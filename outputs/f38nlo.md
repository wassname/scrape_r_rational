## [RST][WIP] The Flower That Bloomed Nowhere, a fantasy story about the pursuit of immortality, love, and the unattainable

### Post:

Hi, r/rational. Some of you might remember me from previous attempt at web fiction, which I posted my two attempts at on this subreddit back in 2017 and 2018 respectively. I ended up abandoning that project (at least, for now) because it wasn't very popular and, frankly, was kind of a huge mess as a result of me having over-written it for a long period of time and being burdened with too many conflicting ideas. Oh, and also because someone stole my laptop with all the files on and I hadn't backed it up properly, but that's neither here nor there.

Anyway, I started different project recently, but felt a little uncertain about posting it here right away because repeatedly getting people to read stuff you're not committed to yet and then ending up ditching it feels like kind of lame behavior. However, I now have about 60k words submitted, so I probably won't end up walking away from it unless it ends up being spectacularly disliked.

This is largely a completely new project, though it shares a couple character concepts and world-building conceits from the first. It's a more traditional fantasy story with a slow, introspective pace that I thought people here might like because the magic system is very mechanical and it focuses heavily on the topics of death and the pursuit of immortality, which seems like a popular idea in ratfic. It's also features (although not super prominently yet, since it's still half in setup) characters using their intellects and an understanding of the magic system to try to solve problems. I also indulge in a very small amount of gamelit-style framing.

It's on royalroad right now. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28806/the-flower-that-bloomed-nowhere Up to 13 chapters. Please let me know what you think if you read any of it; feedback is invaluable, especially on the first chapter if you find yourself unable to get into it.

If anyone is wondering what the title is in reference to, it'll become clear in chapter 15.

  Feedback (written as I read through the first chapter, my impressions entirely subjective):  


  In the synopsis, the phrase 'time loop mystery' is a nice hook, snagging my interest/curiosity and ensuring that I start the text itself.  If anything, I might even recommend that line to go at the start of the synopsis, to snag attention first and then start delivering the premise which then feeds into the context of it being a time loop mystery, rather than the mind going back and reevaluating the premise in the context of the new framing.  


  Starting impression, evidently intentional:  *So bewildered.*  No meaningful hypothesis possible yet, moving on.  


  'aside from window' -> 'aside from the window'  
  'two doors, one on' -> 'two doors, one each on'  
  ' more negotiable concepts then they are' -> ' more negotiable concepts than they are'  
  ' A simple way to put would' -> ' A simple way to put it would'  


  Maybe because I'm thinking closely about what's going on, but I'm finding myself bogged down in the descriptions.  Maybe it can't be helped if there are clues hidden in the room details, but I might prefer more meat (content) and less descriptions-of-the-participants initially, then filling in some details later (maybe one by one, at different times, at times of individual focus?) once we know and care more about these individuals (and become more curious about their characteristics?), spaced/spread out enough that they don't become burdensome.  As it is, I find myself trying to visualise and memorise these appearances with nothing associative to connect them to, rather than filling in or otherwise-updating mental images which have already formed for remembered minds.  


  For the old/new metaphor, just a single detail for each might have been enough, which is also easier to keep in mind as a starting anchor to associate with them.  


  'the fact that the fact' -> 'the fact that', probably.  The comma after 'culture' in that paragraph also feels wrong, though I'm less clear about what could be satisfyingly done about it.  


  Though easier to process now, I'm still getting an impression of the writing being abnormally slanted towards *descriptions*\--here, as though the character is mentally describing the sensations they are feeling, or even making an effort to describe them eloquently to the reader with simile, as though a poet were writing down their memoirs after the fact.  Different, for example, from an impression of watching over an individual's shoulder and actually seeing what they're thinking in the moment.  Hmm, or like a brought-into-custody person thinking back to and recounting everything they felt--with simile--to a police officer in an interrogation room who's writing down everything.  


  Hmm, 'ugly beast' as an example, I feel as though the character is using more thought to have fun with visualising their own fears than they are on the fears themselves.  


  I feel curious about the 'AM(N)', looking forward to when that will become understood.  


  Continuing, a deepening impression of this-is-being-calmly-recited-after-the-fact, leaving me detached from the goings-on.  I'm starting to expect the view to switch, as the person this is being described to says something and we see (even for a moment) what's happening in the present instead.  


  I find myself rather curious about whether the bookmark is in the same place or not...  


  'open it's insipid' -> 'open its insipid'  


  'My mind felt was wracked with uncertainty' -> 'felt' or 'was', not both.  


  The last paragraph is similarly dispassionate.  I've put my finger on another way that this 'fits'--this whole first-person section sounds much more normal to me if I imagine it all in third-person, narrated about the emotional character rather than the character emotionlessly narrating in the first-person past how emotional the character was.  


  Deliberately pausing at the end of the first chapter--besides which, I'm out of time for today--I mainly feel exasperation and some frustration.  There is mystery/questions, but while I was drawn in by curiosity, all I've found is (more) ignorance.  


  For the moment, I have to go.  I hope this feedback offers food for thought!

    Hmm, yeah. I wish your feedback was better, but obviously it's good to get a perspective on how it looks to someone outside-context. I have a tendency to get too tied up in overarching ideas to be able to conceptualize the first impression for a new reader, so I feel like the introductions I write can be tiring and confusing, even if they seem relatively elegant from my position.

    I'll see what I can do?

  I already have it in my read later list haha, I must have come across it while browsing and tagged it instead of reading cause it was too short, I try not to read much that has less than 200-300 pages, for the same reason as you said, starting serving and enjoying it only for it to never really begin is painful.

  I'll give your story a read soon! The only feedback I can give immediately is to wonder if the Anti-hero Lead tag is accurate, it is incredibly overused, being used on any lead character that is perfectly heroic or just mildly amoral, which just isn't what an Anti-hero is in my head.

    Pfft, I actually wasn't totally sure about it either. 

    To be honest, I was a bit indulgent with the tags in wanting to attract readers. A lot of the royalroad tags seem to assume you're writing a very trope-y type of story, and aren't really built for things that stray from that. Like, this story is centered around a college-age class. Should that be school life? Is strategy just fighting battles, or trying to navigate complex situations against opponents...?

    The main character is kind of a byronic hero in that she's a selfish, depressed screw-up with a questionable value system, and a lot of the story is going to ponder the question of if she's legitimately a bad person, but she can also be heroic and kind, too. There's no real tag to represent that, so I guess I just used it to kind of mean "not a conventionally good protagonist".

  Here goes.

  1. Narration: I really like the narrative style.  Both of them, actually.  The introduction is a self-aware pastiche of pretentious narration, and, as such, it only gets better when the narrators call each other out on it.  I'm not sure the style fits in with the rest of the story (the FP-POV sections are a lot more serious than what I'd expect given the introductory tone), but, given the protagonist's compulsion to joke about serious subjects, that may be intentional.  And the first-person narration really sells the character's depression and anxiety.
  2. Format: You almost lost me after Chapter 3.  I'm all for time loops as a narrative device, but there's something almost cruel about introducing us to a POV character and then - this is the impression I got, which reading to the current endpoint has only slightly lessened - killing off that character and rolling back to an earlier version.  It makes the prologue feel inconsequential, and made me feel like I shouldn't get invested into how events affect characters, because they might not end up having happened.  There's a feeling of *deja vu* later at the end of Chapter 6 that makes me feel like the first few chapters *might* not end up being inconsequential, but that's a very short moment.
  3. Characters: I like the characters.  They seem to have decently distinctive voices and personalities from each other.  The only thing that bugs me is that there are a whole lot of them introduced in a fairly short span.  And a trading card's worth of stats doesn't really suffice to help me get to know them enough that I'm not trying to remember who they are when they show up next.  Especially when most of the stats on that card are either incomprehensible at this place in the story (Resistances: AMN) or irrelevant to forming an impression of the character (Blood Type: B-).
  4. Plot: Too early to form a coherent impression.
  5. Themes: I have high hopes for this, based on how you explored a variety of different answers to the "What do you think about immortality?" question.  It looks like you've really thought the question through, which bodes well for how that is going to come through in the conflicts of the plot.
  6. Setting: I like the world-building thus far.  And I agree, in principle, with what you're doing here, to let the details of the world-building show themselves through the characters interacting with the world.  For my personal taste, though, I'm coming across too many moments where it sounds like a term is important, but it's not mentioned after that (for instance: all characters are named "of [something]," which I assume to be a place-name, and given a Party of Origin, which seems to be a culture, as if these are important to understanding them as a character, but it's usually dropped without explaining what Ikkuret is, or why it's important that someone originates from the Mekhian Party).  And, yes, I know it's early for all of that, but the ratio of unexplained novel terms to explained ones is just uncomfortably high for my liking.

  But overall, I enjoyed it, after I got past that hurdle at the start of Chapter 4.

    Thanks for putting the effort in and writing such comprehensive feedback! Lemme try and go over the stuff you seemed critical of point-by-point.

    > Format: You almost lost me after Chapter 3. I'm all for time loops as a narrative device, but there's something almost cruel about introducing us to a POV character and then - this is the impression I got, which reading to the current endpoint has only slightly lessened - killing off that character and rolling back to an earlier version.

There's a feeling of deja vu later at the end of Chapter 6 that makes me feel like the first few chapters might not end up being inconsequential, but that's a very short moment.

    Hmm, it's unfortunate that you went away with that impression. My intention with the first three chapters narratively speaking, alongside the goal of just giving the story a running start and having a platform on which to introduce some basic world-building concepts, is to leave the reader with a question of, "how did we get to this point?" and then to have beats in the story that follows which lead to moments of "_oh,_ now I get it", where it pays off satisfyingly. As well as giving them meat on which to speculate on the mechanics of the time loop itself, since that's part of the hook. I'd hoped the intrigue would be sufficient that it wouldn't come across as pointless for the reader and the beat at the end of Chapter 6 would serve to sufficiently signal that it wasn't meaningless in-universe, either - but I guess not?

    You're the third person to have a distinct complaint about the intro chapters just in this thread, now. It's really starting to make me wonder if their inclusion was a bad idea and I ought to cut them.

    > Characters: I like the characters. They seem to have decently distinctive voices and personalities from each other. The only thing that bugs me is that there are a whole lot of them introduced in a fairly short span.

Especially when most of the stats on that card are either incomprehensible at this place in the story (Resistances: AMN) or irrelevant to forming an impression of the character (Blood Type: B-).

    Introducing the characters in a short span of time is unavoidable for the type of story it is (a closed circle mystery), unfortunately. My only hope has been to try and make it as painless as possible, though if you had specific ideas on how I could do that better, I'm open to suggestions.

    The "trading card" profile sheets are partially an attempt to reach out to the gamelit crowd who likes information presented in a direct way, although you're not the first person to question their inclusion - my hope was that people would see them as fun bits of trivia that would become more relevant later. To tip my hand a bit, I also wanted them to be something that exist in-universe, although that hasn't been brought up yet. They're going to be explained as part of the paperwork that it's mentioned the conclave requires everyone to submit. So the information is specifically the kind of you might give to a resort you're staying at; basic medical information, food tastes and allergies, etc.

    > Setting: I like the world-building thus far.

And, yes, I know it's early for all of that, but the ratio of unexplained novel terms to explained ones is just uncomfortably high for my liking.

    Hmm, this might just have been something I should have explained clearer. The "of <something>" names aren't meant to be super significant to the setting - they're basically just last names in function. You've probably noticed to some extent that the setting has a contrast between ultra ancient, bronze age aesthetics and ultra modern, futuristic ones, and this formatting is meant to evoke that. Last names as we understand them today didn't really come to exist until the Roman era for the vast majority of cultures. I thought a way to reveal this directly would be to have the class director use Utsushikome's functionally as a last name in chapters 8 and 9, but I guess not.

    As for Parties of Origin, they actually refer primarily to ethnicity before culture, (for example, Ptolema has a Greek/Inotian name despite her party not being that) although this is a simplified explanation and it will be discussed more comprehensively in a few chapters from now. I tried to convey some of this with the discussion in Chapter 7, when they talk about how the different parties are groups that migrated together from the old world together and established the original societies, although I guess that must also have been too vague.

    Do you have a suggestion on how either of these could be improved to help people get it sooner?
