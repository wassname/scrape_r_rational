## Justifying superpowers in a hard-ish world.

### Post:

Exactly what it states on the tin.

I've been working on a worldbuilding project on my own - partially inspired by Watchmen, Worm, and other stuff. And I feel like I've hit a brick wall because I realise that I'm not actually sure how to justify my characters having superpowers. 

I've got two groups of characters so far, one group having more munchkin-y superpowers, and those more similar to traditional comic-book superheroes. And I realise that I've no good ideas on how to justify them.

So far, my idea is to have some sort of ... I don't know, a bleed of sorts in between worlds, which happens to be semi-sentient and is attracted to minds. So its found itself attracted to human minds, and has patterned itself off us, and has connected to us somehow based on cultural archetypes of heroes and whatnot. Except I'm not sure if this is a good solution.

Thoughts?

  I like James Nicolls old idea: 

  Super powers can be learned. The techniques were once the province of secret cults, sacred monasteries and so forth, but post enlightenment, and the printing press, all the paths got leaked into the public domain good and hard, and in the modern era, every power anyone ever mastered has its training path laid out in excruciating detail on the internet. 

  However.. every power you want to learn is a major, major effort. We are talking a "A bachelor degree" in terms of hours put in per power.  And how good the version of the power you get is, is also rather like that bachelor degree. Put in superlative effort, and cut no corners, and you can learn to fly so fast that the limit is not killing yourself with wind-chill right through your biking leathers (No required secondary powers. Sorry, those have to be trained separately), half-ass it, and you can fly around at like, 80 kilometres per hour.

  Some powers are, of course, straight up a professional qualification.  If the local law pays well enough, the cops have between one and three powers, a degree in medicine is half learning some useful technique, ect. But anyone can learn, and some powers are just out right popular. Particularly flight.

    Sounds like how wizards are _supposed_ to do it in just about everything. Though it usually ends up just as a bit of fluff instead of showing in the story/game as it's more interesting to throw fireballs around.

  I wouldn't justify them in any depth.

  Consider, for comparison, the question of "why is inertial-mass always proportional to gravitational-mass?" as it exists in our world.

  What happened was that, decades before we were born, some extremely smart scientists worked on the problem.  They pushed the explanation back a few steps ("well, things are made of protons, neutrons and electrons, and those have the following properties...")

  Then, after a few generations of science, all the easy stuff was solved. There are some difficult-to-test potential explanations, but work moves slowly.  And eventually there's some stable mental model that non-scientists use.

  If you lived in the Worm universe, something similar would happen with your understanding of powers.

  Some of the easy stuff would be known ("powers come from this brain structure!") and past that, people would know a vague 'guess the teachers password' style explanation for how the brain structure works.

  But none of your characters are going to be casually pushing the limits of human knowledge, for much the same reason that they're not solving my question about mass.

  So, your onscreen discussion might happen, but it would reach a stopping point once the functional questions are answered

  Do you need the source of superpowers to just be there in the background the whole time, or will it eventually become part of the plot like in Worm?

  That is Worm.

  Why not make them dark matter or string theory extradimensional robots built by ancients which activated by DNA password. Which some humans accidentally got by viral transduction.

    Hmm. I was thinking of it is much more random than Worm is, and more ... I suppose neutral.
