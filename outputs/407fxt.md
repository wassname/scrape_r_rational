## [Q] The Game of Champions (Pokémon fanfic): some explanation?

### Post:

So, after binge-reading /u/DaystarEld 's [The Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) and wanting more, I read [The Game of Champions](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/The-Game-of-Champions)  by L. Lamora, recommended in one of TOoS's headers.

Anyways. I enjoyed both a lot. Here are some thoughts.

- Pokemon seem to have human-level intelligence. At least [SPOILER](#s " Ashford, Trident lead, Ninetales, Shiryuu the dragonite and possibly Pikachu"). They can understand language for sure. Why haven't they taken over the world yet? Guess this is not a rational fic.

- What happened in Chapter 11? [SPOILER](#s " Specifically, NInetales was actually Lady Wakahisa. How come Gary didn't capture her when he tagged her with the old pokeball's light? Why did it take a katana-hit to the illusion, and where was Ninetales that whole time?")

  Speaking of *Game of Champions* here:

  > Pokemon seem to have human-level intelligence. Why haven't they taken over the world yet? 

  They* are incapable of speaking human languages, and their own sign language (?) does not appear as sophisticated. They* do not seem to understand abstract concepts. They* do not appear to have much ambition or capacity for long-term planning. They* started out at a huge technological and organisational disadvantage and do not seem to have the ability to bridge the gap. Add a layer of speciesism and it's understandable that they're not fully integrated into human society.

  And here I'm talking about the few smart species/individuals. The vast majority of pokemons seem to have animal-level intelligence. Pikachu is *maybe* ape-level. I've read dog stories with dogs portrayed as similarly intelligent.

  (*With a few exceptions, and those do leverage those abilities into higher status. Mistermime is more like a butler than a pet. Trident Lead is higher status than a military officer and, to the extent of his communication abilities, can make demands that humans will obey. The Ninetales - who is above human average in every way - managed to, if not conquer the world, at least carve itself a nice slice of the pie.)

  > Guess this is not a rational fic.

  *The Game of Champions* definitely isn't, for unrelated reasons. (tldr: it's almost never a [fair play whodunnit](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit).) It still have elements that appeal to much of the /r/rational audience though.

  > What happened in Chapter 11? 

  [SPOILER](#s "The Ninetales was far too powerful for a pokeball to capture against its will (as in the video games). It could only be bound by the terms of its promise, once Red had returned the sword to a (*real*) member of the Wakahisa clan as per the ritual. I guess the sword to the heart was just a symbolic "game over, I unambiguously have the sword, now hold your end of the bargain." I think "the illusion shattered" refers to the Ninetales's disguise, not that it wasn't really sitting in that chair - at least that's the only way I can make sense of it.")

    Well, for instance the awesome battles. Which, like you said, are not fair play, but damn they are flashy and show off clever tricks.

    >I've read dog stories with dogs portrayed as similarly intelligent.

    Alright. However, psychic types are said to answer questions and be able to communicate, [Chapter 3, paragraph 2 after the intro](#s " when Red talks about  Kadabra and Xatu").

    Maybe Pokémon are on average only as smart as stupid-ish humans, which would indeed erase the organizational take-over-the-world capabilities, while also having a few more intelligent individuals. Pokémon are still _quite_ a problem for humans too.

    Slightly off topic, but linking to the TVTropes article made me imagine how deep into the TVTropes vortex Red from TOS would fall? He would be prattling on for days afterwards about articles like "Dark Types Are Evil" and "No Squirtle, This Is *Dragon* Fire." It would be hilarious.

  My stance on Game of Champions:

  The story is very well written, and the world very well built. It's very internally consistent both with itself and explaining the game canon, and most important characters are (to use EY's terminology) Level One intelligent or above. For these reasons I'd say it's Rational.

  It isn't "Rationalist," for reasons Roxolan pointed out. The story's not a puzzle and it doesn't try to teach cognitive theory.

  Regardless, I highly recommend it to this crowd. I liked it much better than Origin of the Species.

  Well, prompted by this thread I've now binge-read my way through the story so far, and *holy crap* is this ever not the usual tenor of a Pokemon story. Fast, dark, and utterly brutal.

  Had a few moments where the accelerated pace makes the timeline seem a bit unreal, but maybe I've read too quickly, missed the description of time passing, and there are actually more days/weeks that have gone by than I realise. 

  And I suppose my accumulated playtime on Pokemon Gold only really amounts to a couple of weeks, maybe a month tops once you add in time to sleep, and that was enough time to go from zero to world champion, win 16 badges across two regions, almost fill a pokedex, and casually bring down a major criminal organisation in the process.

  As to the questions... 

  [On the topic of pokemon taking over the world - ](#s "It really rather seems like they *have*, except for isolated pockets of remaining human settlement in/around Japan, and even those seem to be under threat if wild pokemon decide they don't like you. It's only by employing the assistance of cooperative pokemon that there's any humans left.")

  No idea about Chapter 11. Didn't really understand the mechanics of the situation, just accepted them as presented then moved on.

  What happened to GoC anyway? Really enjoyed it, and disappointed that it seems to have died off.

    I got the vibe it was always updating sporadically. I saw a single update or two a long while after I discovered it. So, I haven't given up hope.

    As far as I know, the author's still serving in the Air Force. So probably not much time for writing lengthy chapters.

    He's still semi-active on the Dark Lord Potter forums though and hasn't given any indication that the project's abandoned.
