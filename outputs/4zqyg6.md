- u/vakusdrake:
  ```
  Just wish for the coins to always come up heads in the future. If it comes down tails, well it'll always come down tails in the future. If that's the case just wish for the opposite of what you want, hell if you're really lazy just preface all wishes with "I wish for the opposite of x".    
  Anyone who's not a complete idiot should realize that the coin has absolutely no drawbacks if you know which side is going to come up beforehand regardless of which it is.    

  If you can't manipulate the coin like that then just formulate more complex wishes such that they do the same thing regardless of which side comes up. For instance "I wish for a billion dollars, unless tails came up in which case I wish to be a billion dollars in debt."
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Then it always comes up sides, because that's the least likely, due to the fact that's it's possible to train oneself to flip a coin to one side or the other. Congratulations, the coin is now useless.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      But landing on the side is not the least likely. It's less likely to hover, and even less likely to turn into a caterpillar. There is no least likely option.
      ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      > Then it always comes up sides, because that's the least likely

      Can you explain why that's relevant?
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        The most likely option is for that coin to land on heads, because the person using it can train themselves in such a way as to flip to one side consistently (And also because wikipedia says the chance of a coin landing on the same side it starts is .51). So the opposite, the least likely option happens-- sides.

        To be fair, I don't know how the coin would determine "opposites," but there probably isn't a silver bullet for such a coin, or someone would have already munchkined themselves into godhood.
        ```

        - u/vakusdrake:
          ```
          Again this ties into the problems with what counts as opposites. However as stated in the rest of my answer if that method doesn't work it is easy to munchkin to godhood through other means.

          There _isn't_ any good reason that other people wouldn't have munchkined themselves to godhood with the coin already except maybe incompetence.
          ```

- u/vallar57:
  ```
  The big problem with this comes from the definition of "opposite". 

  If it uses stricly logical definition, meaning that the opposite of your wish would be [not][your wish], then you have nothing to worry about. After all, the opposite of a wish "please make it so [a glass of water appears before me]" would be "[a glass of water does not appear before me]"... which is simply [nothing happens]. Nobody said that the coin is creative in it's way of not granting your wishes.

  If it uses more language based system, than it totally depends on how the wishes are compiled. RTFM first, munchkin later.
  ```

- u/ulyssessword:
  ```
  That's extremely easy to munchkin.  You know, after the fact, whether your wish was granted or not, and "opposite" is (probably) a very strong limit on how bad the misfires are.

  "I wish for the winning lottery numbers^1 to be written on this flash drive." *Tails*.  *Smashes flash drive with a hammer*. ..."I wish for the winning lottery numbers to be written on this flash drive." *Tails*.  *Smashes flash drive with a hammer*...."I wish for the winning lottery numbers to be written on this flash drive." *Heads*.

  ^1 Or a cure for cancer, or source code for a Friendly AI, or the weather for the next week, or anything you want.
  ```

  - u/frozenLake123:
    ```
    "I wish for the the source code for a friendly AI to be written on this flash drive."

    The coin flips.
    Tails.
    You look at the coin, before smashing the hard drive.

    Meanwhile, the source code for an AI appears on a hard drive in use, halfway around the world. A teenager looks at the new script that appears, before compiling it.

    "Whats the worst that could happen?"
    ```

    - u/KerbalFactorioLeague:
      ```
      That's not what the wish was though, the wish was for it to appear on *this* hard drive
      ```

      - u/Jiro_T:
        ```
        But you can interpret "the opposite of a friendly AI on this flash drive" to be "a hostile AI on a different flash drive" (or even "a hostile AI on some place that is not this flash drive".

        The entire thing depends on exactly what "opposite" means and whether it has a single meaning or whether the coin gets to choose a meaning so as to screw you over.
        ```

        - u/DCarrier:
          ```
          The opposite of a friendly AI is an unfriendly natural unintelligent entity. Since it's not intelligent, it's not a problem.
          ```

            You've just described a few people I have had the misfortune of doing business with. "Natural" is, I suppose, a compliment I could give them.

  You can add energy to a system this way, "I wish a pound of positive/negatively charged ions to appear inside my machine"

  You could also wish for static effects and just make the same wish over and over until it worked; "I wish she loved me"

  edit// what wishes don't munchkin this?
  ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    > You can add energy to a system this way, "I wish a pound of positive/negatively charged ions to appear inside my machine"

    You are seriously underestimating how much energy you're applying to that system.
    ```

    - u/Strange-Aeons:
      ```
      that... that would be a lot of energy.
      ```

  - u/Jiro_T:
    ```
    You can't wish for static wishes over and over because you don't know how the coin is going to interpret the opposite of the wish, and the coin doesn't have to interpret the opposite of the wish such that a non-reversed wish will fix it.  If the opposite of "she loves me" is "she hates me", then your trick will work.  But if the opposite is "everyone in the world other than her hates everyone else other than me", it won't work.
    ```

    - u/MolochHASME:
      ```
      That is one hell of a chaotic wish.
      ```

- u/EliezerYudkowsky:
  ```
  I wish for the sentence "This coin lands on tails XOR FunThing" to be true.  (Test with minor wishes before trying anything large.)
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Yeah, if the wish is allowed to reference the coin itself, munchkinry is too easy. Though if you were using it in a story, I think "no self-reference" is a reasonable limitation, just like the classic "no wishing for more wishes".
    ```

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  There are many wishes that would have essentially the same result regardless of either heads or tails. Wishing a specific person 100 km directly towards the center of the Earth would kill said person either way for instance.

  Other wishes would be completely harmless to you if the coin lands on tails. Like wishing for a specific valuable item or substance to appear at the exact given coordinates specified in your wish.
  ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Well unless the coin is chooses to interpret the opposite of creating a object, to be creating a antimatter version of that object in which case...
    ```

    - u/Jiro_T:
      ```
      Or as "everyone except that person is moved 100 km towards the center of the Earth".
      ```

      - u/ZeroNihilist:
        ```
        That's not really the opposite though. Colloquially, the opposite of "A is moved by X" is "A is moved by â€“X". Formally, the opposite is "A is not moved by X".

        There's no meaning of "opposite" that would lead to "All P such that P is not A are moved by X". Why would it operate on a complementary domain and, further, why would it use "the set of all people" as the superset rather than "the set of all things"?
        ```

- u/UltraRedSpectrum:
  ```
  I suppose it would depend on how much of a monkey's uncle the coin is. For example, say you want to be more intelligent. Obviously that's dangerous to wish for directly, so you wish for a Fountain of Cleverness. The coin comes up tails. Supposing I'm the genie of the coin, there are a few different opposites I can use here.

  1: A fountain is created in the desired location. Anyone drinking from the fountain becomes a complete moron.

  2: A fountain is created in the desired location. Anyone who doesn't drink from the fountain is imbued with cleverness.

  3: A reverse-fountain is created in the desired location. Everywhere except the inside of the fountain is flooded with the Elixir of Cleverness, and everybody drowns.

  4: A fountain is created on Pluto. Anyone who drinks from the fountain becomes a superintelligent paperclip maximizer and destroys the universe.

  And so on.
  ```

  - u/KerbalFactorioLeague:
    ```
    Eh, 3 is just adding things onto the wish. If that could happen then no matter what the coin landed on the result could be "X, and also the sun explodes, killing everyone"
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      I disagree. "Everywhere except the inside of the fountain is flooded" is not a random extra, it's a valid interpretation (one of many) of "the opposite of a fountain".
      ```

  "I wish for this coin to land on tails."
  ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    That's not munchkining that's just trying to create a logical paradox. Given how presumably powerful the coin is I wouldn't recommend doing something like that if you don't want to destroy the universe or something.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      It would just land on heads, rebound and then land on tails before you can wish for something new. Or the other way around.
      ```

  Be very, very careful what you wish for.  

  "I wish for a 1 kg block of gold to appear on my desk."

  *Tails*

  A 1 kg block of anti-gold appears.  The antimatter immediately reacts with the atmosphere and the desk, releasing 9 x 10^16 joules of energy (~20 megatons, or 1000 Hiroshima-equivalents).
  ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    This possibility did occur to me, and unfortunately it might make it to risky to create any material right away, one way to test it would be to create stuff on mars and see if there's anything about a bizarre martian explosion on the news later.
    ```

    - u/Jiro_T:
      ```
      It could reverse the wish by creating something everywhere except Mars.

  Plenty of ways to make money. 

  Put a straddle on a stock (purchase an option to sell it and an option to buy it), then "I wish for this stock to go up by 30% today." (You can make there be a large change, even if you can't control its direction.)

  Bet on Leicester City at 5000-1 odds, then "I wish for Leicester City to win the Premier League this year." Or, buy a Powerball ticket and then "I wish for tomorrow's winning Powerball numbers to be 26, 6, 10, 65, 33, with a Powerball of 8." (You can make anything a 50-50 proposition.)

  Or, "I wish for the Royals to beat the Red Sox in tonight's baseball game," then flip, then place your bet on either the Royals or the Red Sox. (You know what will happen in advance.)

  "I wish for Jack to accept the bet that I'm about to offer him." "Hey Jack, I just flipped this coin and didn't look at it. I bet you $100 that it landed heads." (You can cause the coin state to be correlated with other features of the world.)

      That's not the opposite! "A not-researcher not-at not-Harvard not-finds the not-cure for not-cancer" - that's a sextuple negative!

      ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    I think a more consistent opposite (how is yale the _opposite_ of harvard?) would be to have someone at harvard develop a disease the gives everyone cancer.    
    Or maybe it somehow sabotages any potential for there to be a cure for cancer in the future.
