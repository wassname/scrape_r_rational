## [Challenge Companion] 20 Minutes in the Future

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the weekly challenge, post ideas, thoughts, recs, etc. below.**

[20 Minutes in the Future (TVTropes)](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture) is somewhat subjective. The test mentioned in that link is whether the vast majority of people alive when the work is written will still be around when the date the work is set in comes around. That brings up a few inter-related defining features; the people in the story will mostly overlap with us, the technologies will probably be on the horizon right now, and values probably won't have changed all that much.

Charles Stross says that good predictions of the near future are roughly 90% stuff that's exactly the same (i.e. in 2027 we will expect the majority of cars on the road to have been built in 2017 or earlier), 9% stuff that's easily predictable using existing roadmaps (i.e. storage space or transistors per dollar), and 1% black swans (i.e. the abrupt end of the Cold War, the 9/11 terrorist attack, the 2008 financial crisis). I think that's a pretty reasonable way of looking at things.

I think if you want to write a short story for this challenge, you're probably better off going with something that's currently on the roadmap, but if you want to write about a "black swan" sometime in the next 10-20 years, knock yourself out.
