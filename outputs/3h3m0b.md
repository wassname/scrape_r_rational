  The first season was pretty good, though I would not say that there was any munchkinism, since we are not actually shown the rules of this world. The second one went downhill really hard really fast.

    Koon was the munchkin to me. The bag... Not to mention the stuff he does later. I'm not sure if it is translated yet in the current version since they are still busy hacking the full pages into tiny boxes with unnecessary white space.

  I read everything available a few years back, and have been thinking of reading all the new stuff.

  It's really, *really* good. The world is huge, the story is long, and it keeps getting longer. I wouldn't say it's very munchkiny, but it's certainly full of intelligent (and dickish) characters. Everyone has motives, too. None of that evil for evil's sake. It's a great read. It will also grate on you in a few years when you remember how good it was but don't want to dedicate a week to rereading but you don't even remember where you left it last time.

    Yeah I'm at that point too. Plus the new version cut out a bunch of the artwork I liked. 

    I thought Koon was a total munchkin. (Remember the bag and what he does during the contest with two teams?)
