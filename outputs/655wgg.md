## Rationalist fiction displaying use of Bayes Theorem

### Post:

TL;DR: A university professor who does research on application of Bayes Theorem wants rationalist fiction recommendations. 

I was talking to my instructor for statistics and probability theory. We were talking about how statistical and probabilistic literacy would be much more useful for most people than calculus. I mentioned updating your beliefs using Bayes Theorem. He was surprised I even knew such things and asked where I learned about it. I gave a very brief description of rationalist fiction. He was really interested given his focus of research is in application of Bayes Theorem. I told him that I'd email him a more detailed explanation with recommended reading. 

This is the second instructor from the math department whose ears perked up at the idea of rational and rationalist fiction. If you want to get some rational fiction buddies, math departments are a good place to start.

  *Conned Again, Watson* was summarized in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5w27a3/eduffrst_conned_again_watson_in_which_sherlock/) (though no discussion ensued...). Bayes's Theorem is used explicitly, in a visualized and easily-understandable [format](http://i.imgur.com/S4JSIIk.jpg), several times.

  If you want rationalist fiction where the protagonist actually *uses* bayes theorem regularly, then I think you're out of luck. HPMOR is the only one I know which actually uses the phrase with some regularity, and if Harry Potter actually used the formula more often basically the entire plot could be avoided.

    Well that, and trusted more experienced people more often when setting his priors.

  There is not, so it is our solemn and joyful duty to write these fictions, so that the world might be a brighter place!

  I can't offer any ficton, but there are three games I know of that help with Bayes Theorem or Confidence Calibration:

  * [The Raccoon Princess and the Fox Prince: A Bayesian Parable](http://cassandraxia.com/projs/raccoon/)

  * [Adventures in Cognitive Biases](http://cassandraxia.com/projs/advbiases/)

  * [The Credence Calibration Game, by CFAR](http://acritch.com/credence-game/)

  I seem to recall datapacrat having a fic with heavy usage of bayes theorem. I'm having a bit of trouble navigating his website, but I remember it was about an SI being revived from cryostasis into a female bunny body, and then exploring the exceptionally weird world that the singularity (and subsequent apocalypse) caused.

  Can I have some help finding it /u/datapacrat?

  edit: it's the one you were posting on SB that eventually got removed by the mods.

    The link you gave leads to the version hosted on SpaceBattles and was shut down by the mods with only 6 of the books. [Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZcUba_GKVCm_i2VeGrfSBBxC8pR6VZC5VBBUVKKxYk/edit) the version hosted on Google Docs, which has 10 books written so far. The stuff on Bayes you are thinking about appears in the second book (or the book #1) as a lesson to a young child.

    Right now, he's not working on it, but I am confident that DataPacRat will return after he's finished working on the other story [Extracted](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit) and [FAQ on LoadBear's Instrument of Precommitment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRSRWbAqtC48rPv5NG6kzggL3HXSJ1O93jFn3fgu0Rs/edit).

      Nah, that one is too short. I'm thinking of the massive work he was posting on spacebattles before it got removed by the mods for frankly understandable reasons.

  We mathematicians, of course, are quite often unknowing members of the Bayesian Conspiracy :)

  Seems like linking this website here would be relevant:

  > [Mathematical Fiction](http://kasmana.people.cofc.edu/MATHFICT/browse.php) 

  >> Of the many works of fiction that are published, very few involve mathematics or mathematicians. However, people who like mathematics (or are mathematicians ourselves) may especially enjoy reading those few that do. [..] mathematicians should be interested in these works of "mathematical fiction" even if we do not enjoy them because they both affect and reflect the non-mathematician's view of this subject.

  >> Therefore, the list at this site is collected both for your pleasure and professional interest. If you happen to know of any other examples, please let me know. [..]
  > 
  >> Notes: Since it is not especially significant to the purposes of this list, I am not differentiating between fiction which refers to actual mathematics and literature in which the mathematics itself is fictional. [..]

  [Found ](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/s-i-original-si.301894/) the story I was talking about.

  fair warning-- there is some really, really weird transhumanism involved, and I don't think it's ever getting finished.
