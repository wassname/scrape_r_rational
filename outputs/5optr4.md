## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Story Prompt: If there is a world with a finite and fixed number of souls constantly reincarnating, what do you think happens when the human population exceeds the amount of souls? As a corollary question, what roles do souls play? The more unusual and creative the answers, the better!
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    It turns out that the less time you spend in the afterlife between reincarnations, the more you remember of your previous life. If you spend less than a minute, you remember everything.

    When the afterlife is nearly empty, anyone who dies comes back practically instantly. After a few years of childhood, they can pick up their lives where they left off. This is a very useful state of affairs, particularly if you were rich or skilled or just don't want to forget who you are. Or if you want to get rid of an incurable disease of injury. So people start committing suicide to skip to their next reincarnation.

    But of course, if too many people die at once then they could be stuck in the afterlife for a while and lose track of themselves. And if the afterlife goes completely empty and someone is born without an existing soul, that's a missed opportunity. So people who are dying wait for the perfect moment, watching something very like a stock market ticker, trying to kill themselves when the number of souls in limbo is as close to zero as possible.

    One thought is the Orson Scott Card route, where a single soul could end up controlling multiple bodies.

    The souls start looping back in time to incarnate into different people at the same time.  By "remembering" your past lives, you can gain limited precognition by remembering the life of someone that exists in the present.

    Souls evolved as a calorie saving mechanism to let people remember complex concepts without as much caloric exertion by the neurons involved..  The people that don't get souls tend to get low blood sugar from thinking too hard.  Otherwise, their isn't much of a difference.
    ```

  - u/Afforess:
    ```
    If we play off the idea that souls are the *spark of the divine*, then the soul-less people born might end up a second-class tier of citizens, barely above animals. Animals don't have souls, and are otherwise okay, but soul-less humans might be recognizable by their lack of reverence for religion/god, less curiosity, and a more drab external appearance.

    Soulless humans would likely end up as a servant/slave caste. A story told from their perspective, rage against heaven plot, etc might be interesting.

    The soul interacts with the body during development. Without a soul, the fetus grows into a great ape somewhat similar in appearance to the bonobo.

    The first humans without souls turn to alchemy, terrified of oblivion. Even more terrifying, they succeed. i.e. souls sabotage attempts at eternal life to stay in circulation.

  Kung Fu Battle Wizard setting:

  Humans aren't the top of the foodchain. Rather, humanity is forced to huddle in heavily fortified settlements while are surrounded on all sides by all manners of scary chakra beasts.

  Kung Fu Battle Wizards in this setting are heavily movement and parkour focused, their effort is focused on outrunning and outsmarting monsters.

  There are three classes of KBW in this setting:

  Scouts - Free ranging explorers. They look for opportunities and dangers. This may be looking for resources, or looking for creatures which may endanger supply lines.

  Runners - Couriers who runs on known fixed routes. They carry packages in pocket dimensions and are the crucial supply lines between settlements. 

  Heavy combat - Their job is to defend settlements, resource extraction locations, outposts, convoy, and VIPs.

  I haven't decided that it'll be a post-apocalyptic setting, but ideally, the environment will be very 3D with terrains that doesn't have lot of flat geometry.
  ```

  - u/SometimesATroll:
    ```
    A jungle environment would be great if you don't want to go with post-apocalyptic.  There's no reason the "trees" have to be like ours, either.

    Something like a forest of giant tangled mangroves would be pretty 3D.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I was thinking a somewhat jagged landscape, with lot of caves and cavernous areas, exacerbated by extremely tall and wide tree with huge roots and branches.

      Not necessarily a jungle environment, but probably one that wouldn't exist on our Earth.

  I made a series of CYOAs [Rings of Power](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5o21uv/ring_of_power_cyoa_v2_the_return_of_magic_oc/), [Traveler's Artifacts](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5o22fg/travelers_artifacts_cyoa_return_of_magic_setting/),  [Random Hypnosis Superpowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5og8ga/random_hypnosis_super_powers_cyoa_return_of_magic/) and [Spilt Bag of Holding](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5ogbpb/spilt_bag_of_holding_cyoa_return_of_magic_oc/)

  The overall premise is that "magic"  is returning to the world after being completely gone for centuries and only at trace levels for over a millennia.  Seeking to leverage this, a mysterious entities (I have some plans about this entity although they are spoilers) gifts out various artifacts, which in turn spread super powers and abilities, setting up the introductions to the first 4 CYOAs and also setting off the conditions for several of the first missions CYOA (which I plan on posting tonight).

  Some questions I am still pondering:

  * How would various super powered/magically gifted nigh-immortal people in a prehistorical era react to their power gradually fading.  How would they try to preserve their power?  What would they try to leave behind? (Right now I assumed they sealed themselves off in alternate pocket realities were their power functions properly and that many of them are the bases of various mythological races)

  * Same questions, for random, rare people from ancient civillizations, although they aren't quite as immortal and they are rare enough that they likely never meet another empowered person in their lifetime.

  * In the rare cases in ancient times where enough empowered people meet up and can form small societies, how might different cultures meet and blend?  (A common ability magic often allows is rapid communicate via astral travel and with creativity their are a lot of ways to travel quickly using magic, so I assume magic users from all over the world meet if they were motivated)

  * How quickly could governments get laws/rules/regulations in place in response to super powers?  How would the initial court ruling influence precedent.

  * Right now I am assuming various people initially attempt to play at superhero only for the limits of their powers to cause various problems with this.  To give an example I replied to someone with.

  > To be Batman in real-life... you would be need to be able to find criminals (super-detective powers/skills) and/or find crimes in progress (clairvoyant super powers) and be able to fight criminals non-lethally (some type of martial arts ability or nonlethal take-down powers) while surviving bullets (bullet proof and/or bullet dodging powers) and whatever else criminals cooked up (flame proof/acid proof/choking proof/bomb proof powers) while also avoiding the police (stealth powers). So depending on your motivations (note the options I gave to heroes) and lucky choices, you might be able to get a decent fraction of that, but you would still need a lot of skill and/or resources to play at being Batman and it would probably be more practical to make anonymous tips to the police a good portion of the time (intervening only if they are slow to show up).

  Can anyone think of any exceptions to this where a superhero "scene" might actually get established or where lone individuals might actually manage to keep the "super-hero" role going successfully?

  * How quickly can law-enforcement/military adjust to super powers?  Either incorporating uses for them and/or learning to counter them?

    Some might have chosen to wait events out (suspended animation). Others might have searched for alternate power sources... Can lifeforce/electricity/souls/etc be converted to units of magic? How bad is the exchange ratio? Maybe that's why Aztecs/Mayans/Death Cultists/etc favoured so many blood sacrifices? 

    >Same questions, for random, rare people from ancient civillizations, although they aren't quite as immortal and they are rare enough that they likely never meet another empowered person in their lifetime.

    Likely the loss of magic would have turned into legends. Non-immortal magic users or commoners from the magical era would have little choice but to suffer through the events. However, historical hindsight would twist the tales.

    >How quickly could governments get laws/rules/regulations in place in response to super powers? How would the initial court ruling influence precedent.

    It seems that unless magic was extremely common (anyone can do it) that governments would end up being ruled by magic-users, who would create a 2-tier caste and judicial system, one for magic users (the elites) and one for everyone else. If you have magic super-powers, *you* individually might try be the good guy, but it would only take 1 nefarious magic-user to topple a commoner-led government. Alternatively, if magic is commonplace, elite strike forces would exist (see: Aurors in HPMOR) to assail wrongdoers.

    >Can anyone think of any exceptions to this where a superhero "scene" might actually get established or where lone individuals might actually manage to keep the "super-hero" role going successfully?

    I think super-hero's powered by magic seem unlikely... It's just a poor use of their time. They would have to have no better alternative uses of their time. Superhero's are a creation of the events and forces around them, often pressed into service or created by some design, they don't arise naturally. However, in this unlikely event, the most sustainable super-hero's would probably try to architect a religion/personality-cult around themselves. This gives them a support network, while discouraging anyone from joining them.

      Got a mission planned around this idea already.

      > Can lifeforce/electricity/souls/etc be converted to units of magic? How bad is the exchange ratio? Maybe that's why Aztecs/Mayans/Death Cultists/etc favoured so many blood sacrifices? 

      And you have given me another idea for a mission.

      > unless magic was extremely common 

      I am leaning towards this direction, but less magic and more minor random powers unique to personality and formative life events.

      > elite strike forces would exist (see: Aurors in HPMOR) to assail wrongdoers.

      This is one of the few roles I see "superhero" teams, the superhero part a fig leaf covering for the fact that often the teams are employed against target with kill orders.

      > However, in this unlikely event, the most sustainable super-hero's would probably try to architect a religion/personality-cult around themselves

      I like this idea, I'll probably steal it as well.

    This. Atlantis, Avalon, Shangri-la, just start going down the list of fantastic lost mythological places.
