## Rational fiction and animal cognition?

### Post:

Just curious as this is a trend I noted. In a lot of rational fic, little thought is given to animals as potentially sentient agents, or targets of ethical reasoning. I don't mean seeing animals as taking priority over humans, of course, but just being object of *any* ethical concern. In HPMOR, Harry briefly fears that animals might be sentient, after he learns about parselmouths, but then he just reassures himself when he understands that's not how parselmouth works and stops worrying. A more blatant example is found in Luminosity and its sequel Radiance, where the "vegetarian" vampires have to feast on animals, but the question of *which* animals is never considered. Bella regularly eats killer whales, which not only looks ethically questionable since these are some of the smartest animals on the planet after us, it even looks like it could be potentially a severe hit to the viability of the species' population, since killer whales are few already and it's not like they're *supposed* to have predators in nature. Sure, it's better than eating humans, but she goes from being absolutely horrified about that to being perfectly fine with regularly eating an animal that probably has an intelligence comparable to that of a small human child.

The way I see it, the idea of a sharp cut between animal and men is a relic of religious thinking, with humans having souls and thus being very very special compared to everything else. If one is a materialist, the most sensible assumption seems that with intelligence and sentience there's probably somewhat of a continuum, and that animals, while not being as much of a concern as humans, should still be more of a concern than, say, trees or rocks. Do you know of any stories that address this? What's your idea about why this topic seems to be never touched? Is it narrative convenience (too many constraints make stories even harder to write) or more of a matter of belief?

  What genres of fiction are you **not** seeing this trend? It's curious to me that you'd call Rational Fiction out specifically for its insensitivity to non-human suffering while you cite examples like HPMOR where there IS such consideration (even if you consider the amount insufficient), and where the latest chapter of [The Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/57/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) is still on the front page and well upvoted.

  My instinct is this problem exists across **most** fiction not specific to pursuit of the cause of animal rights, and that Rational Fiction is doing better on average to notice the problem.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

    Well, in this case I think it sticks out because in rational fiction on average there's a big focus on problems of sentience, ethics, and respect of life.

    If a Christian author writes a novel where humans see killing other humans as horrible but killing animals as normal, they're not contradicting their own world view. In that world view, the sanctity of human life is a product of humans being made in the image of God, aka having a soul. God himself gave man lordship over all other creatures of Earth. Therefore, it's perfectly normal that killing other humans is a bad thing but killing animals is not.

    In rational fiction though usually the world view is strictly materialistic. So that reasoning doesn't hold. Yet a lot of it is also humanistic, putting humans front and centre, and their well-being as the supreme value to pursue, even at the expense of animal lives. While Harry's musings about sentient plants are a bit unhinged, he still could decide to become a vegetarian, just to stay on the safe side. He only considers the option when he thinks parselmouths can give sentience to snakes; but once he thinks that's not a thing, he happily goes back to eating meat. He doesn't stop wondering about whether animals could have sentience *without* magical interventions; he gives it for granted. In other words, sentience is seen as an on/off switch, something that you either have (humans) or don't (animals) instead of a continuum. This is a view pretty common in rationalist fiction (and in a lot of science fiction in general, especially of the old type, the kind Rational!Harry in fact read during his formative years).

    i think the issue is that rational fiction *should* be doing even better than it is doing.

    plenty of fables and light fantasy with talking animals do a lot for thinking about animals as intelligent creatures.

    Oh, good one! Reminds me of some discussions I had with a friend who was arguing that, if you took the principles of veganism to their logical extreme, you'd have to forcefully mod the biosphere, remove the mechanisms of predation and make lions vegetarians too. Or alternatively, if life turned out to be inextricably tied to suffering and inflicting violence on other life, that perhaps the only truly ethical option would be mass extinction.

    The way I see it, that kind of arguments only show how completely ridiculous your ethical assumptions were to begin with. Can't have more utility when there's no subjects left to experience the utility any more.

    Something I found interesting about that story is that the plot is set in motion by the protagonists needing convincing animal actors in a film-equivalent, but even in the current year deepfakes exist and are convincing, and it doesn't cost much to set them up. Surely the far future would have even more sophisticated ways of faking video for free. It comes across as a bit of an anachronism, like when spaceships in old scifi have big hulking switches to throw or buttons to press.

      Film is art, and part of the form of art is the substrate you're using to create it with. That's why we have things like CG film, hand drawn animation, puppet stop motion, and live action. In their time period, even though CGI could probably be indistinguishable from real life, they probably want to make an artistic statement by imaging real objects. It kind of fits with the 'documentary about the past' kind of thing.

  Pokemon - the origin of species pretty heavily explores the idea of meat eating and general ethics of it all *despite* severely nerfing pokemon intelligence from the canonical levels down to real world non-human animal levels so I think it counts.

  Animorphs (the original, not the fan-fiction popular on /r/rational) explores this quite a bit. The protagonists are repeatedly faced with discomfort when morphing into cetaceans and primates because they feel a sense of a consciousness which is apart from theirs and aware of being possessed, looking back at them.

  Of course the original animorphs isn't commonly considered rational fiction, but it can never be said that the series did not deeply explore the full implications of its premises.

- u/Amonwilde:
  ```
  I think you've actually hit on a blind spot in rational fiction and rational ideologies, which tend to be heavily, and sometimes explicitly, partisan to humans and human experience. I think the only reason we can't see animal experience as legitimate and worthy of respect is that we treat one another so badly that we can't even get around to it. In a world where human beings treated one another well treating animals well would start to seem like a no-brainer.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    That is my impression too, yes. Though I don't think that kind of reasoning fully works - after all, if we started creating hierarchies of problems and only ever address the most pressing one, we would do that for humans and only care about, say, world hunger, and not war or cancer or whatever. Different people have different affinities too so obviously everyone will have their focus on different problems; there's nothing wrong about giving your all to a relatively minor problem, like, say, volunteering at a stray cat refuge, as long as humanity as a whole divides its resources in an approximately proportionate way.

    I think this was *hinted* in "Significant Digits" as Hermione is mentioned to be vegetarian. But the motivations for that are only left implied, never stated, and she never tries to convince anyone else to make a similar choice. It just seems into character that she might be the type to be empathetic enough to start worrying about the well-being of animals beyond that of humans too.
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:

      I agree. Probably one reason I'm not a vegetarian, another reason being that I'm selfish and society doesn't punish me for being selfish along the vector of eating other conscious beings.

  In the early stages of Luminosity, there aren't enough vampires for population depletion to be a real concern, and the very real challenge of not eating humans occupies Bella's attention once she's turned.

  If you continue to the end of Radiance, where she's making longer-term plans, Bella actually does consider the impact of vampire diet on the world. She wants to make synthetic blood, breed fractional vampires that can survive on a wider variety of foods, and make use of all the blood currently being thrown away by the existing butchery industry. You can see some of this happening in Flashes.

    Killer whales are top predators - they number in the thousands and reproduce slowly. Even just one vampire nibbling on one every two or three days would be enough to put a significant dent in their population numbers. They're just not meant to be hunted at all, they're not like rabbits or mice whose main strategy is to just Zerg rush the biosphere.

    And besides that, I'd still feel bad about killing even one single killer whale because they're way too smart for me to do something like that comfortably. We're talking human child level intelligence, probably. I'd find it really hard to believe they don't have subjective experience like we do.

  It's called rationalizing.

  The authors don't want to stop eating meat and still feel like a decent human being, so they just say animals are not whatever*

  /* word with no clear definition or stuff that doesn't matter for the ethics.

  RHarry was in the same chapter more horrified that [grass could be sentient](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/02/1b/17/021b171c0ba9c1a3a126750019d80a30--veganism-animal-rights.jpg). Even without evidence that they could be, except that he could talk with snakes. Well, he got a head injury as a baby... 

  I mean I looked for (ethical) reason to not go vegan, and didn't find any. Even the practical reasons against veganism (money, availability or cultural stuff) weren't really any concern. Heck, I can live cheaper and healthier on a vegan diet. (But I don't cause I'm lazy and like to eat cookies)

  btw eating whales would be ethical better than eating chicken. (Cause you kill one individual for a ton of meat versus one individual for a kilo of meat.) A species going extinct is not a tragic thing in itself. Well, in most cases it is tragic, because the individuals starve to death or die in another horrible way, but if all humans choose to stop getting kids, that would be ethical okay with me.

  Anyhow, either the authors want to eat meat and still think good of themselves or fears the reader will think it is vegan propaganda. And vegans should not decide over someone else's live... but meat eater can decide over animal lives, cause... Don't be judgy, bad vegan!

    > Heck, I can live cheaper and healthier on a vegan diet.

    Nitpick warning: *Maybe* cheaper, but certainly not healthier. At least not *necessarily* so, since you mentioned cookies as your alternative to vegan meals instead of steaks, omelettes, and yoghurts.

    I've studied nutrition science and specialized diets a lot and have personally tested both paleo and vegan diets. From research, I can say with strong confidence that a balanced diet that includes meat, fish, and eggs is superior to a balanced diet that does not. Even achieving the latter is difficult enough to constitute a non-trivial cost in time, effort, and stress that can't be ignored in the decision process.

    And from personal experience, I can say that veganism causes people to make very questionable food choices in order to hit their daily caloric energy needs. Most vegans (and a lot of vegetarians) end up with: 

    * a way higher intake of nutrition-lacking (and sometimes nutrition-leaching) grains than is healthy
    * huge amounts of polyunsaturated fats (n-6 primarily) that are the main contributing factors to heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation
    * and a lacking and/or incomplete amino acid profile

    So at a certain point, there is indeed a tradeoff between personal health concerns (not just dietary enjoyment) and ethical concerns related to the meat/egg/milk industries. While I don't think it's right to just ignore it because of taste/enjoyment concerns, I think that most people who eat a "healthy" diet that includes those things rather than a standard vegan diet are at the very least *inadvertently* making a justifiable decision.

    For me personally, I decided that the costs (negative health impact + time + effort + stress) are more significant than the ethical concerns. That said, if I could switch to lab-grown meats for example with the only difference being a 2-3x cost increase, I would do it. But not for a 5x+ cost increase. 

    As long as people think the issue through and establish their own value balance (or make a justified and informed decision to follow the advice of someone who knows enough to do so), I'd say there isn't much of a problem with ignoring it from that point onward.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      >  Maybe cheaper, but certainly not healthier.

      Okay my own fault, for using a word like healthy...

      Healthy eating is for me getting enough calories, with the right mix of macro nutritions (protein, fat, carbohydrates) and having all your Vitamins and stuff (I take Vit B12 pills, cause cheaper than buying soymilk with it added. And Vit D, cause 90% of the whole population don't get enough. And sometimes I eat a Multivitamin for vegans, cause effervescent tablets(?) are funny to put on your tongue)

      Anyhow, I didn't want to claim I eat healthy now. That's why I mentioned the cookies. But I claim *I* can live healthier on a vegan diet and I did. I still eat healthier than I did before I went vegan.

      > For me personally, I decided that the costs (negative health impact + time + effort + stress) are more significant than the ethical concerns.

      Wasn't the point here. As long as you know you are doing something unethical, my point (they say animals are not sentient, cause they want to feel ethical okay) doesn't matter to you.

      But since you mentioned a strawmen vegan diet, can you give me sources for the negative health impact. Like for incomplete amino acid profile (how do you know the profile of most vegans from personal experience? Or any study?), why do vegans have less heart dieseases when they eat "huge amounts of polyunsaturated fats " [Too lazy to find a study: "Many studies have shown that vegetarians seem to have a lower risk of obesity, coronary heart disease (which causes heart attack), high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and some forms of cancer."](https://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Vegetarian-Diets_UCM_306032_Article.jsp?appName=MobileApp)

      I mean honestly, are you comparing a unhealthy vegan diet to a healthy omnivore diet? I mean there is clearly some bias behind that argument. How about comparing the diet of vegans and omnivores (=nice word for meat eater)? Or the diet you would have as a vegan and you have as an omnivore. Seems more fair.

      Also maybe you only see vegans eat, when they are at (non-vegan) restaurants and don't have many choices. The question would be how often they eat there.

      And I can tell you from personal experience, that the time and effort were way less than I expected. (And I have no clue what you mean with stress.) The negative health impact is new to me, would be interested in a source.

        First of all, as a disclaimer, only about half of my comment was really aimed at you specifically; I kinda just started ranting on the general topic once I got started.

        Semi-related: If you're taking vitamin D because everyone's deficient (I do too btw) I recommend adding magnesium (any kind other than oxide) for the exact same reason. I take 400mg of before bed every night and it's an actual *noticeable* difference which is rare for vitamin/mineral supplements.

        > As long as you know you are doing something unethical

        Right. Just to clarify my point a bit though, I think it's a spectrum of *how bad* it is ethically and what the tradeoff is. I'd feel way more guilty eating dolphins or killer whales than I would for cows, and I feel more guilty eating cows than chickens, and chickens > plants. I can accept the ethical issues for the reasons I already stated, but if circumstances were to change (cows found to be as smart as dolphins!?), I would naturally have to change my actions too. I agree that I think some people use sentience as a binary operator, and while sentience is definitely a VERY important threshold, it's not the *only* one.

        > can you give me sources for the negative health impact. Like for incomplete amino acid profile

        No sources right now, but this just stems from the fact that animal protein is always a "complete" protein (all the EAAs in most suitable proportion for digestion and use) whereas plant protein is often "incomplete". The classic example is that rice+beans together provides the complete EAA spectrum if you eat them in an exact proportion. Given that a person just eats "anything that fits the diet" (even if they're counting macronutrients), they likely will be getting insufficient amounts of certain EAAs. Like you may be eating 40g protein in a day, but if (made-up numbers incoming) 1/8 of that would have been a certain EAA if you'd eaten "complete" animal protein, you might only be getting 1/3 the amount of that EAA in actuality. That's what I meant. I don't know actual studies on how this affects vegans in real life, but there are definitely studies out there that analyze the effect of being deficient in certain EAAs. The reason they're "essential" is because your body can't make them from other amino acids.

        > are you comparing a unhealthy vegan diet to a healthy omnivore diet?

        Haha, good point. I think I actually was doing that a bit subconsciously, because most people on specialty diets don't really care much what they eat as long as it fits the specialty diet (and for those who do slightly better, as long as it fits the specialty diet + macronutrient ratios). (People on fad diets especially have this problem). The main point I was getting at is that an omnivore diet will naturally avoid some problems that can crop up with special restrictive diets like the EAA issue.

        > why do vegans have less heart dieseases when they eat "huge amounts of polyunsaturated fats"

        That's compared to the average person, and the average person is unhealthy. If I had to guess, I'd say *anyone* on a specialty diet (unless it's a really stupid one) will likely have improved health markers over the average person. So I don't think this fact can be used to prove that "huge amounts of PUFAs" is not a problem. There are lots of studies that show that it *is* in fact a problem. Now, that's not to say omnivores are immune to this problem—not by any means. It's a huge problem universally in the West. 

        More about PUFAs

        When I was testing vegan diets, I noticed it was difficult to eat enough fat to hit my macronutrient goals without also overdosing on PUFAs. Unfortunately, there are almost no plant sources of saturated fats (which are *not* bad for you and are your body's preferred source of fat for fuel purposes). The only options are coconut and palm oil. Aside from that, sources of monounsaturated fats without also having lots of PUFAs are limited to macadamia (almost pure mono) and olive oils (still about 10% PUFA). Canola is 20% PUFA which is too much. Vegans (and even paleo, regular vegetarians, and omnivores even) who eat salads with lots of salad dressings, especially those who use things like sesame oil (IIRC, ~40% PUFA) will end up getting too much which leads to heart disease, metabolic syndrome, high LDL/VLDL, etc, etc. It's just *more* of a problem for vegans because they don't have convenient sources of non-problematic fats like omnivores do.

        There are other problems that can crop up in highly-restrictive diets (including but not limited to vegan) but that are smaller problems with omnivorous diets since they're drowned out in the larger variety of food eaten. A big example is Phytic Acid from legumes and nuts which binds certain essential nutrients in your body and carries them out of the body through excretion. This means that just adding up the amount of nutrients your'e supposedly getting from the Nutrition Facts (like iron for example) doesn't actually represent how much your body actually has available to absorb, since a good amount of it can be tied up in Phytates. Omnivores may eat nuts or legumes, but much less often do they constitute a large enough part of their diet for this factor to make a big difference. Whereas paleo and vegans who both tend to go heavier on nuts and/or legumes are more susceptible to this.

        I think the bottom line point I was trying to make is that if you're really trying to eat "healthy", it's just overall easier to do with a generic "healthy" omnivorous diet than with specialty diets given an equal amount of time and effort you're willing to spend. From all my research and experience, my personal opinion is that if you are fully committed to micromanaging all of the little details like the ones I've mentioned, a Paleo diet is actually the healthiest. (It's certainly the one I felt the best on.) Of course, a *well-micromanaged* Vegan diet can be *way* healthier than a generic "healthy" omnivorous diet, but it does take quite a bit more work to avoid the issues introduced by having to work around the restrictions of the diet itself.

        And that's where the "stress" factor came from. Not so much a distinct issue as it is a consequence of having to spend the extra time and effort micromanaging all the little things that you don't have to worry about *as much* with an omnivorous diet.

        (btw, I'm enjoying this discussion. Thanks!)

    That's not entirely fair. He wasn't concerned about reasoning plants until he heard about a story with an ability he thought was similar to Parseltongue which applied to plants.

      What ability? He heard the story about a snake getting information from other snakes. And spreading self-awareness. [Read chapter 48 again](http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/48) And then asked about other animals and then plants. 

      And stories as evidence? RHarry didn't even believe his magic teacher how spells are supposed to be cast. (Giving Hermione false spell incantations.) Or that "...after all, snakes couldn't really be human-level intelligent, someone would have noticed by now."

      Anyhow, the "plants have feeling" argument is quite stupid. Even for RHarry in his fantasy world. The ""Parseltongue" was probably just a linguistic user interface for controlling snakes..." is also quite stupid and pure rationalization. 

      I mean, if I give you the power to understand [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/8vbx4q/i_think_the_last_bark_was_sorry/) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4Dfa4fOEY) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbpXM4CgRwk) would you think you gave them self awareness? Or maybe you just found out they were really always able to speak. (And yeah, except for the first, I'm pretty sure they didn't communicate.) Or if you learn German, would you think German is just a linguistic user interface for controlling Germans...

      Btw he discarded it after finding out mandrakes can speak... Not sure if they kill them for the potion in HPMOR. 

      I still think it was stupid. But yeah the "head injury" was only to make a joke. I mean everyone should know, it wasn't a real head injury. 

      I don't expect to convince anyone on the internet to go vegan or of anything else. Not even on r/rational. So I think the perceived hyperbole didn't hurt anyone.

    Well, about going vegan, I suspect it'd make significantly *harder* to stay healthy, though not impossible, as you'd have to spend more time on your diet and balance it more carefully. Some people might be actually unable to survive on it depending on metabolism, I don't know. And there's a social aspect - ultimately it all boils down to quality of life and time, which means, are you willing to sacrifice a fraction of your *own* life for the sake of the lives of animals?

    Here's the thing, I know the most coherent option would be that, but I'm still just a vegetarian because ultimately, it's just not realistic for the animal meat industry to disappear in my lifetime. If we compare animal husbandry to human slavery, we're not in the US right before the Civil War, we're in the middle of the Roman Empire running our entire society off it. At this stage, it'd basically save more animal suffering if you just convinced, say, three meat-eaters to eat one half of meat, eggs and dairy less than they do than if you convinced one single person to go full vegan (which would be much harder). It's not exactly ideal but it's a feedback loop - it's easier to transition to vegetarianism than to veganism, and we need society itself (restaurants etc. especially) to start being more supportive of veganism before all the cultural barriers are removed.

    Concerning extinction: true only if you consider the individual well being of members of the species. Biodiversity in itself is a a value, and it translates into resilience of the whole biosphere to sudden change. You remove one species, you never know what crazy domino effect that could set up. Humans are the obvious exception as, let's face it, everyone else would be probably better off without us. Well, except for cats, dogs, rats and pigeons, who would meet a drastic reduction in numbers after losing their main source of food, and all the abandoned domestic animals like cows and pigs who are so selected and inbred they're now unfit to living in the wild.

    As for this:

    > btw eating whales would be ethical better than eating chicken.

    Questionable, by this logic you could make an argument for cannibalism as well, since humans too weigh more than chicken. It's not just about how many individuals, but *who* the individuals are. If we acknowledge value approximately proportional to sentience, keeping humans as our main concern, then killer whales, other dolphins and chimpanzees are right below. It's hard to decide how many chicken are worth one killer whale - birds are smart too after all, but I don't think chicken are especially so. Domestic animals are usually also less clever than their wild cousins, and chickens haven't even been selected for intelligence like some dogs, so they might as well be completely demented.

      >Well, about going vegan, I suspect it'd make significantly harder to stay healthy, though not impossible, as you'd have to spend more time on your diet and balance it more carefully. Some people might be actually unable to survive on it depending on metabolism, I don't know. And there's a social aspect - ultimately it all boils down to quality of life and time, which means, are you willing to sacrifice a fraction of your own life for the sake of the lives of animals?

      It's actually considerably more healthy to be vegan for most people. There are some who cannot easily, or possibly at all, survive on a no animal products diet, but they're fairly rare. For most, it's very healthy. The [Okinawan diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_diet) for example contains very little meat, and is associated with one of the longest living groups of humans in the world. Additionally, pretty much every major world health organization has said that veganism is appropriate for all ages and stages of life. 

      The only thing you really need to worry about with veganism is getting b12, which is easily supplemented, or gotten through fortified foods. (Which is how meat eaters do it, since meat is arguably fortified with b12.) Protein isn't so much a concern as people think [as illustrated here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n20uGGNoVdo_)

        Japanese people eat fish though! Which is arguably just healthy all-round, what with antioxidants, B12 etc.

        My point though wasn't that you can't be healthy on a vegan diet, but that there can be practical issues in procuring and balancing all the nutrients from the most commonly found ingredients (especially in western countries, and depending on where you live). I guess part of this is that for me a "healthy" diet comes pretty natural since I grew up in a Mediterranean area so even as a meat eater I wouldn't dream to just chug down hamburgers and steaks on a daily basis. Veggies have never been weird for me, in fact they've always been a major part of my diet. For others, just having a healthy diet might be as much of an effort as organising a vegan one.

        Another problem is that you have to throw out a vast part of your acquired cooking wisdom. For me a lot of things I make depend on eggs or cheese. Well, objectively, even as a vegan, I wouldn't see anything bad with keeping a couple chickens in a pen, feeding them and using only whatever eggs they produce. I couldn't possibly be so strict to assume that chickens have not only a right not to suffer in battery farms, but even not to be *kept* at all, a condition I doubt they have enough awareness to even fully appreciate.

        But yes, I know it's possible. People do it. It just takes a bit of effort and time.

          Japanese people eat fish, but if you look at the article I linked, the Okinawan traditional diet includes less than half a serving a day. They also eat pork, but rarely.

          I guess my point is that if you're vegan, and not living off of oreos, then you're probably gonna be pretty healthy anyway, since most of your diet is going to consist of vegetables and fruits and some fungi (nutritional yeast, mmmm.) If you're vegan, you pretty much already have a healthy diet (Again, unless you just eat oreos and ice cream, but I mean, that goes for any diet.)

          About the backyard chickens thing, the problem is mainly in acquisition. If you buy those chickens from a breeder, then you're supporting a business in which male chicks are often ground up at birth, as they have no benefit to the operation beyond the small number of cocks they need to keep for breeding purposes. That's not to mention whatever conditions the hens are under, and if it's anything like normal egg farms, then they're probably calcium deficient, as they're laying way more eggs than they would normally, and they aren't allowed to eat the extras to get back calcium, as they would and do naturally. That can also be a concern for your backyard chickens, the calcium deficiency. Ultimately though, if you can solve the supply issues, then there really is not much wrong with keeping them, as long as you make sure you keep them pets first, egg machines second- add calcium supplements to their feed, for instance, that kinda thing.

          Thanks for listening to me, rather than shutdown entirely as a lot of people do when confronted with a dreaded vegan.

            No problem, I started this thread because I at least acknowledge it as an issue, so I wouldn't simply shut you down :).

            Also, I think neither Oreos nor ice cream are vegan (except for soy milk variants), so that settles it anyway :D.
