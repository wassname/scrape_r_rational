    >“A googolplex is ten to the ten to the hundred, right?” said Mabel.

    >“Right,” said Dipper, though he found it exasperating that even his own sister didn't know that simple fact.

    But she did know it. Score one against Dipper.

    >“Five googolplex, thirty, i,” said Dipper.

    >“That's not a real number, silly,” said Mabel. “No.”

    kek.

    Wiki says heritability of IQ in childhood is "0.45", but I don't know what that would imply numerically. I'm just hoping Mabel is smarter than Dipper. We already know she's smarter than Dipper gives her credit for.

    >“But I was trying to trick you,” said Mabel. “And I got you pretty good.” Dipper crossed his arms. Mabel didn't even care about teaching people to think.

    Except it *is* a lesson. Score two against Dipper.

    >The brilliant mind he'd expected to find in his great uncle was simply gone; at best Stan was merely cynical.

    What, you think intelligence demonstrates itself in casual conversation?

    >Dipper loved books, or at least the concept of books, and this book looked very special indeed.

    The *concept of books?*

    At least he has good taste in fantasy codices.

      Beware black swans Dipper. (Though perhaps it would be clearer if it was: except if the numbers are less than negative one million - half the number plane and you still missed it!)

  I think this is a great concept and I do want to read more, but this may be the most unlikeable main charactor I have ever read about.

    EDIT: Seconding that this Dipper is incredibly unlikable. I kind of hope that he gets eaten by gnomes. Also, Soos actually (somehow) seems less intelligent than he is in canon? Dipper's condescension really isn't helping though. Also kind of weird that there's such a vast gulf in IQ between Dipper and Mabel.

      Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

      In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

      Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

      “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

      The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

      Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

      Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

      L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

        > Did you miss the part there where Soos owned Dipper's smug, showing-off antics butt without even trying? 

        The bit about him creating a rule with weird exceptions and so forth? If not, I wasn't able to read the whole thing, so I might have missed it. 

        > Or where, in the show, he turns out to be smart and capable for pretty much of the time?

        This is true. I haven't watched the show in some time, so I forgot. 

        > Or where Dipper in this story is being annoying now to represent a certain type of shallowly competent, inexperienced, and fantastically un-self-aware rationalist stereotype, all to provide a strong character arc when he gets hit by a magical realism/sci-fi clue bat?

        Oh, sure, I totally get what's intended here. The problem is that I have to be in the head of a character who, for the time being, I'd prefer to see eaten by gnomes. 

        It doesn't matter how good your viewpoint character is *going to be*, if in the meantime it's a chore to be in that character's head.

      Does the exact same thing and enjoys the story by smirking in revenge by seeing Dipper's minor comeuppance and crosses fingers for Dipper to develop into a more likable character (albeit not without him getting some mild punishment for being so rude to people).

  So, glad you made this, one of the shows I've put serious thought into writing a ratfic of.


  My notes:

  Dipper is very obnoxious and hpmor-like, almost to the point of parody. Will wait and see how that pans out. (Some deconstruction maybe?)

  Mabel feels much closer to how I'd expect an exceptionally intelligent version of her to act.

  Wendy being into the same stuff as Dipper kind of breaks my suspension of disbelief, but I can see it's necessary if you want this Dipper to look up to her as in canon.

  The implication that The Northern Caves happened makes me very hopeful about your version of Bill.

  I noticed there's no sign of cryptograms/puzzles, and no mention of gibberish or strange characters when Dipper's examining the Journal. Will that aspect of the show be making an appearance, either in the medium as actual puzzles, or as part of the plot?

  I am excited to see where you take this!

  Guys, we have ourselves a new Wertifloke.

  That said, I ran this chapter through my stylometric analysis and found it wasn't similar to any other rational fics.

  /u/LiteralHeadCannon how did you come across this work?

  God, Dipper is a dick. Besides that particular point, I like how you waited for the show to end.

  ```
  Well, this is the best parody of HPMOR I've seen.

  Also, Soos's rule captured the atmosphere of Gravity Falls amazingly.
