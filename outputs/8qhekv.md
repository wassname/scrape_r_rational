  Thank you for posting. I extend the same request to you as I did to /u\/gbear605, to spoiler-tag these chapters to hide the thumbnail.

  With all that bickering in the middle, I was sort of afraid that would be all this chapter had, but they still managed to squeeze in a reasonable amount of plot in the end.

  Also, I'd almost forgotten, but there's still a huge chunk of exposition hanging in limbo here. The pen cap they found just before setting the rebellion in motion apparently gave them a large wealth of information that hasn't been shared with the reader yet, except in vague terms like "So that's what 'The Seven Walls' means". I'm looking forward to hearing what that's all about.

  Is this a good read?

    As a whole, yes. There's a reasonably interesting cast, consistently clever storytelling and a remarkable courage to change genres and tone as the plot progresses.

    Looking specifically at the rationality criterion, it's alright. Beyond being consistently clever, it's *mostly* grounded and sensible about it, if we accept the starting assumption that the kids that form the main cast are unnaturally mature thinkers, with only the occasional hiccup along the way.

    I quit ~10 chapters ago, since it had felt dry and the characters flat for a while. The start promised much more than I feel it delivered, and at times it seemed merely clich√©. IMO this hasn't been particularly rational; there have been the typical manga-esque bursts of creativity, but most of it feels more along the "social stereotype" version of intelligence than it does "cognitive work".

    I seem to be an outlier, since upvotes on the posts have been [pretty much flat](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=promised+neverland&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new) since the series started, so there hasn't been much attrition.

      Tbh, I just feel like it's gonna turn into straight up battle manga at one point, but so far, I have been enjoying it, even though the first arc was probably the top
