  Jesus Christ, Harry. It's not bloody Twenty Questions.

  [spoiler](#s '"Describe the actions you will undertake in response to the previous command."')
  ```

  - u/Zephyr1011:
    ```
    That was a completely unambiguous question, i think it was pretty appropriate
    How would you have done it?
    ```

    - u/FeepingCreature:
      ```
      He tried to constrain the safety of his command, instead of just asking the system what the command _would actually do_. He did something without knowing what would happen!

      To clarify, my spoiler is what he _should_ have asked.

      Things that also would have worked: "Are you aware of reasons why I wouldn't want to do this? List them to me, in order of descending importance."

      [edit] "Do this for every command that hits this protection."
      ```

      - u/Zephyr1011:
        ```
        Ah, sorry, I misunderstood you. I agree. Although, i am unsure if that last question would work, since importance is not defined
        ```

        - u/Nepene:
          ```
          The machine was pretty intelligent, it could probably work out what importance was. If you wanted to be explicit you'd ask "List any problems that would be a problem to me in a concise manner according to my interpretation of Maslow's hierarchy of needs."
          ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  [I'm surprised this is](#s "the first time the system has run into an issue in which it would loop for so long. Also, a lack of a hardwired failsafe seems really weird. The warning to check with people is good. But if you design a machine that can magically siphon away, well, EVERYTHING, I figure you'd implement a safeguard to ensure that that could never happen. But oh well.") **
  ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    I'd guess that issues like that had happened precisely 15 times before.
    ```

- u/traverseda:
  ```
  Fused Filament Fabrication?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Actually, I was referring to [the Fuck for Forest movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck_for_Forest), though I can see why you would think that.

    ... Okay, maybe it's fanfanfic
    ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    I saw FFT, and assumed that somehow the Fourier Transform was applied to hpmor.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This fanfanfic was recently brought to my attention. A fun quick read. Dunno how far it goes to be rational*ist*, and it's a bit of a clunky HPMOR derivative, but it certainly plays with rational themes. And very successfully, too. All credit goes to /u/qbsmd.
