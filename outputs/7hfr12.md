  See also the [other podcast](https://from-ai-to-zombies.eu/) that was independently transcribing everything into audio. It isn't done, but I have grown rather fond of the narrators' voice.

    I thought this was what OP was talking about. Apparently there's more than one group making a free audio version.

  I just got the audiobook from audible and I have to ask why the audio sample is so shitty, I almost didn't buy it because when I clicked on the button I was assaulted by crackling grainy white noise to the point that it was unlistenable. The actual audiobook is fine though.

  Hi, thank you for this.
  Any idea if this gem has been translated in other langage, french for example ? =)
