## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Re-reccing magical girl gunslinger on royal road after someone else had originally reffed it here after it just wrapped up it's first story arc in the latest update. It's very reminescent of it's inspiration stray cat strut, a magical girl story in a world where humans are being slowly uplifted by aliens to fight against an extra dimensional alien threat that's just here to devour all life (as portrayed thus far). MC is horribly bullied/ abused by implication, but the work is actually fundamentally optimistic. This last story arc got me emotional at a character climax, which is rare for stories this early on, so it's doing something right.

  Only potential ding is that the author may have an inconsistent update schedule, fingers crossed it was a one time hiatus

  Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988) is a really underrated series. Its a space opera, but only 1/8 of the episodes involve any space battles, instead it is mostly focused on political intrigue between the Empire and Alliance, and the factions and subfactions within them. Because of this you get both modern political intrigue in the democratic alliance, but also medieval court politics in the feudal Empire.  The pacing is extremely good- despite being 110 episodes long, I often have to pause and reread dialogue (because unfortunately there is no dub), because every single scene is so important. There is some early installment weirdness in the first 10 episodes, but it really picks up in episodes 12-18.  There are 30+ major characters each with their own personal and political goals creating pragmatic schemes for accomplishing them, especially the main "villain", an Imperial general fighting to overthrow the empire and then unite the galaxy using his charisma and strategy, who completely carries the show to the point where the protagonist, though very well written, can't hold a candle to him.

  Although it was made in the 80s, the art and animation are consistently great, and the soundtrack, despite just being existing classical music, really fits the series.

    >an Imperial general fighting to overthrow the empire and then unite the galaxy using his charisma and strategy, who completely carries the show to the point where the protagonist, though very well written, can't hold a candle to him.

    Hard disagree here, I've always found Yang's plotline to be more interesting. Seeing him >!stick to his principles and getting punished for it, struggling under the constraints that are put on him by his own government, is the most interesting part of the show to me. !<

    In the end, LotGH isn't just about the war, it's also about two "warring" philosophies. To me, Yang's always seemed to be the most coherent one. And the depth of his character made him infinitely more interesting. I've never felt like Reinhard was outshining him, but maybe that's just me.

    Great rec, though. LotGH is incredible.

  hey guys, I've recently finished reading The Law of Averages and it put me in the mood for some superhero fics. I'm looking for ongoing or completed fics. I've already read Worm and The Perfect Run and enjoyed both greatly. I would like to pre-emptively thank everybody who gives me a rec.

    There's The Dire Saga (starting with **[Dire Born](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/27993770-born)**) by Andrew Seiple, where Nicola Tesla was the world's first superhero. The series follows Doctor Dire, a Doctor Doom-like supervillain, and has the strange origin story of having been a crossover fanfiction with Worm before the series itself was actually written! **[Dire Worm](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/)** is regarded as something of a classic among the Worm fanfiction community. 

    There's also The Reckoners series by Brandon Sanderson, which you might like. The first book is **[Steelheart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17182126-steelheart)**. The premise is that superpowers started showing up, and now the world is more or less ruled by superhuman warlords. I don't care for the series personally (I tend to dislike YA novels), but I generally rate Sanderson highly. 

    There's *a lot* of Worm fanfiction out there, and some of it is even good! In fact, I'd say some of it rivals or even exceeds the source material in quality. I'd rate **[Trailblazer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trailblazer-worm-gundam-au.680881/)**, in the later category, which is a Worm/Gundam cross (and I'm not even a Gundam fan). Somehow it manages to weave together themes from both franchises, which I found really impressive.

    Darker Than Black is an anime that might fit. It's a strange blend of stuff, including superheroes and noir novels, centered mostly (though there's a lot of perspective switching) around a protagonist that belongs to a class of people who were granted superpowers in exchange for their emotions and a "contract" in the form of a compulsion that they have to fulfill with certain regularity. He works as a secret agent for a mysterious Syndicate with a capital S. The powers aren't super interesting on their own, but they're all fairly unique and the fact that they're paired with strange personality quirks and traumatic backstories kind of serves as a prototype for Worm, in a way. The normie characters also get quite a bit of focus.

    Another potential fit might be "Trace" a Korean Manwha/Webtoon. The original run, before the sequels, centers around a few characters, all of whom are "Traces": People with supernatural powers whom society fears, despite them being mostly the only ones capable of opposing the monstrous "Troubles" that appear, seemingly out of thin air, to wreak havoc. The story actually has almost nothing to do with Traces fighting Troubles. I recommend reading past the first short arc and into the second before developing an opinion, since the second arc is where most of the characters you'll end up caring about get introduced. The first arc acts as a sort of prologue, with a really obvious genre and protagonist switch as it heads into the second. The superpowers in this one are incredibly stylish, but only from the second arc on.

    Both of these are complete works from before Worm came out.

    Have you already tried the Practical Guide to Evil webseries? It's more about the hero and villain fairytale tropes than superheros, but it's a very popular, very long ( there's 7 'books'  i think) and very worthwhile. I found the 2nd and 3rd books more enjoyable than the 1st one, and it shares  many elements with Worm (well thought out world, inventive battle tactics, complex characters with different goals, main character with a strong drive and moral system, etc).

  Does anyone have any good rational horror recommendations for Halloween?

  Also open to just general horror story suggestions, doesn’t have to be rational.

  I recommend the short story [Contratto](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7127255) about vampires who try to avoid or make use of their weaknesses. 

  There is also a Lovecraftian themed short story [A Colder War](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/colderwar.htm) by Charles Stross where eldritch horrors are used instead of atomic bombs in a M.A.D. scenario during the Cold War

    Oh, I asked this question myself a few years ago I think. To be honest we should probably make a list at some point. Several have already been told so here are the ones I don't think anyone has mentioned and some personal recommendations. 

    Eden Green by Fiona Van Dahl. 

    The main character is a rational and scientific person who discovers that the man who her best friend is dating has discovered and been infected with an alien needle symbiote that can regenerate all damage. Most of the book handles her semi-scientific experiments on the symbiote, and she asks questions and acts like a real cautious person would. Where do they come from? How does this work? Why were they never discovered before now? She realizes before anyone else the potential danger and horror that could ensue and it starts as a slow burn to a terrifying ending. With a sequel that deals with the army invading in the aftermath. 

    The Writing on the Wall 

    A my little pony horror story. Yes, really. About a Indiana Jones expy discovering a odd tomb with undecipherable writing and built to discourage people from going in. They assume it is just another old tomb and a warning to discourage thieves but it turns out the warning was very real and the "curse" isn't magical in any way. With people familiar with architecture or working in certain scientific fields able to recognize the "tomb" before the reveal at the end. A short story and quick read. 

     The Final Girls 

    A spoof and satire of the slasher genre. Where a group of friends go to watch an old 80s horror movie that starred the main characters sadly deceased mother and are sucked into the movie. Now they have to figure out how to survive and kill the slasher before it can kill them. Pokes fun at genre tropes, the characters try to act in a logical/rational way to survive, but it has its fair amount of flaws. But good for a rental. 

    Tremors - the first film 

    A classic creature feature that is surprisingly well written with people acting in a intelligent manner, observing the monster, testing things, and outsmarting it. Every single character acts how a real person would and the monster has specific rules and physical limits it never breaks that can be inferred and analyzed. 

    You're Next 

    A family is besieged by a group of killers but one of the potential victims is the anti-final girl. She is a well trained survivalist, builds traps, acts intelligently, and even shows the downside of wearing a mask since it hurts your field of vision and makes it harder to breathe. If Kevin from Home Alone was a fully grown women and had to improvise. 

    Dog Soldiers 

    Another well made creature feature where a group of soldiers on a training exercise is attacked by a pack of werewolves and they act...like a group of well trained soldiers with realistic tactics, trying to figure out how to kill them, and make good decisions that makes it more of a even fight. 

    Tucker and Dale VS Evil 

    The two main characters are innocent hillbillies on a fish vacation and act like normal people would in the weird situation they find themselves in. The twist on the Evil is the college kids who have watched way too many horror movies and assume all kinds of things about them with accidents, bad communication, and prejudice being the real reason for craziness that follows. Also genuinely funny. 

    The Thing - the original 

    The characters are smart and logical which makes the horrifying deaths so much worse as even though they are smart, except maybe at the ending, it still doesn't matter because the monster is just that bad. 

    10 Cloverfield Lane 

    The main character is resourceful and smart about figuring out how to escape. 

    The Night Eats the World. Zombie movie where almost every step of the   
    way I was thinking, "Yep, that's probably what I'd do." Feel like it   
    almost works as a procedural for a zombie apocalypse movie.

      The short story ["The Things"](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/) makes for an interesting companion to The Thing. Perhaps not Rational as such, but I expect it would interest anyone who enjoyed Three Worlds Collide.

  A Point of Honor by Dorothy J. Heydt

  VR/copyright infringement/murder story set in the near future of ~2040, published in 1998, well realized and very adult characters with personal goals that explain their behaviour, strong world building, nearly did a spit take when she mentions the duck flu of 2019 which killed the MCs mom.

  Goodreads link

  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1015538.A_Point_of_Honor

  All of her work republished on authors website, multiple formats available on this page, sadly without original cover art but that is easily remedied for those who care

  Also, according to Wikipedia this is the writer who coined the eight deadly words (I don't care what happens to these people), a couple elements of Vulcan culture (ni var-artform), and some elements of the society for creative anachronism (which she references pretty regularly in a point of honor)

  I'm also enjoying the short fiction collection 'stories you've never heard of,' it's filled with some truly bizarre/non standard/deeply weird fiction.  Some of it doesn't land, some of it took me days to pick at a loose thread and finally figure out what the subtext was and I'm still thinking about those ones.

  I'm one story into the collection of stories about the Greek witch Cynthia, the flavor strongly reminds me of Circe by Madeline Miller so far, based on the first story they seem really excellent.

  Sadly the author passed away recently, she wrote a very cool epitaph featuring the aforementioned witch, which can be read stand-alone, and features a somewhat heartbreaking foreword by her surviving husband of 51 years of marriage, direct link following

  I just finished *Breaking Bad*. Holy crap how can a show be so consistent, and so good? 

  I watched Season 1 in 2012 and didn't feel the urge to go to Season 2, but I picked it up again because my two long-haul flights in July/August had it on the in flight entertainment system. 

  I remember seeing a "meme" about how everyone hates Skyler and I don't get it. She seems to be the most "rational" of all the characters. I understand that people hated her because she opposed Walt doing what Walt wanted to do, but man, all her stuff seemed pretty reasonable.

  The scene where >!Hank died!<, in particular >!his last words: "Walt, you are the smartest man I know but you can't tell this guy made up his mind ten minutes ago?"!< was so beautiful even though I didn't like that it happened, obviously.

      Agreed, i think it was the best show on TV while it was airing. Artistically i think it actually beats BB - cinematography, framing, character development, etc. But it's half legal drama / half drug drama, making it feel somewhat schizophrenic at times, and it's definitely a more quiet and slower show than BB, largely lacking in the predecessors sheer spectacle, which is probably why it never had the mass popularity that BB had

  - u/-main:

    It picks up, but it takes a while. 

    I think the first five arcs or so are basically setup. That's Mankind's Shining Future, Pilgrimage to the Deep, Everblossom, The Quest Unrelenting, In Fading Image. IMO the mystery really gets going with Profane Ambition, after chapter 30 or so, then rapidly escalates over the next few arcs. 

    While you're reading the setup, try and notice and solve the minor mysteries, like "what the heck is up with the setting", and "what the heck is up with the main character". There's lots of little details that get slowrolled, like *when* it's set and how old the main character is, because the author wants to puzzle you with them first.

  I've been thinking about Casey Matthews's "The One Who Eats Monsters" (https://www.amazon.com/Eats-Monsters-Wind-Shadow-Book-ebook/dp/B074PC4S57) lately.

  It's not what most people here would consider rational fiction, because it's a demon-POV romance novel set in the modern US. It does fit four out of five of the bullets on the Characteristics list, but that's not why I'm posting it.

  The One Who Eats Monsters is hands-down the best executed "overpowered protagonist" story I've ever read. It manages to have compelling stakes despite the fact that the main character ludicrously outclasses the competition, and it pulls that off without ever compromising her agency, pulling a diabolus ex machina, or shoehorning in "counters".

  Give it a read.

  Couple of recommendation questions.

  I just finished the first book of Path of Ascension. How is the chapter-by-chapter update pace? Is it going to be satisfying to keep up "live", or should I just wait for the next book release and go through it like that?

  How is *Forty Millenniums of Cultivation*? Is it worth getting into? Is there a point where it "gets good", or will the first couple of chapters let me figure out if its worth it?
  ```

  - u/FunkyFunker:
    ```
    Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, first of all, is action Xianxia. If you don't the genre, you won't like Forty Millenniums of Cultivation. If you do like the genre, Forty Millenniums of Cultivation is one of the best, in my opinion. 

    If you aren't interested in the different worlds/ societies and the politics aspect, it might not so strongly appeal, because the author definitely digs into that theme, though mostly later on in the story. Again, action novel, not political thesis, but there is still a lot of it.

    **Copy-pasting an old comment of mine:**

    "Forty Millenniums of Cultivation is like this. The author builds a big sci-fi world with a bunch of different factions who all have different ethical systems/ resources/ economies/ technology, and those factions co-operate, battle, and generally interact with each other. Many of the arcs give a lot of attention to the big societal problems of a particular faction, and how different sub-factions are trying to address it. It's a strong overarching theme, though, and not always the focus of a given chapter.

    What I really like is how there are no 'case studies' of how a particular method is obviously wrong; these are all in some way or another functional societies; what these societies consider the 'goal' or 'function' of a society to be isn't always the same, though. Also, even in the most Earth-like societies, problems still exist; there is no utopia (from the reader's perspective; though there isn't necessarily the claim that a utopia can't exist, either).

    Another important thing is that the author makes clear that the existence of a 'cultivation system' strongly impacts what kinds of societies can exist, even though human nature itself is comparable."
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    I'm subscribed to the Path of Ascension Patreon, so clearly I'm biased, but it's definitely the top of my "oh yay got a new chapter" list. It updates very consistently Monday and Friday, with side stories on the occasional Wednesday.

    As for 40 Millenniums of Cultivation... People keep recommending it here but personally I thought it was very "meh". I will say that it is very consistent throughout everything I read, and the first ~10 chapters are representative of the next ~300 or so. It does do that annoying thing these novels tend to do where it randomly "resets" the MC into a new environment where they have to start over, and I always hate that.
    ```

  - u/SpeakKindly:
    ```
    Around chapter 2800 or so of Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, the English translation became so bad that I had to stop reading. Proper nouns stop getting consistently translated, and even start getting confused with each other. The good news is that we do get to finish a major plot arc shortly before this happens.

    I've started over in Chinese, and now I am about halfway through chapter 1. Slow going.

    Regarding whether early chapters let you know if it's worth reading: if you enjoy the comedy and the action, that stays fairly consistent. If you enjoy the intrigue and deception, those take a bit of time to set up, though you'll get some in the first 100 chapters. If you enjoy ethical questions, those get more complicated as the story goes on; the fundamental idea doesn't change, but there's definitely a trend of poking holes in previous simple opinions.

    ```
    I'll also offer a counter rec. I dropped the story somewhere early-mid book 2. I really _wanted_ to like the story after the premise and the first part of book 1, but I ended up not just disliking it, but actively regretting having read it.

    Partly it's the characterization. I was hoping for a character that succeeded against superior foes through preparation and paranoia, a la Batman or Mad Eye Moody. Instead, that part lasts only long enough to give him a solid magical advantage. Then he becomes an explicit adherent of the Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics (which is deeply annoying on it's own merits) who ping pongs around dealing with whatever problems he's happened to decide to deal with, succeeding with his outside context magic use and his openents' ineptitude. Lack of any particularly interesting aside characters didn't help either.

    Secondly, the big magical government Callum is up against seems to be both cartoonishly evil _and_ cartoonishly stupid. And magical society seems structured around all individuals in it _remaining_ both ignorant and uncreative. I _can_ think of explanations that would make some parts less stupid, and it's possible something like that was revealed later in the story. But _man_, it was unpleasant to read through.

    I think the tone switch around >!when he settles in that first town in the second, third, fourth ish chapter after getting the hell out of dodge!< but as late as >!when he first portal murders the vampires from the basement!< or even the >!journey south **Before** he gets in contact with the Alpha!< are all steadily worse “jumping off” points. Each is IMO a critical decrease in what made the first few chapters unique/intriguing. It ends up being a bog standard RR story IMO. Not a de-rec but certainly a “beware, I dropped it” caveat. 👍🏻🙂

      If this is bog standard for RR then I'm thrilled to have found a rich mine of stories!

      More seriously, my theory is the author fumbled around a bit at the beginning before finding the story he wanted to tell, which was about a lonely man doing what's right. I think he did an okay job of telegraphing that, but I can see how you might have expected a different sort of story. And of course I could be wrong in all my assumptions. I just really enjoyed this book.

        Oh man if you're new to RR then you're in for a treat - it's not fine literature (usually), but the top rated stuff is almost always worth giving a shot.

          Working my way down the list now. And I'm also giving a chance to other new authors looking for a boost.

        Ah, I meant it more in line with [this](https://reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ycc0sf/_/itr41rh/?context=1) comment. Murderhobo, Mary Sue, overpowered, as well as the bit about him being “paranoid” for like barely half of book 1.


        RR is still an amazing website, and the other reply to you is right, most of the high rated stuff is worth checking out. 👍🏻👍🏻

    I really enjoyed the first two books of Paranoid Mage. Book 3 has felt a bit weaker so far, and the romance hurt to read, so I ended up dropping it.

        Seconding this. The first book was pretty good, but the second one was very weak in comparison.

          Well, we'll see. I haven't started book 2 yet.

    …Paranoid Mage could maybe be redeemed if the main character were to learn that not all the world’s problems can be solved by holing up in a prepper hideout and taking potshots at evil government agents; but I suspect this is not where it is going.
