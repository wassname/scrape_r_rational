  That idiot starts hitting stuff with 1hp instead of figuring out some heal magic.

    There's a lot of reasons why he wouldn't go straight for healing magic, but I see that I haven't really made them clear in the story. I'll either clear it up in the next chapter or edit this one.

    As it is now, I agree. He looks pretty stupid.

      As he is safe, and didn't heal with new level, his priority should be getting that 1 hp up. He could have died hurting his hand. He could die tripping on a stone.

      His creation is up, he could just whip up some medicine or something.

      I'm a bit surprised resting didn't help with hp at all.

      Though, I admit, if I suddenly got magic abilities my priorities could shift too.

  Decided to go for rational-adjacent instead of rational after receiving a comment I very much agreed on. Let me know what you think about the story so far, and if anything about it bothers you. Thanks.
