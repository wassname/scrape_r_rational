## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  One personal example of culture war:

  So I study computer science and there was this event with multiple speakers from game and software companies in another city. This event was very drinking focused, people basically drank for three days in a row, but I thought it was a lot of fun and I got to meet a lot of fantastic people.

  Anyway, we went to the event by a bus. We had an official WhatsApp group where people could chat. At one point early on we had a "Joke corner" in which people could suggest jokes in the WhatsApp chat and then a guy from our association would tell all the best jokes speaking to a microphone. Very quickly people started to compete who could tell the most offending joke possible, and nigger jokes, holocaust jokes, dead baby jokes and some pedophile jokes were the most common - and this guy would tell all the jokes speaking to a microphone.

  I thought this could alienate some people who come to these events and make them less popular and taint the image of our association so I raised the topic in our association's executive board meeting today and said that they should do that a little less. Also, I personally think they're ethically problematic, but I was trying mainly to think about the good of our association here. The people in the executive board meeting weren't there so many of them were quite shocked and I got a lot of compliments for saying it aloud.

    I don't really think that's a culture war thing? Almost everyone will act 'shocked' when in an official meeting after hearing about something like that; it's hard to tell whether they were shocked because of some internalized culture difference, or just because of the different context.

      I'm pretty sure it is, I know these people and I'm friends with the rest. To explain it fully, I'd have to go through everything that has happened during the last few months but I don't have the time right now. Let's just say that the trip was a complete failure from the viewpoint of our association and at least one previous leading person was fired and is not welcome in anything that has to do with this student association. And why it failed has a lot to do with that joke session and other things that happened on the way there + other kind of organizational dysfunction. I don't think anyone who made those jokes on the way there was even in the meeting yesterday.

    What's the context? If it's a public group, then you have no reason to speak against people with a poor sense of humor; if it's a private group (either corporate or recreational), then you have every right to campaign to get them restricted. And whatever you do, don't just assume that dark humor damages reputation - it might on a national scale, but on a small scale it's a form of in-group signaling. (As a general rule, think about what motivations a *reasonable* person would have for making a joke outside the Overton Window. They certainly wouldn't do it if it *damaged* their standing in regards to normal people.)

    I don't think there's an ethical concern regarding dark humor, but it *is* immature, and that is concerning. Just make sure you're not censoring speech needlessly.

        What's the argument in favor of a Trump landslide at this point? Major polling error in the form of incorrectly calibrated likely voter screens? Some as-yet unlaunched October Surprise that changes the race in some dramatic way?

        Edit: Alternative scenarios: polls are being rigged in Clinton's favor; election results will be rigged in Trump's favor; mass defection of Democrat electors to Trump; "shy" Trump supporters skewing polls.

          Shy Tory Syndrome is why I don't believe Clinton's won until November 9.  I also think her coalition is unstable and fractious by nature, but that's another story.

            If it's any consolation, Republican early and absentee voting is down from 2012, while Democrat early and absentee voting is up from 2012 (at least in those states where such information is publicly available).

              See, the thing is, while I always wanted the Republican Party to crash and burn, I'm currently very uncertain that this is *how* I've wanted it to crash and burn.  Like, I thought George W. Bush was the kind of "last Republican president" I wanted: someone who didn't just say a few horrible things but actually started a bunch of wars and crashed the economy, proving for generations that his ideology was just plain wrong and needed to be rethought from the bottom up.

              Whereas Trump is such a fucking buffoon that the entire camp of intellectual conservatives, corporate conservatives, and right-neoliberals have crossed over into Clinton's camp, thus forcing basically nobody to rethink because everybody can just say that they jumped ship when the word "pussy" came out.

      These results are simply what people choose when there is a financial incentive for being correct, and a penalty for being wrong. There's no way to know precisely what information sources they used. Most likely though, the majority of people who placed those bets made a careful and reasonably well-informed analysis of the situation to ensure that they would make some money out of it.

      Historically, betting markets appear to be [more accurate than polls](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/keith-thomson/how-gamblers--historys-mo_b_2011534.html) when it comes to predicting the winner of an election. This is likely because they take a wider set of factors into consideration like the effect of electoral college inequalities, voter disenfranchisement, etc. in addition to simple poll results and trends.

        They're more accurate than a simple rolling average of polls, but are they more accurate than a [good model based mostly on polls](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-users-guide-to-fivethirtyeights-2016-general-election-forecast/)?

        Who knows? I don't. But come November 9th, I'll be able to finish up my comparison analysis and answer this very question!

              >1. Our early forecasts of Trump’s nomination chances weren’t based on a statistical model, which may have been most of the problem.

              >2. Trump’s nomination is just one event, and that makes it hard to judge the accuracy of a probabilistic forecast.

              >3. The historical evidence clearly suggested that Trump was an underdog, but the sample size probably wasn’t large enough to assign him quite so low a probability of winning.

              >4. Trump’s nomination is potentially a point in favor of “polls-only” as opposed to “fundamentals” models.

              >5. There’s a danger in hindsight bias, and in overcorrecting after an unexpected event such as Trump’s nomination.

  Aside from the whole every-energy-expenditure-hastens-the-end-of-the-universe thing, would there be anything morally wrong with simulating a trillion human limbic systems feeling abject terror?
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    That's an interesting question. Breaking it down:

    The number of simulated tortures shouldn't matter, except in that you might be able to claim there's a legitimate use for a smaller number (e.g. studying the response to terror in a simulated brain to better treat PTSD), whereas a trillion is probably excessive for all but the most contrived situations. If you were comparing the *magnitude* of immorality of two options (e.g. torture 1 trillion simulated brains, kill 1 real person) it would be important.

    Does the fact that they're simulated matter? I don't think it does, personally. If being simulated means something has no moral value, surely I couldn't object to somebody torturing trillions of simulated versions of me. There's probably a ratio of utility weights between simulated and real, but that's not relevant for a binary "bad or not".

    Likewise, does the fact that it's just the limbic system matter? This is a more complex issue. Arguably, without a body or brain to contextualise the emotion, it's all just the movement of charge. Again, I would tend to say that it is morally negative, but by how much I couldn't say.

    With that in mind, I would say that simulating the torture of a trillion human limbic systems has a negative utility. What the magnitude of it is is far too complex a question for me to calculate (it depends entirely on how you weight the components).

    There's an interesting but tangential question that just occurred to me. A computer isn't magically real. Simulations are just patterns in the flow of electrons through the circuits. A piece of paper displaying the memory for a simulation has just as much reality; a system composed of a man who studies the paper and writes the next iteration manually is homomorphic to the simulation, only much slower.

    In fact, neither the man/paper system nor the computer/program system need have any understanding of what they're simulating. So the question is, is *every* system that is homomorphic to a torture simulation equally bad, or does intentionality factor in?
