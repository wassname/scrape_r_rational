    They’re sealed \ cut off from outside environment (think thermodynamics). Trying to use a Black box inside an active time loop would be like building a box inside a box. It may be malfunctioning when used (e.g. not reaching x30 time dilation or not working at all) if black boxes and the time loop are operating on relatively similar principles, but I don’t think it w\could entrap the Aranea.

    On the other hand, if Red Robe is privy to how the FMA-soul trap operates, he may have been able to “blacklist” the Aranea souls and prevent them from getting reset with each iteration.

      I wouldn't put too much on that. I interpreted Xvim's information as an estimate, and on top that 'a month' isn't a very precise unit of measurement.

  Jaglenac and Rutvica come from the Bratac Jaglenac i sestra Rutvica (Brother Jaglenac and sister Rutvica). A children story in croatian language.

  Here's rough summary, but my croatian is far from perfect, so I might've made some mistakes:

  When the local countess was running away from the enemies, they stopped at the old farm woman and gave here for the savekeeping golden belt and golden cross. She kept them save and eventually died and passed them to her children - Jaglenac got the cross and Rutvica got the belt.

  After the funeral giant eagle (khm, Tolkien, khm) swooped down and grabbed Rutvica by the belt and took her to the very castle from which the countess fled years ago. There she saw 7 fairies (protectors if I understand correctly) talking to a dragon. They wanted to convince the eagle to give Rutvica to them, but he liked her and decided to carry her to his nest for a playmate of his baby eagles.

  When he was carrying her they flew by an island in the middle of a lake, and upon that island there was a church and near the church a meadow to which the eagle, the dragon or the fairies couldn't come. However when Rutvica saw the church, she grabbed srdašce (no idea, google gives me some flower, but I'm clueless) and her belt somehow got unfastened. She fell in the lake and the belt fell after her. And she took the belt and swam on the island and the eagle was furious for he couldn't go to the island. But even if she was saved, she was sad, for the lake was too big to swim and no one could get to her either.

  Jaglenac in the meantime was after the funeral very thirsty, but no one understood him (he was very little still), so he found a bucket of water, drunk, and seeing no one understood him he left after Rutvica.

  ((Ugh, that's the first 4 chapter, I've something I've to do now, will do the rest later I guess.))

    Huh, very interesting, nice catch! Apparently the author is [Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Brli%C4%87-Ma%C5%BEurani%C4%87), Nobel prize nominee x4. An English translation does exist, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Tales_of_Long_Ago

    I guess it should be possible to *ahem* find it online.

    > she grabbed srdašce (no idea, google gives me some flower, but I'm clueless)

    Oh, that's easy. It means heart. (Bleeding/broken heart is the name of the flower in many languages).

    Little Brother Primrose and Sister Lavender... It's a flowery tale. Huh.

    add: good news: it's public domain. http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/croatian-tales-of-long-ago-1922/

    add II: apparently, Kosjenka is a tiny fairy named Curlylocks form the fairy tale Regoč (Reygoch) from the very same book. I guess we need to read the whole book, just to be sure we don't miss a time travel related tale.

      Ah, there are English translations? Nice. Foolish of me not to check and read Croatian. Would've spent far less time on it. :/ Oh well, at least I practiced me languages.

      Sister Lavender? Afaik in original Rutvica means rue (herb-of-grace). Not sure about brother, I'll just assume it's a correct translation. :D

      And the book is added to read list. :D
      ```

    Finally got the time to continue. Sorry for some coherence breaks, first time I'm reading this, and as I mentioned before, Croatian ain't my forte.

    Jaglenac got to the mount on which the castle (in which the countess used to live) lived and because no one told him, he shouldn't, he started to go up the mountain. There he came upon the before mentioned fairies (as it turns out I was wrong earlier, those fairies are maleficient spirits), they were happy to see an innocent and helpless babe and start to dance around him, but when they tried to touch him, they couldn't because he was wearing a cross. But he was fascinated by their wings, so they lured him in a pitfall trap. He fell in, and the fairies were happy that he died. But he was light and as the leaves fell with him they both landed on spikes and the leaves protected him. So fairies came closer and saw that he's sleeping, and they were troubled. One of them figured out that they could make a storm and the leaves would get wet and slide down the spikes, and they were happy again and tried to make the storm.

    In the meantime Rutvica was sad and lonely. She missed her brother. A storm started brewing around her, but sun shone upon her, for the fairies couldn't touch the island she was on. But she felt bad for anyone who could be caught in the storm, so she prayed for them and she started ringing the bell that was in the church for them. And look, the fairies were afraid for hearing the bell that was silent for a hundred years and they scattered. And the storm stopped. But it was too late for Jaglenac. The rain that fell formed a fast river and it was racing down the mountain towards the hole he was in. And it covered the hole - the spikes, the leaves, Jaglenac. And nothing but water was seen. Yet the water when entered the hole spun and it lifted still sleeping Jaglenac and it carried him down. And on the way down he impacted upon a bush, and light as he was, the bush stopped him and he woke up. And he climbed up the bush and sat on it like a bird and above him the sun shone and below him the water raced and he sat in the middle like a bird. And he wondered who woke him up so suddenly, but he didn't see anyone. And when the waters passed and the sun shone he went up the mountain again.

    But when the bell stopped ringing the fairies came out of hiding and they saw the sun and they were fearful for nothing are they more afraid of than the sun. And they saw that Jaglenac escaped and they wanted to get to him, but they did not know how. And they went to the mother bear and asked her to kill him, but she didn't want to leave baby bear alone. And the fairy tells her that she'll take care of him, and the mother bear goes to kill Jaglenac and she raises both of her front legs to strike him when he comes. But he knows not that the bear is trying to kill him, and thinks she's trying to hug him, so he also raises his hands to hug the bear. And in that moment the baby bear weeps, for he was stung by a black wasp that gather around the fairies. And mother bear is furious and goes to protect him, and she fights the fairy and they forget about Jaglenac, and he laughs and walks on.

    And the fairies gather around again and decide to poison him. And they lure him to poisonous berries, but there are two berries, black and red and Jaglenac reaches the black berries and eats them, but fairies don't know that. But when he wants to go on, he's tired and sick and can't get up. At that time a fairy that was gathering the red berries reaches him, and offers them to him. And he eats, and get better, for the red poison killed the black poison.

    And the fairies are worried as Jaglenac is nearing the lake. And one of them goes and tells the singing bird to sing, to slow down Jaglenac, and she goes for the dragon. And the bird slows down Jaglenac and dragon arrives. And dragon takes a deep breath, and fairy tells him to burn Jaglenac, but the dragon tells her that he must take some more breaths. And he takes another deep breath, and suddenly a wind blows and blows Jaglenac over the lake. And fairy is weeping and dragon is raging, but they can't touch Jaglenac.

    And on the island he meets his sister. And they start to live together there.

    But after some time, Rutvica starts to worry how they'll survive in the winter, when there'll be no berries. And on one such day, she nears the lake and sees across the lake the youngest fairy, and she's fair to look upon. And fairy sees Rutvica and sees her golden belt, and she wants it. And she asks Rutvica to give her the belt, but she doesn't want to, for the belt was given to her by her mother, but fairy tells her that it was duchess' belt, and that she'll get her and her brother down the mountain safely if she gives her the belt, but Rutvica still doesn't want to. And she kept asking for seven days, but Rutvica never agreed. And fairy sat down and cried, for she wanted the belt that badly.

    And the duchess and her son lived peacefully bot poorly, and they both lived, and the duchess was growing old. And the son was one day lured by the promise of silver, and he wanted to kill a man, and duchess didn't want to lose him, so she told him the truth, that he was the duke, and she told him the whole story. And he asked where she left the golden cross and belt, for he wanted them, and she told him. And he left to get it, and he was wielding a sword.

    And he got to the mountain, and the villagers told him what happened, and that fairies took children who have the belt and cross. And he's sad and furious and he goes up the mountain. He comes upon the dragon and he kills him. And he goes on and comes to the crying fairy. And fairy tells him, she's crying for the belt. And the duke asks her where is the lake with children, and he tels her he's the duke. And fairy is thinkin, she'll get him to get the belt and then she'll doom him and get the belt, so she takes him to the lake.

    But when he comes to the lake, he hides for a while, and fairy once again asks for the belt, and Rutvica is sad, for they're getting hungry, but she still refuses. And the duke is moved, and threatens the fairy and decides to get the children down the mountain.

    And when they get down, he remembers what he came for and asks children for the belt and cross to get them to his mother, but when they hear that they tell: "We don't have a mother, bring your mother and she'll be our mother too." and he's moved and he goes to get his mother.

    And he came back with his mother and they lived together. And duke married Rutvica and went and conquered the castle and became a proper duke again. And they all lived happily ever after.

  More evidence for the Veyers Boranova = Red Robe theory!

  >He was pleasantly surprised that one particular asshole wouldn't be joining them this year – apparently Veyers Boranova lost his temper on his disciplinary hearing and got himself expelled from the academy. He wouldn't be missed. Honestly, that boy was a menace and it was a disgrace they hadn't expelled him sooner. Fortunately, it seemed there were some things that just couldn't be overlooked, even if you were an heir of Noble House Boranova.

  Evidence:

  1) The time traveler is almost certainly someone who would have been near Zach during the original summer solstice, when the spell was originally cast. This could be a fellow student, teacher, or diplomat at the party.

  2) Zach and Zorian have demonstrated that it's nearly impossible to do the same thing over and over again. They certainly couldn't/wouldn't do so without showing their increasing skills.

  3)If Red Robe was present at the school, he would have noticed Zorian becoming better, and eliminated him. So he can't be someone who is present during the story.

  4) Zach starts most loops by kicking Tesen's ass. Zorian started hating Kirielle for her annoying actions at the beginning of the loop, before he got to know her better. This sounds awfully familiar to Veyers losing his temper, although this could have happened before the loop.

  5) Veyers is a briefly mentioned character, at the very beginning of the story, who never appears again. The author doesn't put in unnecessary details very often--he was mentioned for a reason.

  6) He's mentioned as decidedly unpleasant character, although early Zorian was sometimes an unreliable narrator.

  7) He's a member of a noble house, which we have just learned in the last two chapters, may have reason to hate Cyoria, which has shifted power from Nobles to first-generation mages.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    On the other hand, all these points also apply to Zorian's brother, Damien.
    ```

    - u/SpeculativeFiction:
      ```
      Not quite.

      1) Zorian and his brothers are first generation mages--his parents are mundane (although his mother has witch ancestry.) So he doesn't have much rationale politically to screw over Cyoria--the opposite really.

      2)Damien had zero reason to be anywhere near Zach during the start of the time loop. He's off messing with something in the jungle of another continent. Why would he go back to Cyoria? I guess he could have found something there that led to the loop, but then why would *zach* be the target of the time loop spell?

      Red Robe is a leech, a tagalong. I just don't see why Damien would need his involvment at all.

      3) Zorian is incredibly biased against his family. (and people in general, at the beginning.) He hated Fortov, and was quite irritated by Kirielle. Fortov seems like an ok guy, while Kirielle was completely vindicated. His dad is certainly rude, but Zorian was an ass to start with--he could have his reasons. Damien is a bit of a jerk from what we know of him (he practiced the dancing spell on Zorian), but we don't have anything damning. His siblings don't like him, but his parent's and everyone else do. 

      Meanwhile, Veyers did something bad enough to get him sent to a disciplinary hearing, and then was enough of a jerk to get expelled. Despite being the Heir to an important house, which likely gets him special treatment.

      Personally, I think Damien is a massive red herring, and is in fact close to what Zorian would have turned out like if he didn't go through the time loop. Perhaps not nearly as skilled (Damien probably went into a black room), but with similar relationship problems. 

      Zorian has changed his opinion about a ton of people, but only after really getting to know them. I think Veyer's temperment has more evidence, he has more motive (heir of a strong house?), and finally his presence is less well explained. He sticks out like a sore thumb, while Damien fits well with the rest of Zorian's family problems.

        >"I kind of pushed her into a purple creeper patch during our wilderness survival class," Fortov admitted. "Please, you have to help me! I'll find you a girlfriend if you do!"

        He purposely pushed Ibery into plants, to the point where she was as such.

        >Her eyes and nose were red, as if she had been crying recently, and there was an ugly purple splotch covering her right cheek and neck. It didn't look like a bruise, not exactly, more like…

        This happens every month.

        >As far as he knew, Fortov always came looking for him for help with the purple creeper salve, even though his accident with Ibery only happened near the very end of the time loop. Which, now that he thought about it, suggested the accident wasn't so accidental after all. Kind of suspicious for an accident to be so insensitive to changes…

        Kiri describes his actions.

        >"Fortov once burned a bunch of my drawings when I asked him to show me some magic," she admitted. "Said it was a joke."

        He describes Kiri in a much less negative manner.

        >She was downright impossible this year, though

        >He was pleased to note Kirielle hadn't rummaged through his stuff before waking him up. She had a very fuzzy notion of (other people's) privacy.

        >Why was she always so intent on getting there first anyway? That was horribly petty, even for Kirielle. He'd have to ask her in one of the restarts.

        Fortov doesn't seem like an ok guy, he deliberately destroys other's property and Zorian always was much less negative about Kiri- and Kiri wasn't fully redeemed. Zorian had genuine reason to have issue with her, in that she stole his stuff and always went for the toilet first and repeatedly jumped on him, but never had as much of an issue with her as he did with Fortov.

        His judgement isn't that poor, he clearly has good reasons to not like his brothers.

          Well there's a point when Zorian realises that Kirielle goes into the bathroom to force him to go downstairs and talk to their mom (about him taking Kiri to Cyoria) So that's not a bad thing as such as Zorian says she's just a kid and doesn't realize it's actually counter productive.

          Also, she tells him that she steals his stuff to practice things that their mom doesn't approve of - her drawing and learning magic. So Kiri has been redeemed I think. 

          But you're right about Fortov, he's been a consistent jerk. Let's see if he has a proper reason about pushing Ibery onto the vines.. I doubt it tbh.

            Zorian was never that negative about Kiri, expressing some annoyance at her actions. I wouldn't really say she was redeemed, I'd more say he better understands her motives and is more sympathetic- she didn't really make amends for her actions. He still often sees her as an annoying brat, but he never hated her like he did his brothers. 

            Yeah, I doubt Fortov has some secret goodness to ivy pushing.

                It's enough for him to forgive her, but I wouldn't called Kiri redeemed. She's still naughty and bratty, and Zorian was hardly wrong in his judgement of her. He never thought anything that bad about her, he was just a bit annoyed, and is still often mildly annoyed at her for some action.

        ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    A bit too... speculative for my taste. He he he.

    (1) is unsubstantiated assertion at best. (2) has little to no relevance to RR. (3) It is pretty obvious that RR is not a classmate/teacher of Zorian, which excludes, statistically speaking, insignificant amount of people from our search. It is a strong evidence against, say, Akoja the Red Robe, but it is a bad evidence *for* Boranova the Red Robe. (4) is grasping at straws. The chief librarian is hating academy rector over a political \**gasp*\* dispute. Sound the time traveler alarm! (5) that is probably the only real evidence, but not a watsonian one and it's not new (6) lots and lots of people are described as unpleasant by Zorian, partially because he was angsty, partially because lots of people *are* unpleasant (7) if anything this chapter serves as a point against this one. This was the perfect opportunity to give us a clue in the form of Tinami spilling some juicy rumor about House Boranova. Something along the lines *"Oh, you think Noveda have it bad? Wait until you hear about our former classmate Boranova..."* Instead nothing happens.

    A much stronger case could be made for Daimen. "Unpleasant? I'll show you unpleasant!" (counterpoint to 6) 

    He is the biggest gun on the wall BY FAR (counterpoint to 5) 

    He starts the loop outside of Cyoria (to 3) on another continent even, which could even explain why marker detection doesn't work: he is simply out of range (although, most likely he has a different maker). 

    He is known exploring awesome magical ruins of awesomeness, is there a better place to find some forbidden time travel magic and start the whole thing? (to 1)

    He is known to be extremely talented, suspicious by itself. Then there is the the fact that RR is the only person known to perform not one but two magical equivalents of square circles, time travel and soulkill.

    He is not a member of a ruling elite and as grampa Reid has noted in his infinite wisdom no one achieves greatness by being goody two-shoes. Perhaps an extremely ambitious young upstart Daimen wants the world crash and burn so that he can come on a metaphorical white horse and save the day, securing his position. Have enough prominent houses eliminated as a collateral damage and the crown will be strongly motivated to ennoble him. Collateral damage from destruction of Cyoria will be HUGE. He secures an alliance with Ibasans and carves a grand duchy of his own, or something. Smaller than Kingdom of Eldemar, infinitely bigger than what he has right now (nothing).

    This, of course, offers no explanation why exactly Zach is looping, but neither does your theory.

    Add: another fun idea is that Daimen is not the main antagonist, but is the damsel-in-distress, of sorts. What if he poked something that was much bigger that he could handle (and even for a prodigy, world-wide time loop is way way way out of his league) or got betrayed by his partner (someone's got to fund his expeditions, right?) and Zorian has to deal with this shit in the end. Who is the brilliant brother after *that*, huh, huh? No evidence for this one, of course, but that would be a fun subversion.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      >fact that RR is the only person known to perform not one but two magical equivalents of square circles, time travel and soulkill

      A certain razor thinks that it is probably just one square circle, just applied differently.

      Also, so far Damien and Boranova are the two top theories for who might be the RR. My question is, are there any *other* suspicious people around?
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        Oh, the razor is definitely not forgotten here, but the point is, Red Robe is either a necromancer without equal (soul kill) or is occupying metaphorical driver seat in the time loop business, whereas Zach is a mere passenger and Zorian is a stowaway. This means that Red Robe is probably way more capable as a mage than Zach. This point is further demonstrated in Soul Kill chapter, Red Robe is *very* capable. Damien, being the prodigy even before the loop, fits (along with every other capable mage out there). Boranova, a mere student that got kicked out of the academy doesn't.

        As for suspicious people, there was that girl in Zach's group in restart zero that we know absolutely nothing about.

      Both of these arguments depend on narrative reasoning and the strength of said evidence is strongly dependent on the author's decisions. This is a rational story, and while in other genres I think you would have a good chance of being correct merely by recognising such patterns and completing the cliche, under the circumstances it provides only very weak evidence. Damien may exist only to flesh out Zorian's characterisation and provide his principle motivation for growing stronger; if Damien never plays a role in the story I would not be surprised. If Tinami had mentioned House Boranova then that would be reasonably strong evidence in support of the Veyers Boranova hypothesis (though relying somewhat on the Law of Conservation of Detail); Tinami's failure to do this is extremely weak evidence unless you have strong evidence that the author would follow such rigid narrative patterns.

      > He starts the loop outside of Cyoria (to 3) on another continent even, which could even explain why marker detection doesn't work: he is simply out of range (although, most likely he has a different maker).

      I believe it was made quite clear that Zach and Zorian ended up only with the same marker due to Lich schenanigans. It is entirely expected that the spell shows only two markers and this is no evidence at all.

      > He is known exploring awesome magical ruins of awesomeness, is there a better place to find some forbidden time travel magic and start the whole thing? (to 1)

      This is a reasonable point. Damien is sufficiently famous that he may well be the highest profile and most successful magical archaeologist in the the country (or nearly so). Furthermore, Damien is said to have recently discovered something particularly remarkable. If the time travel device were discovered in magical ruins then the chances of Damien being the discoverer are pretty good.

      > He is known to be extremely talented, suspicious by itself. 

      Very weak evidence. Most Red-Robes are prodigies but few prodigies are Red-Robes. How many prodigies or otherwise extremely competent mages are there in or near Edelmar? I would not be surprised if Damien has at some point in the past spent some time in a Black Room, but that doesn't appear to have any immediate bearing on whether he is Red Robe.

      > Then there is the the fact that RR is the only person known to perform not one but two magical equivalents of square circles, time travel and soulkill.

      I don't see how this is evidence specifically for Damien, but it's still good to discuss. It's clear that the time loop required some particularly extraordinary feats of magic: isolating from the divine planes not just a small room but a large chuck of the material plane that may extend past our solar system; engineering the soul marker that appears to be designed for the controller of the loop; and the time-loopy bit itself. Frankly, this seems beyond even an extraordinary prodigy and well into the territory of either divine intervention or a secret government project involving many of the greatest mages available and drawing massive amounts of resources (Evidence against: Xvim, obviously the greatest archmage in Edelmar, was not involved).

      A running theme throughout the story is that the Ikosian magical tradition has already assimilated most of the knowledge of older traditions and is with high probability has the most sophisticated understanding of magic in history ("It's true that we rarely find something worth learning among other magical traditions these days, but that's mostly because we already stole and traded for everything that was worth taking." - Chapter 23). Based on this, it seems unlikely that all the engineering of the time loop, including that particularly sophisticated soul marker, was done by an ancient civilisation.

      It is not made at all clear that Red Robe actually soul-killed the aranea and battle mages, note that he has plenty of motivation to lie to Zorian. I think the most credible explanation is that Red Robe understands the mechanics (or at least the control interface) of the time loop well enough to instruct it to exclude individuals from future loops. Note, also, that he did not attempt to "soul kill" Zorian; this is evidence that being tied to the loop is protection from the technique.

      > He secures an alliance with Ibasans and carves a grand duchy of his own, or something. Smaller than Kingdom of Eldemar, infinitely bigger than what he has right now (nothing).

      Not entirely implausible. This would be similar to Sudomir, who appears to be allied with the Ibasans to carve out his own independent territory around Knyazov Dveri (in addition to charging his soul battery). We really don't have sufficient characterisation of Damien to be able to judge whether this could be his motivation. What's the prior probability for a brilliant and highly successful prodigy to want to carve out an independent dutchy? Tinami's explanation of the political landscape implies that as a first-generation mage who would not have achieved his considerable success without the Mage Guild, Damien should be loyal to the Crown. This is even more so the case if Damien has been inside a Black Room, which appear to be controlled by the government.

      > What if he poked something that was much bigger that he could handle (and even for a prodigy, world-wide time loop is way way way out of his league) or got betrayed by his partner (someone's got to fund his expeditions, right?) and Zorian has to deal with this shit in the end.

      I think it's pretty likely that the time loop was not part of the Ibasan invasion plans. Quatach-Ichl and Sudomir both appear ignorant of the loop without Red Robe's involvement and it doesn't appear to have been to their benefit. When Red Robe was actively supporting the invasion to great effect, the time loop didn't end so either Red Robe did not achieve what he wanted or he is not the primary controller of the loop.

      Leaving aside the identity of Red Robe, I think the most plausible explanation for the time loop is that it was triggered after the invasion. Perhaps Cyoria was lost and the Crown ordered the activation of the secret project. Perhaps the primordial was released and a god came back from holiday and the time loop was created by divine intervention (in the manner of Time Braid).

        All valid points.

        > Both of these arguments depend on narrative reasoning and the strength of said evidence is strongly dependent on the author's decisions.

        Absolutely, I was merely pointing out that if we are resorting to out-of-universe evidence, the case for Daimen becomes so much stronger.

        > We really don't have sufficient characterisation of Damien to be able to judge whether this could be his motivation. What's the prior probability for a brilliant and highly successful prodigy to want to carve out an independent dutchy?

        I think we have indirect evidence via characterization of Zorian's parents. 

        Now, Zorian's depiction of his family is somewhat suspect. I believe re-evaluation of his earlier judgements is not done yet. It seems reasonable that he could be more sympathetic to his mother and Fortov, just as he became more sympathetic to Kirielle. But his father, it seems to me, is a lost cause.

        As per Zorian's description we have a social climber that neglects his other children for being not talented enough. How would someone like this raise a really gifted kid? Would they instill loyalty to the community and the country, personalized by the ruling elites? I feel that's not very likely. Opportunism, self-entitlement, cynicism and bitterness at his low social status are well on the plate for Damien.

        > Leaving aside the identity of Red Robe, I think the most plausible explanation for the time loop is that it was triggered after the invasion.

        I have thought of this. The biggest problem with all time loop theories proposed so far is that I do not see a satisfactory reconciliation of Zach and RR both being in the loop.

        Suppose the loop is a case of divine intervention. This implies that Zach is the Chosen One, and it's not far-fetched. He is suited for a damn good narrative. A deity could choose someone like him to be the Champion, easily. But why did RR get into the loop? Why that option was on the table in the first place? Technically, we know it's because loop soul markers are vulnerable to soul magic, but does divine intervention really work in such... reverse-engineerable ways?

        Time loop as a government program has even worse problems, such as why even bother with Zach? Apart from being a heir to a Noble house, he wasn't someone really fit for this task. Someone like Haslush was. Someone who was already a capable mage before the loop, preferrably an officer and definitely an adult. Unless the loop prohibits biologically older people from looping, there was no reason to loop Zach.

      Mainly narrative reasons at [first.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3eju9z/mother_of_learning_chapter_39_suspicious/ctjvwis) I completely ignored the mention of him on my first read through, and when I re-read it a second time (almost immediately after), I realized that he had never shown up.

      Many things in the story are mentioned once, then only show up as important 20 or so chapters later. The cat by the river being Notcha, for instance. Few things are mentioned for no reason--It just doesn't seem to be the author's style. 

      Once I realized the oddity, other evidence began piling up. Zorian's search for the other time traveler made no real sense, as pretending to be one wouldn't let you use the loop to your advantage, and would quickly drive you crazy. Even if the time traveler had been there, finding them would have been fatal (which obviously ruled out Xvim, who others saw as a suspect. He of all people would have realized Zorian's growth early on.)

      It had to be someone who was close to Zach in the beginning...who was missing. Damien was both too obvious and too far away, and fit more with Zorian's character development arc (realizing how much his empathy skill and general attitude had skewed his view of people around him, especially his family.)

      We've known Zach has had his memory wiped for a long time now. The obvious way to find the time traveler would be to compare notes, and see who he doesn't remember. Or simply look for people who should be present but are missing, but that wouldn't have worked with the narrative arc. Red Robe needed to be hidden until the second arc for purposes of dramatic tension, so that wasn't likely to happen.

    One piece of evidence about RR which I don't think has been discussed:

    RR, being a competent soul mage ("necromancer"), should have no problem seeing the loop marker.  He is able to identify Zach as the looper on sight (but, oddly, not Zorian).  Presumably this is because of the marker, but I don't know.

    Why, then, did he soulkill *all* of the aranea?  If he knew about the marker at all (a necromancer would), he could simply perform a search for the same marker.  RR's behavior  here is odd and probably irrational.
    ```

    - u/SpeculativeFiction:
      ```
      > He is able to identify Zach as the looper on sight (but, oddly, not Zorian).

      He was probably there when Zach first started the time loop, or at least found out about it later (Zach literally told *everyone* in his class that he was a time traveler, not to mention teachers and government officials.) So i'm sure he recognizes him by sight, not by his soul.
      ```

      - u/munkeegutz:
        ```
        but that's weird in and of itself too: since RR is a necromancer, he SHOULD be aware of the marker on his soul, and therefore able to somehow detect other markers, with ease.  The fact that he doesn't may indicate that RR does not have a marker.
        ```

        - u/SpeculativeFiction:
          ```
          That and the fact that Zorian's tracking spell only came up with one other marker (Zach's.) Red Robe is using something else to stay in the time loop. Maybe a familiar/soul bond?
          ```

- u/thegiantpossum:
  ```
  This dimensional magic sounds very interesting, and of course Xvim has shaping exercises for it. Perhaps when Zorian becomes better at creating these fields to teleport he will be able to access previously sealed off places, such as Sudomir's mansion.

  Once again the aligning of the planets is mentioned. Whatever spell was cast was probably related to some sort of surge in mana due to this anomaly. Zorian has already hypothesized that it is very old magic, and this combined with the dimensional gates means that some group has access to magic that has long been forgotten. If the lich had this knowledge, why did he not use it sooner?

  In both Sudomir's mansion and the time loop itself soul magic seems to be the key, suggesting that Zorian will either have to learn it or find someone to train throughout the loop. Red Robe is probably a natural soul mage, allowing his un-explainable skills like soulkill.

    Or he's had access to an island of not particularly hostile ancient necromancers and a time loop. While I doubt they'd teach him the very best things he could have learned some enough to create such a spell.

  Why didn’t Zorian re-save the assassinated necromancers to get their expertise on the FMA-style soul trap? It wouldn’t have taken that long at reset’s beginning and he’d’ve received a much better understanding of its nature (and also the morlock wouldn’t’ve ended up being so depressed).

  Also, I wish Zorian would get his shit together and start using black boxes at least semi-regularly (although that may make preventing him from getting too OPed difficult).

    That might be dangerous. His top priority at any time is keeping himself from being permamurdered/ejected from the time loop, and thus he might not want to risk putting his soul in a box that literally seals it off from the rest of the world.
