  The end reminded me of the ending of 
  [Worm. (Worm spoilers)](#s Cat as Tailor did became a monster beyond human understanding)

  Cat is about to transition into another name, I dont think Black Queen nor Black Knight fits. She is a Queen, a General and of Winter. I cant imagine what will be her new name. 

  edit. I just realized, akua got the classic ending of the evil mage that binds demons. The demon/monster/Cat escapes and the mage is crushed effortlesly. Wow, congrats erraticerrata, the end of the fight was both unexpected and obvious in hindsight. What an ending should be.

    Duchess. She becomes the first mortal to fully take on a Fae name. Getting the full demigod level power but at the cost of flexibility and humanity

      “I reject my humanity, Akua!”
      ```

      - u/Cariyaga:
        ```
        "I reject your 'humanity' and substitute my own!"
        ```

    - u/leakycauldron:
      ```
      It's definitely not Duchess.

      Thief is an old Callowan name, but Adjutant, Archer and Heirophant are all new names. Hers will be new.

      Also she's already more than a Duchess, she's a Vice-Queen by mundane title, there's no situation where her name is less powerful than her rank. Ice Queen. Fae Knight. Lady of War.
      ```

      - u/akaltyn:
        ```
        **Moonless Knight**

        Combining the Black/White Knight theme with her title of Duchess of Moonless nights. Can names be based on terrible puns?
        ```

  - u/Oaden:
    ```
    She also called herself "The monster" though i don't think that is a name since it wasn't capitalized. The Cursed is available though, since Sabbah is dead.
    ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      It's not totally clear how such things work, but presumably it's been available since she transitioned to Captain.
      ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  > “You acquired a great many ritual objects to build this device,” Black said. “Were any bought through the Closed Circle in Mercantis?”

  > Diabolist looked at him for a long time.

  > “Yes,” she said.

  This is interesting. Archer's interlude mentioned is as ‘an auction for which that cannot be bought’, so Akua had to barter something in exchange. Given the form of the question, either an artifact (probably from Wolof) had found its way in the wrong hands, or the First Prince already knows about the superweapon, and so a crusade is inevitable.
  ```

  - u/haiku_fornification:
    ```
    I think this is Black getting confirmation that Malicia set up Akua's super-weapon, since we've been told before that the Empress often works through her intermediaries in Mercantis.
    ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  >A bundle of power inside her unfolded under my patient eye and I flicked my wrist. Ice spread through it, cracks spreading as she flinched. Ah, I thought. Devoured but not gone. The corpse of her aspect I took for my own, let the winds and the snow bury it. It would await my purposes there.

  And so Catherine casually Takes over the whole devil army and, possibly, keys to the hellgate.

  Also, *dons sunglasses*    [called it!](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/09/06/chapter-29-scale/#comment-7216)^YEEAAAHH

  > “I still have an oath to keep.”

  All hail the Commander, I suppose?
  ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  I've got mixed feelings about this chapter. 

  On one hand it makes a lot of sense if you consider the scale of the opposition Akua has been tangling with. Capturing Black who has been killing Heroes for the past four decades is a tall order. Moreover, Black is a renowned strategist so him having a plan to eliminate Diabolist (or take advantage of her weakness) makes sense. In fact, many people predicted that Black let himself get captured or was a decoy somehow. So inside the universe this all adds up.

  On the other hand it felt thoroughly unsatisfying. Too much of what happened felt like Black's plan flawlessly coming to fruition. A couple of chapters back we had Cat musing about how defeating a villain is a trial - a crucible that reforges a person anew - and this all felt too easy.

  Even sacrificing her humanity felt a bit like pushing a button and there- you're now a demi-god. A couple of paragraphs of how she's been sacrificing her people instead of herself... which isn't really true? I mean, in Book 2 she turned herself into an undead abomination and withstood the judgment of an angel. I don't understand how she thinks she hasn't earned or hasn't paid for her power. She's been at the front lines of virtually every battle and she became the Duchess of Moonless Nights by defeating the Duke through cleverness and strength. What more do you need to do to earn that power? At what point did others bleed for it instead of Cat?

  Maybe I'm forgetting something but this dilemma comes out of nowhere. It feels like a tacked on reason to sacrifice her humanity rather than something she actually struggled with in the past.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Cat has been struggling with her humanity this whole book. She cut ties with her lover, rejected the call back to the side of "good", and has been mulling on her hypocrisy for a while. Additionally her "rock" Black, was revealed to have been Assassin, at times.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      And worse yet is she doesn't know *when those times were*.

      Out of all the times she talked to him, aside from the two most obvious, she has no clue if it was actually him or Assassin.  And, assuming that Black survives this day, she will *still* have to wonder in the future.
      ```

      - u/akaltyn:
        ```
        I think its less of an issue that past conversations could have been with Assassin then that Black was treating her as a pawn by not telling her his plan to swap with Assassin, or that it was even possible, and giving Assassin their code phrases. She was building up a level of trust with him an the belief that he treats her as an equal. This knocks her back down to how she was in the first arc where he ordered her around.
        ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      It's funny that we have the author's word that we've seen Assassin at least once in every book. Now we have to wonder if some, or maybe even all of those times happened when she spoke with "Black".
      ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    I mean, Diabolist was up against the Black Knight, Assassin, Warlord, Squire, Adjutant, Archer...

    Like, I get that Diabolist is a big deal Name, but all of Evil is on the other side of the field.  She was never gonna win.
    ```

    - u/Oaden:
      ```
      *Warlock, unless the Hellhound did something fancy when we weren't looking
      ```

  - u/Oaden:
    ```
    It isn't confirmed Diabolist is dead yet though, all she has is an arm stuck through her torso and the full might of winter pumping ice into her veins.
    ```

    - u/Mountebank:
      ```
      Plus, Cat would still need to kill the baby that Akua is using as a phylactery.
      ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    > On the other hand it felt thoroughly unsatisfying. Too much of what happened felt like Black's plan flawlessly coming to fruition. 

    In terms of creation's narrative Cat was the one directly engaging Akua and winning, Black was more like having a reinforcement help at the last minute. That said I agree things went too well for him, I expect there will be some sort of cost. Maybe the swap with assassin was more costly than it seemed. 

    > What more do you need to do to earn that power? At what point did others bleed for it instead of Cat?

    I think its more about the outcome than the power? Like when she was talking with Akua it wasn't about what she had t sacrifice to gain her name or title but about what she was willing to do to help Callow. So far she's been able to have it both ways with getting all the benefits of villainy without losing the moral high ground in her own head at least. I think becoming the dark inhuman fae version of herself means acknowledging she can't do that.
    ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:

  This... well the good news is Akua got a good thorough fisting she's been asking for for years.

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  Ah man, that Assassin reveal had me laughing like a full solid minute.
  ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    It just brings up more questions, to be honest.

    Is it dead? What is it? Why is it so terrifying? How is it so terrifying?
    Someone suggested that it's a counterpart to the Bard, but WHO KNOWS?!
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It's not dead, we know that much.
      ```

      - u/NebulousASK:
        ```
        Not permanently, anyway. I think the implication is that it does get killed... it just gets better.
        ```

        - u/cyberdsaiyan:
          ```
          It's interesting to note that one of Catherine's potential iterations (The Tolltaker) kills him off for real using Goblinfire. Since goblinfire eats magic, Assassin might be a completely magical entity.
          ```

          - u/Zayits:
            ```
            Or he never bothered to come back, either because he realized the Tolltaker never had a plan, or because he was needed to dispose of the Praesi rebels, an then the Empress was killed.
            ```

            - u/RynnisOne:
              ```
              Pretty sure if he realized she had no plan, he would redouble his efforts to kill her.

              These villains are used to adapting to the plans of their enemies, once discovered.  But to find out one of the main people who opposes you *has no plan* and is just making it up as they go?  You can't predict for that.
              ```

    - u/akaltyn:
      ```
      [possible spoilers](#s " Based on earlier chapter's I'm pretty sure that Assassin and Scribe are the same person. Note that they both operate in the background and appear and disappear mysteriously, Scribe has an ability to make people not notice her, which fits with Assassin's shifting appearance and ability to appear unnoticed,  is extremely loyal to black and involved in his behind the scenes dealings. . (And we know from WoG Assassin has been seen onscreen before now. ) Also on a doylist note, in an earlier chapter Scribe literally appears after Cat says something about not knowing who assassin is, which seemed pretty blatant foreshadowing. ")

    > “Why so quiet, Akua?” Black said. “Come now, if there is moment to gloat now is it.”

    > Diabolist slowly crossed the room until she stood by his side, her face remaining in a pleasant façade.

    I'd say this part is far funnier, in the context. The reveal is so funny because what follows is Akua's whole plan going off the rail in a matter of seconds; this is a culmination of her trying to defy Black and failing miserably.

  I'm so glad Kat turned out to be the monster. She was the only candidate I could think of for the monster, and as per usual, the monster unleashed turns on its master. I hope Kat's name doesn't limit her too much, though. If it's heavily based in Fae power, she might be extra susceptible to narrative twists, which would suck since she would have a much harder time messing with other people's narratives. Great chapter tho, the Assassin move was brilliant
  ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  Well well well... looks like it's the ol' Assassin switcheroo! I'm getting major FATE vibes from Assassin, although its aspect seems to manifest differently than Hassan-i-Sabbah (one person who can take many forms rather than many people using the same name/role). 

  I'm not sure what this means for Cat, or what's going to happen when she transitions. I don't like Fae-Cat much so far, although her casually killing Ubua was quite satisfying. Random thoughts/questions:

  * Why did Cat's limp come back? Or more accurately, what made it disappear before? It seems weird that a soul binding physically cured her limp in the first place...?

  * Which Aspect did Cat keep? She mentions that two were now gone and one become overpowered. I'd assume that Take was what she kept considering what happened with Ubua's **Call**, but Fall seemed to be her Winter Aspect previously. How did Winter decide which to keep?

  * I recall a post or comment from long ago that erraticerrata mentioned that Assassin had been in the story already, and I always assumed it was as a hardly mentioned background character like a lieutenant or server or something. Now I'm thinking he actually meant that some of the main characters have been Assassin in disguise. Any ideas of who? Besides Scribe, who seems the most likely contender?

  * Do we think that Ubua's soul vessel/child is going to be related to a main character? Would provide more of a punch than just making it some random kid, no? Watch it be one of Sabah's children...

  * I actually felt bad for Dumisai. I knew he would die, but he just seemed so likable. I mean, besides his support of his genocidally-minded daughter.

  * Why did Black seem "warier" after Ubua confirmed she had a single conversation with the Wandering Bard? My guess is that he's worrying that she set up things to turn out this way, so he's still playing into her plot... could it be something else?

  * It seems a little odd that Vivienne's true name is, well, Vivienne. I'd have expected something a bit... more? Like her last name too, at least? Maybe I'm just used to Dresden Files' take on true names. 

  * "Diabolist backed a way but *I touched her chest over her head,* ever so slightly, and there was a quiet snap." I'm not really understanding what this means or what it pictured here. Ubua was backing away; did Cat suddenly teleport behind/above her? Did she fall down and Cat was standing over her? Did she trip ass-over-teakettle as Cat reached out?
  ```

  - u/haiku_fornification:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure that in some of the scenes Cat had with Black it was actually Assassin instead. This is alluded to when Assassin answers her security questions correctly so either Black told him or it was Assassin all along.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      > it was Assassin all along.

      That would be a trip, wouldn't it? Imagine if every interaction Cat had with Black was actually with Assassin instead...
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        > “You killed barely a tenth of the soldiers I assigned to your capture, Lord Black,” Diabolist replied. “Today is a day for disappointments, it seems.”

        > "In the future, consult further than Hierophant. His lack of interest in stories is a glaring weakness.”

        > If I could frown at that, I would have. He knew for a sure I’d consulted others when planning this out: he’d been one of them.

        I'd say that his appearance was well foreshadowed specifically through hinting that this *isn't* Black Knight.
        ```

        - u/AurelianoTampa:
          ```
          I meant every interaction *ever* not just in this chapter :)

    Ubua's role is to cause a great deal of noise but ultimately fail and die. She isn't a player, just a piece on the board.

    He knows she has been getting support from someone and is ultimately being used as a tool to advance their agenda, knowingly or not.

    Eliminating Bard as the suspect for who is using Diabolist means there are only two hands that could be moving this particular piece.

    If it's not one side, the natural suspect is the other......

    Malicia.
    ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    > Why did Cat's limp come back? Or more accurately, what made it disappear before? It seems weird that a soul binding physically cured her limp in the first place...?

    When the King of Winter made her a Duchess, she mentioned how a side of her face that shouldn't have been feeling anything at all now felt cold. I think that whatever safeguards he (and later, Masego) installed also added to her soul.

    > Which Aspect did Cat keep? She mentions that two were now gone and one become overpowered. I'd assume that Take was what she kept considering what happened with Ubua's Call, but Fall seemed to be her Winter Aspect previously. How did Winter decide which to keep?

    She had one Aspect remaining in the sense that the other two were used for the day. Take was previously used to force a resurrection from an angel, so maybe the remark about it being overpowered refers to that?

    > Do we think that Ubua's soul vessel/child is going to be related to a main character? Would provide more of a punch than just making it some random kid, no? Watch it be one of Sabah's children...

    It's a newborn, and both times Sabah gave birth to a child she stayed with her husband to raise them, so that's not in the cards. Still, I expect a grim scene of the Woe deciding who has to do the grisly deed before the epilogue of this book.

    > Why did Black seem "warier" after Ubua confirmed she had a single conversation with the Wandering Bard? My guess is that he's worrying that she set up things to turn out this way, so he's still playing into her plot... could it be something else?

    Maybe he suspects something along the lines of what happened in the end of the last book (Bard leading away a party of heroes going for Liesse or something).

    > It seems a little odd that Vivienne's true name is, well, Vivienne. I'd have expected something a bit... more? Like her last name too, at least? Maybe I'm just used to Dresden Files' take on true names.

    'Given willingly' is the important part here. Now she has some kind of authority over her, maybe like with the Adjutant and soldiers.

    The chest/head line is probably a typo, and Cat instead casually put her hand through Ubua's shriveled little heart.

    I'm wondering if she'll use Take on the Summer power Akua is still holdng. It'd be an interesting juxtaposition, holding both sides of the coin.

    - u/nick012000:
      ```
      She's tried that before, during the fight with the Summer Princess, remember? She can't hold onto it for more than a few seconds.
      ```

      - u/Friedoobrain:
        ```
        Yep. They couldn't coexist. Now that the Summer Queen and Winter King have married, they might be able to. Cat would be a Duchess and a Princess. In both cases, just one step removed from a Queen.

        EDIT: And the respective titles. The Duchess of Moonless Nights, and the Princess of High Noon.
        ```
