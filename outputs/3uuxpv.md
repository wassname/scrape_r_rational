## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Over Thanksgiving I DMed a Hogwarts themed D&D game. As part of the Ravenclaw section, the players were tasked with playing a game against a ghostly opponent, with the catch being that they had no idea what the rules of the game were and could only gain knowledge through watching the opponent's moves or testing the result of some action.

  I've also lately been getting into programming web games, mostly because it's something that I can do while watching television, which is difficult for me to do with writing. There are games like [Zendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendo_(game\)) with hidden rules, or games like [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game\)) with hidden information, both of which are inspirations for a game that has rule-finding as a core element. I guess my problem with Zendo is that it's *only* inductive reasoning with the end goal being to find the rule. Once the rule is found, the game starts over and the player doesn't do anything with it. What I want (and what I'm trying to prototype towards) is a game where finding the rules is a means to some end. There are certainly a lot of games that do that, from Dark Souls to bullet hell shooters, but rule-learning tends to be a relatively small part of it in comparison to executing a plan with those rules in mind.

  The larger problem is generating rules *procedurally* in such a way that the rules can be tested and figured out *and* still be entertaining, which would probably involve too much work.

  (The game I used for D&D was a variant on [latrunculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludus_latrunculorum), which is sufficiently obscure that none of the players knew what it was, while also being close enough to traditional board game grammar that they wouldn't be completely lost. I've done this before with a different group using Nine Men's Morris, though I don't think that's usable now that the Assassin's Creed games have increased exposure to it.)

    FYI (You probably know this, but others may not) Zendo is derived from [Eleusis](
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis_%28card_game%29)  by Robert Abbott. I think Abbott also designed a chess-like game where you don't know which of your pieces is which (but your opponent does) and you propose moves that are cancelled if illegal. So, that's similar to mastermind (known rules, hidden information) but as a two player chess game. 


     It turns out that designing interesting scoring to Eleusis is also interesting. I won't say it's difficult, but you have to be careful to make the scoring reward cleverness. You want to build a score system that rewards the rule designer for rules that take different people different amounts of time to decipher. (I've played with poor scoring systems, which might encourage rules designers to put in traps that cannot be determined until a certain time has passed, that's just annoying, and I assure you that people have real trouble grokking systems where rules have delays). None of which applies to your game, but it's interesting.

    I'm sure it's possible with the right constraints. For example, chess with new randomly generated pieces. There's quite a library of [fairy chess pieces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece), with simple rules for generating more.

  I had a dream last week where I lived back with my family (parents/sibling/grandparents) where I grew up. Halfway through the dream I died, and became a ghost. I had moderate poltergeisty powers to flip objects/cause wind bursts, etc. I could not speak, however. Dream me spent a good long while being torn between figuring out how to make my family really rich and going off looking for scientists. Awake me thinks that finding the scientists would probably have been the shortest route to improving life for those I care the most for, but at least dream ghost me was planning on *eventually* revolutionizing the sciences.

  [Meta]: Would it be worthwhile to suggest to the mods a new weekly thread, "I Want a Rational Version of X", in which all the threads which are more "Hey, wouldn't it be neat if someone wrote..." than "Here's something you can actually read" could be filed?

  Also meta: How about adding a list of the standard weekly threads to the sidebar?
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:

    Hmm.  I don't want to add too many regular threads, but if there's some interest *from authors* I'd be happy to do it.  (Interest only from readers is useless at best).

    Sidebar list of weekly threads:  someone has to maintain it manually, and outdated information is worse than none.
    ```

      Re sidebar: I'm not suggesting the list of weekly threads is updated with links to the most recent one, just an announcement that there /is/ a weekly thread called X which is about ABC, so newcomers to the subreddit can know to wait a day or two to post to X, or run a quick search for the previous X threads, or the like.

  The Batman is a superhero whose power is to impart wisdom and build super-gear. His power only works if nobody knows about it, but at the same time it feeds off their fear of it.

  So he adopts a rich orphan kid and becomes his butler. He dresses the kid in memorable, bat-themed armour to avoid anyone consciously making the connection back to him, and sends him out to beat up bad guys.

  His power is useful not only for enhancing the hero, it's also useful for success in business. By imparting wisdom and producing super-equipment for the engineers at their firm, he's able to turn the kid (and himself) from millionaire to billionaire rather quickly.

  This only works when fueled by lots of bat-themed intimidation, so he has incentive to keep the kid active in his hobby. Some of that extra money is used to bribe villain actors to stage outlandish heists (which he is careful to prevent the hero from killing or seriously injuring by including a very strict code of ethics in the wisdom package). The police are also on payroll, of course, to prevent questions and so they will do things to enhance the brand, such as shining a Bat Signal on the clouds.
