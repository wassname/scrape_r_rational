This month we read Foucault's Pendulum, a book about some vanity publishers who decide to come up with their own conspiracy for fun, which they dub "The Plan". 

It comes about after a series of experiences with the occult leading some colleagues to develop crazier and crazier conspiracy theories, but they ultimately catch on. So much so that the protagonists end up caught up in it themselves, with disasterous consequences.

Posting Guidelines: We're trying to figure this out as we go, but here's my thoughts to start: if you just want to give your overall feelings, make a post. If you have "discussion questions" that you want to discuss in more depth (anything from philosophical discussions, writing tip requests, things that bugged you, etc), try making a dedicated subthread? We'll see how we like it!

Feedback: I'll make a [meta thread] in here that is intended for you to give me feedback for how I can do this better, or for what you particularly liked and want to make sure I don't change.

***NEXT MONTH'S BOOK***: 

**Title:** The Martian by Andy Weir

**Ebook cost:** ~$3.94 USD https://www.amazon.com/Martian-Novel-Andy-Weir-ebook/dp/B00EMXBDMA

**Word count:** 120k

**Genre:** Sci-fi

**Synopsis:** Astronaut Mark Watney gets left behind on Mars because of a freak dust storm, and must use nothing but his wits, knowledge of botany and engineering, and the limited resources he has available to him in order to survive long enough to return home. Features a movie adaptation directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon.

**Why /r/rational would like it:** It was originally written as a web serial, and is one of the most grounded and realistic mainstream science-fiction books ever written. My only worry in recommending it here is that most people on this sub will have already read it---it's a perfect fit otherwise. Also, I think following it up with a discussion of the movie would be interesting, as it's one of the few pieces of real rational fiction that has a movie adaptation (only other one I can name now is Arrival).

**No content warnings.**

Next month's discussion will start on or about the 14th of November. These dates vary slightly based on my own personal schedule and I also try not to post them on the same day as a weekly thread.

  What's the most unbelievable conspiracy, coincidence, or general story that is true as far as you know?

    This murder is pretty interesting: http://unsolvedmysteries.wikia.com/wiki/Dorothy_Donovan

    Basically, a guy (Charles) picks up a hitchhiker, agreeing to take him only a certain distance. When Charles tries to drop the hitchhiker off, the hitchhiker attacks him with a screwdriver demanding his money and truck. Charles manages to drive off unharmed, leaving the stranger behind.

    He goes to his house and sees the stranger lurking around, finds a pay phone to call the police, police come with him to the house, sees nothing's been stolen but Charles's mother is dead. 

    At first Charles was considered the suspect because the hitchhiker story was ridiculous, but Charles was ultimately cleared with evidence of a stranger was found.

    The murderer/hitchhiker ultimately confessed after being connected with DNA and said he chose Charles's house because it was the first one he saw with no lights and he was looking for a place to sleep.

    So the hitchhiker happening to murder Charles's mother out of all the houses in the local area is quite a shocking coincidence.

      With the benefit of hindsight, it makes sense that Charles would choose to drop off the hitchhiker shortly before getting to his house, and makes sense that the lights would be off if only Charles' elderly mother was home.
      ```

  I'm a bit late with this one, but as with the last one, I'd like to opine on the single most impressive aspect of this book. The general concept is kind of neat. Conspiracy theories becoming real offers space for a lot of self-doubt as the characters have to wonder whether they're just getting paranoid for no reason. But it's not why I thought this book was great.

  In my opinion, the greatest part of this book (and its single most marketable feature in the circles I move in) is the characters' use of a computer to procedurally generate conspiracy theories *in a book written in the eighties*. That's visionary as heck, and Umberto Eco isn't even a scifi writer!

  Similar concepts are explored in *Unsong* (of course) as well as *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*. There's no denying the age difference between those books, though.

  Which raises the question: is being visionary a positive attribute of a book by itself? When comparing, for example, Bruce Sterling's *Schismatrix* with Charles Stross' *Accelerando*, I'm tempted to say no. Sterling was first, and he clearly offered the foundation for what Stross would later write, but to me, *Schismatrix* pales in comparison to *Accelerando* partly because the latter work iterates on the ideas of the former and offers a deeper, more complex view of the same themes. Culture marches on (known on TvTropes as "Seinfeld is unfunny").

  A work needs to have some amount of popularity to have an impact on culture. Those visionaries who have not only the short-lived popularity to be recognized, but also the staying power to be interesting *after* others have iterated on their ideas are exceptional in their own way, and that's the category I would put Foucault's Pendulum into.

  ```
  [HYPE FOR NEXT MONTH'S BOOK THREAD] This thread is for comments about next month's book - please don't go into discussion (save it for next month), but suggest themes or discussion questions we could post, talk about the best price for an ebook, get people to sell the book to you, etc.
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    I found *The Martian* really easy to read - took about 3 or 4 days the first time. The movie is also very similar to the book so if you want to "cheat" and just watch the film, then you'd be able to do well out of it.
