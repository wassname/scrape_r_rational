## What other rational web serials would people like to see an audiobook version of?

### Post:

I am a professional narrator currently releasing Mother of Learning as a free audiobook via podcast and YouTube. What other web serials would you like to see an audio version of?

  I would enjoy seeing a Pokémon Origin of Species as the previous audio guy hasn't updated in about a year.

  Also, if you start a second project I would take that opertunity to use that as a multiplier for your Patreon. I am not a very strong reader (and am way too busy on top of that), so thanks for making recordings of my favorite genre.

  [Mother of Learning](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning) is a good choice. I'd love to hear [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) as well, but it is extremely long.

    I'm already 25 chapters into MoL:

      Are there any graphic sex scenes in WtC? I try to avoid these in my work so it's suitiable for all ages.
      ```

      - u/MagmaDrago:
        ```
        There are a couple of sex scenes but nothing much graphic.
        ```

    ```
    How do narrators deal with litRPGs? I know they exist but I've never tried any. I feel like the game interface is cumbersome in audio format (despite WtC having very little relative to other litRPGs).
    ```

    - u/JackVoraces:
      ```
      If done several litrpg on audible. If there's loads of stats the author and I cut them down to make it more palatable for audio. 

      For the other stuff I add an electronic effect to my voice when I read out the system stuff.

  Ra, for sure!

    Nice, Ill look into that one. Ideally, a male protagonist would be better as I myself am a dude.

  ```
  For my money, I'd love to see you double down on the MoL backlog rather than splitting your attention again.
  ```

  - u/JackVoraces:
    ```
    This is fair. I guess I was thinking of a project I would edit myself. MoL is produced to an Audible standard and so has a large cost to it. Otherwise I would release 3 a week
    ```

- u/Low_Hour:
  ```
  [Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/summary/)
  ```

  - u/JackVoraces:
    ```
    I asked the author about this a while back but they want to make sure the rites are safe for publishing later.
    ```

    - u/DreamlandCitizen:
      ```
      The sacred rites must be respected.
      ```

      - u/JackVoraces:
        ```
        Haha Haha *rights. I read for a living... Can't spell.
        ```

  I would say Worth the Candle but, IIRC, AlexanderWales is tentative to do an audiobook. You could do another of his books, though---I don't know if he feels the same way for Shadows of the Limelight since it's not so personal to him.

  The Waves Arisen would be good, if you wanted to do fanfiction, but Wertifloke disappeared off the face of the planet after publishing it, and definitely wasn't Eliezer Yudkowsky the entire time.

- u/Retbull:
  ```
  Not sure how rational it is because the MC starts out pretty dumb but Super Minion on RR is pretty funny and has a sexless MC who looks like a guy for much of the book.
  ```

  - u/JackVoraces:
    ```
    This is a great book and was one I was considering.
    ```

    - u/Retbull:
      ```
      If nothing else pops up I'd appreciate it.
      ```

- u/Peragot:
  ```
  Worth the Candle would be beyond amazing.
  ```

- u/Kuratius:
  ```
  Do you count fanfiction?
  [Man off the Moon](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/man-off-the-moon-fate-extra-x-mass-effect.641011/) 
  Skip the first chapter, probably.
  ```

  I’m guessing you won’t want to, but [The Rise And Fall Of The Dark Lord Sassaflash](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/93572/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-dark-lord-sassaflash) is a completed My Little Pony fanfiction featuring a rationalist protagonist going up against a Lovecraftian horror. The ending >!reminds me of HPMOR’s shenanigans!<.

  Pact by Wildbow, it's \~960,000 words and is his shortest web serial.
  ```

  - u/BadSpeiling:
    ```
    It is already being made into an audiobook by a fan: http://68.183.146.93/?page_id=517&preview=true

    ```
    Shortest web serial...

    Twice the size of LOTR...

    &nbsp;

    Why are so many web serial authors so long-winded. *Schrijven is schrappen!*
    ```

    - u/Fresh_C:
      ```
      I'm guessing here, but I think it's because they have a release format which rewards continual output over conciseness. It's more important to consistently get out content than it is to sit back and ask "Do I really need to add in the events of this arc/chapter in order to tell the complete story I intend to tell?" Because unlike traditional stories, your readership is likely to drop if you don't put out chapters quickly enough. So You don't have time to make things perfect and plan things out so that all the unnecessary bits get cut.

      Also I think some of the authors don't always know where there story is going to end as they're writing it, so they just keep writing the logical progression of what would happen next until they feel like they've basically written everything that this particular mix of characters/setting will allow for.
      ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        On top of that, quite a few web authors offer bonus chapters as Patreon incentives. Wildbow did that with interludes IIRC, which is why there's so many of them and most don't actually advance the story.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Wildbow has actually switched away from writing donation interludes, starting with Pact. Instead he writes an extra normal chapter each week---the same stuff he would normally write, just a couple days earlier and in addition to his normally scheduled chapters.
          ```
