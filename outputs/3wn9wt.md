- u/Chronophilia:
  ```
  How do you pronounce "Special Agent Cristal", and is it audibly different from "Special Agent Crystal"?

  Also, does Garnet have the Doctor's psychic paper, or does she just carry a forged FBI badge around in case she needs it?
  ```

  - u/mhd-hbd:
    ```
    Cristal is homophone of 'crystal.'

    As for where she got a badge: same place she gets her swimming goggles.
    ```
