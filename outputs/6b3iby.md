For those who don't know what this is about:

  Huh. It's from the author of *[CORDYCEPS: Too clever for their own good](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4c24f8/hsfc_cordyceps_too_clever_for_their_own_good/)*. I advice mentioning it when reposting the story to better advertise it.

  I do love this story, mostly because looks at all the weird stuff happening in Overwatch and tries to actually explain it. It's awesome, especially Angela's character and how well she's been written (even though she's rarely the POV character). T

  The only complaint I can possible think of is actually pretty unreasonable, because it's about my favorite character in the game.  I kind of feel like Winston, being a super-intelligent gorilla from the moon who has built shield generators and rocket packs, and done a a considerable amount of work on Athena (I'm not sure if he designed her, or just helped keep updating her) should be a bit smarter?
  So far he's worked wonderfully as a short of quasi rational viewer stand in that helps explore the setting and characters, but I can't help but hope Winston gets to show off his own intellectual chops soon enough.
