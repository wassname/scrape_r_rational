  Interesting chapter, good to know specifically the time limit for the memory package. I hope Zorian will focus on that from now on. 

  His motivations for avoiding Zack make sense, but I can't wait for them to go all out again the invaders. That battle will be epic!

  Seems like we're heading towards a pretty lengthy timeskip. Zorian confirmed in this chapter that he's not going to meet with Zach until he finishes his projects, and he seems to have a lot on his plate at the moment. Golems, Xvim, study group, Tavin's suggestions, aranea treasury/secret research, making friends with everyone in his class and mind training. 

  I think we're going to get a skip of about a dozen restarts, which is when Zorian will feel comfortable enough to meet up with Zach. Either way, it feels like this arc will come to a close soon. 

  Prediction: Similar to how the first arc closed off on a climactic note and with Zorian leaving Cyoria, I think the same thing will happen again. Either Zach tries to attack Zorian (thinks he's Red Robe), something major in the mind packet or Red Robe discovers Zorian's identity. After that, we get Zorian traveling again, but on a far greater range (the Highlands, the other continent, Silverlake). This is were we will start getting answers.

    I also bet that before the meeting with Zach, he'll try some time dilation training and maybe go all Zach to get there. 

    Next up of mother of learning: answers.

        >The logistics of time dilation are much more complex than people usually posit, though. I cringe every time someone write in a scene where a character spends a few months in their personal dimension (double cringe if they spend all those months alone; how are they not insane by the end?) like it's nothing. Later, when Zorian actually gains the capabilities to do that, I intend to explain why Zorian can't just casually abuse that idea.

          Hmm... I guess I follow the social deprivation issue, but is time dilation really that bad?

            Think no internet and no access to supermarkets for months on end. You probably only have what you take in with you, and no access to information and entertainment you don't already have.

              The problem of inflow of resources for sustaining oneself is greatly mitigated by both magic existing in his world and the fact that he can afford to spend big money on said resources because he’ll get them back with the next reset anyway.

              And regarding the social deprivation: being alone for just several weeks shouldn’t be that bad — he could make a pattern of dilated and normal stripes of time in the same reset.

              And information can be brought in via books that he needed studying in the first place.
              ```

              - u/elevul:
                ```
                Agreed,  it definitely doesn't seem like there are big downsides to it that cannot be managed.
                ```

                ```
                Time dilation may not be simple enough they can start and stop it all the time, it may be that once you turn it on it runs its course. 

                If he has to sneak/break in, he may be limited to what he can carry, or what's already there, if that. I'm pretty sure even his book conjuring spell requires him to know the contents of the books first too. Without knowing the set up, we can't really know, and I'm sure the author will tailor it to make it too difficult.

                  I’d at least expect Zorian to investigate in this direction first, because it’s clearly one of the unique options he’s got for getting an upper hand over other loopers. Actually, I had this passive expectation for him from the chapter in which time dilation mechanics were off-handedly described, and seeing [that quote](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3s26r9/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_44_a_show_of/cwtn0i6) was a bit disappointing for me.

                  Yeah, he’ll define the background rules of his world in a way to support his opinion on the matter, even if it *is* possible to profit from this ability in many other worlds. I am not even saying that using such an ability wouldn’t rise any problems at all, but, at least to me, those would be *interesting* problems to solve. 

                  Eh, I guess MoL’s author has other interests to share.

                    He has definitely expressed an interest, but we don't know where it really ranks comparatively. He's had to concentrate on accessing the memory packet since before he knew there was a time dilation room, and almost exactly since he found out there was anything there from the Matriarch's message in the first place. Obviously he has to put the memory packet above all else at this point as well, if he ever wants to access it. Plus the memory packet itself might change his plans completely.

                    In fact, considering the way the chapter ended, I think we might see him list out what his priorities are after he accesses the memory packet.

              I assumed he would use it to sleep and get more time on his projects.

              - u/Sceptically:
                ```
                You're assuming he can come and go freely from the time dilation field, which seems unduly optimistic. I suspect once per restart is likely to be what he can manage, with some effort.

  I saw this first literally seconds after it turned up on gmail. You posted this fast.

  This feels like a very long month. Not too much happening.

  - u/Green0Photon:
    ```
    Lol get wrecked. I had "[RT] [HF] Mother of Learning Chapter 44: " and the link that it would be pasted into reddit and everything. I didn't paste it five seconds earlier because I got it on gmail instead of refreshing.

    This story is great, but yeah, the last couple of chapters have not had much revelations but a lot of new "activities". It's setup for either the next couple of chapters with the packet, Taiven's suggestions, Fighting Squad, etc.. Much excite!

    He's been hitting his target date for a long while now. It's a shame he doesn't post every 2 weeks though.
    ```

    - u/Arch121:
      ```
      Nah, no need to rush him.  His series is the only series where I squeal like a little girl when I find the chapters posted.  At the same time though, I want him to take his time and not feel pressured or anything at all.  Posting every 2 weeks might lower the quality of his work.  He is a fantastic author but having that extra week may be really helpful.

        At ~600 bucks for each chapter on patreon, I'm impressed he doesn't try to write more.

        - u/None:
          ```
          Because he cares about quality, which would probably drop, has other duties, might be also working on other upcoming projects,... ?

    He's been posting every three weeks for a while now.

  As great as this story is, I was a little dissapointed that we didnt get any more emotional reactions/development in this part. I understand how much this story is the "anti-relationship", trying to make its plot the focus as opposed to a vessel for character drama, but Tavien and Zorian have a complicated enough history that I expected Zorian to actually feel things and care about this situation beyond the tactical. Its not bad at all (and he does have some emotional moments) but it still frustrates me.
