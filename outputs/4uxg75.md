### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4sq04k/biweekly_challenge_happy_stories/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Happy Stories". The winner (and sole entrant) was /u/Kishoto with their story, [My Promise](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4sq04k/biweekly_challenge_happy_stories/d5huty2). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/Kishoto!

##### This Time

This time, we'll be doing "Superheroes". Pick your favorite universe or franchise to riff on, or make up a hero of your own. This is a great time to write some fanfic. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, August 10th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, we'll be doing ["Black and White Morality"](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality). Write a story about pure good and ultimate evil. You are entirely welcome to do a subversion of the prompt, so long as you're rotating around that theme. If you can write a recognizably rational story which is about unambiguous good and evil (in contravention of the sidebar rule), more power to you.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 8/10.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4uy79d/challenge_companion_superheroes/).

    Very enjoyable. I'm not fully caught up on The Maker's Ark but I'm glad I didn't need to be to grasp the story. A very good read.

    Lol, I've had similar thoughts whenever I see storylines where the public/mortals protest superheroes. Who's going to deal with the supervillains now? Like, it's never made sense to me. Authors try and justify it with claims of property damage, vigilantism, etc. but does any of that matter when Darkseid shows up? When the Joker holds the Mayor hostage? When Doctor Doom launches an assault that no conventional military can combat?

      Yeah. I was put in the same frame of mind by the recent captain america avenger's film. I mean, yes, the avenger's actions killed a couple people, but in the first avengers film they were about to resort to a nuclear warhead before that, in the second under 100 (I think) died from what was supposed to be an extinction level event. It seems like a really bad idea. I've never really seen a story make someone confront that to my memory. What happens after you ban superheroes and Darkseid comes to slay?

      Metropoliton man made me want an ending like that too.
