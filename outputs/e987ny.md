## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I've been thinking about time loop stories lately, and I think I have one that I haven't seen too much in other places: a time loop that only exists in a defined volume of space, such that the loop keep happening in this one place, but the rest of the world keeps going. There are a few benefits to this scheme, from a writing perspective:

  * You keep things confined to a single place, which is helpful because it allows deep exploration rather than broad exploration (one of the great things that *Groundhog Day* did was to at least give the illusion of going wide, which wouldn't have been possible if it had been set in, say, Pittsburgh).
  * You naturally allow things and people to enter into the loop, if not to retain their memories through the loop, which can help shake up the story, and is already a staple of time loop stories.
  * You put some kind of time pressure on the looper, which helps to maintain tension.

  The way I'm conceiving of it now, the looped area presents as a bubble, and anything that passes through that skin gets put into the loop at the same time and location through all loops. In other words, if you enter the loop by traveling through the skin at hour fifteen, then every time the loop hits hour fifteen, you'll enter it again, with the same body and memories as you had the first time around (barring some way to keep memories?).

  (The skin of the bubble has to account for thermodynamics in some way, since if light can get into the bubble, then in the second loop through, the light is essentially doubled, if light can't get through, it's dark, and if light can get through but isn't doubled, then the loop will have variable daylight, which changes the nature of the loop pretty significantly. Similarly, we wouldn't want a looping space that allows outside rainfall to enter the loop, because every loop would have multiple rainfalls coming in at once after enough days of clouds passing over.)

  In terms of narrative structure, I think that a lot of time loop stories really struggle with the front-loaded nature of it, as the early part is naturally more compelling than the later parts where mastery has been achieved and there's not that much to worry about; it's a problem with a lot of stories where the inciting incident doesn't so much set things in motion as establish a new order of the world that has to be explored and figured out.

  For story pitches with this premise, I like the idea of a small team of explorers going in, only to realize (somehow) that they're on their hundredth time in the loop, an idea that I think could carry a story. Alternately, a looper who retains memories fighting against an outside government or entity that keeps sending in more and more agents, which would make for an interesting asymmetry (if you could establish win/loss conditions).

    The Adventure Zone (dnd podcast) “13th Hour” arc had a time loop that was confined to a mining town. People who entered after the loop started didn’t forget anything, I think, and I think it saved them from dying?

    The most interesting thing I've done with a Time Loop story recently is put a role playing game in one.  The players began as low level people living their lives, and then a great disaster unfolded.  They had limited visibility into what was going down, and were far too insignficant to stop it.

    After this, they encountered the looping mechanism, got a minor power up, got sent back to the start.

    They know how many loops they have, and how much they will power up after each loop.  They know the victory and loss conditions, and they have essentially complete freedom to wander around causing trouble within the loop.

    It has been a lot of fun so far.  The players seem really into this premise.  I feel like someone ought to make a module out of it for a popular RPG system.

  There was some worldbuilding and thought experimenting going on over in the litrpg subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/litrpg/comments/e9p3rg/how_do_make_love_to_a_cannibal_life_must_be_scary/

  litrpg stories seem like they would be a good mix with the rational genre, though in practice they mostly fall short in all the normal ways that fantasy stories fall short.

  I do like that most litrpg systems at least *try* to set out a world with consistent rules and magic.

  What internal problems / inconsistencies / munchkin opportunities do you see from a litrpg type world where experience / power is gained from killing things.

    It could be a source of conflict. If those who kill the most, go the farthest and are the most powerful, then maybe there's a lot of powerful villains at the top.
