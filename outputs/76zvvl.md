  So I preordered this book on Amazon and it just came out today.

  [Here's](http://www.smbc-comics.com/) a link to today's announcement of the book on SMBC.

  [Here's](https://smbc-comics.com/soonish/) a link to the webpage about the book.

  Here's a list of the chapter titles to let people know what's in the book:

  > 1. INTRODUCTION: *Soonish: Emphasis on the* Ish

  > 2. CHEAP ACCESS TO SPACE: *The Final Frontier Is Too Damn Expensive*

  > 3. ASTEROID MINING: *Rummaging Through the Solar System's Junkyard*

  > 4. FUSION POWER: *It Powers the Sun, and That's Nice, but Can It Run My Toaster?*

  > 5. PROGRAMMABLE MATTER: *What If All of Your Stuff Could Be Any of Your Stuff?*

  > 6. ROBOTIC CONSTRUCTION: *Build Me a Rumpus Room, Metal Servant!*

  > 7. AUGMENTED REALITY: *An Alternative to Fixing Reality*

  > 8. SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: *Kind of Like Frankenstein, Except the Monster Spends the Whole Book Dutifully Making Medicine and Industrial Inputs*

  > 9. PRECISION MEDICINE: *Everything That's Wrong with You in Particularâ€”a Statistical Approach*

  > 10. BIOPRINTING: *Why Stop at Seven Margaritas When You Can Just Print a New Liver?*

  > 11. BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES: *Because After Four Billion Years of Evolution You Still Can't Remember Where You Put Your Keys*

  > 12. CONCLUSION: *Less Soonisher, or The Graveyard of Lost Chapters*

  From my first skim through, it reads a lot like a funny pop-science book than anything more advanced. It crams a lot of scientific knowledge into the book, but albeit in a way to make it easy to speed through the book (with a few comics sprinkled in for a laugh or two). It feels like the book is meant to bring awareness of incredible new technologies to the public's attention in an effort to better handle the development of such technologies.

  Here's a joke from the book about the frontal cortex: 

  > "But why would evolution put my personality in the least-protected part of my brain?"

  > "Because the fact that you're a warm body is doing a *lot* more for your reproductive chances."
