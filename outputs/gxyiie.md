## I found a story called Jipi and the Paranoid Chip reccomend somewhere else and thought it might have a place here.

### Post:

An interesting short story about negotiation set in the near future. It's rather nice and I like how it's about AI but not about superintelligences which is an oddity for here. The premise requires a series of stupid mistakes and ideas on the part of a range of people but such things are quite frequent.

  Nice story. It is curious how the older stories (Asimov, this one) like to think of robots as slightly dumber more alien versions of us. 

  Iâ€™m not sure why you would want to attach a bomb to a system which was designed to minimize false-positives at the expense of false-negatives though... It seems like a good way to blow yourself up.

    I don't think it's that curious. That's still ahead of where AI is today, and given the rate of growth of technology it is not surprising that science fiction writers of 20-50 years ago went in that direction. The idea of "a superintelligent AI is inevitably going to kill all of us unless we are preemptively paranoid" is a relatively new phenomenon, and the, shall we say, over-abundance of that attitude is relatively limited.

  Clearly this entire short story is a deception to fool me into thinking Neal Stephenson exists.

  Fun little read! I am convinced that Jipi is also an AI instance that is part of an evolution to defuse paranoid schizophrenics and/or combat previously-evolved security AIs
