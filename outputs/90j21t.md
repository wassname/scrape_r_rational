  Do you mind posting why you think this is a good fit for this subreddit? Because at first glance it just looks like a romance story which is rare for this community.

    The two involved are talented criminal investigayors, which make rational deductions based on given data to solve crime.

    In addition, they behave like reasonable adults and begin their relationship in a way that put me off guard, since I'm used to the instant teenage crush and drama.

    Situations and psychological afflictions make sense.

    Basically, it's like a more down to earth Sherlock Holmes, while instead of constant pressure and tension, we have romance.

    Not that action and tension do not exist, but romance is the focus.

    Is that sufficient reason to include this in the sub?

      I've heard worse reasons. Where does the snail come in?

        No idea. No snail mentioned in the novel.

          Snails pace: slow to trust/open up.
