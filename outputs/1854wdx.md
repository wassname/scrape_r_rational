## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I just want to recommend The Scholomance. It's a book series that contains an extremely well thought out world, with a very fun mystery in the form of trying to understand that world through the lens of the extremely unreliable narrator which is our protagonist
  ```

    People are being oddly reluctant to second this, so I’m going to balance that out with some straight-up gushing. I loved these books. The way they’re written is *weirdly enthralling*, in a way that makes me super envious of the author’s prose abilities. The characters are fun and basically decent at heart, and their arcs toward becoming better people feel compelling. The infodumpy asides that some people complain about are actually really nice, and they enhance the main narrative rather than feeling awkward. It feels very natural for a conversation about maintenance shafts to turn into a few paragraphs about the time that cafeteria upgrades were brought in by a few hundred combat golems with flame throwers, with a heavy student death toll that was predicted to be outweighed by the long-term reduction in malnutrition, for example.

    This is neither recommendation of disrecommendation, just a warning and my personal perspective. 


    Well I read the trilogy. The writing is clearly skillful though it is certainly unique with frequent infodumps mainly at beginning and the a clearly unreliable narrator. 


    As a whole I would call it rational imitating, it is clearly thought out and mostly internally consistent especially in earlier books, but *everything* serves the plot first no matter the necessary contortions.


    I am not going into spoilers here *much*. This is entirely seriously not a story to read if you do not care for *any* of the following:


    * massive cliffhangers basically destroying the books as self contained tales 


    * *unreasonable* amounts of emotional manipulation of the reader


    * horror in measured but ultimately considerable quantities >!existential/body horror!<


    Also amplified considerably in later books.


    I find the philosophy of *balance*  ultimately in the same ballpark as the concept as a zero sum game and the story takes it very far. Though to be fair it seems self conscious about it.


    And *now* some spoilers:

    >!I think the story takes the importance and lore significance of localized self interest too far boiling over into parody.
    There is suffering so make some suffering to alleviate some suffering to make ultimately more suffering is taken in my opinion *too* far. How has this whole dimension did not collapse into an equivalent of a black hole already? Also why it took however many millennia of unimaginable suffering for *some* effective counterbalance to appear? Fine, ramp-up and all but still.!<

      > massive cliffhangers basically destroying the books as self contained tales

      There are indeed some nasty cliffhangers at the ends of the first and second books, but this is mitigated by the whole trilogy being finished. (Waiting for the third book to come out was pretty annoying, mind you, but the wait is over.)

      > I find the philosophy of balance ultimately in the same ballpark as the concept as a zero sum game and the story takes it very far. Though to be fair it seems self conscious about it.

      It's made clear that if you munchkin the magical balance thing, you can get big wins for everyone. One of the fun revelations in the third book – and I'm saying this vaguely so it won't constitute spoilers – is that the exceptional nature of the current generation is a result of several previous generations of clever, well-meaning wizards doing exactly that.

    Anyone second this? I've heard mostly negative talk about this series, mainly about "trying to ape HP too much", having an annoying and unlikable protagonist, and the authors prose being dense and meandering.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Yeah sure! Its a fun read, some annoying number inconsistencies, but firmly in the shelf-space of "honorary rat!fic", eg. getting the big stuff right. 

      Also of note, there was a glowfic literary megaevent about it! All the authors came together and pushed their poor characters into the scholomance to scheme and wheel and deal and die horribly. Never in the history of literature have there been so many teenagers trying earnestly to safe the world with decision theory and bistable equilibria and ethics!

    - u/TaoGaming:
      ```
      It's .... OK. I read it because it was supposed to deconstruct the entire "Why would mages be poor" AND "why would you send your kids to a dangerous magical school?" 

      The answers are reasonable, but the magic and monster system is just "whatever I need at the plot for the time."

      I agree that the protagonist (and love interest) are not particularly compelling.
      ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      It has its highs and its lows. I enjoyed it, overall, but by the end I had this gnawing feeling that the worldbuilding was eating itself. That the world, even beyond the Scholomance, was tiny and cannibalistic. Everything has to be connected, and the magic system doesn't leave room for 'reality' to be part of it. It feels claustrophobic in a way that I don't think was all the way intentional.
      ```

      ```
      FWIW I very much enjoyed it, but not entirely sure I'd file it as rational, especially the later books.

  I would like to recommend On Foreign Soils We Die, which is a military fantasy/LitRPG. The premise is basically that people from another world (Earth) are called “Travelers” that get all the bonuses from being a summoned hero. Because of this, the human nation summons them in mass, and uses them as strategic weapons.


  In the story we don’t follow the humans, we follow their enemies who are Dragonborn (in the classic D&D sense), and are fighting to survive with WWII equivalent technology. The Dragonborn don’t really get levels because of their new technology, so to kill Travelers that have 50+ levels on them the Dragonborn have to fight smart. I don’t want to spoil too much, but I think if you like military fantasy/sci-fi, and you’re looking for something good I highly recommend it.

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    I read up to ch 15, and my feeling so far is "meh". From a technical perspective, it's good stuff. Writing is tight, prose good, etc, but it just reads like a continuous WWII war movie action scene with occasional litrpg interrupts and magic. 

    I'd prefer it if it had more plot, character, or actual things happen, and while the writing is good and effectively puts me in the boots of a random faux-WWII grunt, so far this just isn't a compelling story.

    It also doesn't really line up with what's in the synopsis: it promises a story focusing on some sort of commando raid infiltration mission, which leads me to believe that all I've read so far (the first 15 chapters) is just prologue!?

    Additionally, I'm not the fan the multiple-protagonist approach, which so far has mostly just been vignette perspectives from the evil human Earthlings. I don't really feel like they add anything--they're just evil or otherwise disturbed. These short perspective jumps mainly make me wonder about what the fuck is going on and why they are so evil, but beyond >!one of the Travelers thinking about how he strategically kills all those who aren't carnage fetishists to make sure everyone falls in line!<, there hasn't been any nuance. 

    This would be fine if they were a faceless enemy. If we only ever see the "Travelers" from the distant perspective of the Drakes, this is fine. However, by giving us that third-person-omnicient peek into the noggins of the humans, the author opens up a whole new can of worms and weakens one of the primary questions that they could otherwise tease and draw in the reader with. Instead we find out that the answer to "why do the Earth humans do this" is just "because they're evil shitstains" and that's just boring. Sure, it can be followed up with a "why?" question, but again, I feel that this really diffuses the focus of the story.

      This is my feeling too. It's not bad enough that I regret trying it, but it's not really good enough to get me to read it over other stuff I'm interested in. The premise is cool, but the execution doesn't quite grab me.

    Could you give me a rundown on Ave Xia Rem Y? I've tried the first few chapters and bounced off it, even tho it felt like something I might enjoy.

    What's your impression of it?
    ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      Ave Xia Rem Y is a little hard for me to sum up.  The main character has such an earnestness about him that goes all the way to his core.  He could easily go the "arrogant young master" route (and in a certain view he definitely is that), but that isn't what happens.

      The story is about ideals like justice, even in the face of overwhelming adversity.  It is about a ***PURPOSE***, serving a cause higher than yourself.

      It is about the love of a father for his son, and a teacher's love for his pupil, and wanting the best for the son / pupil. Even when "what is best" is definitely not remotely nice, and is in fact quite perilous.

      It is about unyielding loyalty. About faith in a really good and moral leader.

      It is about redemption, even for the most heinous of crimes. For even the worst mistakes. It is about the times when redemption isn't possible or permissible.

      ----------------

      > I've tried the first few chapters and bounced off it, even tho it felt like something I might enjoy.

      You've only scratched the surface of the prologue (which itself is the length of a book), and haven't gotten into the main story yet.

      The story overall seems like a typical xianxia power fantasy, and while the MC eventually is able to punch far above his weight class (cultivation level) he is still very far away from the top of the food chain.

      ------------

      I still don't know how to sum it up. It feels very well written to me.  It seems to be going somewhere, and it has a reason to get there. And I'm along for the ride.

          If you've bounced off, it might help to know that the narration and dialogue changes strongly over time.

          As the MC grows from a small child, the narration increases in complexity. The MC also develops a dry, witty sense of humor that I enjoy.

  I'd like to recommend Mage Tank on royal road: [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/76463/mage-tank](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/76463/mage-tank).

  Here's the blurb:

  >After being killed by a high-velocity tree-hug, Arlo is transported to a new world of skills, stats, and levels where those brave and talented enough to conquer ancient Delves are rewarded with incredible supernatural power. Unfortunately for Arlo, there is no tutorial, and he is immediately forced to tackle a Delve set to the highest difficulty with a party of adventurers who are not only strangers to him, but strangers to each other as well. Arlo has no armor, no weapons, no knowledge of the world at large, and his party is growing increasingly suspicious of his lack of preparation and paper-thin excuses for how he got there.  
  >  
  >There's also the fact that the System seems to be treating Arlo's situation like a big, cosmic joke.  
  >  
  >Determined not to die again, Arlo forgoes putting any points into his highest stat, Intelligence, and instead dumps everything he's got into Fortitude. After all, who needs equipment or fighting skills when you can eat fireballs for breakfast and still ask for more hot sauce?  
  >  
  >Mage Tank is a comedic LitRPG adventure set in an epic fantasy world that is rapidly evolving as new and powerful secrets of the Delves are uncovered. There are strong horror themes, graphic violence, overindulgent use of naughty language, and poorly constructed jokes. Mage Tank features slow progression and intelligent characters who spend time making intentional build choices. It’s not action all-the-time, but Arlo’s life is replete with danger and, more importantly, consequences.

  The main character Arlo is smart, and just like generally a mature adult? It's nice. The system is well crafted and firmly embedded in society, and Arlo's build is pretty novel. It's not super deep or anything, but it's good fun. Check it out!

    I read this (up to what's available) and it's a fun read. 

    It makes me wish for more "mature adult" protagonists, as it's refreshing to read about a 30-something protagonist who generally has their shit together and is, ya know, generally competent at things. Very refreshing compared to the glut of younger protagonists that inhabit the webfiction and specifically litrpg space.

    Sincerely very good, thank you for recommending it. It was a very fun read.

    The main character is genuinely likeable and easy to root for. There's a bunch of power fantasy, but it doesn't cross the boundary between satisfying and cringeworthy. 

    It does feel a fair bit unearned and as if the protagonists' advantages are a part of the world *purely* so that he, specifically, can benefit from them. But it's not at all a showstopper. (And it is *very* hard to make a genuine weak->strong progression feel earned, especially in such a short time.)

    Notably, the world genuinely seems quite interesting and unusual, definitely quite unlike the usual fantasy or isekai fare. There's cliches as tropes, but it all has a neat twist to it, and feels as if at least some thought was put into it beyond the basics.

    On a side note, I think the author took quite a bit of inspiration from Delve, in a good way. 

    "Not super deep or anything, but good fun" is a great description.

  ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    I have *very* mixed feelings about Marked for Death. For one thing, I've been occasionally posting/lurking in the thread since at least 2016, and the quest has been running since December 2015. So I've been watching it a long time, and the quest has been *running* a long time with regular updates all the while. Usually 2-3 times per week. There's a lot of content there to sink your teeth into at over 3 million words of story, and almost ten thousand pages of discussion!

    Not only does the quest have a huge backlog to enjoy, it has an overall high writing quality, complex characters, great worldbuilding, and a winding plot. The quest is explicitly rational, so the GMs make a point to strive for internal consistency and logical actions and consequences. It's truly one of the highest-quality quests out there, in my opinion.

    But at the same time... I've had to step away from reading the quest, personally, for the sake of my mental health. If I read it, I get invested, and, well... The quest has a habit of pulling the rug out from under you, so to say. 

    Sometimes it's because the posters accidentally do something without considering the full consequences or the reactions of the other characters (which can happen, since trying to make decisions by committee is *hard*). Sometimes shit just happens because the world is rational, and stuff goes on in the background without the viewpoint characters observing it, since *that's what would realistically happen.* Rarely, the thread just goes 100% wtf and votes for something absolutely moronic (long-time readers know *exactly* what I'm referencing when I type Y____ S___).

    So characters can die suddenly, or the MC can make faux pas with little warning. The status quo can upend itself out of nowhere. The questers are often hypercompetent, coming up with novel solutions to problems (which feels amazing when it happens), but miscalculations (especially social ones) are felt heavily.

    To this day I have a fondness for the characters and the quest's story. But at the same time, the mistakes are felt so harshly and come often enough that I just can't read the story without ending up in an anxiety spiral. I actually clicked on your link and peeked at what the quest was up to nowadays, and I honestly regret it.

    So yeah. It's a fantastic quest with a lot to offer. If it wasn't, I wouldn't be invested enough in the characters to risk my depression flaring up when the thread makes a big mistake. Maybe if you read it you'll get a lot out of it. Maybe it won't be for you. So I'd recommend it with the caveat that it's not for everyone.

    This reply ended up being a bit of an essay. Sorry about that!

      Marked for death is exhausting. It does that thing that a lot of web serials (and TV dramas) do, where because of the serial format and the need to maintain reader engagement, BIG THINGS happen on a constant basis every few updates. Those things are often paradigm shifting, be that good or bad. One week the protagonist solves some super difficult problem and gets praised to heck by everyone. The next he deeply insults a diplomatic envoy and starts a war, getting his clan exiled from the village. The whiplash is quite severe, made worse by the fact that whenever I notice this problem in a web-serial, it instantly shatters my SoD. 

      Have you ever watched a drama show and realised that the protagonist has a horrible, awful, dramatic moment *every single episode* that drags everyone around them into some anxiety-filled, emotional event? In the real world if you had a friend like that, you'd drop them for being toxic and move on with your life, but no one in these sorts of stories ever even acknowledges it.

      Marked for death is like that. Things happen. Constantly. They're all individually interesting, but in aggregate, they're exhausting. Well, that's what it feels like for me, anyway. People *do* watch Dramas and are apparently capable of ignoring this sort of thing.

        Seriously, I read like 90 chapters of it, but eventually had to just... stop. The way that the characters would flip-flop between hypercompetent and totally insane was too much to handle. It felt like... the story has a tone, and the tone absolutely the fuck is not "realism", but instead is either "wacky comedy" or "gritty political thriller" at random.

          It's either wacky comedy, or gritty political thriller, or a treatise on the human experience of love, family, and relationships. It's pretty wild, but also very high effort which makes it impressive.

      How much Naruto knowledge do you need? I've read the entire manga, but the ending was so abysmal, my memory legit scrubbed itself from anything related. I can recall some basic worldbuilding stuff, but not the details.

        I don't think you really need all that much canon knowledge, honestly. Everything is different enough that relying on it will just get you in trouble more than  anything.

    MfD is a quest run by a bunch of people who have relatively clear and lucid ideas about what Naruto is and the kind of world it is, and the kind of worldbuilding required to make that world function and make any kind of logical sense (the power balance, reasoning and politics in particular are very well done).

    The questers are a bunch of people who generally don't have that kind of scope and/or understanding of the hellworld of child soldiers and ninja combat it is, focused on power/influence acquisition and (extremely dangerous in the setting) technology and/or jutsu hacking without thinking through the short or long term consequences of their actions. You know, standard tabletop stuff.

    So the player character comes across as schizophrenic, because over a few million words he has established himself as a character, with a network of relationships and politically precarious status, and the questers will frequently step on these things out of a lack of foresight, ambitions for how they could "totes hax the world of naruto because we thought of this and nobody else did", or a lack of respect for the way the world would react to such things. 

    The writing is solid, but following it is an exercise in exhaustion and frustration. It can come across as Twitch Plays Pokemon in its worst moments; months and months of patient work to accomplish something and then the questers will think of something stupid or react terribly to being put under pressure, pouring gasoline on the flames entirely by accident. If you're the sort to get invested in a story, the quest nature of this will make you lose your hair at the stupidity of the player character.

    At its best, it's probably the most, unfortunately, rational take on the Narutoverse. Yes, even more than Need to Become Stronger.  At its worst its a drawn out exercise in emotional abuse.

      This reminds me of the Nanoha/Worm crossover quest [Magical Girl Escalation Taylor](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/magical-girl-escalation-taylor-worm-nanoha.28074/). The writing was good and there were various clever/unusual plot twists. Many of the quest-original characters were very nicely done. However, some of the decisions made by the voters were ... painful.

  To make glowfic more well known, here two stories for their pure absurdity value. 

  Very low prereqs, for this one you only need to know that Carrissa comes from Cheliax on Golarion from the pathfinder setting, vaguely DND-esque high fantasy, wizards have spell slots. Asmodeus, deity of hell and tyranny, has shaped Cheliax' society for the last 100 years. 

  https://glowfic.com/posts/4103  "free will was a mistake"



  The other is "your stare was holding".  Pre-reqs are "for the taking": (summonable precisely bound demons with matter conjuration abilities!) https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809486 by Lintamande. 

  Most of the absurdity/fun is contained in the dialogue with Jacqueline, ~11 pages, thats the highlight of the story to me, and worth it as standalone, so I've linked directly to that (scroll to bottom):
