## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I would like to recommend "The World as it Appears to Be." It's an Overwatch fanfiction that hardens Overwatch's sci-fi. The dialogue and comedy are extremely good. It reminds me of Unsong in a lot of ways, and Unsong is my favorite novel.

  Also, I'm considering reading the Erogamer because I've heard very good things about it. However, I tend not to like smut because I prefer to separate business and pleasure. Is it still worth reading?

    >"The World as it Appears to Be."

    Is that this?  [https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149)
    ```

      Yes. Also, do you still call rational fic Yudkowskian? I don’t mean that as a criticism or weird status stuff, just a question.

      I think the term Yudkowskian is actually really useful for works that try to emulate HPMOR, e.g. Pokémon: The Origin of Species. But I think rational fiction is a large category, of which didactic RATIONALIST fiction is only a small subcategory. For example, I would describe Alexander Wales fiction as rational, but not rationalist.
      ```

      - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
        ```
        Heh.  "Yudkowskian" is a strange little term indeed, and I'm not sure it really means anything yet.  But to be sure, I'd lay stronger claim to rationalist fiction than "rational fic".
        ```

        - u/CringingInTheNight:
          ```
          Yeah. I remember in a previous thread where I searched for "Love, Interest" your use of the term in a 2017 Facebook post, and some random commenter being bothered by the "ego" of it, but I was curious about the term and decided to ask.

          For the record, my definition of rational fiction is pretty similar to the TVTropes one.
          ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    Seconding the rec for *The World as it Appears to Be*. Definitely my favorite OW fic. Although I liked *Cordyceps* and *Dave Scum* by the same author much more.

    Same as masterax2000, I wasn't aroused by any of the scenes in *Erogamer* and yet really liked it—at least in some part because of that. It starts off weaker than expected considering all the recommendations but quickly picks up steam and becomes downright amazing.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I would definitely say that the Erogamer is worth reading solely on its literary merits. Even if it is just graded as normal literature, it;s still an excellent story.
    ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    I think The World as it Appears to Be is the single most under read rational work given its quality.

    I genuinely feel like it belongs in the same tier as HPMOR, WtC, r!animorphs and Metropolitan Man.
    ```

    - u/tjhance:
      ```
      just read the first chapter and it *is* good so far
      ```

  - u/masterax2000:
    ```
    I personally found barely any of the sex scenes in the Erogamer to be titillating enough to actually get off to. Despite that, it's one of my all-time favorite pieces of literature. So yes, I would say it's very much still worth reading, even separated from it's pornographic appeal.
    ```

    - u/CringingInTheNight:
      ```
      Thank you! This is exactly what I wanted to hear. I didn't convey this in my statement, but I meant that I was hoping the sex was an un-arousing as possible, or at least skippable with respect to plot.
      ```

      - u/masterax2000:
        ```
        Ah... I didn't really mean that you can *skip* them per-say. You probably do need to at least skim most of the sex scenes to understand the story, it's just that said scenes have enough going on other than the sex most of the time that they're worth reading even if you don't get off to them.
        ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    That's the fic formerly known as...I forget, something like "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" but describing Mercy, right? Same author as Cordyceps?
    ```

    - u/notgreat:
      ```
      As mentioned in the author notes, it used to be "Angel, Valkyrie, Witch, Devil...". All of which are mercy skins ingame (default is angel)
      ```

      - u/VorpalAuroch:
        ```
        I don't see any links to it so I couldn't find the author notes
        ```

    - u/CringingInTheNight:
      ```
      Yes. It is extremely good.
      ```

  - u/lillarty:
    ```
    The World As It Appears To Be is very solid. Seconding this recommendation. 

    If you can stand reading a story in second-person it's probably worth it to read Erogamer. It's an instant disqualifier to me, like if the author decided to forgo punctuation; it doesn't matter how well the story is otherwise written, the syntax makes it unreadable.

  # The Traitor Baru Cormorant

  I just finished reading *The Traitor Baru Cormorant* by Seth Dickinson, and really enjoyed it. The MC, Baru Cormorant, is a child living on the island of Taranoke when it's annexed by the Imperial Republic of Falcrest. What follows is full on colonization, under the guise of "elevating" the simple islanders. Baru sees this happen, and knows that her people aren't strong or smart enough to fight the Empire, so does the only thing she can: she joins them.

  Her idea is to change the system from within, but in order to do that she needs power, and in order to get power she needs to prove she's useful and a good Imperial citizen. Which in turn her into a cog in the machine that helps perpetuate the system she hates.

  The story focuses a lot on the aspect of colonization. How it works, what the effect on the native people is, how it replaces culture with one that is "superior" and who benefits from it. The author definitely draws from historical examples; we see how diseases are imported by colonizers, how children are educated to forget their past, how pseudoscience racial theories are used, how money is used to subvert local rule, and how merchant and the military go hand in hand. It's very interesting, though a bit morbid, to watch this unfold on people who know what's happening but can't fight.

  The characters feel very real, each distinct with their own dreams and aspirations and flaws. The main character is constantly struggling, with herself and her actions and those around her. Being a young woman all on her own in a strange land, she has to survive using mainly her wits, unsure of who she can trust.

  The ending is something else. I didn't see it coming, but all I can say is >!it was painful. The book is aptly name, and Baru lives up to it.!<

  #Salvos

  *[Salvos](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37438/salvos)* by delta201 is a story about a demon child who is trying to figure out who she is and where she belongs. I've been reading Salvos for a while, and I'd very much recommend it. 

  The characters are definitely the strong point of of the story, but it's doesn't lose out in other aspects. We see character growth, both literally and metaphorically, and personally I just feel invested in Salvos, watching her grow and learn more about the world, who she is and how she fits in it.

  I can't really talk too much about worldbuilding - the demon world is described as bleak and basically a wasteland with literally nothing to see but rocks. The mortal world is well-described so far, but we haven't seen too much of it so far. What we have seen is consistent and well-described.

  The writing is well-done. I don't recall any problems, or grammatical/spelling problems.

  My personal take is that the story is very much about [self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization), and goes about it in a very literal way. Character progression is measured by evolution, where each evolution essentially "resets" the character in terms of [desires/needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) and immediate goals.

  The last few chapters have been especially good, with Salvos being thrown into the deep end and having to learn what it means to be a demon.
  ```

  - u/Judah77:
    ```
    Salvos is OK, like 3/5 stars and readable.  Dunno that I'd rec it though, as the story hasn't gone that far.  May check out Baru later.   

    Edit:  ordered vol 1 Baru from amazon, will get in a few weeks.
    ```

  - u/PM_ME_CUTE_FOXES:
    ```
    Haven't checked out Salvos yet, but here's a second for Cormorant.

    Minor spoilers about the subject of the book, rather than events: >!economics are a focus rather than physical combat — I can't say whether it's well-done because I don't know shit about economics, but it's done. The main character is also sapphic if that's a draw.!<
    ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    Baru Cormorant is definitely going on my to-read list.
    ```

- u/PastafarianGames:
  ```
  I'm out of books to read, not counting all of the books I don't feel like reading! This is of course a terrible, horrible disaster and you should help me fix it.

  I'm particularly looking for fantasy or sci-fi that features protagonists that have a fundamentally positive outlook (not necessarily "things are great" but at a minimum "things can be better and we can make that happen if we work hard enough in the correct way") and close personal bonds/friendships. 

  Three examples: Becky Chambers ("The Long Way To a Small Angry Planet" and its two sequels), Effie Calvin ("Daughter of the Sun" and other books in Inthya), and Graydon Saunders (the Commonweal).

  Also, I re-read "A Memory Called Empire" and I just absolutely cannot wait for its sequel. Very much recommended, so incredibly good.
  ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    The *Young Wizards* series by Diane Duane sounds up your alley. It's for young adults, but I've just finished the second book and I'm quite enjoying it. Fundamentally positive outlook, close personal bonds, and, perhaps best of all, all nine (current) books in the series are [available for just $20](https://ebooks.direct/products/young-wizards-new-millennium-editions-9-volume-box-set) for as long as COVID is running around. 

    It isn't rational fic per se, but the series has been recommended *many* times on this subreddit, its ideology is pretty anti-death (wizards are explicitly charged with fighting entropy and delaying—though not permanently averting—the end of the universe), and it even tries to explain the YA-typical trope of teenagers going off and doing spectacularly dangerous things (wizards get weaker as they get older, so the, well, *young wizards* have to be on the front lines, as it were, while senior wizards hang back and fill an advisory role).

    EDIT: There's also the [Feline Wizards](https://ebooks.direct/collections/feline-wizards) trilogy, because there are cat (and dog, and whale, and...) wizards, too.

    Have you read any of Brandon Sanderson or Robert J Sawyer's work? I feel like they might fit you "protagonist with an optimistic worldview" requirement.

    Sanderson does mainly fantasy, has has also done some sci-fi. He's probably best known for his *Mistborn* series. It starts out kind of like a fantasy Ocean's 11, except instead of robbing a casino they need to overthrow an immortal god-king.

    For Robert J Sawyer's I would recommend *Mindscan*, which explores whether a dying woman who has her mind transplanted into an android body is still "alive," and even if they're still human. There's also *Calculating God*, which I like better, but doesn't fit the theme of this sub as well as the former. There's the *WWW* trilogy (*Wake, Watch, Wonder*) that is essentially about a blind girl making friends with an AI. He has a bunch of other work, but unfortunately I haven't read them (yet).
    ```

    - u/TaoGaming:
      ```
      *Calculating God* does fit the theme of this sub, IMO (and is a good book). It may not be rational to believe in a specific religion, or a particular god, but what if Aliens came with compelling evidence that the universe was designed? (This isn't really a spoiler, its the first chapter, IIRC). The aliens are on a fact-finding mission to try to puzzle out what god is up to.

      The alien is reasonably funny. The opening with the Alien talking to the security guard (who thinks this is a prank) at the museum of anthropology is amusing (this is from memory).

      Sawyer's books are all fairly reasonable/rational ... like any SF books they have some leaps you have to make, but they play fair once you make them. The Hominid trilogy (about people moving back and forth between our Earth and one where we went extinct but neanderthals didn't) is also decent. Haven't read mindscan, though.

      Edit -- Just read Sawyer's Wikipedia page (looking for the name of a few books) and it said "Sawyer's works frequently explore the intersection between science and religion, with rationalism frequently winning out over mysticism." Also, all of his books are fairly quick reads, I think. No door stoppers.
      ```

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
        ```
        I disagree on Calculating God. Not only is not a very rational book, it's not very good, period. 

        I first read it when it came out and I was in middle school/high school. I originally enjoyed it well enough mostly because I was too young to really get the points the book was trying to make, but then several years later I re-read it when I was well into a degree in biology. 

        That book is basically arguing for intelligent design. With even the most basic understanding of evolution, none of it makes any sense. And they don't explain at all what's different in the universe to make a reader think that evolution would work differently than in the real world. The arguments are clearly meant to apply not just to the book, but to the real world. 

        The basic premise >!that all life in the universe was seeded by a lifeform who's reproductive process spans multiple big bang/big crunch cycles and uses the life in one universe to create it's own next generation!< is super interesting and could have been done so well....if the protagonist didn't end up going on long rants about how we should have known that evolution didn't make sense and that all the arguments that intelligent design proponents made were, in hindsight, totally reasonable and we just chose not to listen, oh the folly of those arrogant scientists! 

        It's a cool premise that is ruined by unnecessary pushing of a totally crap viewpoint on science and evolution.

        The problem is not the religion per se, it's the pushing of the narrative that evolution just doesn't make sense/is clearly wrong. I knew/know a lot of religious people in the biological sciences, and religion isn't fundamentally incompatible with our understanding of evolution. And Ive read and enjoyed lots of book with either religious protagonists or religious themes.

        This book isn't just religious, it's attempting to make anti-science, anti-evolution arguments that it wants the reader to carry over and believe in the real world. It's propaganda, and it's not good enough to justify reading, which some propaganda occasionally is. 

        The modern day equivalent of this book would be one making the argument that climate change isn't real, and not in a speculative fiction kind of way but in "and the lessons in this book show why it's wrong in the real world too!" kind of way. No thank you.

        -edit- when I re-read my comment, I realized it's kind of rambly mess. To sum up, the idea of exploring "what if intelligent design was  real" could be really interesting. But just saying "lol evolution is wrong and it's obvious in hindsight" is probably the least interesting, least smart way the author could have done so.

    Are you okay with webnovels? I feel like there have been a few recently that check your boxes.

    Ar'Kendrythist has a protagonist that keeps his optimistic outlook even after many challenges. It's somewhat controversial here, but I think it has merit if you're able to get past his initial personality. 

    I hear good things about Cinammon Bun, which is a litrpg starring a really adorable and optimistic protagonist who gets the "cinammon bun" class.

    The Demon Lord's Lover (on royalroad) is primarily a romantic comedy, in a seemingly generic Japanese isekai where the mentor of the current generation of heroes falls in love with the demon lord. Outside of the main romance, there are also elements of optimistic diplomacy and cultural acceptance that come up. It's an overall positive, happy story. Highly recommend.

    Some non-webnovels.


    Bobiverse is an optimistic AI colonization story. 

    The Culture series is an entire series of optimistic sci-fi novels.

    The Curse of Chalion is a pretty optimistic (both philosophically and theologically) fantasy story. The main character is an injured veteran, not too old but not young either, coming back to the palace he grew up in and trying to find employment. The characters go through some pretty bad situations but they never give in to despair, they keep trying to uphold their innate optimism. 

    By the same author, Penric and Desdemona is a series of novellas taking place in the same world. Also has a pair of optimistic characters that solve problems through diplomacy and kindness instead of fighting (although there's a bit of that too). Really delightful.

    Spice and Wolf is a series of light novels with mainly two main characters Lawrence and Holo. It's about their romance, but being a Japanese romance, it takes ages to get anywhere. But I will say that their banter is really fun to read. It's mainly slice of life, but I will say that there's a warmth to the story and characters that makes me go fuzzy inside.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      I've seen Ar'K mentioned a few times. Maybe I'll take a look at it. And yeah, Cinnamon Bun is gosh darned adorable.

      I've read all but Spice & Wolf of the non-webnovels you mention, and I entirely agree with your takes on them! Maybe I should go re-read some Culture books. That sounds fun.

    '[The New World](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/12024/the-new-world)' and '[Kill them All (Worm)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/#post-65418408)' are both long, fun LitRPG popcorn reads (and utterly irrational).

    The New World is incredibly edgy.  It's so edgy it runs into parody land while Linkin Park plays in the background and wraps back into hilarious because you can't take that much edge seriously.  In chapter 3 (of 287) >!he unlocks a power that called agony that slowly kills him from the inside out by setting his nerves on fire, in order to do equal damage to anyone near him and that's how he has to fight.!<  It only gets edgier (and numbers go up) from there.  It's like someone read the famous Arifureta novels and decided to outdo it by an order of magnitude.

    Kill them All just finished, and has some of the dumbest/best power progression I've ever read.  I've described one of the author's other works as 'the Bee Movie, but every time someone says the word Bee, it speeds up, except with murder instead of B's.'  This story is that, except every time the main character kills someone, the power level doubles.  It also has multicross elements after the first ~fifth, which are ridiculous and fantastic.  One of the few stories I've seen them used well instead of detracting from the story as they're actually *used* instead of just being a garnish.

        Alright here's a few more popcorn-esque reads. Most of these are fanfiction though.

        The Games We Play by Ryuugi, rwby fanfic but might as well be a whole different novel. Protagonist gets the powers of The Gamer.

        The Gamer on chyoa.com, follow neo_kenka's route, it's probably the best one. It's an erotica, and does get somewhat extreme (as you would with magic sex powers), but the Gamer aspect is genuinely interestingly done and the protagonist's build is also really interesting. 

        Almost any of coeur al'aran's fanfics. He mainly writes rwby fanfics with Jaune as the main character. It's not amazing (although some are pretty darn good), but it has consistently high quality grammar and usually good plots that are enjoyable to read. I especially liked Forged Destiny and Relic of the Future.

        Man off the Moon. A mass effect/fate crossover, starring Nameless from grand order as the protagonist (really it's archer from fate stay night with some differences). Really fun and has some long running in-jokes that get funnier each time. Has some pacing issues in the middle but the current arc is pretty exciting.

  Off the back of [Sexy Space Babes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37934/sexy-space-babes) being recommended last week, are there any interesting and more rational scifi/fantasy high-concept attempts at exploring potential different gender dynamics?

  Stuff like Amahara's two Teisou Gyakuten Sekai manga series (also a male/female dynamic swap) and Ursula K Le Guin's Left Hand of Darkness (also a human interacting with humanoid Aliens that have different gender dynamics) are the closest to Space Babes, but I'm interested if anyone is aware of anything that covers that kind of ground competently in a high-concept way.

    I just read a Greg Egan short story (Wang's carpets) where, offhand, the virtual-space humans are explained to use "relative gender," where two sides of a relationship might perceive their own avatar as female and the other person as male, for instance.

    [Dying of the Light](https://spaceandsorcery.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/the-dying-of-the-light-g-r-r-martin/) by George R.R. Martin is a space-age scifi novel that might fit your request. The storyline focuses, in part, on the results of an isolated human civilization shaped by privation such that it developed vastly different gender dynamics as a matter of survival. The harsh, seemingly barbaric customs linger on, even centuries after the necessity which bore them has been relieved.

    Ancillary's already been mentioned, and you should definitely read it.

    The Inthya books by Effie Calvin and the Clocktaur War + related books by T Kingfisher (aka Ursula Vernon) both have non-gender-binary settings but it's played so casually there's literally no exploration of it, it's just a thing that exists as the un-commented-on status quo.

  Any good (rational) vampire stories you can recommend where vampires play the main role? 

  I have personally read 

  1. [Contratto](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7127255), a short story which was very good, apart from the ending which felt hastened 
  2. Peter Watts Blindsight and Echopraxia and the pseudo documentation PDF about vampires.  I wouldn't count the novels as vampire novels with one vampire per book. 
  3. Luminosity and Radiance by Alicorn. I didn't like them. It has been quite some years, so I only remember that the main character Bella was the only really competent one on the good side. And the ending felt like wish fulfillment fantasy of the author.
  4. Some Harry Potter fanfictions I really can't remember the name of. 

  Movies:

  Apart from that the vampires in the Twilight movies weren't convincing, let alone the plot. But depending on the kind of film you want to watch and not too high expectations *Stakeland* and *Daybreakers* was good. Vampire Academy  was okay. And *Interview with a vampire* was good. *Let me in* was very good. *Let the right one in* was good - actors weren't as good as in the American adaptation (Let me in) and this one comedy-like side-story didn't fit. *The Moth diaries* which was pretty good. Can't remember any other movies currently.

        Thirded, Journey is one of the very best on RoyalRoad and an excellent vampire novel in general. I especially love how the MC breaks away from typical vampire conventions with her love of guns, cannons, and explosives. Vampire society in general is also portrayed excellently in Journey. Very enjoyable.

    A similar request garnered some great recommendations close to a year ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ekv9s8/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fdfwvq9/ 

    I'd repeat my recommendations of [*Fevre Dream*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382450.Fevre_Dream) by George R.R. Martin and [*The Madness Season*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36161.The_Madness_Season) by C.S. Friedman. The former is an excellent period piece set on a riverboat in the 1850s, the latter is space-age scifi that explores some interesting ideas about alien psychology.

      Thanks, also thanks to all the others who have replied.

      I just wanted to mention, that I have read *Let me in 2*, recommended in the linked thread. I can generally recommend it to. A for me novel take on vampires which also fits what we learn in the movie well. The characters in the book in general where interesting. Although the plot as whole wasn't ultimately satisfying for me how it developed. But that is - meta-spoiler about ending - >!probably more due to the gloomy development of the plot and the bitter-sweet ending. Which is in the end a personal preference!<

  RE: Monarch is on trending/most popular and is a rising fiction on Royal Road.

  I just binged it yesterday and it ticks every box for a good time loop story. It has periodic check points and tangible progression with likable characters and high stakes. The author is a big fan of MoL and sought to create something to scratch the same itch. I believe they succeeded.

  There is currently ~370 pages on royal road and it's of a very high quality, publishable. The author has stated that the first 100 chapters have been already storyboarded and we're currently only in the 30's, so there was some good planning put into this and you can feel it.

  Highly recommended as someone who is a fan of MoL and other time loop stories.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:

    I started reading it after it got rec'd last week, but I have bad experiences with the "legendary badass who lost everything recounts his story" narrative framing device. Not only is it hard to pull off(look at the kingkiller chronicles), since the reader knows exactly where the story is going, if not how it gets there, it removes one of the best and most dependable ways authors have to produce narrative tension. With webserials it's even worse as now the author is locked into a destination he's years away from reaching. You're shit out of luck if you change your mind or get a better idea for the character. 

    In this story we already know the guy is going to master unmasterable magics, acquire unacquirable weapons/artifacts and reach places that are unreachable. We also know he eats shit somehow and is vewy depwessed. Here's the problem: in every other story I would have to use spoiler tags, but not this one!

    In closing, people like to say it's about the journey and not the destination, but that's bullshit, it's fucking both.
    ```

    - u/Luck732:
      ```
      Isn't this story more of a timeloop?  He wasn't a legendary badass, nor has he lost everything, as the timeline is different now.
      ```

      - u/zorianteron:
        ```
        The story is this one guy's personal timeline through the repeatedly resetting world, so the setup's equivalent to the one in a non-timeloop story.   I'm not a fan, either.  I'd just recommend people not read the prologue- it has no bearing on the story that comes immediately after (or rather, it has a negative bearing.)
        ```

        - u/Luck732:
          ```
          Ah, I completely forgot the prologue even existed to be honest.

            ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          FYI the author has posted in an author's note somewhere that they've heard this criticism and are probably going to take the prologue down. 

          I do agree that it doesn't add anything to the story, particularly since the framing device is never used.
          ```

        - u/Revlar:
          ```
          Sounds like it has the same issue as that one ASOIAF fanfic ("Purple days", I think it's called?) where the prologue spoils the character progression.
          ```

          - u/xachariah:
            ```
            I think the Purple Days prologue is actually non-cannon now, since the author's story moved away from where he expected when starting, and he'll later rewrite that section.

            Unintentional deconstruction of the timeloop genre.
            ```

            - u/Watchful1:
              ```
              Not to mention the Purple Days prologue doesn't really touch on the actual mechanics and reason behind the loop, which is what he spends the whole story figuring out.
              ```

          - u/zorianteron:
            ```
            Yeah, that's exactly what it reminded me of, actually.  As I was reading the prologue I was thinking "Oh no, not again".

            But ignoring that, the story's quite good so far.
            ```

          - u/kraryal:
            ```
            For what's worth, if you enjoyed the rest of the story, the prologue is no longer canon.
            ```

  - u/Judah77:
    ```
    I tried this one and couldn't get into it.  The prologue seriously turned me off to it.  So I'd recommend you skip that and start with chapter one if you try it.
    ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      I did this and had no trouble understanding the story. It's a good story. I recommend it.
      ```

  - u/GlimmervoidG:
    ```
    So I read it and didn't really like it. I consider the comparison with MoL particularly poor. One of the defining aspects of MoL was the use of the time loop deliberately as a tool to grow. This story completely lacks that. The time loop is purely too-bad-try-again encounter redoing. 

    There are reasons why the MC is acting the way he is. Good reasons even. The timeloop works very differently than MoL. But it doesn't make the story any more like MoL.

    More generally, I don't think the time loop is being very well used at a narrative level. Indeed, it's being massively underused. The time loop is this story's selling point. 

    It featured heavily in the Everwood chapters. That arc had the main character reset scumming through a deadly situation to survive and come out victorious. That's the core of this story's time loop. What it should be. Utterly different from MoL but it could work. But since then? In the 20 odd chapters, fully half the story so far?

    >!It's been used exactly once.  !<

    >!Escaping a city his enemy has surrounded? He fails once and then gets through. None of the desperate reset scumming that so characterised the Everwood chapters. The author even sets out to make this situation different than Everwood, with the shorter reset window. Could be interesting. Could be different. But nope. One try and he's right on out of there. !<

    >!And since then? Not. One. Use. !<

    >!Arrives at the infernal city and has to get inside? Gives a speech and does so first time. Thrown in prison by his political enemies? Gets out without doing anything. !<

    >!A trial with his life on the line, where corrupt dealings have already pre-determined the verdict against him? That has to use the time loop right? He can go through the trial multiple times, learning more about the corruption and how to bring the judges onto his side? That's perfect for this kind of time loop.  !<

    >!Nope. Notices the corruption and deals with it with a speech. !<

    I know a few I can easily recommend.

    **[Dragonspawn](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dragonspawn-my-hero-academia-si.696280/)**: My Hero Academia SI, where the MC is born as Ryuko Tatsuma's little sister. The SI ends up having to deal with a major disability while simultanously having a rather strong power, which is a neat combination imo. 260k words so far.

    **[Assimilation](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/assimilation-young-justice-si.436294/)**: Young Justice SI. The SI finds himself on a Psion research vessel, and is promptly eaten by nanobots. He soon >!teams up with another imprisoned research subject!< and escapes to Earth. The story has gone completely off the rails in a few interesting ways, and it's just great. 400k words so far.

    **[What's Her Name in Hufflepuff](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/)**: Harry Potter SI. The SI falls through a mirror into a Gringotts vault. She proceeds to use her metaknowledge to secretly work against Voldemort while remaining (mostly) in the background. Actually manages to capture some of the original series' feeling of 'whimsy,' which isn't particularly common for most fan-works as far as I can tell. 190k words so far.

    **[The Calculator](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-calculator-dc-multiverse-si-as-canon-character-season-1-complete.39138/)**: DC comics-verse SI. The SI wakes up as a minor villain (one of the ones without superpowers). But what he *does* have is some better than average technology, an Artificial Intelligence, and a boatload of paranoia. 60k words (first 'Season' complete).

    **[Hear the Silence](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896/chapters/35757684)**: Pre-canon Naruto SI. Takes place way pre-canon during the Second Shinobi World War. There's a ton of original worldbuilding here since it's set so far in the past, which I found really interesting. The story leans really hard into the trauma aspect of Shinobi life, which might be a turn-off for some readers. The world is seriously brutal, and the SI regularly gets emotionaly wrecked. 690k words so far.

    I'll also put a recommendation behind Sanitize.
    ```

    - u/Dufaer:
      ```
      I second *What's Her Name in Hufflepuff*! Funny, adorable, clever.

      *Dragonspawn* was OK to read, but after I finished the then-last chapter (at the end of the internships), I never felt the desire to come back to it and read on.

      The thing that most stuck with me from the whole fic is this: The protagonist (Ryuko's sister) befriends Pony. Pony is basically Ryuko's number one fan. Pony is unfairly eliminated from the tournament ("Sports Festival"). Because of that she gets no personal internship offers afterwards and is stuck with the default ones for the whole school. So of course the protagonist does... absolutely nothing. It's never even mentioned that she could do anything about it and she is on great terms with Ryuko.

      *That* is what I remember the best out of hundreds of thousands of words. I would classify the whole thing as quite bland.

      *Hear the Silence*: As far as I read, this lacked any wonder, cleverness or intrigue. It was blandly slice-of-life-y. The SI-aspect was also completely unnecessary.

    In terms of objectively good, I'd reccomend the below. If you're willing to accept good for SI / which I myself often am, then I can list more, but while I enjoyed reading them, objectively they had their flaws, so I'm sticking with these 4 for now.

    ```

    - u/Gigglen0t:
      ```
      Let me preface this by saying SIs are not rational. My big thing with SIs is that you get to see AU more often than not. The original authors create an entire universe and a lot of FF just ends up being stations of cannon or they explore angst/romance in ways that make me as a reader uncomfortable. 

      This is typically why I enjoy a good SI. They have an entire documented verse to play in and no obligation to do anything with the plot should they choose (read: I also have a tendency to dislike stories where the SI forces themself in the main cast e.g Omg HERMIONE, HARRY, RON, and I will be BFFS for life SQUEEE.) This is a personal preference and I can see where people who feel the opposite are coming from. 

      So, in general, I look for things that at least respect the butterfly effect, go slightly AU, and treat meta knowledge for what it is. Op as all get out. (side note: People who feel the need to add more powers onto the SI e.g rinnei-teinseigen or some other broken thing are an immediate turn off because quite frankly that's just super boring. The gamer ability is an exception as it scratches the progresson itch)

      - u/Dragongeek:

        I think in some settings, adding powers to a SI is basically required though because otherwise it limits the stories that can be written. For example, in *Worm*, if someone just showed up suddenly with all the knowledge of canon *Worm*, Contessa and the Simurgh would notice immediately and it's very possible they would be insta-ganked or kidnapped right off the bat. Mind/precognition protection is basically mandatory.

          Honestly any of them. The only ones that toe the line are 9 (Its 40k) and 15(Has yet to get its legs and is pretty dark beginning).


          More often than not I find that tragedy is synonymous with edgy. Same thing with "Evil MC", "Sociopath MC", "Dark MC", etc.. I have yet to find one of those that has been decent let alone good. Its gotten to the point where I see any of the listed above and cringe. I have a great deal of respect for people who spend their free time on the hobby of writing. In general, I love all genres, but when the writer says "Sociopath" it can 99% of the time be taken as "Hey, I want to do whatever I want and there won't be any consequences unless it advances the plot in some contrived manner." Like someone took an already annoying as hell trop from xianxia and turned it up to 11.

          Edit: 14 can toe the line as well

  Does anyone know of any good monster MC progression fantasies or the like? It's an interesting genre, but it's so empty and filled with garbage.

I've heard some mentions about Salvos, perhaps I'll check that out soon.

      Hive Queen deserves a bit better than a 6/10 imo. Not because it's amazing, just that there is so much other garbage out there that "reasonably executed and somewhat unique ideas" almost warrants a 7/10 alone.

      Shade Touched on Royalroad is also pretty solid, although the mc is an intelligent monster learning about the world and humanity from birth, rather than as much a focus on navigating the world that comes from having some starting knowledge.

      I already read it and keep up to date on it, it's pretty good among isekais and JP LNs, as much as that's worth. Apart from the stats powercreeping and some silliness, it's one of the better nonhuman isekais.

      Thanks for the attempt, it seems like I've read every single decent monster MC novel going by the recommendations here, unfortunately. Guess I'll have to get my fix through the upcoming Spider anime at this rate.

  Is worth the candle getting close to ending? I stopped following it last year since long stretches between updates pull me out of the story.

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    Yeah it's close, but I wouldn't be surprised if Fel Seed prep/fight/fallout is a massive arc, and it seems to be either the next arc or after the next arc at this stage.

    Delays on the latest release were from the author being distracted watching the US mutilate itself around him in real time over the past year.

      I really think we've got at least two or three chapter batches before the end game stuff. >!I know this batch heavily teased diving straight into Fel Seed, but I really feel like there's some major character development stuff that's going to happen before then. Bethel coming back, Raven is going to do something, Solace and the Locus, I could swear we're going to get Fenn back somehow now that Juniper is in a stable relationship. There's no way all that happens in just one arc.!<

        Exactly. I figured two chapter batches and I maybe underestimated the new speed. We will see, and then I will update, and grow ever more powerful. MUAHAHAHAHAHA

  Hi, I'm looking for some progression fantasy. It doesn't have to be 100% rational but I would prefer if it doesn't have any idiot ball or any I'm evil just 'cause type of character. And nothing with less than 300.000 words or 1 published book. Pls assume I already know WtC, all of wildbow's fictions, or the other works that are recommended every thread. Thx.
  ```

  - u/LaziIy:
    ```
    Since I see you ask this every week, what's the best that you've read or have been recommended?
    ```

    - u/incamaDaddy:
      ```
      let me point out before I begin that most of these are **not** rational and most aren't even rational adjacent, but these are the ones I liked the most.

      * Apocalypse: Generic System by Macronomicon.
      * Infinite Realm: Monsters & Legends.
      * The Pen is Mightier by Quill Moniker.
      * Dungeon Crawler Carl.
      * anything written by John Bierce.
      * Ar'Kendrythist. (I know it's shit, no need to remind me of it, but I enjoy it)
      * Forge of Destiny. and in a similar vein even though it wasn't recommended to me, The Path Unending.
      * Masters and Mages trilogy.

      and just in case anyone wants some recommendations from me that I **think** haven't been mentioned before with the same caveat as the ones above:

      * A song for two voices. (rational Valdemar fanfic)
      * A Sword Without a Hilt: A Song of Ice and Fire/D&D 3.5 Crossover.
      * Bruce Quest (for the record. this is a shit quest with an overabundance of religious propaganda that I do not agree with, but it updates daily and I have too much free time).
      * Just a Bystander by Aefraga.
      * Beneath the Dragoneye Moons by Selkie
      * RE: Monarch by Eligos (just saw that it's recommended here in this thread).
      * Tower of Somnus by CoCop.
      * Super Minion by Gogglesbear.
      * Traveler (Pokemon Fanfic that I've just begun to read).
      * Ra. (I think it's on the r/rational wiki)

      and right now I'm reading a progression fantasy called the Frith Chronicles by Shami Stovall. I've been thinking of making a long-ass google spreadsheet with everything I've read and reviewing it with scores on things like how much I enjoyed it, how good the grammar is, what I've thought of the magic system, etc but it's way too much work.

      Lastly, a list of webcomics that I've read recently or I'm reading right now:

      * Homestuck.
      * Kill Six Billion Demons.
      * Gunnerkrigg Court.
      * Daughter of the Lilies.
      * Stand Still Stay Silent.

      edits: added webcomics and fixed some things.
      ```

      - u/Dufaer:
        ```
        *Bruce Quest* is by LordsFire, isn't it?

        That gets an automatic de-rec from me.

        Dude can't keep it in his pants. I haven't read *Bruce Quest*, but in every work that I *have read* by him (that wasn't short and dead) he jizzes his Christian evangelism all over the worldbuilding, characterization and plot, no matter how little sense it makes.

        For example:

        Crossover premise: After years of drifting, a Japanese Shinto girl crashes in her spaceship onto the death world of Remnant. Alright! Let's go!

        Wait, did I say Shinto? Nah, let's make her Christian.

        Last time she had contact with religion or any other people indeed was as a preteen? Doesn't matter. Religion- No. *Her* religion is *extremely* important to her.

        People on Remnant need her tech to survive against the endlessly respawning monster hordes? Well, she wants to talk to them about her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ instead. Do they feel saved yet, while being eaten alive?

        Wait! Does this lead to religious conflict with the native religion(s) on Remnant? Nah. Surprise! The sole native religion on Remnant is also Christianity! Let's have Pyrrha quote the Bible out of the blue!

        (And anyway, that part is canon, you see.

        Proof: Ruby has **crosses** on her costume! QED!)

        No, [I am not making this shit up.](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sheltered-rwby-pseudo-crossover-completed.713359/) I wish I were.

          I agree 100% with you on everything you said, but just like with the author of With This Ring. whenever they start spewing bullshit I skip a chapter and try to ignore it because they update regularly and consistently. I have a fuckton of free time and I'm desperate to fill it so I'll read **ANYTHING.** but con the subject of LordsFire, I tried reading his brutal harry fanfic and had to drop it because of the excessively plentiful religious references.

          edit: and for the record bruce quest suffers from all the flaws you mentioned here and I apologize for not mentioning it on the list. I would remove it but that would make this whole section of the conversation weird and out of place so I'll leave it for context with a warning.

        Have you read the Art of the Adept series? Nothing groundbreaking or anything, but good enough popcorn reading. Also the 4th book is due before the end of the year.

          >Art of the Adept

          It's quite bad imho. I've read book 1 and 2, it's enjoyable if you don't analyze it or think about it for 5 minutes.

            >it's enjoyable if you don't analyze it 

            Agree with that part specifically, thats why I wrote "popcorn read". I don't think the series is bad though, it's certainly better written than half the stuff on his list. It's like above average; definitely not rational, and not anything great, but good enough.
            ```

        - u/incamaDaddy:

          only the first book, I'll check it out.

          I enjoyed these. They're not amazing, and the MC has a death wish, but there's some hard-ish magic stuff that's entertaining. Last time I gave a halfhearted rec on here I got raked over the coals for some reason.
          ```

      - u/LaziIy:

        Thanks for the insights, let us know the day you get to making that spreadsheet.

        I don't get it, you say you want +300k words but you recommend and read stuff that's less than 3 months old with less than 50 chapters, and that we can't be sure will still be good a month from now.

        &#x200B;

        Personally I'm not reading anything less than 6 months old, getting invested in things that turn out bad after a while and having a hard time dropping them because of the sunk cost fallacy is not my idea of a good time. I'd rather wait a while longer and not risk it.
        ```

        - u/incamaDaddy:
          ```
          it's more that I was trying to not put things that have been recommended to death before here. for example, I love:

          * The Zombie Knight Saga.
          * Pokemon: The Origin of Species.
          * With This Ring. (I know the author has some shitty takes on some subjects but he updates daily and I'm bored)
          * I tend to let WtC chapter build up and then binge them once in a while.
          * up until a very recent chapter I put The wandering inn tied for #1 with Mother of Learning for my fav. web fiction. now it's like #10.
          * I dropped  A Practical Guide to Evil around the end of book 5.

          and many more that just aren't coming to mind right now.

          edit: oh and  A song for two voices has  1,391,256 words today. And  A Sword Without a Hilt is an INSANE quest with 4.6 million words.

    Are you okay with non-progression fantasies? I've recently been reading some nice fanfics.

    Man off the Moon is a Mass Effect / Fate Grand Order crossover in the best way possible. Main character is Nameless (basically Archer from fate stay night), and he retains most of his power, and goes ham on the mass effect universe. The author expands on the lore and locations in a good way, and explores parts of the universe that weren't shown in the games. There are also a bunch of recurring jokes that get funnier each time. 

    Coeur Al'Aran on ff.net writes mostly rwby fanfics with Jaune as the main character, and has a bunch of completed stories with more than 500k words. Most of them are good, some are quite good, but nothing too groundbreaking. It's like shounen manga in literature form. He also updates weekly.

    Brockton's Celestial Forge has the main character get the powers of the Celestial Forge. Every few thousand words he gets a new power based on a jumpchain chart. They range from small powers that put a bonus to his crafting speed or style to big ones like knowing how to build Transformers. Really satisfying progression from nothing to building power armor in hours. Also goes deep into technobabble about how his tech (and other powers) work, which could be a plus or minus.

    From Fake Dreams is a fate stay night fanfic where Kiritsugu gets dreams of the future, and starts preparing Shirou for it. It's quite long, 1 million words+, and has an out of character Shirou. It's also quite controversial for fate fans (not a high bar tbh). It's pretty fun and sometimes even emotionally provoking, given you don't look too deep into the lore. Shirou progressively gains power through the series as well.

    The Games We Play and An Exercise in Stupidity (on ff.net) are two Gamer rwby fics. The first one is one is pretty popular, and finished. Gets to the endgame and encounter with final boss and everything. The second one is more recent, and has a protagonist that goes all into strength and tankiness. Results in some fun impulsive moments where the protagonist ignores lore dumps in favor of fighting his enemies.

    Have you ever come across [Threadbare](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare)?

    In an RPG-based world, there's a golem maker who's desperately trying to create a sentient golem; one of his attempts is in the form of a teddybear. He tries to invite the bear to his adventuring party, but the bear doesn't say 'yes' - mainly because it doesn't know that saying 'yes' is an *option* - and so at first he thinks he's failed to create a sentient golem (again), so the best thing to do is to take the teddybear apart for parts. And the teddybear doesn't even understand the question.

    And those are the humble beginnings of the hero...
