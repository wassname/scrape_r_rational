## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I finally decided to sit down and start plotting out the outline on Sideways in Hyperspace on paper, so I wasn't just writing from my memory, and holy hell did that throw up a lot of problems pretty much immediately. 

  1) (mostly unrelated and mostly solved) I downloaded Space Engine so I could get a good 3d view on where stars are wrt each other in the galaxy, and immediately realized I had put the entire Hyades Cluster on the wrong side of the sky. The problem was I used [this map](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/250lys.html) of space, which makes it look like the Hyades is in front of the Earth wrt the center of the galaxy...nope, it's in fact in almost the exact opposite direction. I came up with a way around it wrt the plot, but it was incredibly grating to realize the error. 

  2) I'm stuck at this point in the plot where I'm not sure how two governments in a state of cold war and distrust with each other would act in this situation, and its hard to even discuss it without revealing massive spoilers.

    Gwern wrote an article that might be relevant to #2. Check it out [here](http://www.gwern.net/Colder%20Wars). 

    Also, I've been ignoring Sideways in Hyperspace whenever it pops up for...reasons that I'm not entirely sure about. I've read your synopsis now on wordpress, and I'm wondering what aliens are like in your story (I tend to read stories more for the world than for the plot). Could I get the lowdown on aliens and the setting in general? Thanks.

    Regarding distrust for point 2, you may be interested in looking at how intergalactic civilizations attempt to survive in [The Dark Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest), which has some ideas I hadn't really thought about re: communication and PD-type scenarios.

      Thanks for the recommendation.
