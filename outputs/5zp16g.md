## How would these two characters react in each other's presence, hypothetically?

  Surely their interactions would vastly vary depending on the context for the interaction? Is this a social call? Are they making small talk? Are they fighting? Do they both want something only one of them can get?

    I agree, the context of their interaction is necessary to determine how they would interact. The question is essentially pointless to ask without that information. Especially because this is not the information that these characters have, they both absolutely *know* their induvidual goals and motivations. While they also both have their own personal perspective of whatever situation they are in.

    OP seems to be asking the question under the assumption that there exists a "perfect" or singular rational way in which these characters are able to act regardless of outside factors. Either that or he's asking how the audience would expect the characters to act in any situation which is a similalry useless question because in that case any answer is both right and wrong because not everyone will agree.

  A lot of how people interact is a function of goal alignment, but assuming they're broadly pursuing the same things, the snark knight will probably be frustrated with the paladin pretty quickly, on account of giving him nothing to work with.

  Do they have to tolerate each other’s presence for some time? Work together? Against each other? 

  I’m assuming either 1 or 2; in which case A occasionally would be grunting non-commitally to B’s witticisms, B would be trying to ask some deliberately inane questions trying to make the routine more bearable. If faced with a problem, A would first wait to see how’d B go about solving it, and then silently solve it himself if B fails for some reason. If faced with unknown people, A would try to prevent B from accidentally stepping on someone’s ego to prevent potential conflicts. If given enough time together, A would get somewhat used to B’s not-as-clever-as-he-thinks remarks and rarely even add his own tries at jokes.

  I think adding situational context info would help you get more\better answers.

  Sounds like a setup for a socratic dialogue (with person B being the author avatar, subverting person A which represents the audience's expectations)... with occasional reversal when the obvious and intuitive and conservative answer is actually the true one and the contrarian is wrong.

  This could potentially be a pretty good /r/writingprompts post, I suggest reposting it there?

  In real life? Probably they'd just get along like normal people. Exchange of names. Small tokens of knowledge exchanged. Validation of the other person by playing along somewhat in conversations.
  ```

  ```
  When you say, "weather[sic] or not person A is a fighter, is unknown," do you mean it's unknown to you, the author? This seems like an inexplicable oversight.

  These guys seem pretty typical for "buddy movies," especially cop or road trip type, although they veer a little towards the "3 edgy 5 me" stereotypes common in a teenagers' first fanfic.

  As someone who asks a lot of vague, purposeless questions myself; this one seems particularly in both of those veins. I feel like we don't have enough information and the info you've given us seems to be oddly nuanced considering lack of context, even if I accountethe hypothetical scenario you gave us.
