  ~~Calling something "rational fiction" doesn't make it fiction automatically. This sub is for explicit fiction, not general rationality topics.~~

  This was in error, sorry about that, folks.

  - u/thechadlin:
    ```
    If you read it closely it’s pretty clear it’s fiction, the “founder” talks about how they’re partnering with corporations to modify user behavior without knowledge or consent.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Oh! My apologies, this isn't even the only blog-style fiction we've gotten recently; it's just we get things that *look* like this a lot that are just rationality-related stuff.

      I'll reinstate it.

      I likewise on skimming it thought it was a real startup, other than a few details its not that outlandish
      ```

    - u/fljared:
      ```
      Tagging it as some form of fiction might help
      ```

      - u/thechadlin:
        ```
        Will do
        ```

  ```
  I don't know much about investing, and I've been cracking up. I love amoral surrealist humour, and your blog has revealed itself to be my platonic ideal of this niche genre!

  I really liked the ADS bit!
  ```

    ```
    Thank you sir — if you enjoyed, I would encourage you to follow me on Twitter @thechadlin or sign up for new articles at specialsituations.substack.com. I’ll be posting a couple more interviews this week.
