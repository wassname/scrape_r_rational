  Why did Zorian get a critical failure when trying to convince Xvim? Even if he couldn't persuade him right there, he should have been able to tell Xvim the instructions for some super rare spells, including some which are unique to Z&Z like the modified Gate spell or the shield spell with ridiculous shaping requirements. This should have at least been enough to get Xvim to take his story seriously.

  For that matter Zorian managed to convince Xvim of the time loop before without access to advanced knowledge/magic, though that took a couple of days and he didn't ask Xvim to cast any spells.
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    He also has Xvim's "my memories have been deleted" code and can straight up tell him that he spends the first few months screwing with his students.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      He probably can't retrieve that code without using magic.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        Oh, good point. There's hardly a reason to keep it fresh in mind all the time.
        ```

          ```
          No, thanks to the spider's mind training doesn't zorian have perfect recall?
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            > doesn't zorian have perfect recall?

            Sure, if he could use mind magic.

                I wish the chapter had explored that more. Even though he only started developing his mind magic during the time loop, he's had the innate empathy thing for his entire life, right? Seems like losing that would be like losing his sense of hearing or smell.
                ```

                - u/thrawnca:
                  ```
                  Hmm...it's possible that passive abilities like empathy still worked, he just couldn't deliberately shape mana without putting unacceptable stress on his soul.

                  /u/nobody103 Can you confirm?
                  ```

                  - u/nobody103:
                    ```
                    Passive abilities would still work, but they'd be erratic and unreliable. Zorian purposely kept his empathy off for this reason.
                    ```

                  - u/CeruleanTresses:
                    ```
                    I don't think the narration in this chapter does the "telling us how the person Zorian's talking to feels" thing, so I assume the empathy wasn't working, but then again I don't remember whether that convention persisted after Zorian figured out the empathy was an actual thing.
                    ```

              - u/notagiantdolphin:
                ```
                Imagine how horrible it would be if he was like the Matriarch and ran his brain like an experimental multi-threaded supercomputer.

                Hell, remember that computer that programmed its own chip to take advantage of minute flaws and variations in the chip to design something 'perfect' for the assigned task? And touching *any* part of it ruined the whole thing? At her level your mind is probably like that, and 'coming down' to mortal levels might drive you utterly mad.
                ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    I agree---I found Zorian's inability to convince Xvim extremely odd. Xvim's code, Alanic and Lukav's deaths, in-depth knowledge that only arch mages would have---and indeed knowledge that is based on novel research like the gate spell that can be casted without help from the destination, the advanced shield spell, Zorian's spell formulas and item schematics . . .

    I feel even without magic, it would be enough to at least not get dismissed instantly by Xvim. But perhaps Xvim was so incredulous so quickly that Zorian got no chance to prove himself further.

    /u/nobody103
    ```

    - u/nobody103:
      ```
      Zorian may have grown a just a *little bit* too set in his routines when it comes to convincing Xvim about the time loop, and acted too quickly and aggressively, not realizing not not being able to back his words with magic makes him much less credible to people's eyes...

      Or that's what I was thinking, at least. Maybe I just didn't think things through well enough. I'm not infallible and it happens sometimes. Since it's not critical to the plot of the chapter, I ask for your suspension of disbelief in the matter.
      ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        It's not that,  I suppose, I guess I'm just sad about the missed opportunity with having one last hoorah with his time-looped classmates before we leave, and by that I mean they get more than a sentence saying that they did so.
        ```

        - u/nobody103:
          ```
          I did consider writing more about their interactions in the chapter, but it wouldn't have moved the plot forward and I do need to cut *something*. 25 restarts is a lot of time to cover.
          ```

          - u/eSPiaLx:
            ```
            I think if you ever publish MoL in a novel format such scenes would be a great way to slow down the pace a bit. Right now we're having breathers forced upon us by the 3-4 week gaps between chapters so non-plot chapters will make the wait doubly as long. But without those, a chapter with zorian re-approaching his classmates could provide great insight into his character growth and would actually end up helping the pacing massively imo.
            ```

            - u/mp3max:
              ```
              Not just his classmates, but his family issues as well. They may not be important for the plot either but it would be nice to see some more of it.
              ```

          - u/Ardvarkeating101:
            ```
            Can't you just keep putting a chapter out every few weeks forever?
            ```

            - u/hallo_friendos:
              ```
              Please no. I want to recommend this book to a bunch of people but none of them want to read it until it's done...

              I guess that's why sequels are a thing.
              ```

            ```
            I'll agree with /u/eSPiaLx that it would be very, very nice to get some slice of life chapters/sidestories to MoL. However, I also agree with you - I'm eager to see the story move onto the next stage after the end of the time loop. 

            I actually enjoy Zorian's school setting and classmates to an unreasonable degree. I'd like to see much more of it - but not at the expense of moving the plot forward. The time loop has gone on for long enough. Just something to keep in mind for the future when you're looking at publishing MoL - a few sidestories would do a lot for fleshing out this world and the side characters. I'd especially like to see more of the wolf-girl in their class.
            ```

          - u/GodKiller999:
            ```
            Arc 3 likely be better off if it was divided in two (if there's ever big edits for a more official release), some parts end up rushed otherwise to the detriment of the story/pacing otherwise.
            ```

    - u/Dismalward:
      ```
      You seem forget Zach tried multiple times to convince Xvim and he failed so it shouldn't be farfetched Zorian is failing without the code (which he can't retrieve without magic and obviously doesn't remember it) or displaying magic.
      ```

  - u/Dismalward:
    ```
    Zach never convince Xvim in his many restarts and Zorian doesn't remember the code so its not unreasonable to get a failure in convincing Xvim without the code nor be able to demonstrate the magic he taught Zorian.
    ```

  - u/Rheklr:
    ```
    If what Zorian was saying was true, then he should have something from Xvim for the convincing. That he doesn't is concerning, and as for the information \- I doubt Xvim doesn't have his fair share of enemies, and of which could've prepped Zorian in an attempt to lure Xvim into a vulnerable position. No\-one gets to be old and powerful without being paranoid.
    ```

    - u/Dismalward:
      ```
      Well Zach never was able to convince Xvim so not really surprising Zorian can't convince him without any hard evidence since Xvim never really gave Zorian anything beyond the code to convince him without magic.
      ```

- u/AmeteurOpinions:
  ```
  Zorian is *insanely* lucky that those soul cures worked on Zach without a hitch.
  ```

  - u/Midknightz:
    ```
    How so? They're just normal very expensive soul recovery potions. Don't see how they were extremely risky.

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Eh, I'm sure that such potions are not widely known, but Zorian *has* repeatedly ransacked the mind of a thoroughly unethical necromancer - and a research-focused one, at that.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          I agree that this solution makes sense---at the beginning of the chapter I was thinking, "I wonder if Sudomir's mind had any information germane to healing soul damage." I would, however, suggest that during the final editing process of the book, this information about soul healing be moved to a much earlier chapter. Chekov and all that. /u/nobody103
          ```

          - u/Dismalward:
            ```
            How about waiting for all the question until AFTER the novel is finished? You keep tagging the author about all these little details which kinda ruins the mystery of the story or figuring it out yourself.
            ```

            - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
              ```
              You make a good point. I did hesitate to tag the author, however my memory and organizational methods are entirely inadequate and I don't trust myself to bring this point up at a later date. I know the author puts typos into a master document for use once the novel is over. I'm tagging the author with this comment as it's related to that editing process---indeed this comment was not a question at all but rather a recommendation.

              To the author: I apologize if I'm being annoying. I don't have a good sense for these things.

                  ```

      - u/AmeteurOpinions:
        ```
        Not only that, but the fact that they were reliable for both Zach’s unique, slightly altered soul and presumably *very* unique injury throws me out of the story. 

        Really, it’s just how incredibly quickly the story skips past “so I gave him the potions and left” without Zorian showing the slightest concern for its possible failure.
        ```

        - u/RiOrius:
          ```
          Zach's soul has a marker on it, but nothing indicates that that's super rare. And their soul injuries seem to be pretty standard "something blew up on my soul" kind of issues: no indication that QI's soul bomb had unique effects.

          Really if you're okay with generic healing potions that work on various physical injuries, I can't see how this is that different.
          ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          The source of damage for Zach and Zorian was the same, so I feel that by examining his own soul, Zorian was able to make remedies tailored to the damage. On the other hand, the potions could also just be aids to quicken the soul's natural recovery process rather than treatments for the specific type of damage sustained---analogous to the effect of good nutrition on the body.
          ```

        - u/OchreOgre_AugerAugur:
          ```
          I could see that if Zorian only had access to/tried a single soul remedy and it worked.  But he used three different ones, presumably to cover as wide as spectrum as possible.  For all we know two of the three could have been complete duds, spiritual placebos, and the last potion did all the heavy lifting in regards of accelerating the natural soul-recovery process.

          The point is that Zorian didn't gamble all or nothing on a single cure, and it is more that reasonable to expect Sudomir to collect various methods of soul repair and have tested their efficacy given his plan and hobbies.
          ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    It sounds like they weren't so much meant to fix Zach's soul as speed up his natural recovery, which sounds a lot less risky.
    ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    adding onto Midknightz, Zorian selected potions specifically without risk. could be as simple as that
    ```

  - u/wassname:
    ```
    And lucky he could remember, I imagine most of potion recipes are in his notes instead of his memory. And he can't access his notes.
    ```

    - u/azeazezar:
      ```
      This i think is not luck. Just common sense and foresight. He did know that if he needed these potions he wouldn't have access to his notes.
      ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    My reaction precisely. Below 7k words always leaves me feeling like, "Eh? But the chapter just started!"

    I think it's also due to how quickly things progressed through the chapter.
    ```

- u/PurposefulZephyr:
  ```
  "Oh no! Zorian is dying!"  
  "Oh wait, he's recovered (mostly)."  
  "Oh no! Zach is missing, his soul damaged beyond compare!"  
  "Oh wait, single spell tracked him, and soul cure worked with no long-term effects."

  This was underwhelming, frankly. Any potential danger was quickly hand-waved away, and the only consequence they suffered was losing a bunch of restarts.  

  Back to the grind, I guess. Not that I mind- it's just a shame this fearful moment didn't last longer. It was a change of pace, and I thought we'd see more fun interactions between Zorian and others.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > Zorian is dying!

    "You don't *look* dead."

    "I got better."
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      > "You don't *look* dead."

      The reports of my death were greatly exaggerated.
      ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Yeah, I was expecting a little tidbit or two about some of their schoolmates during the no-magic restarts, or something similar.
    ```

    - u/mp3max:
      ```
      Yeah, pretty much this. While I get that we are near the end of the story and the plot *must* move forward, I really miss those earlier scenes of how things happened differently thanks to their insight, more specifically, the different interactions with their classmates.
      ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Yeah, being unable to cast spells was too harsh of a result. There's no way for that to be a reoccurring obstacle and still have the story progress. If the damage was less severe, then it might have been able to be permanent, but as it is there isn't any way for Z&Z to do anything significant if their ability to do magic is significantly impaired.

    Maybe if the damage was something like having constant bodily pains? Or some form of numbness, partial paralysis, or even memory loss. Those could have been things that stayed throughout the story, and acted as a real consequence for the previous chapter's mistake. Even if the damage slowly healed over time, or they needed to learn something to fix it, it would have been better. Instead there wasn't any way for them to do anything meaningful while they healed, meaning that from the reader's perspective not much time was spent on the consequences.

    As an alternative, what if Z&Z needed to use crutches for the next few chapters, but they otherwise could function normally? It would be a real consequence that the reader would be reminded of, and very clearly see the results of that.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      I agree a more permanent or longer lasting effect would have been nice, but to be fair, Zorian is so accomplished that I wasn't surprised by the result. Zach *would* have been screwed out of commission for longer if Zorian hadn't been so proficient with soul magic, alchemy, and had collected information from someone like Sudomir who is well-versed in soul damage. Zorian worked long and hard for those skills---like fifty chapters---so I'm okay with him knowing what to do. It may seem like what QI did to them was dealt with anti-climactically, but I feel this chapter was the natural culmination of years of disciplined training.
      ```

      - u/Quetzhal:
        ```
        Moreover, soul mutilation on this scale has happened to Z&Z before - that time they just spent several restarts unconscious. I think this is just us being shown how much they've grown. They might not have been able to use magic, but they didn't lose any restarts this time around.
        ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        That could have been demonstrated by having the ailment normally be permanent, but through Zorian's alchemy he makes it heal in a few months. The author controls everything anyways, he can have Zorian improve the situation from "permanent" to "a few months" just as easily as he made Zach's ailment go from "he may not wake up for weeks" to "he'll be fine in a little bit".

        It doesn't matter how skilled a character is, if the author wants the audience to take injuries or setbacks seriously, we need to actually see the negative consequences of said setbacks. As it is, we were shown about as much story time spent on QI's attack's recovery as we had for Z&Z recovering from the injuries the Grey Hunter inflicted on them.

        The number of restarts remaining decreased, but that's a classic example of "tell don't show". A number that barely any audience member was tracking anyways got decreased by some amount. The plans didn't change, their ability to enact those plans didn't change, and not only did Z&Z not have any permanent consequences, they even have improved due to the injury.

        I know that we can't know the contents of the rest of the story at this point, but would the rest of the story have been significantly changed if the initial number of restarts remaining when they started tracking had been 5 fewer, and this whole subplot of QI injuring them was skipped? The thing with being injured with the Sword Divers made Zorian substantially less aggressive in gaining Aranean knowledge, and gave him a motive for revenge. He also started carrying around better suicide bomb things. The result of the current injury seems to be "Hey, let's try mind magic this time", something that would have been about equally likely to be thought of beforehand.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          !delta. I don't feel the same gravitas with this as I felt with the Sword Divers death, which I still remember quite well. Although I will note that Zorian said without his soul and mind training, the damage could well have been permanent as his soul restructured his mind to integrate his loop memories.

          In all honestly, though, I feel we'd be talking about this differently if these previous five restarts had occurred over three or four chapters where significant work was done despite not being able to do magic themselves. That would feel like serious consequences had occurred. Maybe it could go into depth about convincing Xvim sans magic---or perhaps Ilsa instead---then using whomever they recruit to help rescue Alanic and Lukath. Then they could find more to join their cause who would help them move goals forward in unexpected ways. It would be a five-month masterclass in minioning.
          ```

          - u/sicutumbo:
            ```
            > I don't feel the same gravitas with this as I felt with the Sword Divers death, which I still remember quite well.

            Precisely the point. It didn't really change anything.

            > In all honestly, though, I feel we'd be talking about this differently if these previous five restarts had occurred over three or four chapters where significant work was done despite not being able to do magic themselves.

Then they could find more to join their cause who would help them move goals forward in unexpected ways. It would be a five-month masterclass in minioning.

            While that is one solution to the problem of this chapter, I don't think it's a great solution. It would kill the pacing, and I don't think that taking a multiple update break (translated into multiple real months of time) from using magic in a story where the magic is one of the most interesting focuses. Maybe if they had never been able to convince any of the people around them before of the time loop, and they had a few restarts where they focused on doing so rather than training, but at this point it would be really slow. It's barely even mentioned at this point how they convince their teachers of the time loop, so going back to spending a lot of time doing so would be annoying.

            That said, I do commend you on offering a way of showing real consequences to Z&Z not being prepared for QI's attack. And I think it would have worked fairly well earlier on in the story. Just not at this point.
            ```

  - u/Duck_Giblets:
    ```
    To me it seemed the author rushed it a bit. Shorter than other chapters, nothing really of note happened. Read like a run down and condensed version of what happened.
    ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    Yeah it read more like a summary of a chapter than an actual chapter, its one thing being told that someone spent  a month struggling, but it doesn't have much impact if we aren't shown it
    ```

  - u/Schuano:
    ```
    I think it's a headfake.  

    They assumed that QI blew himself up in a suicide strike to hurt them.  He did.  

    They also assume QI had no way to send himself messages in the time loop.   

    I suspect that he figured out a way to send some information to himself.

    ```

- u/GodKiller999:
  ```
  That was a serious loss, but thankfully they didn't receive any permanent damage. If they manage to beat QI I'm sure there's a lot they could learn from his skeleton and whatever items he had on him at the time.
  ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  Huh.

  Unrelated to this chapter, I just realised what RR was probably up to, optimising the invasion over and over again.

  If we assume that he owned that robe (since he had it easily available at the start of the month when he attacked Zach), and is thus an inner-circle cultist, then he actually wouldn't care all that much about maximising damage. But it didn't take him long to drop off tips to the invaders, and a more effective invasion would give him more time to work on the cult's true objective.

  Remember how Zorian didn't think that their mind magic would be good enough to actually overpower the primordial? *What if they had someone who could try it over and over again in different ways, recording what worked well and what didn't?*

  We now have a motive for initiating the loop early. Not a divine failsafe to contain the primordial, as some have suggested, but a secure laboratory to determine how best to break it out and put it on a leash.
  ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    However, each time that the primordial is released, the loop ends. So isn't that a terrible way to go about trying to control the primordial?
    ```

  - u/jiffyjuff:
    ```
    I don't think the primordial itself is looped. It's pretty clear that as powerful the Sovereign\('s?\) Gate is, it's not strong enough to loop anything more than what's within this "earth plane": spiritual planes, and therefore probably primordial dimensions, are off limits. When Silverlake inspected the summoning setup, she said that it's going to the same place, but from a different perspective: thus it's likely that connecting to a primordial within the loop actually connects to the linear\-time extra\-loop primordial, and the "different perspective" is because the loop dimension is located in a different meta\-spatial position. The primordial is probably really confused about why these femtosecond\-long gates keep pinging it at incredible frequency.

    On that note, I strongly suspect that the reason for loop crash isn't something inherent to the primordial, but the time\-speed differential between the primordial\-dimension\-body and the loop world.

  It feels slightly odd that they've never revisited the coin strategy that Zorian used to beat QI the first time. Sure it's unlikely to work but they know it does banish him to his phylactery on contact if they can get him to touch it.

      they just dismissed it because it was unlikely to work but that doesn't mean it won't work. they are essentially gonna do the same thing with the whole mind thing since lich might be banished to his pylactery if he senses might tampering.

        What would it take to convince you that it won't work? Testing it? Zach *has*. He's tried to throw objects at QI a bunch of times, and QI literally handwaves them away.

        And as for having him underestimate them, to even make the attempt, they would have to appear as nonthreatening as regular academy students. Which means shutting down some portion - quite possibly a large portion - of their activities, since those activities were enough to actually attract QI's attention and have him seek them out. So making any realistic attempt at tricking him into grabbing a thrown object has a significant opportunity cost. It's not at all a free shot that they're ignoring; it's a time and resources sink with no realistic prospect of a payoff.

        Mind magic is a much more feasible approach. Since he's apparently not a psychic (based on his attack on Xvim), his only adequate defence against Zorian is Mind Blank. If Zach can dispel that, then QI can't just wave his hand and push Zorian out like he could knock away a soul coin. Either he goes mind-to-mind with Zorian and likely loses, or he evacuates and likely drops the crown.
        ```

        - u/Dismalward:
          ```
          The only reason qi met them was because their activities concerned him. They wasted multiple loop not trying it out in which he wasnt suspicious and I repeatedly emphasize they don't need to throw the ring. Literally said it in bold and you still going on about them doing it themselves.


          The author most likely wants it done THIER way and not some anticlimactic coin trickery  which has no evidence that wouldn't work within the rules of the universe other than them stating "Oh it won't work". They never even tried with other ppl and utterly dismisses it because of it breaking the authors narrative. Like I said, use the lich's arrogance against him like the first time it worked since it's not like the lich is going to be wise to the trick across loops. They don't need to beat the lich at all just get the crown and they are finally understanding that this chapter instead of all the time wasted before.
          ```

            ```
            QI can see their souls, he'd instantly see that they weren't mere academy students, which Zorian was back when he used the coin trick and convincing a proxy to do it in their place would likely prove... difficult.
            ```

            - u/Dismalward:
              ```
              They have mind magic and near-unlimited resources at their disposal. Pretty certain finding a willing (or unwilling) patsy would be easy
              ```

              - u/GodKiller999:
                ```
                Actively using magic would likely be noticeable, making it seamless without Zorian actively doing something would require deep mind modification to the victim, which is something he's unwilling to do (though I myself believe he should train the skill exactly for these kind of events).
                ```

                - u/Dismalward:
                  ```
                  he can just give it to someone and tell them it works on liches. i don't mind if the author makes it impossible but they never attempted to try instead of doing nothing at the end of the multiple wasted restarts(making the coin shouldnt be too hard and just give it to someone and hope for the best). if it works then awesome but if it doesnt its not like they invested too heavily
                  ```

                  - u/GodKiller999:
                    ```
                    The someone they gave the coin to would have to be positively insane to believe them (facing the lich is ludicrously dangerous, hence the need for mind magic) and then have good enough acting to replicate the situation Zorian was in (not to mention doing something interesting enough for QI to take notice, but not so much so that he'd consider them a danger).
                    ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        That doesn't rely on getting him to touch a physical object, which is the main obstacle. Offensive spells can punch through defenses and generally aren't affected by telekinesis, and it's been mentioned that QI is is proficient with unstructured telekinesis. A coin or other similar object would be blocked by almost any defensive spell, and could be easily deflected by almost any spell including the telekinesis mentioned above.
        ```

        - u/Dismalward:
          ```
          Well they got him by relying on his arrogance so it won't be farfetched to try the same thing again but with even more vulnerable target since it doesn't NEED to be them to flip the coin to the lich. They could even mind-control someone on lich's side or a student. They should've done it way before when they knew lich had the crown instead of doing nothing at the end of the loop where lich invades. 


          Tbh Its an easy solution thats dismissed because the author wants the lich to be defeated in their own way instead of relying on that coin trick instead of just doing that at the end of the loop instead of wasting so many loop doing nothing to the lich even by proxy.

            Maybe you're right, but I never got the sense that Z&Z were able to spy on QI enough to compel someone to touch him with a coin. To agree with you, however, it would have been cool to see Z&Z spend time trying similar tactics unsuccessfully a couple times just to convince the reader that they weren't overlooking these kinds of strategies.

      This is a great idea: If Zorian can render QI mentally powerless for the split second it takes someone to toss a coin at him, then QI is out of commission until he can find a new body. This would be enough to get the crown and dagger in the loop. Out of the loop, this solution is a good fall-back if they can't find a way to end QI permanently---though it might only buy them a little time as we know from a previous chapter that QI has extra bodies nearby.

  Hello guys,

  I learned recently that there was a thread on this subreddit each time a chapter came out, so here I am.

  Do you guys also discuss theories about where some plotlines are heading? If you do, do you have a dedicated thread for that? I have some ideas but I don't dare to post them directly in case I'm right and it ruins the fun for someone...
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    There is also the r/motheroflearning subreddit.

    I wouldn't worry about spoiling with a good guess. That's completely legitimate. It's only spoiling if you've read further than someone else, and if that's the case, they shouldn't be reading discussion threads if they're concerned.

    My own theory is that Zach will be able to exit normally, unless RR has stolen his body, but Zorian will have to bust out via the primordial prison.

    You can make a [D]iscussion thread ([example](/r/rational/comments/8cb6d8/d_mother_of_learning_does_the_time_loop_destroy/)), but posting here is absolutely fine, especially if the chapter has some new information relevant to your theories. I mean, what's the point of having these threads if not to discuss the plot and fan theories?
    ```

    - u/_Ternal_:
      ```
      Fair enough. So here I go.

      WARNING: THEORY BELOW. MIGHT BE SPOILER IF CORRECT

      One of the main issues that Zorian has to solve is about the fact that if he gets out of the loop, the original Zorian is still there with his own soul, so our Zorian has to find a way to get his body back without killing him. My theory is that he will use some form of soul magic to become something similar to a shifter (but having his own soul twice instead of two very different souls). We're told as early as chapter 29 that "shifters are people with two souls", and it seems to me to be particularly appropriate to the matter at hand.
      ```

      - u/FlameSparks:
        ```
        It is a popular theory. With what happened at the start of the chapter Zorian got a first hand experience of memory intergration without the anesthetic, this would be useful when he does get into the real world.
        ```

        - u/_Ternal_:
          ```

          ```

- u/None:
  ```
  A shame there were no lasting consequences, but perhaps there are that we haven't seen? 

  Honestly the best part of this novel is going to be when they finally escape the loop and their actions have actual consequences on the world around them.
  ```

- u/dragondraems42:
  ```
  They're still going to interact with Quatach-Ichl? That seems...unwise. If they go through even one more attack of the same caliber it would be almost impossible to escape the loop.

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    too bad they *have* to engage with him at least once more. and now they know what to expect so...

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    Risk/Reward.  19 restarts left, that's a year and a half. QI is the biggest threat IRL, and he represents direct access to one key and indirect access to another.  They *have* to interact with him a few more times just to practice getting the crown itself, and any information they can get on dunking him out of the loop would be invaluable.
    ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    It was definitely unwise. Now, with some of his secrets revealed, it's probably not so unwise to deal with QI as before.

    Besides, they need the crown. 

    Get all the relics or bust.

        QI's help is less crucial than it was. They have now had the chance to at least briefly examine the vault's wardstone, and they know how to break the tracker afterward. Busting the vault without QI would be very challenging, but has probably become possible.
        ```

        - u/pleasedothenerdful:
          ```
          They got in once before, but got harassed the rest of the restart by pursuing authorities. Now thanks to QI, they know how to keep that from happening.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Not quite. They got far enough to be tagged and tracked, yes, but on that occasion they didn't actually manage to rob the place.
            ```

  - u/mp3max:
    ```
    > That seems...unwise

    They don't have any other option though, they need to interact with QI for both the dagger and the crown, which are 100% vital.
    ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    They can either do it now, or do it when another setback would kill them for sure. The only complicating thing would be if the scepter granted then some amazing combat power, but that's rather risky.

  Nevermind, the chapter title was a bit overdramatic. Fitting, but overdramatic nonetheless.

  Tbh, I don't think it's such a bad thing for them to have taking their time off. I mean, it sucks that they were forced to lose those restarts but it doesn't hurt them to remember who they are doing those things for as well, and to rest their minds a little.
