  "Sooo... these are the three new glimwardens."

  "Yes."

  "An intellectual who likes to read about science and engineering, an intellectual who likes to read about politics, and an intellectual who likes to read about dashing heroics."

  "Yup."

  "The town is f*cked."

  EDIT: Also, being Sanders sucks. No one takes Sanders seriously. I'm hoping our resident... I was going to say psychopath, but I'm not sure it's the right word, I'm hoping Philip will teach him at least some basic sociopolitical analysis before he inevitably decides Sanders is not worth the effort.

      That fits surprisingly well, actually.

    He wants to become a dictator though, he's saying that all the time.

    Still a competent ruler.

      He seems like he would be a competent dictator as well. And one that would actually care to set up a system that doesn't just crumble or decay upon his retirement or death.

    It's not who we are in the inside that matters, it is our impact on the world.

    Philip is reminding me of Ciaphas Cain actually.

    I'll work on dialing it back a bit - thanks (as always) for the feedback.

    (For what it's worth, Sander is at least partly modeled on how I was at that age.)

    It seems to be focused on Melanie, at least in this chapter.  A guy can easily be *particularly* oblivious regarding the girl he has a crush on.  She at least tolerates him, and that's *not a "no"*.

  Last time: Philip presented an idea for filling the position of glimwarden via competition at the city council meeting, Sander went off into the woods to get some training, and I need to get better at summaries

  This time: politics, policy, and polis, new alliances, what happened at Moon Rise, and why people have horses

  A shorter talky chapter this week in exchange for a longer actiony chapter next week.

    > Politics wasn’t about policy.

    You've got to love an antihero who's influenced by Robin Hanson.

    Isnt the economic horse genocide a bit premature? If rune tractors are still expensive enough to be shared and yet the ways to central city relatively far when walking, horses shouldn't have hit their sustenance wage limit yet.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      **tl;dr: Horses are like renting, runework engines are like buying a house.**

      I haven't gone into much detail on runework yet, but a runework engine is clean, quiet, low maintenance, and runs "forever" with no need for fuel. It's a sizable initial investment, but after that you don't have upkeep costs to worry about. Because it can run all day without consuming fuel, it's better to never have one sitting idle. If you were a baker who spent an hour in the morning delivering bread, it would be an enormous waste of your resources to just park it next to your shop and have it sit idle for the other twenty-three hours of the day, when instead you could pool resources with your neighbors and share the runework cart. Typically this is structured with a long-term loan rather than an *actual* upfront payment. (A farmer will typically own their own runework tractor, because they're using it a large portion of the day.)

      A horse needs about two hectares in order to get enough food to survive, which is somewhere between four and eight times as much as a person needs (depending on the person's diet). In real-world rural areas, that's not a problem, since land is relatively cheap, but in Light's Hollow pretty much all protected land is in use. Horses need lots of equipment to be usable, plus lots of labor, plus somewhere to be stored. This is aside from dealing with all the filth they generate, which is a problem if you're using them on roads. Beyond all that, a horse is good for only a limited number of hours of labor per day.

      Some of it is also explained by legislation. Horses produce something like thirty pounds of manure a day, which is a serious problem in cities if you care about sanitation at all (and that's the say nothing of the urine). Once the horse is forced out of the city center where the majority of the population works and lives, whether by fines, fees, or blanket prohibition, horses are relegated to the outskirts ... but most of what you'd want to use a horse for is to go from the outskirts to the interior.

      Hopefully that all makes sense.

  > “People treat you differently when they know that you have money,” said Philip. He gave Sander a genuine smile. He’d had these conversations with his father, but those had been solemn affairs between teacher and student. Sander seemed to think that this problem was a stupid one that he could solve in a few hours thought.

  I like that this paragraph is the only occurrence of the word "genuine". I think Philip being amused/pleased by this situation says something about how he thinks, the I'm not sure what.

  Also, is it me or is Melanie worried by the prospect of Sanders going into danger?

    >I think Philip being amused/pleased by this situation says something about how he thinks, the I'm not sure what.

    Perhaps I'm being overgenerous to Philip, but I think he was just enjoying the chance to explain the sort of social interactions that interest him, in the way they interest him.

  I feel like I want an adjacency matrix for the lanterns. 

  Also, I've seen both sides of this conversation way too many times:

  > “Is it any good?” asked Sander.

  > “You claim to love my cooking,” replied Melanie.

  > “That sounds suspiciously like you’re avoiding my question,” said Sander. He was smiling, but she was not. “Is it any good?”

  > “It’s a traditional dish,” said Melanie. “When the first settlers founded Light’s Hollow, they had to slaughter a number of the horses and oxen that had pulled their traveling lantern along. They made noodles from the last of the flour they’d brought with them and used spring onions they found near the river.”

  > “That … is actually still not an answer,” said Sander.

  > “It’s horse,” said Melanie. “Do you like the taste of horse?”

  > “I don’t think I’ve ever tasted horse before,” said Sander. “I just wanted to know whether you liked the soup.”

  > Melanie pinched the bridge of her nose.

    If you want a non-final map, [there's this one](http://i.imgur.com/8AKepOl.jpg). Though I need to remake it with better contours and more artistry (I kind of suck at graphic design). From the top going clockwise, the lanterns are: Rogue (Challenger), Healer (Mender), Ranger, Watcher, Builder, Singer. With Chancellor's Lantern in the center.

  Isn't it weird that Philip has no experience with romantic language? He ought to have heard it in school or later in taverns, or have read it in books.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Honestly, I'm not sure what Sanders is describing actually is love, or even attraction. More like, I don't know... curiosity? Fascination? He does generally seem infatuated with her though. Maybe.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    It's not that he's unfamiliar with romantic language, it's that he's not a hundred percent sure that's what he's hearing, or if it is what he's hearing, how he's supposed to respond to it.
    ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    That was some pretty weird romantic language though.
    ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  Good chapter. I enjoyed Phillip and Sanders interactions, though I'll chip my 2 cents into the pile for toning down obliviousness a bit more. We're still getting to know both of them though, so maybe it'll fade on its own anyway. 

  Sent a typo report through the site (gotta get that plugin for mine), but quick non-spelling typo of sorts, Sanders says he has never tried horse before two times while talking to Melanie.
