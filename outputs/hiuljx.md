  > “Let me guess.”  He spoke back and forth between his two bodies.  “You tried to study, failed, then slipped into a spiral of self-loathing and apathy.  Now, you’re trying to drink away that memory.”

  As someone who read this from work, I felt personally attacked by this line.

  On the other hand,

  > There was no burst of energy or determination in my veins.  I felt as frightened and unfocused and tired as I did an hour ago.  And I wanted more than anything to get drunk, or play Jao Lu, or listen to the radio or watch something on one of those fancy new television sets.

  > I sat down at the coffee table, next to Hira.  And I flipped open the book.

  This was chilling.

  > The mobster shot his right-hand woman in the back. [...]
  >
  > The high-powered rifle round blew straight through her chest, turning her ribcage into a red hole.  She dropped to the ground, splattering blood on the train station’s floor.
  >
  > Half a dozen of the mobster’s friends aimed at Ana from the walkway two stories up [...] But they didn’t fire.  Ana had positioned herself so that the mobster was between her and them.  To hit her, they’d have to shoot through their boss.
  >
  > The mobster, affected by her illusions, aimed his battle rifle at his friends and pulled the trigger, shooting through another man’s neck.  Ana loosed a burst from her suppressed machine pistol, grazing one of them in the arm.

  Holy shit. This is awful.

  Like, just reading about this makes me super uncomfortable. They're slaughtering these people like lambs.

  > “Alright,” he sighed.  “We got them.  And we got the illusion girl first.  Is everyone alright?  Sound off.”
  >
  > Ana shot him in the back of the head. [...]

  What the fuck.

  > The man dropped to the ground.  Ana exhaled, taking deep breaths, and the energy seemed to drain out of her.  She rubbed the circles under her eyes, stretched her neck, and straightened herself up, adopting a cold, flat expression.
  >
  > “Brin didn’t say we had to kill the target,” I said.
  >
  > “He didn’t say we had to spare him, either.”  Ana stuffed her gun into a holster on her thin blue combat suit.  “Come on.  We’ve got a bounty to collect.”

  ... Wow. That was *really* fast. I mean, from our perspective. From hers, she's been doing this for a month.

  But still, I'm shocked. She went from "lethal force is not an option" to shooting people in the head because it's tidier that way in a really short timespan.

  I like that we've sort of montaged the gang into being actually competent, ruthless mercenaries without skipping past any of the difficult interpersonal stuff or character growth. 

  Ana is sort of the exception there, but I'd hesitate to call the changes to her character "growth," and it's the sort of thing I can understand as being a result of her circumstances. She's being forced to confront more and more situations where lethal force is the only option, what few friends she had she's losing (Kaplen's suicide and Wes' betrayal), the situation with her body is accelerating as time passes and she takes more injuries that won't ever heal right, and to top it all off people are actively trying to drive her away from Tasia, who is her sole remaining friend and the only good thing in her life right now. Of *course* she's becoming bitter and jaded and all too willing to use lethal force. I'd still welcome a chapter from her perspective, of course, to see the specifics and nuances of her new outlook, but the fact that she has a new outlook is hardly a surprise.

  Really enjoyed the chapter, thank you.  
  Looking forward to the next Ana chapter, now that she seems willing to not only kill in self-defense but kill people that have already been incapacitated, it'll be interesting to hear her reasoning for not just taking their bodies then killing them.

    Story does a good job of making him look like a complete piece of shit, but relatable enough that when you're in his perspective you can see why he thinks all the stupid shit he does.
