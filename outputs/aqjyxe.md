  Not sure why the officer bothered to actually do everything he did there in the end. He could have just thought about it. After all, it's the thought that counts.

  That was far too much fun. When the officer was trying to look a gift horse in the mouth harder than the doctor  could beg i started losing it.

  Scott Alexander (the author of Unsong) posted a new short story. 

  I don't really know that it is particularly rational, but considering Unsong is a sort of honorary rational story I figured people here might like to read it.

    Not a mod, but this is definitely self-consistently rational.

  This is [Anglophysics](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/13/the-proverbial-murder-mystery/) 2.0. I love it.

  Gonna have to start using that when my seasonal affective disorder flares up again.  Or when another snowstorm takes out the power.

  This was hilarious.

  I was expecting "beggars can't be choosers" to bite LaShay in the end (but maybe it did, implicitly).

- u/None:
  ```
  Twists like this, where it turns out all of the jokes and references aren't actually pure entertainment, but important clues the author knew the reader would gloss over, are honestly the best.
  ```

  ```
  Huh, that last fight reminds me of Cat manipulating stories in A Practical Guide to Evil, just on a smaller scale.
  ```
