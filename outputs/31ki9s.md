  This whole book was a wonderful rational read. In addition to being informative and entertaining, it shows that you can approach more or less any serious question scientifically and arrive at a reasonable answer.

    For a given value of "reasonable".

    I have (and love) this book, and it is certainly logical, but I'm not sure you have a very strong argument that calculating the electical output of Yoda is very reasonable...
