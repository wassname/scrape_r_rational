  There's a theme I'm noticing in Worm fan-fiction that's a solid departure from the original: The main characters get time to set up. 

  Original-Taylor never got enough time to be *ready*, although she did get time to prepare. Partly that's her own fault - that first night out, before everything was done, but that's *almost* the only time she actually get enough time to get ready for something.
  ```

    And it's especially bad when you have characters like this that can get so much more powerful.

    They're lucky Worm has like three or four good monkeywrenches to throw into things (and a few bad ones) but even then it doesn't always balance out.

    There's solid in-universe reasons for that, as well. It was all a conspiracy by ~~The Simurgh Eden Coil~~ Cauldron.
    ```

      I'm not sure that I can agree 'Contessa/Simurgh did it' is a solid reason :D

      Just a universal one.
      ```

        ```
        Contessa did it is only a good reason if she was there. She doesn't have the butterfly powers The Simurgh has.
        ```

          She kind of does. In the same way that Dumbledore in HPMOR [](#s "Uses Prophecy to perform actions he knows must be done but doesn't understand") to reach a given outcome, so too can Path to Victory.

          Maybe she lets a dog loose that runs into traffic that causes a pileup which causes someone to be late for work which causes a business deal to fall through which makes someone homeless where they meet someone else who is important for them to influence.

          Butterfly is the name of the game with PtV

            Yeah, the difference is that the Simurgh always knows exactly what it is she is doing.
            ```

      Hahahah. Yah. Worm was great that way - everything DID make sense, in the end, because Freaky Shit and Broken Powers.

      Also, just got to first Endbringer fight. Not a deathstar, but still...

      I think it's a third category.  To people who like rational and rationalist stories, it's soothing psuedo-intellectual pablum.

  I know it's weird to complain about breaking laws of physics when there's Magic going on, but she can apparently build "catalytic water converter" that turns water into h2 + o2 without energy input. And then they are worried about water tank size :)

  Also that's using Tony Stark physics not tinkerer's physics.

  Decent start, but the writing is *very* stilted the first couple of chapters.

  Does it improve?

        Oh, no, there's tons of drek out there.  Most of the crappy ones just die out quickly.  This one is middling.  The not-great writing is buoyed by the conceit.
        ```

        - u/blazinghand:
          ```
          There's also a lot of writing (in general, but also for fanfics) that falls into the category of "fairly crappy, but some parts of it are appealing to some people" in every genre. If we're going to stick to fanfiction, there are a lot truly awful of Harry Potter fanfictions that are like 400k+ words (and some over a million words) with many, many reviews and favorites on fanfiction.net
          ```

          >Conceit

          Explain? A story having excessive pride in itself does not seem a positive.
          ```

            Hm.  I meant it in the secondary meaning of a central concept/theme, but the precise definition doesn't really match what I had in my head.  Rephrase as "The writing isn't great, but not so bad I can't enjoy watching a fully OP Marvel character wreck the wormverse."
            ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              Ah, I see. 

              I'll pass on it; the writing is too much of a distraction for me. Hard to see the forest when the trees are blocking the way.
              ```
