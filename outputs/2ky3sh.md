## [Image] With RaNoWriMo starting tomorrow, I've had to distract my anxiety about this being my first attempt - so I spent today making a cover for my story.

  Is this a standalone Fallout/MLP, or based on the excellent [Fallout Equestria](http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-fallout-equestria.html)? Either way, I'm looking forward to it.

  You know, I find it funny how much MLP fanfic I consume when I've never seen what it's based on...

    The best way to describe it is probably as a "parallel universe" to the original FO:E. Some settings, characters, an overall world-building will look similar, but nothing is going to be exactly the same - the story will be mostly original in plot and character.

    For example, I plan on keeping Tenpony Tower, but DJ-Pon3 may or may not stay (and will be a very different character even if she does).
    ```

  Wow, good luck with this. Fallout doesn't lend itself to rationalism very well (post-nukes: yes, the way it's presented in the games: no) and FO:E is just Fallout with ponies spraypainted on top of it. Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

    Ehh, necromancy based nukes actually explain a lot. I'd say it's a more internally consistent world in a lot of ways.

      Well, sure, I agree that the magical nukes made the consequences much more reasonable then "radiation did it" in base Fallout, but FO:E follows the exact same plot as Fallout 3 with only slight variations and flashbacks, and a different ending. It still takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to be fine with the absurd ratio of insane bandits to people they could actually be banditting, 200 years after the megaspells/bombs dropped, not to mention how pockets of <=50 people could survive in vaults for centuries with not even cultural drift.
      ```

      - u/JoshuaBlaine:
        ```
        Yeah, the bandit ratio is just insane. They've always been the biggest thorn in my suspension of disbelief in regards to Fallout stuff, so you can expect my story to basically not have raiders anything like the Fallout ones - and much less too.
        ```
