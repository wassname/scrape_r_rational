## Found an old list of writing tips from EY in my comment history. It's interesting to compare it with later "Writing Intelligent Characters" series.

  The funniest thing (in light of recent revelations) is the quote about the Riddle/Hermione shipping fic. I'm not particularly familiar with the HP fanfic genres so that one was news to me.

    Oh, it's fairly common to have Hermione thrown back in time for some reason, just so that she can fall in love with Tom. Looking at the list of [most-favorited romance stories featuring Tom Riddle,](https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&g1=2&lan=1&r=10&c1=1962) I see that most of them have either Hermione or Harry as his partner.

      Eh, that's not a surprise. The three most developed characters in the books were Harry Potter, Hermione and Tom Riddle. Of course stories pairing them were bound to exist. Also...rule 34...

    I think he might be vain enough to only appear if you call his name at least three times.
