  Rationalist fiction can *absolutely* be set in an irrational-seeming world (see: HPMOR). That said, it's a fun-sounding premise - I look forward to reading it.

  Ohohoho.

  >all the rationalism in the world won't be enough to completely solve the problems Eden faces.

  That generally goes without saying when the technological imbalance includes nanotechnology.

    I may have [clapped my hands in glee](http://i.imgur.com/3WhHRo8.jpg) when I got that review.

    I don't think the needles count as nanotech, since they're organic, but yeah, same principle. Glad to hear (so far) that this still qualifies as rationalist! I guess I was putting too much weight on the 'plot puzzle' element.

      Emotional punishment and body horror are both fun for me to read (and write, my god), so I'm prioritizing this story. c:

      ["Wet" nanomachines are a thing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_nanotechnology) Ribosomes and enzymes qualify as nanoassemblers, though they aren't quite general. Have you seen the animated renders of [organic molecules doing their thing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-uuk4Pr2i8)

      The sidebar is more what you'd call "guidelines" than actual rules. But the plot puzzle element doesn't necessitate that the problem is actually *solvable,* just that the information that goes into character conclusions and decisions is made available to the reader so they have competitive ground with the main character.

  Finished your book, it was good. I really enjoyed that all three of the main characters felt real and like they were making the best decision from *their* point of view, which leads to fucked up conflicts and situations.

  Reading your book reminded me of the same mental beating that reading Blindsight or Echopraxia gave me, and I'm starting to think I might be an intellectual masochist.

  I look forward to reading a sequel if you end up writing one!

    50% of the way through. I'm liking that Veronica's secret isn't actually stated (so far), but it's not exactly hard to figure out, either, unless I'm making a hilarious mistake. I also like that she's a shitty person regardless, I expect no special treatment from RT authors.

    The mock murder was agony, even worse than Ted's bowels being turned to soup. There's something about teeth caving in and/or breaking that seems so much more horrifying to me.
