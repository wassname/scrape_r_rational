## Divining values from a percentage seer and a customized RNG.

### Post:

**Context**

In the web serial Worm, there is a character whose power is to ask (or be asked) a question about the chance of a future event or state occurring, and then to know the percentage of all possible futures which observably match the requested event/state. Unfortunately, the seer has a soft limit of somewhere around 10 questions per day, with each question resulting in more pain until it becomes debilitating.

For example, one could ask for the percentage chance of a coil flip resulting in heads, and they might receive an answer along the lines of "49.995289%". In this example, the seer is picturing a future in which they observe the coin resulting in heads, then automatically receiving a percentage of all possible futures in which their observations sufficiently match their envisioned future. If you received an answer such as "12.958234%" on a coin-flip question, you would have to then consider the possibility that something is going to either control the results of the flip (such as another power), or that the seer has a high chance of being prevented from observing the result, or that something may prevent the flip in the first place.

In the fanfic "Finding the Path", a fanfiction of Worm, that seer is given a computer which generates a random number, in which all possible random numbers have a preset and different chance. It also has the ability to do a lookup on that chance to determine which random number has it. Using this tool, the seer can ask a question such as "What is the chance that the killer's phone number will appear on this device when I press the button?" When the power responds "14.234215%", the seer can press the button, see \*a\* number show up (doesn't matter what it actually says), then look up "14.234215%" to find out that only "6278199231" has that percentage chance of being shown. The seer then can conclude that the killer's phone number is 627-819-9231.

Of course, this is contingent on either accepting that the seer can ask questions about the chance of something occurring which matches a variable they don't yet know, or that we accept that the seer will later on find out in an after-action report that the killer's phone number was that, and therefor satisfy their question. (Perhaps it is better worded as "What is the chance that this computer will show the number I will eventually know is the killer's phone number?") (***And*** that the power somehow doesn't take into account the RNG's generating methodology, or that it is somehow ***actually truly random.***) While these are fairly obvious problems, please ignore them for the purposes of this prompt unless you believe you have something additional to state about them.

**Questions**

Based on the above context, I have the following questions I would like to pose:

* Is the methodology given sound? Are there any faults you can find in it, and how might you go about solving them?
* Based upon your understanding of the power, is there a better way to go about leveraging it?
* How would you go about fooling such a power (or the methodology) if you were acting against them? How would you go about preventing those methods of fooling it?

  It's easy to get around that. "When I look at the number that this machine shows, I will dial it. What are the odds that the killer will answer?"

  After looking at the current number, dial it. (Odds are you'll get a wrong number, but do so anyway). *Then* check the odds in the machine and dial the number that matches the odds given.

  --------------

  The killer can easily fool such a power, if he knows that this trick is being used. He merely needs to have two phones. If the number for Phone A has a 0.003% chance of turning up in your RNG, and the number for Phone B has a 0.001% chance of turning up, then the odds of a successful number turning up are 0.004% - but the single number that turns up at 0.004% probability is the wrong number. (Note that, if your machine returns every possible telephone number, then any individual one will have very low odds).

    The probability that a number is the killers number is not the same as the probability that the killer answers your call. 

    The killer could have their phone off or on silent, (in which case the probability is near zero regardless of the number shown) or the phone might randomly malfunction in some universes and not in others (in which case the probability is lower than the one matching their phone number).

  The problem with this is that your answer doesn't *actually* have that many bits of precision. There is always a non-zero chance that your mouse will fail, your electricity will cut out, a cosmic ray will flip a bit, the earth will explode, etc, and so if you're depending on the nth bit of the result to signal information you're going to be wrong.

  With your example, there are 9,999,999,999 valid phone numbers just in the US. You'd have to split a percentile into that many unique buckets, but your answer always has some epsilon of uncertainty which is more and more significant with the number of buckets you have.

  The better way to do it would have n buckets and an n-arity partition search. A phone number is only ~34 bits of entropy, and you can use your scheme to narrow into a lot more than 2 buckets each step. (1,2) has a 1% chance, (2,3) has a 2% chance, etc., then ask for the probability of the phone number being greater than the first element of the random number pair times a billion and less than the second number times a billion. Round the probability to the nearest chance, and you know it's within the range. Repeat with (1.1,1.2) etc. until you're narrowed down.

  You'd have to experiment with the error rate, but you could probably get a very large n, and at each iteration you're sure you didn't make a mistake - if you accidentally round to the wrong bucket, when you ask the question it'd say it only has a 0.0000001% chance of being correct because none of the possible outputs contain the phone number unless you get bitflips.

  There is a ~0.01% chance of a power outage or distraction, so the *proper* random number corresponding to the phone is 14.242574%, not 14.234215%.
