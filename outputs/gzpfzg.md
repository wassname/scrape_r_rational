  There's a worldbuilding and writing thread posted every Wednesday for exactly this kind of question.
  [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gvvlgq/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/) last week's, but, given that it's Tuesday, you might just want to wait until tomorrow, when this week's will be posted.
