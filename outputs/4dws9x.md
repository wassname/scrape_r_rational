## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I've been playing a lot of Factorio lately, and highly recommend it. It's all about automation, and automation for the automation, and automation for the automation of the automation, and logistics chains. (I use Bob's Mods for the extra logistic difficulty.)

    Factorio reminds me a lot of three Zacktronics games: Spacechem, Infinifactory, and TIS-1000. If you enjoy Factorio's factory-making you might well enjoy one or more of those as well. 

    Infinifactory is a 3d first-person factory making game where you have inputs and have to create outputs by manipulating blocks with e.g. conveyor belts, lasers, rotators, welders, etc.  

    Spacechem is a chemisty-themed puzzle game where you have to make outputs out of inputs and do things like make water by bonding hydrogens to oxygen, or fuse hydrogens into carbon and then make carbon steel, or whatever. 

    TIS-1000 is a programming themed game where you have a very simple assembly language and a grid of low quality computers, and have to solve problems like finding the maximum of a string of numbers and outputting it.

    If you like even one of these games I would not be surprised if you like all three.

    I played Factorio, but quickly became frustrated at my lack of large scale design ability. Do you have any advice for someone who keeps hitting a wall where my small scale solutions work great, but become a horrible mess when I try to integrate them all together?  

    I feel like I have this same problem when writing software, and I'm not quite sure what I'm missing here or how I should be thinking about the process differently.

      The biggest thing you should learn to do is to create a main bus where you put the ingredients you need to make things work. [Here's an example](http://i.imgur.com/yvjgVSx.jpg). So you have a river of basic ingredients running through the factory, and you pull from it with splitters and underground belt when you need them. Each assembly area can then be fairly self-contained, and the problems get a lot smaller because if you're setting up (for example) a place where you're making belts, you don't really need to think about where the inputs are coming from, because you already handled getting all the materials earlier on.

      Another tip is to give yourself plenty of space. It's fun to find compact, efficient designs, but most of the time the only penalty for not using them is that you have a slightly larger space to defend. Trying to cram things in makes the logistics a lot more difficult.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        They get really inefficient as soon as you reach like 20 item categories. Soon you spent much of your time laying out an increasingly wide bus system.

        So it isn't a scalable system.

    I thought basically the same thing while watching the movie. The character doesn't have to be a rationalist to actually use their abilities in a remotely clever way. 

    The thing about this kind of movie is that the makers clearly wanted to tell a particular kind of story, that had nothing to do with the time travel aspect, and as a result the time travel was never fully explored. 

    To people with strong munchkin instincts something in a movie with immense implications not being well utilized can be very frustrating but alas we must put up with most movie protagonists being about as smart as a average middle schooler.

    As a unrelated point I really wish it was standard to include a tag for movies that are depressing af.

        > imagine munchkinning this setup. You can try going back in time decades with memorized advances in specific fields, setting science forward more and more each time. Getting rich is trivially easy. Getting powerful, actually changing things, probably less so.

        [Qualia the Purple,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia_the_Purple) which has been recommended here several times, does this.

        > I wonder if there isn't a cabal of time travellers who secretely run the entire world with their power [..] â€œ.. they'll send time travelling ninjas to kill you as a fetus."

        [Thursday Next](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Next) has this, and also plays with some neat experimental ideas.
        ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        The problem is that it doesn't make any sense for the world to secretly be ruled by time travelers because such a world would be so vastly (and obviously) different from our own. 

        Effectively by piggybacking information arbitrarily far back into the past it seems inevitable that as soon as you get some time travelers who know what the hell they're doing, you will almost inevitably get a singularity, spreading back as far as anyone has had these powers.

        But that's kind of how things go, with nearly any setting with any time travel that can do much.

        As for the trigger thing, well i'm not sure just being depressing is really a "trigger" so i'm not sure such a thing would exist. Still i've heard a lot of people complain about movies that totally blindside you by suddenly getting seriously sad part way through. The classic example is marley and me, which I never saw for that reason. I mean can you imagine if a massive number of comedies turned into horror films part way through.

    I really liked it. Sure, he's a bit short-sighted, but you could say the same of pretty much any movie protagonist. Not every story can be rational, just like not every story can be a romance, or a space opera; some stories in possibility space are both good and rationality-incompatible. The protagonist's antics are funny, and there's a lot you only get to learn about the world and the characters by seeing how they act in different timelines.

    Also, your feminist critique rubs me the wrong way. A big part of the story is the father-son relationship, which would be lost somewhat if it were a father-son-daughter-mother relationship. Not to say that the alternate universe gender-inclusive It's About Time wouldn't be good too, but they're *different movies*, and I hate it when people act like the writer and director are committing some kind of cosmic wrong by making the movie they want to make instead of a similar movie with the same characters but an entirely different plot.

    >Their first child, Posy, is born. Tim's sister, Kit, has not been so lucky and her unhappy relationship, failure to find a career, and drinking lead her to crash her car on the same day as Posy's first birthday. Kit (his sister) is seriously hurt but begins to make a good recovery. Tim decides to intervene in her life and does so by preventing her from meeting her boyfriend. When he returns to the present time, he finds Posy (his daughter) has never been born and that he has a son instead. His father explains that travelling back to change things before his children were born would mean those children would not be born. Thus, any events that occurred before Posy's birth cannot be changed, and Tim must accept the consequences as a normal person would. Tim accepts he cannot change Kit's life by changing her past but he and Mary help her to change her life in the present.

    Several years ago I was making my first character on World of Warcraft and couldn't think of a good name. So I decided to just hit the name randomizer and got Luminnaran.

    After that I started using Luminnaran as my name everywhere online and and so when I joined reddit (I was a pretty late adopter of reddit as my main source of information) it was an obvious choice to simply continue using the same internet name I had been using for years.

  Well, I don't have a new load until tomorrow at 1100 EST, so I have a little time to think.

  I am closing in on acquiring a patent for what might literally be a game-changing space propulsion method, that can utilize pre-existing space-proven fuel-based propulsion technologies to perform interplanetary-range missions both rapidly enough for commercial exploitation and more efficiently than any current rocketry method.  My last examiner interaction was an Ex Parte Quayle action, meaning it was patentable, but I had some cleanup on non-claim issues to take care of.  That claim had too many limitations, due to my only recently determining how to use wording in a claim to more precisely define my claim.  I have resubmitted, with a couple earlier limitations removed.

  I believe I will have the patent in a few months.  Supposing nobody comes forward with a publication that predates my patent application process, but was overlooked by the entire space propulsion community, what in the heck am I going to do with it?

  I have no meaningful ties to anyone in the space science community.  I have no experience with dealing with a patent.  I'm afraid to sell the thing, because I don't want it locked in a box by some corporation.  I don't particularly want to administer the thing (no experience, again.)

  I'm also refusing to allow myself to look too forward and collect eggs for only one basket.  As I mentioned in a recent thread, I'm currently a professional truck driver, and that's not changing until I get other money in hand, if this ever generates income.  The return from this could be anywhere from zero to licensing fees that might mean I never have to work again.

  I have considered a Kickstarter to put it into public domain, but I have my doubts about how well that would actually work, and what I'd offer for rewards and stretch goals.

  I'm also considering holding onto it, pinching my nose, and dealing with lawyers and licensing agents to administer the thing, because I know I can trust myself to not lock it in a box somewhere.

  Anyone here know of an example of an outsider in a field generating a game-breaking patent, and not making a horrible mash of introducing/administering it?

  I'll say again, that I do not have the patent yet, but every office action gets me closer.  The concept is patentable, it's a matter of what limits I'll be forced to accept.

  - u/TennisMaster2:

    I assume you don't have the time, skills, or funds to create an appealing video that explains the idea well.  Do a small Kickstarter for those funds, then hire someone to make that video.  Then do a huge Kickstarter promising increasing levels of involvement with getting the idea into some phase of production, mainly by making contact with you a scarce commodity.  The goal of the huge Kickstarter will be to generate media attention, and the attention of Elon Musk or his competitor-colleagues in private and governmental space travel.  Say you need the money in order to be able to spend your time getting the idea into some phase of production, and that all leftover will go straight to making the project not so large of a money sink for whatever entity decides to invest in the idea.

    Again, the idea is to get PR and funding so you can spend more time getting access to people with the power to get it done.

    An easier route might be pm'ing Eliezer this comment, asking if he's still in contact with Peter Thiel, who can then be the power broker between you and Elon Musk.  Before that, e-mail one or a few respected Professor(s) of the pertinent field your patent and the idea, asking if they would invest in it had they the funds, or just what they think of the idea.  Use that to get enough credibility to make clear to the power broker that the risk of embarrassment and time wasting is low.

    Another way would be e-mailing engineers at SpaceX, NASA, etc. your patent and the idea, requesting they bring it up to their superiors if they find the idea something worth pursuing.  Before that, though, you need to decide what deal you are comfortable accepting.

    I did some Googling and found an article about a movie star who got a [patent](https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/07/25/hedy-lamarr-the-inventor/) which helped significantly in WWII. It was probably easier for her due to having the fame to make connections with the relevant people, but she was still an outsider.

    I have a question about patents. If you are the 'owner' of an idea, does that mean people can't use the concept in their own projects without your permission, or they just can't use it to make money, or what? It's just very confusing on how one can 'control' an idea and I can't find anything which explains it clearly enough for me.

    Thanks!

      A method patent is much the same as a device patent.  The smaller the actors are who implement the patented idea/item, the harder it is to enforce.

      For example, if you try to patent something like tying little balloons into dog-shaped knots, you probably aren't going to be able to enforce it, even if it is valid.  Every clown in the universe would ignore your patent.  The balloon makers can't be held responsible either, they just make balloons.

      Now, if you were to patent a new eating utensil, you wouldn't try to enforce the patent on people using them, you would enforce it on people making and selling the utensils.

      In my case, there are very few actors involved in the space propulsion industry.

  *On this site, are you more likely to downvote a submission or to hide it?*

  When I browse r/all, I typically upvote between five and fifteen percent of the submissions and hide all the others, starting from the top and working my way downward through a fifty-item page before refreshing and starting again (until I get bored, which typically takes only one or two pages). Downvotes are relatively rare, and are reserved for items that I *thoroughly* dislike--most often, something from r/UpliftingNews concerning money that's being spent on animals. I sometimes think that I should be more strategic and downvote *everything* that I consider to have risen above its proper station, though, rather than merely hiding it from my sight.

  Mr. Yudkowsky made a fairly-funny post on Facebook making light of [Mr. Alexander's facetiously calling him the rightful Caliph of Rationality](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement)--but then [he deleted it](http://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/142425293256). When I originally saw it, I considered making a screenshot of it, but decided against it, considering it not funny enough to be worth much [prestige](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Prestige) here (let alone funny enough for me to save for my personal satisfaction)--and now it's lost forever.

  It can't be denied that [Chatoyance](http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&user=1291), of so much infamy in the *Friendship Is Magic* fandom, has been a very prolific creator--and it always bears remembering that, even if you dislike the *majority* of a person's work, there may still be *something* of interest to you buried deep within his accumulated corpus. Several years ago (well before the start of *Friendship Is Magic*, I think), I somehow happened to stumble on [this ancient comic](http://unicornjelly.com), which was started by her way all the way back in 2000. I vaguely remember reading several dozen pages of it before getting confused/bored/something and leaving the site--but the art definitely is *quite* exquisite. Likewise, I personally didn't have too much liking for the art style of [this other comic of hers](http://pasteldefender.com), and dropped it after not too many pages, but I did find the worldbuilding ([this panel](http://pasteldefender.com/images/007.jpg), at the very least) to be fairly interesting.

  (Unlike FanFiction.net, FIMFiction.net lacks ID-based links to authors' profiles--so, if I link directly to a person's FIMFiction.net profile, that link will break if the person changes his profile's name. Sigh...)

  Some other fun comics:  
  \- [*Oglaf*](http://oglaf.com): Often, but not always, intercourse-related  
  \- [*Whomp!*](http://www.whompcomic.com): r/meirl personified  
  \- [*Sally Forth*](http://comicskingdom.com/sally-forth): Contains Ted Forth, who's probably tied for the position of my favorite newspaper-comic character  
  \- [*FoxTrot*](http://www.foxtrot.com): Contains Jason Fox, who's probably tied for the position of my favorite newspaper-comic character  
  \- [*Dilbert*](http://dilbert.com): Office humor (Has been using guest artists for a few weeks, while the author is on vacation)  
  \- [*Junior Scientist Power Hour*](http://www.jspowerhour.com): Slice-of-life humor  
  \- [*The Non-Adventures of Wonderella*](http://nonadventures.com): Superhero humor  
  \- [*Invisible Bread*](http://invisiblebread.com): Stick-figure humor  
  \- [*Leftover Soup*](http://leftoversoup.com): A grab-bag (irksomely lacks an RSS feed)

    On r/rational:

    I upvote all rational fiction I see, even if I'm not a reader of it, because I want to encourage authors and people who share. I also upvote the weekly discussion threads and challenges. 

    I tend to downvote discussion threads like "Rational X???" since I want to signal boost content over discussion. However, I will upvote or ignore these threads sometimes if they are good or if the author's post is very good. I tend to ignore (neither upvote nor downvote) very few threads. I almost always vote.

    Of the current 25 highest posts (sorted by hot) on r/rational I have upvoted all of them, except Orange Mind, Indie Fund, Interesting Study, and Rationalist Diablo???-- this is a usual rate of upvoting, 85%, for me.

    You can use http://feed43.com/4888272440688468.xml to get an RSS feed of Leftover Soup. It doesn't actually link to it for some reason, but it tells you when it updates.

    ```
    > Mr. Yudkowsky made a fairly-funny post on Facebook making light of Mr. Alexander's facetiously calling him the rightful Caliph of Rationality--but then he deleted it. When I originally saw it, I considered making a screenshot of it, but decided against it, considering it not funny enough to be worth much prestige here (let alone funny enough for me to save for my personal satisfaction)--and now it's lost forever. Sigh... Well, I guess I'll be less complacent in the future.

    Also, not saving other people's stuff against their will when they decide to delete it is polite.  Also, there wasn't a reaction face for, "I'm pretty sure 'rationality' shouldn't have a caliph"?  Or for, "HERESY!"?  Come on, man, where's my HERESYBLAM icon when I need it?

    Another vote for worldbuilding of the unicorn jelly comic. Awesome reveals and twists etc.

    Caelum est Conterrens = Unicorn Jelly!?  I feel like somebody realizing that HPMOR = Sequences for the first time, that webcomic was *awesome.*

    > On this site, are you more likely to downvote a submission or to hide it?

    Same policy as you, basically - and the same for upvotes. I seriously have to think a submission is good/bad for a sub to bother with the extra click. I'm also more likely to vote in small subs than big ones, since I have a bigger impact and usually care more about that community.

    > When I originally saw it, I considered making a screenshot of it, but decided against it, considering it not funny enough to be worth much prestige here

    As curious as deleted posts instinctively make me, I would have respected you less if you had shared a copy of it, and disapprove of the attempt. I support people's right to delete their own posts, because the alternative is a lot of interesting posts not getting written at all.

    > Leftover Soup: A grab-bag (irksomely lacks an RSS feed)

    News to me, I can read it through feedly just fine. Maybe it's some internal feedly magic.

      > News to me, I can read it through feedly just fine.

      About a year ago, the author [mentioned](http://tailsteak.com/reviews/woohooligan.html) that he should do things that respectable webcomic authors did, including setting up a working RSS feed. At that time, the RSS feed had stopped working. Now that I check on Feedly again, I see both a dead feed (last updated almost two years ago) and a live one, which I assume was set up more recently than when I last checked.
