  I liked this chapter much more than the previous ones. It flowed very nicely, and was quite enjoyable.

  First off, a request:  can you make the text on your site darker?  The light grey is hard to read.

  I was really interested by the experimentation that you had Naruto doing with the clones in the beginning.  If I have it right, each time he summons clones his chakra pool divides evenly between them, and so on down the chain.  Therefore, if he starts with 1,000 chakra:

  * Summon clone A1, each body now has 500
  * Clone A1 then summons 9 clones.  Original now has 500, A1-10 each have 50
  * Original summons 4 clones (B-E).  He and B-E now have 100, A1-10 still have 50.

  Is that right?

  A couple of questions:

  > he had no one “real” body, and if ever he had only one body left then that’d be the one that became “real” again, 

  Shadow clones vanish if they bite their tongues, normal people don't.  So,

  * If Naruto has no shadow clones out at the moment and he bites his tongue, does he vanish?  
  * If he had one shadow clone out and his original body bites his tongue, does it vanish?  
  * If the shadow clone then bites its tongue, does *it* vanish?
  * If both bodies are punched at the same time, do they both vanish?

  Also:

  > he took damage in proportion to the number of bodies he had active to spread an injury out over

  So, he has two bodies out (one original, one clone).  One of his bodies is stabbed with a knife and vanishes.  Does half of the wound appear on the other body?  If so, what does "half a wound" look like?

  When a clone pops, do its memories go:

  * to the original body
  * to whoever created it
  * to all current bodies?

  Do Naruto and his clones constitute a hive mind, or when he "has a clone" do something, is he yelling orders to it?

  Last question:  you've changed how the kawarimi works -- in canon a ninja can substitute with any inanimate object, but now it sounds like they have to have prepared the object first.  Why the change?

    I've changed the wordpress theme to something with darker text, now.

    Commenter Kaukamieli has answered most of your questions, but I'll clarify that when a new shadow clone is summoned his consciousness branches off from the original, so he'll be aware of what "he" had been intending to do with himself, but any new decisions thereafter would have to be communicated in speech. There is no special awareness of the thoughts of any other active clones, until they die.

    When popped, a shadow clone's memories go to all current bodies, offering another avenue of communication for anyone willing to burst themselves to send a "message" in their thoughts.

      Thank you!  This is much better.

    The amount of chakra might not be quite like that. I didn't calculate anything but I thought there is some fixed or flexible cost too, like 100 or 5% chakra for using the kagebunshin at all. Everything should have a loss methinks.

    > If Naruto has no shadow clones out at the moment and he bites his tongue, does he vanish?

    Do you? :)

    > If he had one shadow clone out and his original body bites his tongue, does it vanish?

    Apparently yes, as there is no "original body". I think this fails here when one of the Narutos has the forehead protector and others don't, so clearly there is something like that, or does some clone get that randomly?

    > Do Naruto and his clones constitute a hive mind, or when he "has a clone" do something, is he yelling orders to it?

    They think like him and they literally just have thought about whatever he had thought so they totally know what to do even without mental link after the summoning.

    > Last question: you've changed how the kawarimi works -- in canon a ninja can substitute with any inanimate object, but now it sounds like they have to have prepared the object first. Why the change?

    Probably because it's overpowered bullshit? :D

    edit: Extending on the last bit, it's overpowered because it's not really explained and has no real limits. It's literally the power of the plot protecting people. Ooh you got hit with this killer tech? KAWARIMI!
