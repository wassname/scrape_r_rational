## What would be the consequences of a Fountain of Youth?

### Post:

In fiction these are often in remote hard to reach places. But after initial discovery, I suspect a very well paved and maintained toll road shipping the stuff by the barrel will pop up quickly. So what economic effects would this have on a medieval setting. Say the Vikings discover such a fountain in Iceland. Produces a litre a second. Consuming a teaspoon de ages you by a decade and cures all diseases, ailments, and injuries. Side effects, over consuming won't de age you past 10 but can turn men into girls.

  [This is a great exploration of the topic](http://qntm.org/jesus). It's part of *Ra* by Sam Hughes, but can be read without reading any other parts of the series.

We spin more numbers and simulations and we see the machine being reverse-engineered, and the principles it applies being adapted for purposes other than the immediate, perfect restoration of living and dead humans. Mr Grey, you've seen how easy it is to heal. Can you imagine how easy it'll become to kill? [...] Death surrounds this machine, like a curse."

    This is the argument against _any_ technological or scientific advancement. In this case what he's really saying is "We don't want humans as a whole learning what we know". He's saying "We like being the only immortals around". He's saying "We're already in the _'Medical technology is deliberately stalled and never reaches the pinnacle it should.'_" scenario. He's saying "We're not going to let you mere mortals _discover_ this either."

      Yep, and having read all of _Ra_, that's entirely in character for them.

        Sure, but it means it's not something that should be taken at face value in this discussion. \^\^

  Interestingly, (a litre per second)*(decade per teaspoon)=60 billion people can be kept young and healthy by this. 

  Someone will conquer it, use it for them and theirs. They'll need a young, healthy army to defend it. They'll also need to provide water in some quantity to leaders/nobility/upper classes of other nations, or they'll face a world united against them. Nation (or at least its leader) owning the fountain becomes obscenely wealthy.

  Don't forget "figure out how it works and see if you can reproduce it". You'll have alchemists, philosophers, hedge-witches and barber-surgeons and all manner of people trying to find a way to duplicate the effect.

  Speaking of reproducing, a better way to nerf it is that it renders you sterile. That cuts down the "immortals population explosion" problem as well as providing a disincentive to using it.

  The description says that overconsuming turns men into girls.  People have been responding as if normal use turns men into girls, which is not how I read it.  If only overconsuming turns men into girls, and normal usage does not, you basically have a separate fountain of youth and a youth gender change spell.

  Were you serious about the last sentence?

  My first thought on seeing the title was, oh boy, just what we need: *immortal* ruling elite. Because that's almost certainly the outcome: those who discover the fountain (assuming they are intelligent and not moral saints) will keep it secret, building up their power. Any sufficiently advanced technology (or magic) inevitably either finds its way into the hands of the ruling elite, or makes those who possess it *into* the ruling elite.

  If the discoverers did foolishly brag about it (or, more understandably, use it to keep all their friends young, thus tipping their hands) then a massive war would break out over such a resource. Eventually, it would come into the hands of a country, and who would control it? The ruling elite, of course. I'm going to say that as much as I can, apparently. But now they would have to at least make some show of sharing it or doling it out. But if the fountain is finite or replenishes slowly, then again we will see it concentrated among the rich and powerful. If not, whatever country controls the fountain will become a superpower within a generation, as they will have a workforce and military that never ages and is constantly in their prime.

  Now assuming you were serious about the last line, that's harder to speak to. Quite likely, if the Fountain were restricted to a bare few, the society that controlled it would become matrilineal, with women dominating positions of power (whether by birth or by Fountain). If unrestricted, the country would likely face serious issues as birth rates would drop drastically: I imagine many men would be willing to become women to stave off death. This might increase societal acceptance of LGBT groups (would be a dream come true for MtF transsexuals).

    Eh, I think an immortal ruling elite would actually be pretty effective at governing. The first few hundred years would suck, but eventually they realize their primary goal is stability (to make sure they don't get killed) then maximizing hedons (which more advanced societies are better at.) Anyone they didn't like would be screwed, but statistically speaking we'd be pretty well off, because if the ruling elite is incompetent... well, they're still vulnerable to regular weaponry, disease, and unfortunate toilet-related accidents. Democracy is the greatest achievable form of governing, but an immortal plato-style philosopher king would be pretty swell, if we don't have to worry much about succession.

    tl;dr: a fountain of youth would probably lead to magic pony land.

    Um, I dont know. I was think it might throw a spanner in the works of the obvious immortal warrior elite answer, instead maybe then it would mainly be used by warriors, knights, and Kings to keep their wives, and concubines young and hot, only used by themselves as last resort if you are really sick or old. I wonder what the percentage of men who would rather get old and die would be. I wonder how much authority an early medieval warrior king would retain if became a woman, if all the elders are women I suppose it would eventually create some kind of matriarchy. Then I changed my mind and edited, then you finished typing your reply, consider it an optional scenario to ponder.

    I think it would be hard to keep secret, without any unwanted side effects almost everyone in the discovering party would want a sip, and want to take some back for their relatives and friends, a chief saying "Now, now this is only for a select few in moderation", while a fountain is gushing behind him might be a hard sell. How do you become an "immortal ruling elite" without people noticing you are not aging over time anyway?

      Are you seriously saying men would hate turning into women so much they would rather die?

        I think some of them would. Suicide rates among transgender people are significantly higher than in the general population and you'd effectively be turning almost all the men who went through it transgendered. The big questions are how different they'd be from the normal transgendered population that we have now, and whether people would be able to see gender dysphoria as a negative consequence ahead of time (since it's entirely possible that they would think it's a sweet deal and only be affected after the fact).

        I personally think it would be way worse to be transgender in medieval times than in the present day.

          The last part is obvious. Way more rigid gender roles. In a present day setting, people with low attachment to their gender identity would perhaps be fine. It's really difficult to tell if the "cis-by-default" theorem is correct, but even if it is, and the numbers from the less wrong survey are correct and half of the entire modern elderly population would respond to a magic gender change + renewed youth with "Score!... Wait, Drat, none of my clothes fit, eh, well, time to go shopping" that would be in a context where people don't treat women as chattel.

            I personally think there's a greater proportion of gender apathy than is commonly discussed.
