## [D] Mother of Learning... big question stuck in my mind [Spoilers to Ch 66]

### Post:

Hey all,

&#x200B;

I'm a bit late to the MoL craze, having just started it last week. I'm on Chapter 66 right now. One of Zorian's main concerns is getting a quick method to travel to Koth. 

&#x200B;

Perhaps I've just read it too quickly, but... I'm failing to see why he couldn't just teleport there after having been there once. Is there somewhere that the story explains that personal teleportation has a range limit? I'm only remembering Ilsa's initial explanation that all once has to do is visit a location once, then teleport to it freely - so it seems like the whole investment in searching for and activating Bakora Gates seems like a waste.

    Specifically, the effective range limit is shorter than the distance maritime distance between the two distances, so you have to get a boat yes or yes.
    ```

  As u/lordcirth says, there is a range limit to teleporting, because the mana cost increases with distance. You can keep that mana cost down by putting up spells that do a lot of the work of teleporting for you, like the one in Cyoria which makes it much easier to teleport in. The gate spell is different in that it has the same cost no matter the distance, it's just rare and difficult to perform over long distances because you need two mages to do the spell simultaneously for it to work.

    I will point out that important part is not that it increases with distance, but that it increases superlinearly (i.e. teleporting 200 km away is more than twice as expensive as teleporting 100km away twice)
    ```

        If memory serves, main cost in a teleport is the divination requirement - thing that actually allows you to determine where you are teleporting. That's the part that scales with distance pretty sharply, as divinations apparently don't work well over great distance. Short-distance that part may presumably be discounted completely, and you'd be left with the constant (or perhaps also scaling, but slower) cost of all the dimensionalism teleportation stuff.

        TL;DR I doubt cost will go to 0 in the limit of null teleport distance.

          "That's your problem - laziness. A *proper* dimensional boundary would allow you to teleport to your exact location for no mana expenditure.

          Start over."
          ```

    I may be misremembering, but I seem to recall it being dangerous/unstable in some way as well, not just mana-intensive.
    ```

  There are three different methods of traveling long distance with various draw backs:

  The *teleport*: is the one that Zorian already knows, teleport is great for short range movements (like in a fight or battle). But is stupid hard to do long distances and isnt actually a viable way to get around the world in less than a month.

  A *gate* has no extra cost due to distance, but the problem is that it requires a mage on either end ... and currently Zorian has no way of getting himself or a simulacrum or whatever to Koth.

  The third method uses the connects two Pre prepared Standing Stones with a *portal*. This is the ideal method for Zorian because you don’t need anyone already at your destination, and the mana costs are reasonable.  The problem is that standing stones are typically under cities in their dungeon area, and the areas are typically controlled by spider clans, and you still can’t open the portal until you figure out the right method/destination address.

  Ideally Zorian would be able to negotiate for use of a portal.  He would only have to figure out how to open that portal once, and then every other reset it would be only a matter of re introducing himself to the local spider clan.

    Standing stones? You mean Bakora gates, right?
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  You may or may not recall that Ilsa also told Zorian that she doubted he would have enough mana to cast it at all. Teleportation is great, but not particularly cheap.
  ```

- u/Bramble-Thorn:
  ```
  Teleportation can be long ranged, but is not unlimited ranged. Zorian sees Zach use it to quickly vacate his mansion and go to far away points of the country one restart using the tracking marker, which he considered to have a huge range.

  The author uses many D&D inspired spells in his story (magic missile, gate, etc) and D&D's teleport is 100 miles a level. Great for crossing countries, not continents. 

  And Koth is another continent.
