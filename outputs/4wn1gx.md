  System Shock fan!

  >"It's just… I don't want anyone using mind magic on me. Having someone looking through my thoughts is a last resort as far as I'm concerned. This compulsion, if it even exists, clearly isn't a pressing issue. It's pretty much rendered irrelevant at this point. I'd rather take the time to learn how to deal with this myself."

  Taking bets now for "He's under a compulsion not to get his mind checked for compulsions", which really should have been thought of by Zorian sooner.

  > Sadly, the Boranova heir never turned up anywhere and their attempts to find him went anywhere

  \^Nowhere.

    Obviously, but there's no good way to have that conversation.  "Oh, I need to check you for a compulsion.  You don't think it's a problem, that's another compulsion.  You don't want to be checked?  So is that."  Sure.

        ```
        This would be considered a "Thompson's Trusting Trust Trojan' only if Zach is implanted with a contagious compulsion that compels mind-mages to conceal it's existence and implant it in Zach.

        ^(What a sentence!  What a name for a spell!)

        As described, it's only a single-part Trojan which makes it (relatively) easy to detect, if hard to remove.

    - u/JackStargazer:
      ```
      Also the compulsion to hate mind magic (in general, also making him hate the aranea and the other guy Red Robe knows is a mind mage - another looper) would be even more effective.

      Couple that with a few implanted commands or keywords to mind control Zach during any truly dangerous confrontation as contingencies, and another to erase all memory of that. Red Robe could have been using Zach as his magic artillery cannon anytime it was necessary with him being non the wiser.

      Mind magic is scary kids.

  - u/stepupson:
    ```
    Is Anixa Pravoski that unnamed girl that was hanging out with Zach along with Neolu at the beginning?

    Here's a theory out of left field: what if she is Red Robe?  No evidence for it, but there is the possibility that she blanked Zach and then hid Veyers/got rid of him.  It'd be a pretty good red herring.

    From looking at the bar on the right side, it was definitely shorter than most other chapters. I don't know by how much, though.

        ```
        There is only one chapter that is longer than 10,000 words. Most are in the 6000-8000 range, with ~7500 being normal. But shorter chapters like this one are hardly rare.

          I'm sorry I didn't mean to sound rude about the chapter length.

          I really enjoy the story and like every other addict you always want more, you know?

          Thank you for writing this.

            I'm not bothered, don't worry. I just found it eye catching since I pay keen attention to the length of my chapters. Thank you for reading.

          - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
            ```
            I think it feels short because of the interviews about Veyers Boranova, which take ~30% of the chapter (so 4k words without them). They will make the story flow more naturally for people reading it from cover to cover, but when you’re reading one chapter at a time, things like that make you fidgety instead.
            ```

      - u/Diralman_:
        ```
        Not quite. I just checked my emails and the past 20 chapters are all under 10,000 words. They seem to range from 6,000 to around 9,000. The past few chapters have been towards the lower end.

    I thought the same. That should be a way good way to keep him off the hook, really.

  ```
  Looks like Alanic decided to find Xvin afterall, one of Zorian worst nightmares just became reality.
  ```

  - u/literal-hitler:
    ```
    And now they somehow track down Silverlake, in spite of the fact Zorian has never mentioned her.
    ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    I think that they knew each other to begin with, actually. I find it unlikely that Xvim would have reached archmage level without having at least *some* connections.
    ```

    - u/GodKiller999:
      ```
      Alanic himself said he had never heard of Xvim and that: "If I really wanted to meet this 'Xvim', I would have sought him out on my own. With a name like that, I doubt he'd be hard to find."
      ```

      - u/monkyyy0:
        ```
        Alanic keeps truth potions and lets a young mage mind rape a prisoner

        I'll go with lie
        ```

        - u/GodKiller999:
          ```
          Why would he though? It's not like him telling Zorian he knew Xvim would have changed anything.
          ```

          - u/monkyyy0:
            ```
            Because they were lying
            ```

            - u/-Fender-:
              ```
              Exactly. Say something slightly provocative, and gauge their reactions. He knew they were withholding information from him, so he had to be curious, to a certain extent. This is someone involved with the military, and who hunts necromancers and undeads. Of course he'd make sure to gain as much information as he can before getting involved with someone.
              ```

      - u/Vakuza:
        ```
        Maybe Alanic knew him by a different name? That is possibly the case, or Alanic was lying.
        ```

        - u/-Fender-:
          ```
          To be honest, he never told a lie about him, afaik.

          >"This Xvim fellow you keep talking about sounds fascinating. I hope you can introduce us sometime."

          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

          > "I was just joking, mister Kazinski," [...] "If I really wanted to meet this 'Xvim', I would have sought him out on my own. With a name like that, I doubt he'd be hard to find."

          He asked for an introduction (which could be done merely to see how he'd go about doing this, whether or not he and Xvim are already acquaintances), stated that he knew "Xvim" was an exotic name, and that he'd be easy to find. He never claimed that he didn't know him. Merely spoke in such a way as to give that impression.

          Until next chapter, we won't know if they were previously acquaintances or not.
          ```

- u/Vakuza:
  ```
  So how much will Z&Z have to reveal now one cat is out of the bag? If Zorian reveals that he's a very good mind mage I'm worried Xvim might have a bit of a reaction. Even if Xvim is okay with it Zorian is going to have some gruelling soul protection lessons ahead.

  Having Xvim and Alanic involved would be a massive help regardless.
  ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    Just to recap, what do they each know?

    Alanic knows that they were targeted by some soul magic, and that both of their souls now have a marker. He knows that Xorian has some knowledge about sensing his soul, and that Zach is a novice. He probably knows that both are inordinately good magicians for their apparent age (depending on how exactly they saved his and Lukav's  lives), and may be aware that they can both teleport. He also had to find it strange how Zorian spoke about him as if they were acquaintances, and seemed to know Xvim. (Although it was fairly obvious, he still somehow knew that Xvim was a person's name rather than a place or a training method, and he also knew right away that it was a reference to a man and not a woman.)

    Xvim, on the other hand, knows that the time loop is a thing, and that Zorian and Zach are "endlessly" repeating this same month. He most likely knows that the Astral Plane is currently disconnected from their plane of existence, since he's told Zorian in the past that this is one of the most convincing things that he could be told to believe in the time loop. He also knows that both Zorian and Zach have very developed shaping skills, and that Zorian has been his student for a long time, going so far as respecting him as his master. He can also easily guess that this is really Zach's first time spending a restart as one of his students. Beyond that, all I can think of that he would also know would be whatever anecdotes and circumstantial evidence Zorian would have told him to convince him of the time loop.

    As far as I can tell, neither is currently aware of the Sovereign Gate's usage or that Cyoria's time magic research facility is involved in any way, they are unaware of the invasion, unaware that Sudomir is a necromancer and built a spiritual sinkhole. They are most likely unaware of the deaths of all of the people with working knowledge of soul magic around Knyazov Dveri. They are also unaware that Zorian is a mind mage, although Xvim at least must have strong suspicions that Zorian is very knowledgeable in the field, after his talk with Zach. And they are unaware of the exact purpose of the soul marker.

    Did I miss anything that they could have taught each other about the time loop and Z&Z?
    ```

    - u/Vakuza:
      ```
      A good summary, though the attack on Lukav is definitely hinting at something. They might be able to deduce something from that. The real kicker is what they are going to ask Z&Z since they'll have to be honest since I think Alanic might have some lesser form of truth detection like the priestess or at least was able to recognise he taught Zorian his soul sense and thus will be sceptical.
      ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      > And they are unaware of the exact purpose of the soul marker.

      This they probably deduced. Two time travelers, both have this unique masterfully crafted maker that no one else has. Yeah...
      ```

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        Good. This is where I wanted the discussion to go. Above, I listed the things that they each knew. But now that they're talking to each other, what are the additional pieces of information that they could deduce?
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          I think Xvim could figure out that the Sovereign Gate is involved, actually. An artifact purported to be able to train someone up for centuries in mere minutes of real time? Sounds like what's happening to these two.
          ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  I like that the major problems with VB!RR have been addressed. There is more to it than simple teenage classmates 3-way drama. 

  And team Xvilanic is gonna tear ZZ a new one, hue hue hue. On that note, I wonder if Alanic knows a tidbit or two about Boranovas. An expert fire mage could know something about expert fire House.

  Wait... House Boranova is the Fire Nation!? [](/lunalaugh)

  Could this whole "Veyers can't be found" thing be the same as the whole "Zach can't be found" thing that happened after the Lich's attack and Zorian's inclusion into the loop?  They seem fairly similar.

  ```
  Well seems like Xvim has a new friend xD

  This story just keeps getting better.
  ```

- u/FireHawkDelta:
  ```
  I just realized, Red Robe spent at least two long periods in the loop before the time Zorian entered. First, somehow getting in and finding ways to assist the invasion. Second, erasing Zach's memory of the normal version of the invasion, and repeating the same changes each restart to avoid suspicion. It was like this long enough that Zach made an elaborate plan to save Zorian, a side objective, from an explosion that only happens with Red Robe's influence, without thinking it was anything new.

  Hopefully Alanic and Xvim force him to get his head checked.

- u/archaeonaga:
  ```
  This is a bit tangential, but to be totally honest, I've gotta say: I ship Zach/Zorian p. hard. It's not remotely supported by the text or even slightly indicated subtextually, but still, they have a lot of chemistry. Zach is a really good foil for Zorian, and props to u/nobody103 on that score; I was legitimately surprised at how well he slotted into the story, given that he had been purposefully put on a bus for large swaths of the text. 

  Also, this was a good chapter, because I *also* ship Xvim/Alanic. I'm excited to see what happens here; Alanic's presence is likely helpful, since we have every reason to believe he's got pretty high-level connections with the church and the military.
  ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    Well, if they got together it might be kinda contrived. Since part of the reason they're such good foils could be the spell that qtach ichl cast on them to try to combine their souls or something. So I guess you could kind of say they're soul mates in a sense I guess, but only because an evil lich tampered with their souls.

    As for Xvim/Alanic I don't think there's been any contextual evidence for that whatsoever. No hints that they've ever interacted before. It would have been kinda funny though.
    ```

    - u/archaeonaga:
      ```
      I'm mostly just being flip, honestly; you'd have to rewrite the entire story to make Z/Z make sense and be interesting, and it'd almost have to take the place of something else, since piling a romance subplot on top of everything else would be a bit crazy. Surprised it's so controversial as to get a cross, but hey. 

      And I'm only joking about X/A, mostly as an excuse to talk about what actually happened in this chapter.
      ```

  - u/GodKiller999:
    ```
    The only one who I could really see Zorian getting with among the presented characters is Raynie. I do know you're not being serious about the Z/Z thing, but just saying.
    ```

    - u/archaeonaga:
      ```
      I think it'd be a stretch for nobody103 to include anybody as a romantic partner for Zorian at this point, except as some sort of aside in an epilogue that follows some kind of time skip. As Zach pointed out last chapter, Zorian hasn't thought much at all of the romantic possibilities of the time loop, and it's hard to see him turning to that at this point. 

      I don't miss the romantic subplot here, fwiw; I think Z/Z would probably be the most compelling possibility if one were to add such a subplot, especially given the mechanics of soul magic and etc., but it would arguably slow down the narrative of a very plot-driven piece of work. Part of what works about *MoL* is its approach to the time loop gimmick, and given how many time loop stories include romance as the main plot driver, it's refreshing to see nobody103 eschew that in favor of worldbuilding density and plot elegance. Very Nasu-esque, really, all while avoiding the pitfalls that Nasu falls for in his H-game plots.
      ```

      - u/GodKiller999:
        ```
        I didn't mean during the loop though, he himself said that he wouldn't contact Raynie any longer while it was going.

        Z/Z could work if Zorian was bi, which I just don't see happening, he made his view of Taiven sexiness very explicit when he initially described her, so there's no doubt about him being interested in women, but he has never shown any such views on men.

        I'm also happy that there's no romance, it usually ends up being fairly crass and often bloat out of proportion to take over the plot and romance pretty much only works as a side dish so it's pretty bad when that happens.
        ```

        - u/archaeonaga:
          ```
          I dunno, I'm pretty sure that romance sits at the heart of some of the most iconic works of fiction. It's true that when it's done poorly, it's uniquely terrible, but I'm inclined to think it's *easy* compared to the complicated plot work nobody103's doing; it's one thing to put together a mystery plot, but doing it so that you tell a satisfying mystery in a serial format seems even harder, since you can't go back and edit in that subtle foreshadowing that nobody103's so good at.

          Z/Z obviously is not a real thing that can happen in the story at this point. But I call it compelling because romance is a good vector for conflict, and these characters and their motivations would be interestingly complicated by additional tension in their relationship. I don't think *MoL* would necessarily be better for it, given that the space that sort of thing would take up has been used to tell a story from an arguably more original POV, but I can see how it'd be an interesting alternative.
          ```
