  Hmm. I notice that it's not following the canon rule of morphs not being able to be acquired from other morphs, which makes me wonder if there are other rules which don't apply in this story (Visser Three thinks about bacterial morphs, for example, which aren't supposed to be available in canon).

  I *really* like the self-morph hack. It's even supported by canon (ignoring the acquire-from-morph rule)!
  ```

    If you're curious about which rules do and do not apply, I'm happy to talk.  Each and every piece should eventually become clear through the text ... mostly it just depends on whether you'd like to discover it as a reader or talk about it as a fun intellectual exercise.
    ```

    - u/Geminii27:
      ```
      Kinda both. I'm happy to see it play out, though.
      ```

  - u/nicholaslaux:
    ```
    No, Visser Three explicitly mentioned the no acquiring while in morph rule during the previous chapter, so I'm pretty sure the acquiring just happened when they weren't morphed as each other.
    ```

    - u/Geminii27:
      ```
      Not acquiring while in morph, acquiring from a morph - ie being able to pass around morphs between team members.
      ```

    - u/Zephyr1011:
      ```
      I think that by acquire-from-morph rule they mean acquiring a morph from someone who is morphed into that animal, rather than the animal itself, rather than acquiring a morph while you are yourself morphed
      ```

      - u/Uncaffeinated:
        ```
        But in canon you can't acquire while you are morphed either. Remember all the trouble Tobias went through to acquire the dolphin? It would have been so much easier if he could just morph a human and acquire it like the others.
        ```

        - u/Zephyr1011:
          ```
          That doesn't apply here. When Jake acquires his long nailed form from Marco, Jake is not morphed, Marco is. The equivalent in your scenario would be if one of the other group members morphed into a dolphin, and then Tobias acquired the morph from them
          ```

  !! 

  Yeeesssss!

  That's it.  That's the stuff.  My fix finally came in...
  ```

  ```
  Augh! Finally! I thought you were dead!

  Well I just bombed through all 7 chapters in one afternoon and oh holy crap yes. And yet also several points where I want to metaphorically slap the characters about a bit for being stupid (in entirely believable/realistic ways, but *still*) 

  Especially Rachel in Ch3, revealing way too much to the enemy - you do *not* just casually give up the element of surprise, put the entire opposing faction on high alert against morphing opponents and then not even mention it to the others... not if you have any intentions of winning the war. Also got the Chapman's killed, so yeah, *great job Rach*.

  Personal sympathies currently situated with Marco, who seems to be the only one who *really* "gets" the idea of being serious about the situation because you are fighting a goddamn war against bodysnatching aliens. Tobias seems to think he gets it, but for my money he's too far deep into his distrust of everyone to realise that splintering the group, even if the group is suboptimal, is not improving the situation.

  Honestly not sure how far regular-grade humans can be expected to get against actually-competent yeerks. Seems like they're already reeling from what amounts to a causal backhand from a couple of yeerks who didn't even know what they were doing; if Visser 3 is full-on *intelligent* I do not see an outcome where they are anything less than flattened.

    Might happen, actually.
    ```

  - u/chaosmosis:
    ```
    How do you not love Jake after this chapter? Marco is too slow.
    ```

- u/h4rt:
  ```
  I am so glad that someone is writing this. Great stuff so far, keep it up!
  ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  HE LIVES.

  Great chapter though, I enjoyed Jake's thinking, and how you depicted why he was the leader, and capable of remaining the leader, as opposed to him just slotting into it by default, or transferring it to Marco, who's more rationally minded.
  ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  > Marco was silent for a moment. ‹Just make me one promise,› he said finally. ‹If it turns out you are right, don't go nuts and start thinking you have some kind of spider sense, okay? Because right for the wrong reasons is only a tiny bit better than flat-out wrong.›

  But remember, Marco - the signature of a "right reason" is that it works consistently. _Anything_ that works consistently, even if only statistically, is structurally based on a _right reason_.

  I guess what I'm saying is, don't throw out a working tool just because you don't understand how it works.
  ```

- u/ZeroNihilist:
  ```
  I loved the Animorphs series when I was younger. This take on it is fantastic so far.
  ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  Question though. [](#s "Just because I got a little confused by the fingernail trick. Can someone explain to me what exactly the "hack" is? Or are they just talking about the standard "demorphing heals all wounds" thing?")
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    [Author here; ch.7 spoilers](#s "The thing is, the morphing tech works like a Mac—relative to a PC—it's got user-friendly controls, but the guts aren't particularly accessible.  It's great that you can trigger a morph by just thinking about the thing you want to morph into, but unfortunately this means that if you're trying to morph into a copy of yourself, it's hard for the program to distinguish between 'morph into the copy of me!' and 'demorph!'  The fingernails were just a concrete trigger: Jake-with-long-fingernails is the morph, and Jake-with-short-fingernails is the demorphed, normal state.  By focusing on the fingernails in particular, he was able to tell the program 'This isn't demorphing; it's morphing into a version of myself.'  They're abusing morphing tech to basically create disposable copies of themselves, just as you create a disposable copy of any animal.  That copy can get cut up, abused, infested, etc., and they can just demorph back to their true bodies with no lasting harm done.  The exploit wasn't available in canon directly, because you couldn't acquire from someone else in morph.  In other words, in canon, there was no way for Jake to access his own DNA template.  Everything else is pretty standard, though ... they could've accessed this same powerset—thought speak, healing abilities—simply by morphing one another for two hours at a time.")
    ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    > Access to thought-speak alone would have been worth the hassle of demorphing and remorphing every two hours, and on top of that, we would be able to heal any non-lethal injury in minutes, and to morph out from under a Yeerk stunner without giving ourselves away.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      So all standard stuff? It's OP, don't get me wrong, I just was trying to figure out if the exploit was something not shown in canon
      ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        In canon, you can't acquire from a morph, nor dead animals, nor your own body (that you are currently acquiring from).
        ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        Yes.
        ```

      - u/E-o_o-3:
        ```
        I mean, the animorphs canon really didn't leave much unexplored - as far as exploring the idea space and munchkin goes, they did it quite well - on the heroes side, at least, the aliens could likely have done far better with a bit of creativity and common sense. The divergences are all going to be plot or a result of different rules in this world , I doubt there's much in the way of unexplored hacks.
        ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    [](#s "The hack is that they're normally morphed into themselves so they can demorph if they get stunned. They also trim their fingernails when demorphed. I'm not clear why. It might be that they have to imagine the change to morph, so they wouldn't be able to morph into themselves normally.")
    ```

- u/TimTravel:
  ```
  Very nice!

  If there really were rogue ~~andilites~~ Andalites then wouldn't they not have too much trouble going to a zoo a few cities over? Seems like an ineffective measure against them.

  Come to think of it, isn't it ~~Andilite~~ Andalite policy to just torch infected planets, Protoss style?
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Still better than nothing. And the andalites probably have less intel about the area than the yeerks do. 

    It is andalite policy but they need ships for that, and they don't have any left.
    ```
