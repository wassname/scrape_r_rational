  Presumably, he will usher in a public education system.

    More like adult retraining courses than schools. While they can now easily afford to take all the children off the farms, doing so is a future investment with little immediate payoff. (The simple magic training schools Cato is trying to do aren't like public education, more like a crash course lasting a few weeks)

    Pushing adults into a nascent manufacturing industry seems like a faster way to do things. For uncomplicated sweatshop like work, you can train someone pretty quickly to just do it by rote. Especially if you have a more qualified core to provide QC and guide rails/jigs/measuring blocks tailored to the process.

  Tried to read it and beginning was not bad. However it went downhill fast as soon as protagonists started uplifting feudal society. I've read dozen of sf/fantasy books on uplifting ancient, feudal, magical-feudal, magical-ancient, early-industrial  etc societies, and "A Hero's War" somewhere in lower 30% by quality. It's simplistic, naive, careless to key details and not quite internally consistent. I'd recommend "Island in the Sea of Time" instead, even though it's not perfect.

    Hi there!  Thanks for commenting!  Now if you could just tell me what went wrong for you...?

    Obviously, my writing needs work and the way I plot it out, step by step in my head like a simulation with some nudges, is not conducive to thematic unity.  Well, pointers there would help!  Also practice, which is why I'm writing.  

    You said that the beginning was not bad but it went downhill fast.  Many other comments I had gotten said the exact opposite.  So your perspective is much more informative than others as it seems to be unique.  

    I do understand that the all parts of the worldbuilding are lacking except the magic system (which is probably too detailed), but specific examples of which parts bothered you or seemed to lack detail would be helpful.  

    They're probably not even the same parts I'm thinking of.  

    And while Hero's War is probably not salvageable with how far it's come, I can always do better next time.
