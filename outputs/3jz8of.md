## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Is the emotional state known as *desperation* ever a good state for a human being to be in, in real life?

  Why or why not? Thinking of it as a consequentialist / munchkin, is there some *optimal* amount to experience, say 15 minutes per day, or one 24 hour day per year, or something like that?

  Thoughts:

  1. Desperation implies stress. So for heart health and neurological health reasons, it's probably bad to have too much. But then, exercise also causes stress, so perhaps it's fine to have a little.
  2. Desperate people are easier to sell to. Does that imply it makes you suggestible and vulnerable to trickery? Or is it just that one is more inclined to make a purchasing decision / rational trade off (to the best of their ability to determine such a thing) in general?
  3. Desperation can make a person stop putting off resolution to some kinds of conflict, e.g walk away from a bad situation like abusive job or relationship.
  4. Bad decisions made out of desperation can trigger additional desperation when the results show up. So perhaps there are cycles where desperation/stress is maintained over the long term, resulting in more harm than if the person were to completely avoid the feeling of desperation. For example, a person may initially borrow money out of desperation, then miss the payments, and later borrow money at a higher interest rate due to their lack of credit.
  5. Desperation is painful. So hedonic utilitarianism might imply that it should be eliminated in an ideal world. But then, using it to overcome a source of suffering (aging, etc.) would still be justifiable (assuming it is the most effective tactic).
  6. Acts performed out of desperation can be seen as less bad, or more heroic. For example, stealing a loaf of bread is acceptable to prevent one's family from starving, but evil if done merely to save money.

    My first thought was of course it can be good:  Desperate times call for desperate ~~measures~~ *emotions*.  Desperation is very good at convincing a person to take immediate and direct action on simple and straightforward problems.  Yes, there are side effects like bad decisions and being painful in itself, but they aren't necessarily worse than the ultimate results of decision paralysis or other emotional states.

    My second thought was that I just skipped half of the question you wanted answered:  If we could remove all desperate situations, *should* we?  My gut is saying that small amounts of desperation can be an overall good thing, as it teaches people about themselves and a broader range of human emotions, can give confidence in slightly-less-than-desperate situations, and entirely removing an emotion from human experience is part of a slippery slope that I don't like.  My head was reminded of [this quote](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8/how_to_seem_and_be_deep/):

    >At another point in the discussion, a man spoke of some benefit X of death, I don't recall exactly what.  And I said:  "You know, given human nature, if people got hit on the head by a baseball bat every week, pretty soon they would invent reasons why getting hit on the head with a baseball bat was a good thing.  But if you took someone who wasn't being hit on the head with a baseball bat, and you asked them if they wanted it, they would say no.  I think that if you took someone who was immortal, and asked them if they wanted to die for benefit X, they would say no."
    ```

      I think there's a difference between:

      * Eliminating an entire emotion.
      * Eliminating all situations that could generate the emotion.
      * Put up a fence and several informative signs, warning people what they're about to get into while still subtly encouraging them.
      * Make them appoint a safe-word or a legal custodian with power of attorney before they do it.

  It's Tuesday, so I might not get a whole lot of replies, but I have a politics question.

  Have you found the whole feminism/SJW/gamergate/whatever debate to be entirely one sided? Recently someone who's opinion I respect by osmosis (they're part of a group that generally makes good decisions) very firmly came out as pro social-justice-warrior.

  I'm not asking for a debate on the topic, partially because it's not something I really discuss for concern of SPIDERS (also witch burning), but I would be interested in hearing if you've found the debate to be completely one sided, or if you have problems with SJW tactics or goals.

    My experience of this whole shebang on Reddit and other places was one of walking into a room and finding people hurling molotov cocktails at each other and blasting blood curdling insults. Oh and SPIDERS EVERYWHERE.

    And this question seems to be trying to find the group inclination on a political issue, by asking about perceived balance of evidence from others. Well, why base a decision on that? r/rational isn't some kind of arbiter on Rational Thinking, or of a Good-and-Righteous political platform. 

    If the question is about balance of evidence, well, go imagine yourself as that-label-you're-using-to-represent-those-who-disagree-with-you, spend some time collecting the strongest evidence possible (like half hour at least), and *desperately* try to counter your own position. That may approach a teensy bit of the sufficient amount of de-biasing and honest assessment of evidence that's probably required. 

    Tbh, I haven't had the time to do that and such hostility as I usually see makes the whole thing unpleasant and seeming like it requires significant personal effort to expend concentrated thought on. Accordingly, I don't hold an informed/strong opinion yet.

    From what I've seen, it's outrage culture on both sides, combined with some in-group/out-group dynamics that have made both sides pretty damn toxic. A bunch of keyboard warriors have found a thing that they can be shitty to each other about. Because the people who are the most outraged have the most to talk about, they're the ones who dominate the discussion. This is in addition to bad conversation driving out good and extremists driving out moderates. It's nothing that's unique to what their particular spat is about.

    Can someone explain what all this talk of 'spiders' means?

      Calm and rational discussions of politics are less common than might be optimal, for a variety of reasons, and for fora to become a regular hub of political discussion often drives away contributors due to (real or imagined) partisanship.  Since we don't want that here - it's a major reason for our fiction-only rule - we use a 'politics is spiders' analogy to remind us:

      SPIDERS evokes the feeling of waking up to realize hundreds of venomous, chitinous, arachnid horrors are crawling all over you:  best to respond calmly and rationally, but *very difficult*.

    My main observation was that it's mostly both sides talking straight past each other. See [this poorly-named but well-thought-out article.](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/09/all-debates-are-bravery-debates/)

    Just a side point: debates can be one-sided and still the subject of tons of struggle and vitriol. Wars have been fought over slavery. Many people were injured for participating in the civil rights riots -- [the US government assassinated Martin Luther King Jr](http://www.globalresearch.ca/court-decision-u-s-government-agencies-found-guilty-in-martin-luther-kings-assassination/5320024) for his work.
