  Did anyone else realize the implication of the fact that it is "dangerous" to pronounce a name yourself instead of using a scroll, yet names can be pronounced by minimum wage workers in mass working in cubicles?  Either the "dangerous" part is bullshit to give an extra excuse for enforcing the current copyright setup (likely), or the minimum wage workers are working in an unsafe environment (less likely, but still plausible given the right economic incentives).  I find it sad that both seem plausible.

    We don't know what all the other names of God do yet, but this seems like one of those things that's unsafe until proven otherwise. They're trying to find new spells *without knowing what those new spells do*. Unless all spells are universally usable without any precautions or flaws, or unless they can predict effects, it's dangerous to go hunting for new spells. What happens if the next spell you find begins producing huge amounts of carbon monoxide? Or levels the city around you?

      * The objection the police officer has to speaking a name directly starts with the classic copyright argument. "It's dangerous" seems to be very nearly an afterthought. Agreed with by the idea that half the people in the office are doing it on a daily basis. My guess is that names are approximately as dangerous as power tools: if you know what you're doing you can use them for hours a day for your entire life without ever getting injured, if you don't know what you're doing they will tear your limbs off and/or set your house on fire.
      * From the effect we see when he finds the new name, it appears that a name may not do anything unless you speak it with intent. Here, he accidentally says a name - same conditions as when randomly attempting names - and instead of invoking its effect, it simply tells him what it does.
      * I'm not sure how copyright will actually work in this occurrence. Can it be argued that "meh meh meh meh meh meh" is enough of an addition for Aaron to own it himself and that he was off the clock at that point?

        The company will try to claim they own it, even if they don't know the name or if they have no valid claim (the probably have some type of waver they make their employees sign guaranteeing that they will own any names the employee comes up with, even off the clock).  However, my impression is that Aaron may not actually try to copyright it, but instead use its raw power for himself directly and not tell anyone the secret name.  I imagine if the name is powerful enough, he will wipe out the company's records (just to minimize their chances of guessing at what he did, or if they always record everything just in case a situation like this comes up.)

        I guess my reading was that the Name he discovered grants self-awareness and that this awareness is what he granted to himself. Compare:

        > It stood there for a moment, a crude statue, and then a voice from Heaven spoke a Name, and the clay came to life, lumbered into a standing position. It spoke a second Name, and the clay’s eyes opened, and within them were innocence and curiosity and the capacity to wonder and learn. **And it spoke a third Name, and it was as if a light went on inside of it, and the dust became aware that it was dust and in so doing was dust no longer.**

        And the effect he experiences:

        > **I was struck by a wave of holy light. The heavens opened and poured into me. My soul rang like a bell.**

        This would imply that he was the beneficiary of the Name and that he did cast it by saying it.
        ```

        - u/Vebeltast:
          ```
          Huh. I parsed the "it" in "And it spoke a third Name" as the voice from Heaven speaking a third time, and that it was targeted on the golem => man. Which implied to me that there was a targeting step, which would have to be somehow intent-based, and that the word spoken without a target does something else entirely. That's potentially much less interesting than your reading, though. Interesting.
          ```

          - u/PeridexisErrant:
            ```
            Or targetless words target the speaker... which really could be dangerous.
            ```

        - u/Transfuturist:
          ```
          I think this effect was only divine revelation of the nature of the name. They can make golems with the first two names, the third was implied to make the difference between golem and human/person. Aaron is already a human.

          If the revelation of a name being transcendental is so undetectable, I would wonder how employees wouldn't be able to steal all of the real names.

      >Or levels the city around you?

      I wonder how they found the Wrathful Name...
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    My assumption was that the computer was connected to a network tracking the list of names being said. So if something happened at some point (like say the entire building exploding) it could be tracked and the name responsible could be found.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      So it is safe for the company, because they can get their name, even if everyone dies?  I was referring to the people working in the building, but I suppose what you pointed out is what the company actually cares about.  What is life insurance for a building's worth of people compared to another valuable, patent-able name.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I suppose being fined would probably serve as a cover story to Aaron's inevitable quitting, but surely the Countenance would be recording the words spoken for verification purposes and think to listen to Aaron's last day's recordings if he suddenly started using powers in a flashy way.

  I would guess the first item on the agenda is to ensure that doesn't happen, but Aaron seems sure that Countenance wouldn't think of it.
  ```

  - u/FishNetwork:
    ```
    If I had to guess, the relevant parts are "Palo Alto" +

    > I incanted: “ROS-AILE-KAPHILUTON-MIRAKOI-KALANIEMI-TSHANA-KAI-KAI-EPHSANDER-GALISDO-TAHUN…” and just as I finished, **my timer reached zero and told me I was finished**, for today, free until tomorrow morning crashed down on me and I started the same thing all over again.
    > 
    > “Meh,” I said. “Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh.”

    California law is that employees own any IP they create on their own time, using their own materials.  So, the character 'discovered' the completed phrase.

    Also, I can imagine that any recording system would be tied to the timer.  If I have to audit an employee, I want their recordings broken into 1 chunk / 1 word anything else would be really annoying to audit.

  [The other being _Kiln People_ by David Brin]

    ```
    Kabbalism is top underexploited aesthetic. YHWH was Lovecraftian before Lovecraft was a thing, look at Ezekiel and Revelations for example. I've never seen a Revelations fiction that uses the imagery in Revelations literally.

    There was one short story where [](#s "an order of monks made a computer to find the name of God.") [](#s "It ended with the stars in the sky beginning to vanish. Anyone remember the name?")

    Sumeria is another underexploited aesthetic, but we have Snow Crash so it's okay.

  Does anyone know how the copyright would work for that? My best guess is that it's a joint copyright, since neither would have come up with the name alone.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I would guess that the author is under contract and therefore owns no copyright. This is the same general agreement that governs things like writing for television or videogames (I've done the latter and signed such a contract).

    Edit: The whole idea of being able to copyright a sequence of letters is legally dubious under our current intellectual property frameworks, of course.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      Writing is a creative endeavor. What he was doing wasn't. I don't think they'd have the same contract.

      > The whole idea of being able to copyright a sequence of letters is legally dubious under our current intellectual property frameworks, of course.

      I feel like a patent would be more appropriate. But they'd certainly have some form of intellectual property rights. They'd write the law to fit the needs.

    - u/Anderkent:

      Yep, same as it works in programming and lots of other trades. If you're being paid to create something, you don't own that thing - whoever paid you for it does.
