  Do people still appreciate that I'm posting this here? If not, I'd be glad to stop.

  There's a subreddit for this at /r/YakusokuNoNeverland.

    I appreciate it. Started reading this thanks to you. I don't know much about mangastream, but do they routinely delete the first chapters of manga? I kinda remember going there and being able to see only the most recent stuff...
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Yeah, it's a concession to prevent them from being taken down.

      If you go to a manga aggregate site (like Kissmanga), it should have all chapters. 

      Of course, you could just get it legally off of Viz.
      ```

      - u/RobBobGlove:
        ```
        not where I'm from. Thanks for the suggestion and explanation, didn't know why they where doing that, i'm not much into manga but want to give it a try, I have read probably less then 5-7 series
        ```

      I'm using [mangahere](http://www.mangahere.co/manga/yakusoku_no_neverland/c007/)

    I appreciate it. Started reading when you posted chapter 5. I like the story, for now none of the characters are stupid and it's a cool prisonbreak kind of story.
    ```

    I'm grateful that you started posting this (and were consistent about it, too, because I only started looking at it starting from the second update). I wouldn't mind weekly notices, but I can understand why some people might want fewer updates.
    ```

    I don't read much manga but I decided to give it a go. Now I'm annoyed that only a few chapters are out. So thanks a lot.
    ```

    - u/gbear605:
      ```
      Sorry. The good news is that new chapters come out weekly
      ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    I would prefer a thread with multiple new chapters some time in the future, rather than the minimum publishable unit.
    ```

    - u/gbear605:
      ```
      How often would you prefer? They come out roughly once a week, though it varies. Maybe once every three weeks post a new thread?
      ```

      - u/thelolpatrol:
        ```
        I like once a week. We already don't have a glut of content in this subreddit.
        ```

      - u/Zephyr1011:
        ```
        I'm entirely content with once a week. That's infrequent enough to not be annoying
        ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        Yes, that sounds about right.

        (This is just my preference. I may be outnumbered here.)
        ```

  The thing about the eldest girls being the only ones allowed to bathe the toddlers seems like a definite tip off. Though for what I think it's too early to say.

  It does give me the impression that there will not be any "papas," and moreover the girls have purposes other than being eaten. Sort of like how male bulls are for the slaughter, and female cows for the milk.

    ```
    Ya but connie?
    ```

    - u/Zephyr1011:
      ```
      Perhaps just the girls with highest scores?
      ```

- u/creatureofthewood:
  ```
  Just started this from the beginning

  So, Mama is definitely secretly on the kid's side for dropping them all these hints, right?
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    It's possible, but seems highly unlikely that she would be able to survive losing an entire batch of children. Even just losing the three protagonists would probably be enough to secure her execution based on their apparent importance for the ceremony.

    The story suggests that she has been diligently sending children off to be killed and eaten for many years, which doesn't sit well with the idea that she's a secret ally.

    My hypothesis is that she's baiting them with specific information to (a) impress upon them her reach and knowledge, (b) encourage them to investigate solutions of her choice (knowing they lead to dead ends or pitfalls), and (c) keep them constantly reacting to her moves and not proactively planning.
    ```

    - u/awesomeideas:
      ```
      She probably wouldn't survive if the kids escaped, but she might survive if she *also* escapes.
      ```

    - u/creatureofthewood:
      ```
      Sacrificing yourself for children you raise is  totally something humans instinctively do. (to the point where for this farm to work the "mothers" would likely be nonhuman or specially chosen for sociopathy) 

      Sacrificing children for years could be for the greater good or due to a change of heart / infusion of bravery later in life 

      Playing social cat and mouse if your life is at steak, less common. 

      The thing which gets me is that she always tells her superiors that there is nothing unusual or suspicious to report even though their clearly is.
      ```
