## [RT][Meta] Mother of learning chapter synopsis

### Post:

I made a google doc for chapter summaries of Mother of Learning. Its public so anyone who wants to add to it can. It's pretty bare since I only made the document yesterday, but it should become an easy to use resource once its finished.

[Chapter synopsis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2XOHtPp9kICDRZd22YT5guSD6yaqC0SBiBiR836lE4/edit)

Let me know if there is anything wrong with the doc, like you can't edit it.

  Nice! I really wish there were more initiatives like this (be the change you want to see, I know, etc. etc.). For slow updating fics, or fics I drop and then revisit after later recommendations, or fics that go on hiatus, it's really nice to be able to recap what's happened. I feel ye olde timey novels would often have an "in which our heroes find themselves at odds with the nefarious shark people and eat a huckleberry cake" at the start of each chapter but haven't seen that convention in anything more recent.

    I think terry pratchett does that in a few novels

    http://www.wotsummary.com/ is a great example. I wish it was a wiki, though.

  Might be worth putting a blank page after ever ten chapters such that people can refresh on part of it without getting spoiled too far.

    The idea behind this is that its for people who have already read the series and want to find a specific moment and not have to read the whole story again to find it. Because of that, I don't think spoilers are something to worry about. If you still thin it would be best to have a blank page after every ten chapters, then you could add that in yourself, since the document is public.

      Another good use is someone who hasn't read in a while and wants to get refreshed on where they were.
