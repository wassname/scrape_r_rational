## Does anyone know where I can find an audioized version of Eliezer Yudkowsky's various works?

  ```
  Your best source is hpmorpodcast.com where you will find HPMOR, The Sword of Good, Three Worlds Collide and more by the talented /u/embrodski
  ```

- u/blazinghand:
  ```
  There is a website where a podcast of HPMOR has been made: http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/

  If you're looking for things other than fiction, you'd probably want to look in r/lesswrong or r/slatestarcodex instead of here. r/rational is for works of fiction.
