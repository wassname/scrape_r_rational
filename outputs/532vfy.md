      awesome, i loved this fic and was so sad when it seemed to be abandoned. Ill need to read it from the beginning to figure out what story path was the real one.

          Those are only the canon-path chapters, right?

            Scanning through the first few chapters, it certainly looks like that's the case

      I'm going to give it a little bit of time to get reliably updating again before I start re-reading, but that's incredibly exciting
