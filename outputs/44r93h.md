## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

    Did you know that walking speed by itself is a really good predictor for the rough population of the city/town in which you live? [Radiolab episode about this and other stuff](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91732-cities/).

    >To me it seems rational to walk from place to place quickly so you aren't wasting time you could spend doing something more interesting.

    Walking is interesting. There's people and places to look at. The weather's nice. The light exercise gets my blood flowing. I can think if I want to but I don't have to focus on a specific task. And it doesn't need a huge slice of time dedicated to it.

    If I wanted to get somewhere quickly, I'd take the bus, or the car. Or at the very least I'd set out earlier so I can make it at a leisurely walking pace.

    Anyway there's no sense in saving walking time if you're just going to waste that time in some other way. If I needed more time in my day, I'd start by blocking Reddit.

    The TL;DR is that groups of females will walk slower than any female's preferred speed, groups of males will walk faster than any male's preferred speed, and a male+female will walk at the preferred speed of the female.

    Of course, I haven't actually read the study, so I'm likely mischaracterizing it.

    I think that the answer might have to do with prioritizing why you're walking. I know that several famous scientists and philosophers say they think better while they're walking in such a situation it's the locomotion itself that you want so having a leisurely pace while slow walking is reasonable where is if you're trying to get to one goal or another than going the fastest you reasonably can is probably the right move. There's a word flaneur (?) which represents someone who takes his time strolling around his hometown. Nowadays people who identifies as such understand that there is value in taking your time because you get to be more observant of the areas around you and your more present through your day which has been statistically proven to increase both satisfaction in life and mental awareness in other problems

    People walk slowly because as we were growing up, other people walked slowly, and so it's weird if you don't walk slowly. If that were not the case, screw walking, I'd be galloping everywhere. 

    As for why people, long ago, walked slowly... I'd gamble it had something to do with walking in groups. The speed of the group naturally falls to the slowest walker.

  I read an interesting article today about the practice of science (http://www.jstor.org/stable/3881649). Sorry about the paywall; it isn't interesting enough to have to pay, in my opinion, I just happened to have access to JSTOR for free. I think the most interesting part of it was the final paragraphs:

  > Today we [scientists] are told that what we do must be relevant to society's needs. But relevant *when*? Today, tomorrow, a decade hence? ... Today's advances ... will surely underlie a new technology, and will offer major new forces for the alteration of the human condition. Issues of a new dimension will surely be raised. It is crucial that these issues be made understandable to non-scientists who must participate in decision-making.

  > As the Reverend Theodore Hesburgh (1962) has observed, man's intellectual history up to now has represented a long series of abortive attempts to establish an unwarranted hegemony for this or that kind of knowledge. I can only agree with him that we now have the rich opportunity of changing this trend. But we will not succeed unless we each have deep conviction. We must repeat with Terence: nothing human is alien to me: no human insight, no human misery, no human beauty, no human knowledge, no human anguish, no human value, no human hunger

    I 100 percent agree with the sentiment espoused in this quote. I feel like the work has to come from the side of the stem community. Both by setting good examples allowing ourselves to become public figures without pandering. We need to find the best teachers and best explainers of ideas and make sure that they go to the public in a way that makes them want to listen Neil deGrasse Tyson is trying but we need more and not just intellectual public figures but those who are willing to disagree with each other in a true and clear sense because showing civil scientific debate will be more valuable to bringing the rest of the world into the discussion than anything else.

    Is humanity's intellectual history *really* a series of misguided attempts to establish an unjustified monopoly of theory? 

    There's cases like physics which buck the trend, I guess? At least some of those developments/changes happened as a result of new explanations better explaining observations, though I can appreciate arguments saying it only advanced the state of the science because older people died off...

    I wonder what they're trying to capture with that quote.

    Is the major thrust: communicate to non-experts for ethical and cooperative wins?

  One of my friends is a very enthusiastic aspiring rationalist, actually one of the most enthusiastic I've seen who is still very excited trying to implement the LW style of rationality in her day-to-day life. 

  Anyway, she's in an university, but she doesn't want to attend lectures because they're mostly less educational than her own reading, doesn't want to attend group session because they take too much time and the only reason she would want to attend classes is that she'd be able influence other students to become more like effective altruists.

  I mentioned that having regular friends and being able to converse with regular people have a lot hidden (and clear) benefits. But she thinks social life comes at a great cost, it takes a lot of time and distracts her from more explicit rational and altruist aspirations. She's afraid her standards for herself will drop, she'll become more like other people, less productive, less obsessed with world-saving.

  I understand her point because I've noticed I become more similar to the people who I spend time with, and therefore try to distance myself from people with hostile and antisocial beliefs because I don't want to become like them. But taken to this extreme, it seems... kind of crazy?

  [People like Brian Caplan have said they've done something similar,](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/03/my_beautiful_bu.html) who makes sure he gets as little input from the outside world and mostly likes to spend time with libertarian economics Ph.D.s which include bloggers from the rationalist memeplex like Robin Hanson or Alex Tabarrok from Marginal Revolution. His motivations seem to be more selfish - he simply doesn't like other kind of people and finds the outside society "unacceptable, dreary, insipid, ugly, boring, wrong, and wicked."

  But I'm more interested in my friend's case because it's more tangentially rationality related, and Caplan's motivations are quite uninteresting. If you want to want to maintain your current personality into the far future as closely as possible, are measures as extreme as this warranted? Your deeply-held beliefs might not change, but how important you find them probably will if you spend time with people who don't find the same things important.

    Perhaps, but in order to accomplish her goals in the wider world she *absolutely need* strong social skills.  Staying inside and interacting with few people will not give her the skills and connections she needs to get a paying job, let alone change the world.

    Sounds like a serious case of halo effect. a person can't save the world on their own, and they can't save the world if they don't take care of themself. your friend needs to taboo the word rationality and remember that the thought she cannot think (even if the thought might be wrong) limits her more than the thought she can. She shouldn't let her thinking be paralyzed by the fear of thinking an irrational thought, because that could cause her to think too rigidly.

    Rationality is a skill that can take a long time to master or even to be proficient with. People don't learn that kind of thing as well if they expect themselves to be perfect at it from the getgo and then get upset at themselves when they're not.

    Instead of putting a metaphorical dam in her mind to block her less rational thoughts from consciously forming, it might be better to let those thoughts come out into the open and address them with more thoughts, even if she knows they're wrong and even if it makes her feel stupid. Be willing to question everything, even if the question doesn't make sense since if it doesn't you can just unask the question afterwards. And if she finds herself spinning in circles stuck on a particular looping line of reasoning, she should just take a step back and take an outside view on whatever the subject she's thinking of is.

    Ultimately rationality is just a tool to help someone form more accurate beliefs and achieve their goals more effectively. If it's not helping her form more accurate beliefs and it's not helping her achieve her goals more effectively, she should ask herself what she thinks she's talking about when she says "rationality". Real rationality isn't just believing the words of some great teacher, even if what the teacher says is so obviously sensible and right and rational, one should still think it through thoroughly for themselves, just in case there's anything at all the teacher might have gotten wrong that slipped their notice, since the teacher is imperfect and human just like everyone else is, and since thinking things through thoroughly for yourself is a good habit to have.

    I'm starting to suspect that halo effects and happy death spirals are a common and prevalent enough problem for the rational/ist community that we really should be doing more to address it. People who are in a happy death spiral about rationality make rationality and this community look bad and aren't doing themselves any favors either.

    Hope this helps, and I hope your friend recovers from her happy death spiral as soon as possible!

    She's rationalizing (and she seems smart, so she's pretty good at it). Nobody is so hyper-rational that they would be able to cut out social contact just because they've decided they could get more useful information through reading. 

    Her decision to cut off most contact with others is an emotional, not rational decision. If I'm right, she's probably a lot like people on this sub, people who like both rationality and reading. For her, it's become an addiction, which she has rationalized as a perfectly reasonable decision.

    Tell your friend to do a thought experiment. Ask her how many of the profound ideas she is reading she could have come up with herself. Then ask her how important it is that you introduced her to this. The final part is ask her why does she believe that other people don't have the potential to contribute ideas just as life changing as rationality? For further reading I would say she should look into Nassim Taleb and his books the Black Swan and anti fragility. Pretty much he says that any event that you go to that has minimal downside on your immediate well-being but could have potentially huge upside should be engaged in. And parties fall into this anti fragile category. You can extend this to socializing in general. 

    Meeting someone cost you a few seconds of your life which, if you are being healthy as a rational option, you can probably afford a few seconds and if you don't like them you can politely disengage and not have to worry about it again. People disengage all the time, but maybe you will find that person who will introduce you to rationalism or your new favorite band or maybe the person who you love and motivates you to be a more effective altruist in another way. I guess the more effective way to say it is her understanding of rationality is very short term. friends and socializing and parties and even class don't have a great return on a daily basis but if you spend all semester in class and only get introduced to one life changing idea that you couldn't figure out on your own then that class was still totally worth it. You have no way of predicting that ahead of time and if its a boring class you can just read while you're in class

      To play devils advocate...

      Most people aren't the people you read about in books.

      The only reason that a live interactive individual would do better then the collective sum of recorded human knowledge is because individuals might be able to tailor their advice for you specifically. You get information tailored to a specific individual.

      But on average they're going to be worse at conveying information then someone who's thought a lot about how best to convey their information to a general individual.

      There are two fundamental problems. The ability to convey useful information over speech, and the selection bias of who you're talking to (IE: not people who think the ideas are important enough to commit to the internet).

      (You can get around the latter by careful selection of people, and specific instruction is often very useful for learning a skill)

      If you're relying on *talking* to people to get introduced to new ideas, well you're going to have a bad time. Read more instead.
      ```

      - u/dragonballherpeZ:
        ```
        You aren't incorrect but you're making a mistake in assuming that the information you are going to receive from those people is going to be intentionally conveyed. I forget who said it but and often repeated idea is that everyone teaches you either they teach you what to do or they teach you what not to do. In which case your observation of that person is significantly more important than anything they say.

        Besides I think that you're also making a problematic binary here it's not that there are interesting people and boring people life is more vague than that. Maybe that person who you think isn't very rational stumbled upon a really rational belief and practice by accident. Maybe it only works in one aspect of their lives but if they have a brilliant way of doing that, which I believe almost everyone has at least one or two brilliant revelations inside of them, then it's more like there are points where your wisdom quality will increase and decrease.

        So I still believe that the best argument in favor of interacting with other socially is the anti fragile one. You lose almost nothing trying to be social and forcing yourself to do so for one full minute per person at a party. If you get bored or if you decide you don't like it you can always leave but you may get lucky. And if you make it a point to be social over a long enough time You are almost guaranteed to be lucky because unexpected people will be there. 

        More importantly she even said that the only reason she would have to interact with other people and introduce them to rationalism if she wants to do that then she should be a good rationalist and be a fun person to be around. There is a terrible terrible stereotype of the Vulcan rationalists without emotions who only talks about analytical things if you want to be a real rationalist you have to figure out how to deal in a world without everyone following rationalism and you can't just lament that they're not as smart as you you have to set an example explain it where it is relevant and socially okay so that people are willing to listen and actually change their behaviour and more importantly you need to be the kind of person that people want to copy

    This reminds me of a point Tetlock makes in Superforecasting; he describes a thing that almost all of the forecasters who performed extremely well over a 4 year rigorous forecasting tournament shared: a 'dragonfly-eyed' perspective, or in other words a tendency to actively include multiple external points of view. The general makeup of a 'superforecaster' seemed to correspond to a careful, rational thinker, after reading through the whole book, so it seems relevant to dig into this 'multiple perspective' idea.

    Here's one slightly more detailed explanation. So, there's studies about how averaging lots of people's estimates can actually produce really good estimates taken together, granted on problems where observers have any chance of being able to forecast at all (kinda pointless to ask a crowd to forecast the psi of a gust of wind 20 years from now in a South African diamond mine). However, there's potentially even better forecasts possible if you **extremize** that calculation. That means 70% -> 85% probability and 30% -> 15% probability, or something similar. The intuition is that scraps of useful information are spread across many observers; if those observers all knew all of the information, they would update their forecasts to be stronger. Turns out by extremizing the 'wisdom of the crowd' measure, they were able to beat out the 'wisdom of the crowd' (based on what I understood). So, including lots of perspectives actually makes you more accurate (but you do still have to incorporate those perspectives well and update with care, and have an eye to the underlying causal relationships too, and so on and so on....)

    Anyway, incorporating multiple points of view is directly beneficial to anyone who wants to become stronger rationally, it seems. (There are probably more direct ways to argue this point)

    Besides the other benefits, like feeling contentment (social contact seems important for this) and discovering new allies. I personally can't imagine having grown half as much in general without all the social experiences I've had at work/college, including meaningless blather.
    ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:

    There are two issues here.  The first is friends.  All her points are quite valid.  Although surrounding oneself with friends that motivate, inspire, and help one make progress toward one's goals will indeed help her in achieving her goals, the opposite is also true.  She's said there are no people of the former class near her location; for her to then go out and cultivate a friend into the above description, or seek out people that fit that criteria, is extremely suboptimal - one should not place that expectation upon her.  It sounds like she has many online friends whose company she values; her social skills will not atrophy.  Her acceptance of her situation is rational given her goals, and will not have costs to her emotional health.

    The second issue is the human need for in-person socialization.  This appears to be a concern you haven't raised with her, and of which she might not be aware.  Rare is the human whose happiness will not suffer when isolated from in-person, one-on-one interaction for a prolonged period of time.  This interaction need not be any deeper than eye contact and a smile, jest, and/or thanks; each interaction hardly costs any time, and the benefits to one's mental health granted by even twenty minutes of such interaction will be well worth her time.  It's also an opportunity for her to exercise her social brain in-person, as online interaction, even via video, isn't quite the same.

    I feel the need to say this because I think other advice offered here strawman her concerns, and conflate the above two issues.  

    I don't think you've given us enough information to judge whether she has social anxiety or awkwardness that is influencing her reasoning.  To mitigate whatever influences that might or might not be impairing her ability to reason as a rational agent, I offer this advice: Evincing to her that you come from a position of agreement with her goals, present any advice or suggested courses of action not as criticism but rather as refinements to her plans.

    Yes, spending time with people will tend to make you more like those people. Deliberately walling yourself away from people will, I think, make one more extreme in one's views. Not occasionally discussing one's views with others removes a number of sanity checks - it's often true that one does not notice the flaws in one's own beliefs and opinions (confirmation bias makes this very hard to do through self-study alone, and discussing an idea only with people who already subscribe to part of it risks forming an ingroup that runs into a group form of confirmation bias).

    So... there *is* a cost, in time and other ways, to having a social life. But it's also a buffer against a number of self-reinforcing mental biases. If, somehow, your friend is always perfectly correct about anything and everything, then it would be too costly to have any social life, at all...

    ...but if she *thinks* that she is that good, then I have to consider it significantly more probable that she is over-estimating her own correctness than that she is, in fact, that good. (Would that be egotistical bias?)

    So, yeah. I can see a clear and obvious failure mode that starts with refusing all contact with regular friends, and ends with spending several years and a lot of effort in pursuit of something which, in hindsight, turns out to be the *wrong thing* to do - perhaps trying to make everyone happy in a way that turns out to be equivalent to forcing wireheading on the world or something.

    The hospitals are full of really overworked, frustrated people who moved to the area for the low rent but became collateral damage in the hugely destructive fights. Sometimes they receive huge donations from the Wayne Institute, but that doesn't make up for the nights when the ER is overflowing, there's no beds available and civilian casualties with less severe injuries are waiting for hours to be seen. Staff burn out quickly, there's a huge psychiatric team with massive staff turnover. Ward veterans take bets on how long newbies will last. 

    On the upside it produces a LOT of publications for case studies - with so much wanton violence there's plenty of material for universities all around the world to draw on.

  WARNING: SPIDERS

  I find it interesting that both the socjus tribe, and the anti-socjus tribe want basically the same thing (equality for everone) and yet have polarised into two camps that seem to spend hours every day demonising and ridiculing each other instead of productively working together toward their shared goal.

  Society has an alarming amount of both misogyny and misandry, of predjudice in all directions, and all but the fringe crazies of both tribes believe these things to be terrible tradgedies to be rectified.

  And then *instead of working together rectifying them* they waste time drawing comics and writing blog posts depicting the other tribe as disgusting pathetic bigots.

  As far as I can tell, the socjus tribe thinks the anti-socjus tribe are rapey neckbearded redpillers, and the anti-socjus tribe thinks the socjus tribe are cultish violent hypocrites.

  And *sure* there are *elements* of these things in both tribes, but they tend to be vocal minorities, right at the edges. For the most part, if you tabooed any gender-politics jargon and took a person from each tribe and got them to talk to each other, they'd actually find they have very similar views.

  That they hate each other so much just seems to boil down to standard us vs them tribalism.

  And socjus vs anti-socjus isn't the *only* place where I've noticed this bizzare trend of people with common values dividing into two tribes that spend more time mudslinging each other than trying to acheive their goals.

  So I'm wondering if you all have any ideas for getting people to drop their pointless tribalism and actually work together on shared goalstates.

Probably lots of them don't even directly encounter the other, or only do so anonymously online. 

    Maybe making extreme statements on either side politically inconvenient?

    The tribes generally disagree on what the state of the world is, where the problems are, and what should be done to fix them. And the people belonging to the same tribe don't necessarily share values with the common egalitarian motive. Social conservatives *are* anti-SJW, and liberal authoritarians *are* anti-patriarchy. When you have a tribe that explicitly identifies itself as against some group (anti-SJWs, anti-patriarchy/hegemony), you are not going to get a happy bundle of unified opinions.

    I'm curious, what shared goal do you think these tribes have? It's not egalitarianism. It is, as always, scoring points against the other tribe. It's a social sport, completely separate from the ostensible topic at hand, and I'd like to see any sort of evidence against that. The values you can infer from their behavior are exactly what you would expect.

  I liked this [cool cyborg ear.] (http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/future/technology/217097-doctor-adventure-makes-an-ear) It looks pretty sci-fi. 

  Does anyone know if there's a word for fanfiction that occurs in the canonical universe of one setting (eg Harry Potter) but doesn't involve any of the main characters? Eg, if there was a story about a team of Gringotts goblins working on a way to improve vault security, or someone who works in Diagon Alley and their issues with payroll tax, this is still Harry Potter fanfiction but is there a word for its distance from the main storyline?

    I've heard 'sidequel' applied to such stories.

    Spin-off.

      Ooh yes. That's a thing.

  so I have been thinking about an idea that I saw in less wrong and I've been elaborating on for a while internally. Eliazar mentions in one post that his techniques are almost like a school of martial arts and one that like all martial arts is strong and some ways and weak  in other ways. I've come to believe that Nassim Taleb and his books on unpredictable events and how one deals with them ( the black swan and antifragility) could represent a second style of Minervan art (Minerva being the goddess of wisdom and strategic battles).

  Since I feel like this is just starting as a field who else do you believe is on the path of creating new and slightly different Minervan arts?
  ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    Antifragility, which you could more sanely call adaptiveness (I don't care that Taleb denies this), and black swans, which you could less poetically call kurtosis risk, are more like presentations of interesting parts of risk modeling and management with typical pop sci overemphasis. It isn't a "style" of mental arts, it's a collection of hypotheses and prescriptions, like any other thesis. It isn't a paradigm in and of itself. At best it's a few considerations to keep track of in your epistemology and ethics according to their value.
    ```

  - u/electrace:

    Taleb gets talked about a lot, but I find his books needlessly long for the amount of information they convey.

    It boils down to...

    1) Don't assume everything is a Normal curve.

    2) The sum of the smallest probabilities can often be big enough that the probability of at least one of those events occurring is fairly high.

    3) Some predictions have such a large margin of error that they are basically useless.

    4) Don't trust prediction markets, stock prices, etc. They can easily be wrong.
    ```
