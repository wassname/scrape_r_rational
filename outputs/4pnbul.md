## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I went to the author Jim Butcher's book signing last Saturday when he visited Sweden, and managed to ask a question about the unsaid things about the setting. In the Dresden Files, all religions are true to some extent, and belief gives power to the gods Pratchett style, so the origin of the world and things like that change over time. Currently the Abrahamic religions dominate, so hell is very real. Hell hasn't been talked about much though, so the books don't explain what it's like. I asked about how much power the devil has over hell (The books show Hades having king like powers over the Greek Underworld), and Jim said that hell operates exactly like a multinational business conglomerate.

  I find this amusing. I imagine ancient fallen angels and demons of corruption who saw the stars form, bickering in the lunch room over unreasonable quotas and rules handed down from Management and laughing at stupid customers.

    Lucky sod. I've been wanting to pick Jim's brain about The Dresden Files for ages... might be better if I don't though, because I'd probably just vacillate between fanboying and criticizing some of his writing choices (the Deus Ex Machina of the latest book was really offputting, for me, and the representation of the Abrahamic Religions as purely good compared to all the other gods and belief systems has troubling implications for an ostensibly Kitchen Sink fantasy series).

      So much. I enjoy the series a lot, and have reread most of the books maybe five times, but I wish there wasn't so much special treatment given to Christianity. My main gripe with Skin Game though was how poorly Nicodemus planned things. Since he knew the relics were all in the same place (He knew both the grail and the knife were there, at least), and *especially* knowing Mab compulsively keeps her word all the time every time, he should have just said he wanted all the relics there, not betrayed, and if he just couldn't help himself but try to kill Harry, he should have just carried around a big chunk of polonium in his backpack throughout the mission. The noose makes him immortal, his fallen angel gives him regeneration, and the poisoning would be slow enough Harry wouldn't have noticed until after the mission.

    Superhero shows are full of irrationality. I've been watching Season 1 of The Flash recently, and while I like some parts of it, the Flash's refusal to incapacitate or disarm obvious villains (instead giving them time to act by starting with dialogue) is severely grating. Why would you stop with the superspeed mode to *talk* to the guy with the cold gun and allowing him time to plan and act and cause severe property damage, instead of taking the cold raygun out of his hands before he can do anything, tossing it out the nearest window, and THEN talking to him? Why is the cold-gun villain taking time to explain yourself to The Flash while he's incapacitated, when the villain fully intends to shoot him and kill him afterwards? The villain killed his underling instantly without gloating at all earlier in the show in a rare display of competence, why is he now pissing about with the Flash?

    There are lots of really good Doylist reasons to have lots of dialogue between hero and villain, but it would be really nice if the writers put in any amount of effort at all for a plausible Watsonian reason. Give the freeze gun a reloading thing that the villain can fumble with for his part, for example.
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      Also: the freeze gun is *not that scary*. It is not a particularly effective weapon, nor does it make you immune to bullets. Yet we're supposed to believe it lets its wielder take on a police station, threaten a speedster, and qualify as a supervillain.

      (It's supposed to be extra scary because cold disables speedsters. Well, so does a bullet to the face. The difficulty is hitting them, not harming them.)

      God, don't get me started on The Flash, it's nonsense through and through.

        I really liked *Steelheart* by Brandon Sanderson for how he dealt with fighting supervillains.  The main character is heavily focused on researching his targets (and Epics (the supervillains) in general), and his primary form of classification is whether or not they have a "prime invulnerability", which is to say: "can you kill them with a sniper rifle?"

        If you can kill them with a gun, then kill them with a gun.  If you can't, continue researching until you find their inevitable weakness (in-story inevitable, not just narratively inevitable).

  Who wants to talk about Brexit? And it's repercussions on globalism, internationalism and nationalism. 

  Anyone thinking the EU will be better or worse or collapse? 

  I'm Scottish and I predict the future of Scotland and the UK is quickly coming to an end
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    Hmm, I guess we'll see. In and of itself, the Brexit referendum doesn't cause UK to leave the EU. It obliges the government to do so, however. If anti-brexit elements in parliament are clever, they can dissolve the government and call for new elections. If anti-brexit elements win said election, they'll have a mandate for staying in the EU. Otherwise, it's fairly likely the UK will end up leaving the EU.

    In general, governments like the EU are underestimated by their citizens. A lot of government policies are invisible to the public but provide benefits. For example, in the EU, they jointly evaluate drugs for medical use with a single [agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency), rather than on a nation-by-nation basis. This is convenient and saves money while ensuring a certain level of safety and efficacy for new drugs, etc. This is something that your typical EU citizen does not think about or interact with in a visible way, but has a huge and positive impact on their lives. 

    There are scores of institutions like this that operate invisibly in the background of a typical UK citizen's life, and the UK government will have to be very on-the-ball about replacing these with national institutions. No matter what, it will be expensive and will significantly expand the size of the UK government. They'll lose the institutional history and economies of scale that these organizations have, even if they do their best to migrate to new setup.

        EU institutions have problems, but these problems aren't really solved by abandoning institutional history. Trying to run a similar institution that operates with similar objectives but only for one nation (with fewer resources and less legitimacy) will mostly make these problems worse. There are really really big economies of scale for drug validation. I have no particular reason to think the UK-level equivalent agency will be better, and several reasons to think it will be worse. Most people underestimate the importance of institutions in governance, politics, and general.

      Well that was interesting. I have *some* stake in the game because Sweden too is in the EU, so my perspective is somewhat different. I don't know what will turn out the be the best path for the people of the UK. I can offer up *my* main reservations about the EU, however, of which there are two. The first is a little abstract. It's that moving the decision making process away from the people decreases faith in, and engagement with, the democratic process. Sure, ultimately representatives in the European Parliament are elected like members of parliament, but Brussels is so much further away in people' minds than [your own capitol]. In most European countries, the percentage of people who vote fore EU reps is much lower than the percentage who vote in national elections. In Sweden, which voted for both in 2014, 85% of people voted in the parliamentary election, while only 51% voted for EU reps. I am active in local politics and knocked on a lot of doors in 2014. Several hundred people gave me some version of "I can't be bothered to vote, it's all so far away and I can't change anything". Then, when laws come into effect that originate in Brussels, either people like them and don't care/notice, or they dislike the law and feel their interests are trampled upon by faceless corporate overlords (It's a pervasive view in Sweden that the EU is more prone to lobbyism than Sweden itself). Sure, if people all made sure to spend half an hour a week on keeping up with politics they could vote confidently and affect things, but psychologically the behemoth of Brussels just doesn't feel close enough to touch. I would guess that many Americans feels the same about the Federal government as opposed to your own state.

      The second, more concrete objection is also more party political. I'm center-left in Sweden, which basically means Bearnie Sanders. I *like* that Sweden has long had strong unions. But we joined the EU in 95, and since then unions have gradually been gutted. In particular, there is something called the [Posted Workers Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posted_Workers_Directive). What it does is make it easier to hire foreign workers, at the wages and conditions that unions in their home country agree to, regardless of the stance of the unions in the country where they work. So Eastern European workers (poorer) can go work in the UK/Sweden/etc at wages and conditions far worse than local workers would ever accept, and unions can do absolutely nothing about it. So unions can no longer negotiate for all workers, and companies can often straight out ignore them. This used to absolutely not be the case in Sweden. Like many other countries, we are now dealing with a shrinking middle class and widening inequality. And unions have all but been knocked out of the equations, all because the EU made it so and we can't change it short of leaving.

      I hope things turn out well for the UK, but we'll see. If it does, I hope Sweden follows suit. If not, I may have to give more weight to economical arguments for staying. But the ever widening inequality, coupled with slowly rising unemployment in the face of technology, makes me very suspicious of the gung ho neoliberalism that flows from Brussels and makes up 80% of the laws and regulations that go into effect in my county every year.
      ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    I'm Swedish and quite negatively disposed toward the EU because it gutted Swedish unions. Selfishly, I am quite glad that the UK can now serve as a test case as to what happens when a country leaves the union, and am hoping you will do well. Also, England is way, way to the right of us, and whether Scotland joins in the future or not, the 'average' political position of the EU power brokers will now shift toward that of my country and party.

    Also, where in Scotland do you live? I studied in Aberdeen for four years.

        [Second paragraph explains it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4pnbul/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d4mpt49) I'm sure focuses lie elsewhere in the UK, but as someone locally politically active in Sweden, that's the major gripe I have with our membership in the EU.

          Well as a leftist I would say that's not a problem with the EU, at least I think it should be the case that wealth is taken from the west and distributed more equally. However if it leads to growth of inequality rather than just all of the EU enjoying the same standard of living then that's the issue that needs tackled. Presumably if the wages were low enough your goods and services would be cheaper in turn with little standard of living variance.

            Certainly more work for the poor in the East helps the East catch up, but they would catch up considerably quicker if they weren't locked into *their* minimum wages and unions. If they at least got paid more in the West than in their home countries, wages would have to rise in the East. But as it is, many of them make the same barely tolerable wage in Sweden as they do at home, while Swedish workers lose out on work. It's possible I have a narrow perspective, but it seems to me foreigners make the same $4/hour wages they did in the 90s, while Swedish wages are stagnant for the majority of the population.

    > Both Brexit and Trumpism are the very, very, wrong answers to legitimate questions that urban elites have refused to ask for thirty years. 

    > Questions such as - Who are the losers of globalization, and how can we spread the benefits to them and ease the transition? Is it fair that the rich can capture almost all the gains of open borders and trade, or should the process be more equitable?

      The Prime Minister is supposed to represent the will of the people. The will of the people was directly opposed to him, and he wasn't able to control his own party. While I don't like him, I think the alternatives are worse (especially Boris Johnson and Micheal Gove). I can understand why he feels that he should resign, and respect him for it, although I think it's a mistake.

      Think of it as an ethical move, rather than a political one designed to help his career.

      A large part of voting to remain with the UK was because there was zero guarantee of getting in the EU, so we'd g independent, be out of the EU and it'd take some time to apply.

      The UK voted as a unit. England really wanted out. Scotland really wanted to stay in. Scotland voted last year, barely, to stay in the UK.

    I do have a question- on Reddit and most articles I've read, it seems clear that leaving the EU has a lot of costs and that meanwhile the benefits promised to the Brexist supporters are unlikely to be delivered (more control over immigration, save large sums of money that instead will go to NHS). 

    What are the main factors in why this still got so much support and ultimately passed? I don't doubt my simplistic reasoning above is missing a lot, but I've also heard that there's an attitude similar to Trump supporters in the United States of unhappiness with the status quo and using this as an opportunity to show it.
    ```

    - u/blazinghand:
      ```
      Reddit and the other sources of links you read are a hotbed of "people who are against Brexit" so you get the appearance that everyone was anti-Brexit. In truth, many people liked the idea of Brexit. Many politicians, newspapers, and so on supported it. In fact, most of the people who voted in the referendum voted to Leave, as I'm sure everyone is keenly aware.

      Leaving the EU has a lot of costs, but they're non-obvious, and the benefits seem obvious. Remaining has lots of clear costs and subtle benefits. You might think that the EU regulatory regime is expensive and not worth it. Perhaps, the idea of non-UK citizens dictating law of any kind in the UK rankles. After all, most UK citizens identify as British, not Europeans, on some level. UK has always had a distinct cultural identity from the continent. The EU itself has problems, and not having to bear those burdens could sound attractive.

      For an American example, imagine you live in an area where everyone cared a lot about the restricting right to smoke marijuana. When you go online to the websites your friends frequent, you read about the dangers of marijuana use. When you see links on facebook or your social media of choice covering marijuana use, it talks about the dangers. Yes, you're aware that there are people in other places with weird beliefs (like in Colorado), but you know that their arguments (marijuana not harmful, taxing it would pay for itself, crime stuff, etc) are unlikely to be true. So you wonder, how do marijuana legalization schemes actually get support and get passed?

          The effective main pro-leave argument is immigration control. It's what the Leave campaign was centered about, and it's what plays into fear and uncertainty in large sections of the UK.

          There were some political/economical claims regarding leave, but they were almost always presented as asides, and usually had little factual accuracy.
          ```

    - u/RMcD94:

      As far as I'm concerned the first is buzzwords, talking about sovereignty is pretty easy. 

      Secondly it's that for the past twenty years the UK government has blamed the EU at every opportunity for anything bad. 

      Thirdly the EU is rubbish at telling especially the older generation what they contribute. Everyone who goes to University all intimately know hence the heavy youth vote, but very little older folk know. 

      Fourth the remain campaign was the worst campaign ever. It was useless at making any point or refuting leaves constant lies. 

      And last and most importantly immigration. Even though half our immigrants come from outside the leave campaign were allowed to portray as if when we had full control we would stop it.

  Why do so many anime fall apart? I've been watching *Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress* (*Koutetsujou no Kabaneri*) and just shaking my head at how stupid everyone is acting. It wasn't like that in the beginning, or even the first few episodes. (At first I thought I was being picky, but when I went to /r/anime they were largely in agreement, so I'm probably not entirely off-base.)

  So *why* does this happen? Why do good things stop being good? Is it just a matter of authors not knowing how to keep the plot in motion, or not knowing how to end things? Is it that fewer resources are devoted to a project the longer it's gone on? I can understand interest waning, since I've definitely felt that myself, but is that really the big driver of declining quality?

  (I'm feeling the same way about Re:Zero, but while last episode didn't do terribly much to advance the plot, at least it contained an interesting side story with better characterization than I've seen so far.)
  ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    I think the answer is to look at which anime don't.  *MONSTER* doesn't.  *Steins;Gate* doesn't.  Madoka doesn't.  What others don't, and why?

    I know *MONSTER* is seinen and adapted from a mangaka with a large following.  I know Steins;Gate was adapted from a visual novel/video game.

    I'll hypothesize that some of it is planning, as others have mentioned.  I also think it's related to how closely the producers and writers must hew to established conventions of Japanese media.  Each of the above has characters that come across as real people, and few if any that are two dimension archetypes.  Haruhi, for example, is strongest when it shows each character actively pursuing their own goals and weakest when genre convention and archetype shunt those goals into the background.

    That said, I'm not well versed in manga or anime; I'll leave the discussion here.

    Same reason most fanfiction falls apart and how most books can't follow the rational ideal. I've always thought its important to have a team that checks the plot and advises against undesirable plot holes because one single person can't account for all possible interpretations of his work.

    I think there's also pressure for some elements like a certain amount of fanservice in every anime to get certain demographics (otakus are the ones that buy the goods after all, and those are the main source of income).

    I remember having seen some really good works that were very interesting yet were a commercial failure because they didn't follow conventions of how an anime/story must be.

    I think Young Justice was cancelled due to the same reasons in the West.
    ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    The same is true, to a lesser extent, with all TV series that don't have an ending planned from the start.

    (I'm satisfied with Re:Zero so far. But since it's an adaptation of a light novel series that's on its 10th volume with no sign of stopping, I fully expect it to run into the same issue.)
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      My opinion on Re:Zero is mostly that way because of how expectations were set. The first arc introduced a lot of characters and intrigue, but then that all got pared away to focus on life at the manor (which is itself a subplot of the crowning, but only barely). The time loop also sort of falls by the wayside, except in that it allows the main character an excuse to be extremely reckless. I don't know, I really try to appreciate things for what they are rather than what I want them to be, but for this particular series I'm having trouble with that, mostly because of how the focus has shifted.
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        Yeah the first arc was definitely most engaging. I'm hoping it picks up again now that the plot seems to be focusing on the crowning.

        I still enjoyed the manor slice-of-life, because I generally like slice-of-life comedies, but it wasn't what I expected or wanted from the show.

      Re:Zero felt incredibly irrational to me (up to Episode 7 where I stopped, I think)- the main character is actively silly and manages to be an overly-emotional idiot. 

      [Spoilers through episode 7-](#s "Speaking his ridiculous ideas *out loud*, pursuing a romance immediately after arriving in a new world (he was at first interested in the princess, and then somehow ended up being in love with the two maids who hated him and including the one that was trying to kill him?), generally squandering his opportunities (even with his time loop, when given a boon from a lord for saving the princess's life, he chose to become a servant/guest at the lord's estate...), not communicating well (for example after the blue-haired maid's death he could have easily not stirred the pot further but instead lets the sister think he's responsible for this and sets off more drama).")

        Your core arguments are valid, but this kind of character flaw is necessary in stories involved time loops; if the character was an unemotional rational agent, he could just brute-force the scenario and there would be no story.

          Well, there would be a very *different* kind of story. One that's getting kind of overplayed. I was glad to discover a time loop story where the protagonist does *not* swiftly become an aloof schemer who muchkins through suicide. 

          The protagonist is not my favourite kind of anime archetype, to say the least. But it's one *completely unsuited* to a life of mystery, violence, and short-lived relationships. I find it interesting to watch him fail to cope.

            Yes, and fail to cope in ways that aren't totally whiney! (Looking at you, Shinji)

            I too just kinda cringe and move on whenever the MC pulls one of those 'Hey I'm an anime nerd too' moments, like in most of the first episode. But fortunately they're rare enough that they don't much disrupt the story for me.

    I'm more a fan of anime than you are but I agree a lot of shows fall apart later on. In my opinion it's because shows try to stand out with interesting premises but little direction. Shows with simpler premises but good execution are more reliable in anime, such as Shirobako or Shokugeki no Soma. Though there are some great shows with interesting premises such as Zetsuen no Tempest, Madoka, and Steins;Gate.

    >Why do so many anime fall apart?

    It at least stops surprising you if you think of anime as the fast food of the Japanese media-industry: even Sturgeon’s law doesn’t hold true for season-long anime. So continuing the analogy, a nice diet would be to watch quality works like the ones produced by Ghibli and *sometimes* watch specific anime titles like H×H while still having the expectation that the plot will eventually get to suck.

  What did you buy in the Steam Summer Sale?  

  Some stuff I got;

  * Dark Souls 2 and 3, as a big fan of games that last really long, this series is a huge treat. Nothing better than grinding through an area while listening to a podcast.  

  * Tormentum: Dark Sorrow, this was an impulse purchase I suppose, the game looks gorgeous in my defense.  

  * Grim Dawn, apparently the real Diablo III, can't wait to see for myself!  

  * MGS V: The Phantom Pain, my first game in the series, I hope the plot won't be hard to follow.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    * Banner Saga 2, because the first one was well done with an interesting world and unique art style
    * War for the Overworld, because of Dungeon Keeper nostalgia
    * Assassin's Creed Unity and Rogue, because I enjoy the games but think they've become too formulaic to pay more than $20 for (my par rate is $1 per hour of entertainment)
    * Invisible Inc, because I love turn-based strategy and it's been on my wishlist for a long time.

    We'll see what else goes on sale, but I think that's enough to keep me in games for a long time, given my available time to play them.

    Mirror's Edge, Deus Ex (the first one), Deus Ex: HR, and Quantum Conundrum.

    None of them seem to run particularly well on my aging laptop, which I really should have anticipated. Well, except Deus Ex, but playing it straight after the ultra-modern reboot really shows how poorly it's aged.

    I got *[Solitairica](http://store.steampowered.com/app/463980)*. I thought it looked very interesting after I saw TotalBiscuit's video on it (though [that video apparently wasn't received well](https://np.reddit.com/r/cynicalbritofficial/comments/4nijs1)), and I also have vague memories of enjoying attempting to play the somewhat-similar (but much more complex) game *[Spider Solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Spider_Solitaire)* many years ago.

    Resident Evil 6. It was way cheap, and I've wanted to play it since I saw the thumbs up mechanic. Took it for a go, and the campaign is trash, Mercaneries is enjoyable.

    Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. A friend and I have a ironic enjoyment of Naruto, so it was a lot of fun to play godtier battle mages together.

    System Shock 1. I have this tick of having to start series with the first game, and 2 was gathering dust.

    Bioshock 2. Beat it a long time ago, but never paid for it.

    Dead Space 2. Enjoyed the first one, but not enough to pay full price for the sequel.

    Megabyte Punch. I'm a fan of Team Reptile, the developers of this and Lethal League, and I love Smash, so I thought it was time to this clone\twist on it.

    And then a whole bunch of games that've caught my eye through the steam queue: Fortune Summoners (I really enjoyed Recettear's mind numbingly simple combat system, it was meditative to me), Unholy Heights, Valdis Story, Battle Fantasia, and Evil Maze.


    Also, Magodo, the plot will be WAY to hard for you to follow. The entire crux of MGSVs plot is from games that are ~20 years old on the MSX. It is chockful of references, callbacks, and retcons. But the worst offender is that the plot of the game was held back by Konami due to budgeting\corperate problems. Good luck, though, it'll still be fun to play, but I honestly think it's the weakest game in the series.

  Is anyone interested in setting up a tabletop roleplaying game over the internet? Maybe it's just ingroup favouritism, but I've always wanted to play something like Dungeons and Dragons, FATE, or Mutants and Masterminds with other people from the subreddit.

  NEWER EDIT: We have a Google Doc and a Discord chat now.

  Discord Chat link: https://discordapp.com/invite/5rs54Mb

  EDIT: The next step would be a discussion about the details of what, exactly, we're doing, preferably in a different format. I don't really have anything that strikes me as a *good* idea for how to do this, but since I'm temporarily in charge by divine right of Schelling Point, I'm going to use this as a test to see if we can all show up in the same place at the same time. Everyone who acknowledges my vague legitimacy and/or doesn't have any better ideas should try to log on to the #reddit-rational IRC channel at 2PM (7 PM GMT) either tomorrow or the day after (Saturday June 25 and Sunday June 26, respectively). I'll be on the IRC as much as possible this weekend, primarily between noon and midnight Eastern Standard Time (5PM and 5AM GMT), so if you do happen to miss the time we'll still be able to chat.

  If you *do* have any better ideas, "better" meaning "good enough to be worth confusing the issue and possibly not being able to get the basics done over the weekend", PM me and I'll signal boost you. I'll be PMing this message to everyone who posted to make sure it gets out. Anyone and everyone should feel free to show up and chat with me, even if you didn't post in this thread; I'll try to get a headcount and some first impressions for what games everyone prefers.

    I'm tentatively in favor, as my long-standing D&D group appears to have suffered a fatal blow that it's not going to recover from anytime soon. It really depends on what kind of GM you have and how regular the schedule is (I'm system ambivalent). If you're still looking for a GM, I have a half dozen settings and campaigns that can be dusted off for play (D&D, M&M, or Pathfinder).

    Edit: CST for me.

    I would be very interested. It seems several people here are. The main problem is probably *keeping it going* once it starts up. Play By Post games tend to die the first time there is a battle, and voice games tend to have time zone issues. I alas am European, and since most of you are American, I'd have to play in the middle of the night, most likely.

    If somehow a group could be formed willing to play at Saturday or Sunday noonish EST, I would be very happy to be the game master for a D&D 3.5 game. Or a player for any system.

      At this rate, we might have as many as three groups running, so there's a good chance you can DM at least one. You might want to hold off on studying up, though, since we haven't really nailed down a game yet.

  After the last Game of Thrones episode I was thinking. In a low fantasy battle how would you field giants? How would you arm them, what armor, which combat roles?

  You got 1 giant every 500 man. How to use them in the most efficent way possible.

  Various scenarios: siege, defende castel, camp battle, skirmish.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    It depends on how their strength scales. If a giant is twice the height of a human, then it's eight times as massive. What's the strength-to-weight ratio? Strength per mass goes down as size increases, generally speaking. So let's say that a giant is twice the height of a human with eight times the mass and five times the strength.

    Using them as siege weapons almost certainly isn't efficient, since you can just have five men carrying a battering ram. It's *possible* that they're able to concentrate their force into a smaller area and break down a door more effectively than men with siege tools, but I sort of doubt it. If you do the math, I don't think a Game of Thrones sized giant throwing rocks can do a proper siege either, since castles should be prepared to defend against catapults, trebuchets, etc. which fire much larger projectiles. There's the possibility of the giant climbing the walls, but that depends on the particulars of the fortification in question, and you don't want to send your giant in on his own, where he's vulnerable.

    A properly outfitted giant on the field of battle is another story entirely. Give him a sword and not only can he strike with the strength of five men, but he'd also have a much longer reach. That allows him to break through non-giant formations with relative ease. Also, the greatly increased range means that a giant can use slower, heavier weapons relative to his size. Obviously you'd need to armor the giant as well, because he'll be a large target, but it's totally worth it. A giant can probably handle cavalry pretty easily, so long as he doesn't get completely flanked.

    I suppose it's also possible that a giant would do well as an archer, but it's my understanding that longbowmen were more about launching huge numbers of arrows into the air than hitting a target precisely. You'd have to do the math to see what kind of draw the giant would have and how far the effective range would be, but that's hard enough when talking about historical human archers. Intuition tells me it wouldn't be worth it, but I don't know how much to trust that.

    (My biggest problem with that episode was that they didn't give the giant a weapon. In the books, the giants used large rocks tied to trees, but in the show he was just using his hands, presumably because it would have messed up their ideas for the battle if he'd been as effective as he should have been. (The lack of proper armor can be chalked up to not having the time or resources.) (I also have some trouble with the plausibility of a giant using his bare hands to break down a door meant to hold off armies with siege weapons.))
    ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      You could also treat giants as cavalry that's not stoppable by pikes; i.e. give them heavy armor and put them at the head of a formation and just rip through opponents line with pure momentum.
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        GoT giants seem to scale better than square/cube law would require. Remembering the feats of the giants during the Wall Siege: 

        Be a one Person ballista that shots from a bow a few hundred Meters into the air

        Barehandes destroy Iron Gates

        Use a chain to pull apart a heavy Iron fortified door
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          Yeah, I agree with this. My analysis is for them being roughly five times stronger than humans, but it's entirely possible that ~~no one did the math~~ magic is involved somehow. It's hard to peg what the actual difference between a giant and a human is in canon though, if it's consistent at all (which it might not be, because ~~no one did the math~~ of magic).

  Finally getting over my depressive phase, these days have sucked big time and I can't believe I actually spent two whole days asleep just so that I wouldn't have to think.

  It seemed to do the work and now I'm feeling more optimistic (although also a lot more aggresive than usual). Still tired though, trying to come up with some strategy to get back to normal faster and make up for the huge delay on everything.

  Seriously, fuck bipolarity/whatever it is I have (even if the manic phases are amazing to my productivity...). Planning to order more **adrafinil** because its the only thing that has kept me somewhat awake and probably seek a specialist.

  ---------------------------------------------

  Also started an anime called **[Kyoukai no kanata](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18153/Kyoukai_no_Kanata)** which has some really low reviews. Its a SoL with supernatural elements about demon hunters, makes me think a bit of Madoka Magica with better animation but worse music and slower plot. Managed to watch a bit but lost interest after the depressive episode began, currently retaking it and seeing if it could work for a fic.

    For something more useful to everyday life I would download one of the programs that reads micro expressions thus giving me awesome social powah.

    It shouldn't be to hard to hack yourself into Eidetic memory. 
    By selectively turning off anything not absolutely necessary and increasing your brain's metabolic intake, you could probably increase your mental speed, thus allowing you to have longer to think about snap decisions and letting you study faster. Plus by simply turning off boredom and forcing yourself into a hyper focused state you study _really really fast and well_.

    Honestly this sort of power would let you be the best in the world at most endeavors if you were willing to be ruthless enough.
