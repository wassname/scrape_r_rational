## Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

The Powers:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *clearly* defined rules that are consistent. The powers may be original or may be from an already realised story.

* The power to be munchkined can not be something broken like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

The Reverse Munchkin:

* In these scenarios, we will find ways to beat someone or something with a power which is, well, *powerful*.

The Problem:

* In which we solve problems posed by other users. Be smart and expect other users to be smarter.

Note; All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have a sapient blob of crystalline biomass, which thinks and communicates by its crystals touching other crystals of itself and sharing half-formed ideas among them. Basically a non-centralized brain. Naturally this blob didn't evolve things like vocal cords because it doesn't need them. The blob feeds itself by dissolving all organic biomass in its reach and converting them to crystals. 

  Blob has no concept of self but it is intelligent. You are a human with a normal body, you have a team of scientists with you and the resources of NASA. Blob is contained in a glass cylinder about twelve feet high.

  Now, your team needs to find a way to talk with blob. "Find a way," or else you shall lose you funding, lab and reputation.

    How does it interact with the outside world?  There's no feasible way it could evolve intelligence without there being some sort of selection pressure.  And how does it get food normally?  Does it simply wait for animals to walk past it and grab them?  If it isn't camouflaged then wouldn't animals learn to avoid it?  Does it have means of locomotion?  How does it use its intelligence to further its purposes of getting food and reproducing?  What does it use to perceive the world in order to make decisions?

    I don't mean to be pedantic, but knowing these details would probably give insight into how to interact with it in a way that it would understand.  So I guess, if I was a researcher I would try to examine its natural habitat.  Did it just fall from space one day and that's all we know?  Because if so then I would try putting it in a variety of situations in order to test these properties in order to get a clearer picture before attempting intelligent communication.

      It can reshape and recolor its mass as it requires, but only when it is sufficiently large. More crystals=more clever it gets. We know its intelligent because its spaceship was just more of itself, the burnt remains show something that looks like a genetic improvement chamber for sections of its body that were disconnected from the whole.

      The crystals are mildly photosensitive but the organism could re-purpose them when it has a surplus.

      Our blob is just the only section left alive when their spaceship crashed with an unknown object.

      Again the reason why we can't just feed it animals until it gets big enough is that no one is willing to risk what the escape of blob would mean in that case. We don't know the physical capabilities of a full blob or its intentions. We cannot risk that.

    I think the first thing I would want to do is test how it reacts to different food sources.  It dissolves all organic biomass, so does it react differently to plant matter or meat?  Is there a specific food it reacts differently to?  If so, we can theoretically use the differences in food preference to establish basic Pavlovian interactions.

    Something else I would run concurrently is try to harvest some of this crystalline biomass (hopefully there's a way to do it without harming the creature, its fear (or equivalent) would likely be a sub-optimal behaviour to induce).  If we can tell the difference between crystalline biomass containing different thoughts, we could hope to establish methods of reading its thoughts by some scanning apparatus.  If we can replicate crystals of different thoughts, we could have those crystals touch the blob to provide communication the other way.  It wouldn't be aware of the setup, but it's intelligent, so we could make it aware if we identify the right thoughts to send it.

    Of course, we don't know how the blob works, so any or all of this could fail spectacularly, but these are the clear first steps.

    So you can take save states by placing some of its crystals away from the rest. It sounds like you could use evolution by natural selection to rapidly produce any simple behavior you want.

  You have the ability to commit 1 MB of data to memory, as well as the ability to "transcribe" the data back into its original form.

  (EX: If you encode an image file, you can "decode" your memorized string of bits into the original image onto your mind's eye.)

  You can only do this once.

  What's the most damage you can do?

    Somehow manage to gain access to the private keys of some major corporation, likely by being in their IT department. Of course, they will ensure that physical storage devices never leave or enter the premises, but I have my memory bank. Store their private keys. Wait about a year, then move on from the company. Wait out whatever period is required by my non-compete clause, then move to a competitor known to be more shady and give the private keys to the higher ups there. Cackle madly.

  * A power to have absolute and impossible to be overriden control over a fly. Only one fly at the time.
  * An ability to see the steps you needs to win at any boardgame. Doesn't apply to anything else.
  * A level of physique comparable to pre-Crisis Superman. Catch? It only apply to your rectal muscles.
  * Ability to telekinetically control (but not create) Livermorium - a synthetic superheavy element with atomic number 116.
  * Half-invisibility. You can make left or right part of your body to become completely invisible at will.

  You have  the power to make homeopathic products that you touch work(they follow  the 3 laws of homeopathy )  but only if they were created by someone who believed in homeopathy and considers himself to be a expert and sold to someone who also believed that it should work ,but the effect isn't affected by the client beliefs only the beliefs of the homeopath and can't contradict the beliefs of the community of homeopaths (basically you have a touch based power to  make  placebomancy like in unsong work for homeopathy) .       
  Because I know how you are , touch means contact with parts of you that are still connected by living flesh to the rest of your body        

  Do the most damage posible.
  ```

  - u/gods_fear_me:
    ```
    Advertise new miracle homeopathic medicine. Administer it to people who believe that it will work. Since you know it works, and your patients think it will work, it shall work.

    Give worldwide demonstrations. Soon people will believe it works, and the doctors will too. Each success builds upon itself. Sceptics would be shown evidence that it works beyond simple Placebo. Some wouldn't believe it, but the masses would.

    Have a central factory where you dip your finger in the vats of the stuff. Provided you manage to ride the initial eave of success, you can have an empire of medicine.

    And then 'invent' something which can halt aging. Repeat the process.

    You may or may not have your own religion by now.

    The rest is up to you, stop production of and watch people die from the unhealthy habits, being immune to disease has bred in them, rule for eternity, etc.

      Ok that's good ,maybe I should limit it to one use to make it more dificult(but then you could keep dissolving it to get more and it would be even more effective)

  You can transfer energy between mediums, at an efficiency lower than what it would take to do it using normal technology. For example, if you have physical access to a car's gas tank, you can convert the gasoline to kinetic energy to push the car, but you'll run out of gas far quicker than if you were just using the engine. You can also use your own calories for an energy source, but you run into the same efficiency issue. Power is line of sight for effect, proximity/touch for the source. The closer you are to both, the more efficient you get, but it's going to be less than burning/eating/otherwise using the energy in the first place. Basically, this power doesn't break the laws of thermodynamics. 

  1. What do you do, and

  2. What is the most energy-dense fuel you can buy cheaply, in large quantities, without arousing suspicion?
  ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    2. Hydrogen might be a good choice. If I can get less power than fusion, that's still a lot of power; alternatively, if I can just get less power than mixing in oxygen and providing a spark, well, that's still a source of energy.
    ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    Is "heat" energy? Is "a temperature gradient" energy?  If those both work, then you have infinite energy from the start, and your only concern is how quickly you can use it to generate power.

    (This also works with "pressure" and "pressure differentials".)

    More in the spirit of your question: [Gasoline/diesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials).  You can easily carry about 100 MJ worth (~3 l), and it is available hundreds of liters at a time.
