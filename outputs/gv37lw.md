  One of the things EE does exceptionally well is politics. Which a lot of other writers struggle with. We get to see both their different interests and how those affect their actions, and how personal characteristics and relationships factor in. Its not a pure theoretical game theory exercise, but neither is ist purely personal

    ```
    I once described PGTE as political fiction where everyone knows they're in a story. It's just become more apt as the story has progressed
    ```

  - u/Locoleos:
    ```
    I mean the books very much have an opinion on politics, so if he couldn't describe the subject matter in a compelling way, that'd be pretty lame.

    But yes, I also really like it.
