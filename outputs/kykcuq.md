## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  The idea of a plant person or plant people is a common trope in a lot of fiction. Someone who has the properties of and/or control over plants. Usually some handwaveium is involved and particularly in the case of plant antagonists, their abilities tend to wander more into the valley of creating and controlling plant-themed minions rather than making plants threatening.

  Even Worm introduced the idea of a >!, "plant tinker" but they turned out to be more of a general wetware tinker who utilizes seeds and incorporates aspects of plants/fungi into their creations, but the end result is more animal than anything!<

  Assuming a setting in our world, the existence of a, "planter" on its own doesn't necessarily bring to mind the trope of plant superhumans being bioterrorists. The applications in agriculture, terraforming, phytoremediation, chemistry, and so on are obvious. 

  How would you munchkin a villain!Planter?:

  - Goal for now is to exterminate humanity completely. There can be no peace until every human is dead, even them exiting the Earth would be unacceptable. The very idea of humans is highly irritating, and associating with them is naturally repulsive, albeit not completely out of the question for Planter. Social skills with anyone besides plants are severely lacking.

  - Planter doesn't share this grudge with non-human animals and is, ironically, a rather militant vegan as long as they can minimize their harm to plants as well. Planter believes causing harm to animals should be avoided as much as practicable. No one ever said their ethics made much sense.

  - Body can easily survive off sunlight and eating sufficiently nutritious soil if necessary. Otherwise they're a baseline human, average intelligence and unlike Poison Ivy, not particularly attractive. Hygiene isn't great either if we're being honest. Planter is currently a homeless 20-year old on the streets of Tallahassee.

  - Can speed up the biological processes x36,000 of any organism in the kingdom *Plantae* within a 180 meter radius around them. A common dandelion could germinate and reach maturity in under 30 seconds and a white oak in approximately 2.4 hours.

  - Planter's power greatly supplements nutrition, carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight throughout the growth dilation to ensure their plants are healthy, but can't simulate more environmental factors like temperature, if the initial conditions impede plant life, or don't provide any foundation for the plants to germinate. 

  - They can sense what any plant in existence can naturally sense and their brain is well suited to interpret, compartmentalize, and multi-task with all of this feedback, of course their active awareness of how plants are constantly getting mutilated doesn't help with their misanthropy. 

  - Power doesn't allow them to control or modify plants or to warp reality to spread seeds faster, but they can assess the genetics, age, health, etc. of any plant using just their plant-sense. 

  Bonus: How would you reverse Munchkin?

    Okay, so this was really difficult to munchkin, but I think I potentially have some ideas. The problem is that Planter's personality and motivations means that his effective reach is very low - by the time he uses some method to create a problem in one portion of the earth, the previous problem is solved, the people are more prepared - the task is just very big. So he needs a way to kill large numbers of people very very quickly, and then can use his plant sense to find stragglers. Nuclear war would be ideal, but planter doesn't seem like the kind of guy who could become president. So, some ideas:

    - Sell drugs. Planter dislikes humans? Drugs are a way to potentially make a lot of humans very miserable. Interaction would be necessary, but it would give him a lot more financial reach. This wouldn't be how he'd wipe out humanity, but it would cause problems, is a source of income for other projects, and he only needs to be there to grow the stuff - he can sellers, unaware of his true motivations, to do the business side of things. I'm not an expert on the drug trade, but I can only presume that if real people can sell opium, Planter can do it much more easily. And hey, a sphere of diameter 360m is pretty big.

    - Bamboo, under Planter's influence, grows at 40cm per second. That's the fastest growing plant I can think of, but at the very least having a huge mass of bamboo grow incredibly quickly should be able to disrupt *some* important industries.

    - In an ideal world, Planter would be able to wreck farmland at a massive speed by growing weeds faster than they can be dealt with, causing famine in some amounts. Unfortunately, his combination of speed and area affected isn't fast/large enough to do this. He could, if he so wished, massively fuck up some town's year, though. Perhaps if he started with small, isolated places?

    - The big one - harmful algal blooms. Visit reservoirs, scatter some colony seeds, and create a runaway problem. Even better if there already is some source of phosphates, and you just accelerate the problem. Get rid of enough sources of fresh water for humans and you could cause mass dyings. This isn't enough to destroy humanity, but at the very least if you're smart and lucky you may be able to break down some level of infrastructure, which is step one.

    - Use your omni-present nature to get some dirt on high ranking political figures and blackmail them. Of course, this requires some levels of resources, social interaction, and reputation, but the reward is worth it. And hey, the social interaction is both minimal and hostile, so that's a plus. And resources can come from your drug trade!

    - ... Ask people for help? I think there's a bunch of people who are invested in massively fucking up large groups of people/everyone. Just... use your money to put them in a better position to do so. It'll take time, some unavoidable amounts of human interaction, but in the end it'll be necessary just to increase your reach. Being a living world surveillance system is good and all, but if you can't actually have a far-reaching, long-lasting impact, then total annihilation is extremely difficult.

    You could also ask for ideas on how to destroy the world using your powers on forums like this one, which would allow you to let others do this sort of thinking for you- Wait.

    Shit.

Perhaps if he started with small, isolated places?

      There are private storage units where there are massive amounts of seeds. They're intended to be distributed to a multitude of farms for next year's harvest. Planter is well suited to finding them and with some time and creativity could meddle with them to cause large amounts of damage and confusion. 

      It's also worth noting that you can cause millions of dollars of damage, effectively ruining a golf course or other compulsively groomed, manmade environment just by planting a few wildflowers. Planter could do a lot more than that. There's also the potential in invasive species of plants, or aiding invasive species of animals, or just messing with natural animal populations in general.

      >Use your omni-present nature to get some dirt on high ranking political figures and blackmail them.

And resources can come from your drug trade!

      The problem with this is that plants don't have senses that could pick up human communication. Planter is only tapped in to what they can naturally sense, like if something is damaging their body, where the sun or other source of light is, and some degree of ability to sense chemicals. Aside from a basic sense of light, they're blind, and they're not sensitive enough to the vibrations of human speech.

      This 

      Otherwise your analysis is solid.

      Planter would probably need to be careful along the way since the drug trade has a lot of intelligent, established, and even less sane people involved. Keep in mind that dealing in poppy seeds and their products alone includes corrupt politicians and military personnel around the globe. There's a lot of ways Planter could end up murdered or worse, even assuming they play it safe. 

      Walter White must have had a top-of-the-line guardian angel to get as far as he did as an outsider to the drug trade, and Planter is way beyond being in the empire business.

        ```
        Oh, aye, Planter could cause a lot of damage if he wanted to. He could even, perhaps, kill a large population of humans with the right choices and luck. The problem I find is that if he wants to destabilise human civilisation to the point where he could pick off the remnants with ease, ruining golf courses or aiding invasive species isn't terribly useful. It could fuck things up severely, but not severely enough. The plant vaults thing though? Didn't cross my mind. That might be enough to cause some real damage if our man is stealthy enough that he can get away with taking the aeroplane rides necessary to get it done quick.

        A final note on the plant sense thing is that while Planter's plant sense isn't enough to get *proof* on dirty deeds, it might be enough to get circumstantial evidence that can be developed into blackmail. It's not a sure thing, but given that he could process the inputs anyway, it might be a good use of time he wasn't doing anything with anyway. For example, if you can effectively track anyone who walks over grass, that could let you track that some sort of meeting is happening between two people who wouldn't want people knowing they were meeting. Even if you offer no evidence that such-and-such was meeting with their handler so-and-so, just telling them that you knew their meeting occurred at this place and at that time would be enough, I think, to freak them out and make them listen. Again, you're right in that it's not terribly useful, but it's difficult to come up with ways to destabilise the world using this power specifically.

        But yeah, tricky scenario.
        ```

          ```
          Ruining golf courses alone might not be civilization-ending, but it'd do economic damage severe enough that it couldn't be ignored, and it also wouldn't have a rational explanation. It could be used in conjunction with other methods to spread societal instability. Historically, the most devastating collapses of civilizations have occurred due to the panicked actions of empowered factions.

          Increasing the supply of heroin and building up contacts among the sellers/distributors is a start, but it takes a lot more to bring Mankind to ruin. People need to be in disarray, the assumptions that keep them calm need to be twisted and shattered.

          Wealthy people love their golf and other luxuries and in a more abstract sense, like anyone, they like feeling in control. If their property was ruined without any sensible explanation, costing them significant time and money, that could contribute to other stressors that lead to further, widespread decay. Planter could even be selective about their targets, using their power as another way to blackmail. 

          Their power has decent range for doing this, even if they'd need to do it in-person. Planter would probably find it relaxing actually, a way to let off steam from dealing with humans. Spreading their comrades on the sterile landscape, bringing fear and anger to the bloated, corrupt humans.

          You make good points on Planter's espionage, assuming that they could cultivate the deductive skills to use their plant-sense like that. They could use it to cultivate a supernatural persona and/or sow seeds of mistrust in between individuals/factions, obviously being careful to avoid tipping their hand, letting anyone know that their supposed omniscience is limited to plants. 

          There are people smart enough that they could figure it out with subtle experimentation and ruling out the mundane possibilities. Sadly for Planter, they'd have to stay away from any plant-theming. If they let their fixation on greenery slip, it could bring people that much closer to connecting the dots, especially in a world where plant villains are a part of pop culture.

    Exterminating humanity is pretty easy: selectively breed some sort of extremely efficient algael bloom that will choke out phytoplankton without commensurately contributing to CO2 sequestration/conversion, ensure its runaway success, congratulations you now have killed all of humanity.

    Unfortunately this would also take down most macrofauna. Problematic!
    ```

    - u/Voharati:
      ```
      How quickly could this theoretical death-algae choke the atmosphere?

      Humans are by far the most likely macrofauna to notice abrupt, unexplained changes in the planet and take emergency actions in response. I'm guessing most people would die, but a minority of people could be saved before the species is exterminated completely and hopefully find a way to persevere. 

      That could make for an interesting reverse Munchkin. Someone else mentioned that Planter could also contaminate water supplies in a similar way.
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    In the American South, Kudzu can grow at up to 18 inches a day and has been known to kill cows by rooting them to the spot while they were sleeping or grazing. This means Planter can make kudzu grow at 37 feet per minute, and unlike bamboo it spreads out instead of up. He could carry cuttings with him and travel around to farms, spending ~10 minutes at each of them to create a line of ruined land which will still spread pretty rapidly without his presence.

    Tree roots are already a threat to many kinds of industry and infrastructure. If he can make a fully mature oak tree in 2.5 hours, he could also drop a bunch of maple seeds in various places to create a mat of less mature trees which will all need to be exterminated. If he does it on the beaches where sub-oceanic fiber optic lines emerge, he could cripple global communications very rapidly.

    Almond and Tamarisk trees consume enormous amounts of water. If he went around to the headwaters of various rivers and planted trees all around their shores, he could consume a significant fraction of their flow. If he went to remote areas above major aquifers he could dry them out over the course of several years by preventing rainwater from percolating downward into them.

    Ironically, he could probably destroy sections of the Amazon Rainforest even faster than we are by introducing invasive species. The Amazon is usually protected from that kind of thing because the trees absorb nearly all of the nutrients in the ground and prevent any light from reaching seedlings, but if I'm interpreting things correctly that shouldn't matter here. He can just multiply what few nutrients exist and go from there, applying his power only to the invasive plants and smothering the trees. 

    Kelp grows incredibly quickly, and if he clogged shipping lanes with it he could bring the economy to a screeching halt pretty quickly. The enormous amount of added biomass would also eventually start rotting, deoxygenating the surrounding water in the process. He could probably kill reefs this way as well just by massively altering water chemistry.

    This is speculative, but if he got some plant with particularly deep and destructive root systems, he might be able to blow the Yellowstone supervolcano early. This would require knowledge of geology he probably doesn't have, but he would be very unlikely to be caught until it was too late, assuming it's possible.

    He might be able to reroute lava flows on Hawaii to destroy cities and towns. If successful, this could give him a reasonable base of operations. He might also get some support from disaffected native Hawaiian communities if he billed himself as driving away the imperialist bastards.

    This would be a great question for someone who specializes in biology/botany/biochemistry/etc. since Planter would be best suited leveraging the capabilities of specific plants. Lumber comes to mind since trees take a while to grow. TheJungleDragon mentioned bamboo which already grows quickly and has applications that range from construction to fabric to a source of fuel.

    Among the first thing Planter should do is head to a public library, get set up, and do research on the computer. It's not like there aren't already homeless and/or weird people in there, and its quiet.

    Looking up stuff on certain poisonous plants could raise up red flags in the long term, but really Planter just needs to focus on are applications of plants that are usually limited due to the fact that they grow/spread slowly. It'd also be helpful to research selective breeding and really agricultural science in general.

    Planter shouldn't skip on learning the math either. Time to learn the languages of biology and chemical/mechanical/textile engineering. Autodidacts is easier with the internet and willingness to put in the time and effort. Start with garden variety algebra, precalculus, and methods of proof. Build up layers of knowledge in linear algebra, calculus (both single and multivariate), statistics, and differential equations.

    Average intelligence or not, if you're not people smart, you need to cultivate other kinds of smarts to compete. I'm tempted to say they should work towards a wide base of knowledge, which to some extent they'll have to. At the same time, being a jack of all trades is of limited use when things surrounding plants and killing the enemies of plants come easily to you.

    They'll probably want to pay their respects to the departed trees first, but Planter needs to take notes, lots of them. 

    Other than that, /u/TheJungleDragon has good points. Their power would be great for producing drugs and other illegal substances that come from plants or even animals that eat plants. Organized crime isn't easy to stay afloat in, especially on a large enough scale to threaten the human species. Planter would have to operate carefully, it'd be best for them not to pursue a leadership position unless they're acting through a reliable prox(ies).


    Our intrepid villain is relatively easy to physically conquer and their power is as much a liability as it is an asset. They're at a much higher likelihood of getting vivisected than most people to say the least. Or maybe just assassinated to get rid of someone whose power is an inherent threat to entire industries.

    - u/Camaraagati:

      True, which explains why when the trope is invoked, they usually take additional artistic license. 

      I excluded modification to prevent it from becoming more a matter of mixing and matching to find the best botanical WMD or the combination that lets you make giant, man-eating Venus fly traps that stomp around on root-like legs. 

      Plus this keeps this true to the spirit of a plant!villain rather than just a plant-themed overlord of an inhuman army or someone who treats plants like Legos.

      Keep in mind that Planter's *power* doesn't give them the ability to modify plants. That doesn't stop them from modifying them the way that plants can already be modified. Such as the way powerless humans have been doing so for millennia.

    You may be able to go for the long con: act benevolent, use your power to mass produce food to solve world hunger. With the new massive food supply, the world population will surge.

    And then many years later, you die from old age, and the world loses its massive food supply. Food prices skyrocket, people starve everywhere, tensions rise and countries fight a nuclear war to end all wars over food, ending humanity.

    Sadly I don't think villain!Planter's powers are actually strong enough to generate that much food. 36000 \* 180\^3 \* pi \* 4/3 = roughly  879,444,881,075 times as much food generated by planter compared to the mundane generation of 1 cubic meter.

    Some googling reveals that the world has 1.5 billion hectares of farmland. 1 hectare = 10000 m\^2, so if we assume farm plants are roughly a meter in height, that's 10000m\^3 per hectare, so 15 trillion cubic meters of farming, which is much much bigger than the \~900 billion cubic meters of villain!Planter. :(

    - u/Sagnaskemtan:

      Keep in mind that Planter's goal is to exterminate humanity completely, killing *most* humans wouldn't be much of an accomplishment. If Planter was dead and there happened to be enough people in remote bomb shelters to perpetuate the human species, that'd be mission failure. 

      Plus a nuclear exchange large enough to kill most people would be devastating to the Earth's biome as a whole, killing a lot of animals and plants in its wake. It probably wouldn't end all life forever, but it'd be a mass extinction much worse than anything humans have done so far. 

      On top of that people wouldn't be blind to the fact that Planter ages and is otherwise a mortal being, not to mention being suspicious of where their power comes from and what their intentions are. In fact, acting too openly runs the risk of Planter getting exploited by less-than-benevolent governments or private entities who would want to use their power for profit, or at least stop them from disrupting the status quo. People have been imprisoned and tortured on far lesser provocations.

      However, assuming we go the route of agriculture, Planter could boost the world's food supply by selectively breeding existing crops 36,000 times faster and then spreading the resulting cultivars. Except Planter isn't benevolent and it'd be difficult to selectively breed crops to be malevolent without being detected. Many people are skeptical of GMOs, imagine how skeptical they'd be of plant powers.

    Assuming he can choose which plants in his range to apply his growing power to he could do what amounts to tens of thousands of years of selective breeding in a single year.


    I'm fairly sceptical he could use it to overthrow humanity or anything, but it should take him mere hours to develop weeds/plants that are immune or nearly immune to the majority of modern pesticides and would be just terrible for farmers in general.

    If his power to assess their genetics via his plant sense was good enough he might be able to make some super plant via planned breeding or something, but that seems pretty unlikely; him being a major economic/food security issue is about the best he can hope for.

    One thing a lot of the above has missed is the fact that you can get animals to help too, by creating an ecology that favors them. Tsetse flies making life hell in parts of Africa are supported by the plant life that gives them shelter. I don't know how many other plant/animal/disease combination there are, but just walking along creating the right plants could introduce horrid amounts of disease in the right places.

  Based on something that I'm sure doesn't actually happen to me, but definitely feels like it does.

  Whenever you accidentally drop an object weighing 10 grams or less and measuring 15 centimeters or less on the longest dimension, there is a 1% chance that it permanently vanishes, essentially becoming dark matter--conservation of mass is preserved, but it can't be seen or physically interacted with besides observing its gravitational pull. This will not happen if you intentionally drop the object, or if you pick it up with the purpose of eventually losing it through habitual handling & eventual accidental fumbling.

  I probably won't use any suggested munchkinry because IRL this is just me being clumsy & bad at finding things, but in a world where it functions as above I'm curious if there's any way to make it useful.

    I park my shuttle in a high orbit above the supermassive blackhole Sagittarius A*. The sight wasn't nearly as impressive as I had hoped. Definitely not worth the four-hundred year journey, and that was only going by my time. In fact, several tens of thousands of years must have passed on Earth since I had left. It was funny, scientists had completely conquered aging, mortality, and all of the four horseman, but faster-than-light travel was still as elusive as ever. I guess some rules just can't be broken. Well, whatever. Not like it would matter for much longer. Using the ship's dark matter thrusters, I lower its orbital velocity until I was on a direct course for the black hole itself. It was time for revenge.

    Why, oh why had the universe decided to curse me with this strange, inexplicable ability? Not only was it the most useless "superpower" imaginable, but it was unbearably annoying. Drop a pack of playing cards? Well, odds are decent one of them just dissapeared forever. Fumble your boarding pass on the way to the spaceport? It's probably still there, but sometimes it isn't! Who can possibly live a normal life with such inconsistency? Oh, and drop those tiny screws while fixing your glasses? Those things are gone for good my friend, although that last one is probably unrelated to the power itself.

    Anyway, after years of dealing with this torment, I'd taken the only sane course of action and resolved to kill every living being in existance. And luckily for me, I've just crossed the event horizon! Looking at the black hole has gotten boring, so I put on my EVA suit and exit the shuttle. Looking back at the direction I came from, I see an accelerating universe. Time from my perspective remains constant, but as I fall into the black hole I move faster, causing all the wonky relativistic effects I was hoping for. On the outside, thousands and then millions of years appear to pass in seconds, and the size of the universe itself contracts from billions of light-years down to millions and down still further. The mass of objects appears to increase, yet the total weight of the universe stays at a constant zero. Why yes, the universe actually weighs nothing at all. Weight implies a downward force, but there's nothing for the universe to "fall" into!

    I approach the singularity, and the entire universe shrinks down to the size of a solar system, then a star, and then a planet. Soon it's a mere kilometer, then a decameter, a meter, and now a decimeter. I reach out one last time and clench my hand, trying to hold onto the universe before I dissolve into nothingness. But the universe, being a very fickle thing, slips out of my hand. *Oops*, I smirk. *Must've dropped it*. And in that instant, the entire universe does not get destroyed, because I bet everything on a power that only works 1% of the time. *Damn it*, I frown. *What a stupid ability*. I die.

    Well, the typical work-around for intention-based restrictions is to get someone else to do it. Get a business partner to act while you are sleeping: placing items into your hands and then pulling open your fingers so you "accidentally" drop the items, letting them vanish.

    Ideally, you could do so using nuclear waste, but that doesn't seem likely to fit in under 10 grams and 15 cm\^3. So the question becomes: what is small and light and needs to vanish from the face of the earth?
