## Searching for a Beta Reader

### Post:

Hi guys!

I'm writing my first novel, and currently almost 90 pages into it, with over 45,000 words. This is a full length novel that I actually want to publish, and consequently, unfortunately, I won't be sharing it here until its published. I do however have some side projects for fun that I have either already finished or am working on as well, so you will see some of my stuff around. 

Anyway though, I've by this point far surpassed the ability of my friends to literature-nerd out with and discuss really meta ideas regarding tone and plot and such. I need a beta reader who I can bounce ideas off of, who would be willing to commit the time to help me get this off the ground. They would get to see the novel in a very early and incomplete phase, when I would be somewhat ashamed to show the world, in exchange for helping me with plot, worldbuilding, dialogue, anything and everything. I want someone who will really enjoy the story, and can get into helping me. 

So here is a rough run-down of the story.

Aeria. A strange world where islands of metal and stone float through seemingly endless skies. The people who live there are somewhat primitive, with a feudal system in many areas, and the most powerful technologies available are those from the age of steam (with a few twists ofc). There is magic, and the story may appear at first as simple high fantasy, though it is far from it. It may also initially look very steampunk, and it is fairly steampunk in fact. It will be a Rational!story, but it probably won't use specific terms as the characters are unlikely to know those terms. I want everyone to act smart though. 

If you're interested, send me a PM or post here. I'm looking for someone who is really into this sort of thing, and will really enjoy getting a first look at my world, so please be sure you're really interested before messaging. 

Cheers!

Sagebrysh
