## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  It's been recommended here before, but I just completed the Final Cut version, which was superb: [Disco Elysium](https://www.gog.com/game/disco_elysium). (It's also half off today at gog.com.)

  This game has the best writing of any game, hands-down. This includes prose, characterizations, worldbuilding, concept, the works. The premise is that you're a cop tasked with investigating a murder in a town charged with political tensions. The wrinkle is that you're a complete and thorough  fuckup, and in the days leading up to the game's start you've gone through an ugly spiral and undermined the investigation in every way possible. At the start you're at the bottom of a deep hole and you just have to start digging.

  The really fun part of the game is that your messed-up detective has a head full of skills that are also aspects of his character and psyche. As you increase these skills, they interject themselves into conversations and analyses with their individual takes on what's going on in ways that can be helpful or unhelpful. If you increase your Inland Empire skill, for example, you'll get wildly imaginative interjections, and at higher levels you'll have whole conversations with inanimate objects, some of which can even become characters in their own right. Your Encyclopedia skill will give you a huge amount of info on the world, but you may find yourself saying things that are annoying or pedantic.

  The other main system is a Thought Cabinet. As you go about your investigation, observing things and having conversations, thoughts will occur to you that go in the cabinet. If you ruminate on these thoughts (you kind of equip them for a time), you will develop them into aspects of your character. Thoughts range from things like "the workers are being oppressed" to "finger guns are cool" to "I'm a hustler" or "I'm actually a really boring person." These provide mechanical advantages and disadvantages and give you rewards for playing a certain way. In my last run my detective was a free-market hustler who was convinced he had psychic powers, which was pretty entertaining.

  The game handles politics really well, which is extraordinarily rare in any form of media. The main writer on the game, I believe, is a socialist, but the kind of Orwell-style socialist who is quite aware of the shortcomings of the movement. You kind of wouldn't even know it to play the game, politics in the game is a matter of history and character, and the various political perspectives seem more appropriate or sinister in different circumstances. It's intelligently and wisely done, and with an eye for the humor, pathos, and awkward necessity of political ideology and affiliation.

  The Final Cut has dialoge that is fully recorded, and well done at that, which really adds something to already great characters. If you're even remotely interested in story-based games, RPGs, or games in general, I highly recommend getting and playing Disco Elysium.

    The politics are interesting though, the funniest and most succinct way I've heard it put is: "Surprise surprise, the left is punching left as hard as they can."

      ```
      I think the game has a good handle on the common failure states of the different ideologies. The leftists are energetic but self-devouring. The "moralists" (game's name for international liberalism / globalism) are sort of unimpeachable but in a way that makes you think they're actually the source of all the problems. The royalists / fascists have the best handle on the things people traditionally find meaningful (family, history, place) but are bigoted and intolerant. The hustlers and billionaires (the guy who sells shoes, the container guy) are having the most fun, but are in it only for themselves.

      The game also does a great job having better and worse exemplars of the philosophies. Kim is a moral moralist, the Sunday Friend is a terrifying moralist, and Joyce is somewhere in between. The old royalist cavalier is almost admirable on some topics, the cryptofascist mug guy is unobtrusively terrible, and the racist lorry driver is just a stinker. The leftists range from various flavors of monster to soldier types to quite likable artists and utopian dreamers. And the hustlers have Idiot Death Spiral.

    You're on the money about the writers - the dev team thanked Marx and Engels in their acceptance speech at The Game Awards. It's part of why the political undertones (and overtones) work so well, in my opinion. Speaking as someone who's gone through a bit of the gamut of hard-left politics - irritating youthful autodidactism, student politics, traditional party-building, etc. - and has a bit of affection for the history of the dissident left, so much of the humour and cynicism about left-wing politics reads as the sort you really only get from the experience of being in that scene & that framing, which helps it land so well. The doubt is self-doubt, the criticism a self-criticism in many respects (something that definitely crops up elsewhere, like in the >!abandoned game studio where their goals kept getting bigger until they had to disband, leaving nothing!<).

    A good non-spoilery example is the text you get from completing the Mazovian Socio-Economics thought:

    >0.000% of Communism has been built. Evil child-murdering billionaires still rule the world with a shit-eating grin. All he has managed to do is make himself *sad*. He is starting to suspect Kras Mazov *fucked him over* personally with his socio-economic theory. It has, however, made him into a very, very smart boy with something like a university degree in Truth. Instead of building Communism, he now builds a precise model of this grotesque, duplicitous world.

    Or one of my favourite sets of political lines,

    >You: Wait, first — what's this *communism* even about?

    >Rhetoric: Failure. It's about failure.

    >You: Failure?

    >Rhetoric: Yes! Abject failure. Total, irreversible defeat on all fronts! Absolutely vanquished, beaten, curb-stomped and pissed on — until *you* came along! 

    > ...

    >You: Hang on, what will I do once I establish contact with my fellow communists?

    >Rhetoric: You'll discuss the monumental world-historical task that lies before you. You'll engage in rigorous and spirited debates about Mazovian theory and practice. But mostly you'll probably complain about other communists.

    >You: Isn't that last part kind of counterproductive?

    >Rhetoric: Not at all. Complaining about other communists is one of the most important parts of being a communist.

    Sentiments which, if you've ever attended a march where the Maoists, the Trots, and the Social Democrats explosively ended up near each other, or thrown yourself through the grinder of student union bureaucracy, will be familiar and bitterly funny.

    And, of course, it isn't trying to pull some didactic brechtian teach-you-to-love communism bullshit, it's just that the world, the narrative, and the game as a whole are all built so that politics fully suffuses them, despite the story obstinately being about solving a murder, and built that way by people who linger on the edge of cynicism and optimism in communist politics. This way, it all integrates so smoothly, with any political points or implicit positions arising naturally and subtly from that situation, and articulated incisively and funnily by the fantastic writing.

      Nice comment. I've also been through a few rounds of ideology shift, and many or most of my friends would consider themselves serious socialists. I'm probably a socialist, but of the boring Scandinavian variety that looks a lot like liberalism.

      Your first quote is truly a good one. I'm blind and played trough the game with a screen reader, and the thought development didn't come through that well, though most of the text did, so I missed out a bit on those, though I did look up a few on the wiki. Wompty Dompty Dom Center is a funny one, that's essentially the space in which I work, at the cutting edge of science and BS.

      https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/trees/trotchart2.jpg is a nice illustration.

      That said, it might be interesting to try to quantify just how much different parts of the modern ideological spectrum are subject to fragmentation. After all, other movements like the Objectivists have had more than their fair share of splits as well.
      ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        The US is.. "Special" in that the two party system forces everyone into two camps until one implodes. 

        Way it works elsewhere is usually that the social democrats hovers up anyone who values unity over ideological purity on the left, after which everyone else splits into fractions until they are in danger of hitting whatever treshhold your parliament uses as a minimum for getting in. If the social democrats self-destruct, some other party will pick up the banner of "Values unity on the left" and become the social democratic party, except not named that anymore.

        The right splits of factions that want to be more centrist and factions that want to be more.. Uhm. Well. Xenophobic. This is usually racism, but any kind of hate the outsider will do to motivate the right fringe. The right fringe parties eventually go down in some corruption scandal because they pretty invariably are corrupt as hell. 

        The centrist right and the plain right can do a whole dance of supplanting each other, merging, splitting again...
        ```

          Well, it depends on the country and the period. For example, the Italian Communist Party was much stronger than the Italian Socialist Party during the Cold War. During the 1950s-1980s, the former commanded the support of 23-34% of the electorate while the later hovered between 9% and 15%.

          However, I was thinking mostly about ideologically driven movements like Trotskyists and Objectivists as opposed to political parties whose need to compete for votes reinforces centripetal tendencies. Absent that kind of glue, ideologically driven groups can splinter ad infinitum resulting in what Shachtman once described as a "ludicrous picture of sterility and futility to which ultra-leftist sectarianism condemns itself" (as if to illustrate his point, he and his followers split from the main Trotskyist party 16 months later.)

          Anyone who has studied modern ideological movements is familiar with the phenomenon, but I am not familiar with any attempts to quantify it across the ideological spectrum and national boundaries.

      Huh, different strokes for different folks. That boat lady is a great source of geopolitics and existential terror! But she's also a massive encyclopedia and encyclopedia bait.

      I will admit that I probably only read ~1/3 of the text on screen. And I think that's totally fine. There's so much of it you get more than enough background by osmosis, although I did look up a map, and you don't "need" 99% of it. You'll still have a good time if you skim/skip through the uninteresting parts, but also keep in mind what you enjoy for your character build.

  Does anyone have stories about archaeology/paleontology in unusual places? Archaeology in space, unusual archaeology on Earth or parallel dimensions, eldritch archaeology in a fantasy world, or something weirder?

  For example, I liked Jack McDevitt's books about archaeology and solving mysteries about alien planets. Some of the archaeology based mysteries explored in the Priscilla Hutchins series (Starts with Engines of God) are amazing and have the best archaeology-in-space plots I have seen, but I sometimes disliked the focus and pacing since it felt like there would be many chapters about months spent flying around in a ship bored and watching movies and then they would finally get to a planet with a bunch of cool stuff on it and a really interesting backstory, poke around in two buildings and take a few random things as souvenirs, fall down an elevator shaft because they are all incompetent and nearly die, and then leave all in a few pages. It does show the waiting involved in the form of travel used in the books, and given how half-assed some past archaeological expeditions have been I can sort of understand this being how things might go, but after all the buildup I really want more time with the cool mystery planet you designed!

  A lot of Jack McDevitt's other books have an archaeology theme like Ancient Shores where someone digs up a boat in a field in the Midwest hundreds of miles from the ocean, or a few of the Alex Benedict novels where ex. they travel to different points in space with FTL to pick up radio transmissions from the past.

  Eric Flint and Ryk E. Spoor's Boundary series starts with people finding a fossilized alien that visited Earth in the ancient past and >! got eaten by dinosaurs !<  and they use this to find more traces of the aliens.

        While that game really manages to build a mysterious atmosphere an a solid narrative it really lacks basic QoL features which personally made me drop it pretty early. For example the frequent unskippable cutscenes or some convoluted sections.


        To me it really seems that a lot of these games that really have some solid idea and effort behind it then include repetitive/obnoxious and unnecessary elements that, at least to me, make it not worth it.

    This isn't exactly that (>!protagonist is very powerful but not omnipotent!<), but I think you'll get a lot of the same feeling from 'Forty Millenniums of Cultivation'. It's a massive story with a bunch of different arcs, and a good example of what you want in my opinion is the arc that begins at >![Chapter 1334](https://novelfull.com/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation/chapter-1334-black-box.html)!<. I really think you could just start there and infer the background as you go. 

    I would recommend reading the whole thing, because the story is great and reading from here will spoil a lot of the ends of the previous arcs, but if you aren't going to do that then I would suggest just this arc. One warning; a lot of things seem strange or wrong, but then are later justified in this story.

        In my opinion the writing quality of Compulsion is pretty high. I enjoy reading it.

        I particularly like the chapters written from Alex's perspective: The author made a great character development arc for him, exploring how he changes more with each mind he consumes and how he handles hiding his true nature from the PRT.

        I didn't enjoy the Taylor chapters as much, mainly because the author seems to have dialed up the teenage drama and uses the Queen Administrator's influence as an excuse to hand Taylor idiot balls. That said, the author is taking her cape career in a very different direction due to the ripple effects of Alex's involvement, so I still find those chapters interesting despite their flaws.

    Stop at the first season of the anime/first arc of the manga. You can keep the reading the manga for a little while (1 or 2 more arcs) but the anime falls off the rails and tries to end the story at lightning speed, while the manga slowly loses what made it interesting.

  **ASOIAF:**

  There have been a few self-insert fics I've read on AO3 that are pretty good in the shonen sense but not rational or well-worldbuilded, with characters such as Robert Baratheon, Aerys II Targaryen, Renly Baratheon, Rhaenyra Targaryen, Eleanor Mooton and Selyse Florent as the insert. They reminded me of the lesson that just because a story has good dialogue and introspection does not mean that it is worth reading, and if you come across these fics I'll advise you to only read them if you are a big enough fan of ASOIAF to drop your standards.

  I will however heartily recommend the gradually updating [The Trial in Winterfell](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/the-trial-of-winterfell-what-if-cersei-and-jaime-were-discovered-at-winterfell.509717/reader), hosted on a members-only board of Alternatehistory.com, which has a consistent setting and a cast of genuinely intelligent characters fighting against other genuinely intelligent characters in battles of war, strategy, politics and legalism.

  **Also:**

  Can anybody recommend any fanfics they think are great in the Final Fantasy, Miraculous Ladybug or Overwatch fandoms?

  Are there any stories set in an actual video game world where the characters, inserts or not, have to follow and exploit the game logic 20YE-style?

  **Other, non fanfiction recommendations:**

  [A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry](https://acoup.blog) is a history blog ostensibly focused on antiquity that seems to straddle the boundary between pop-history and serious intro-undergraduate textbook. It has, among other things, covered Sparta, the siege of Gondor, the WW1 Italian front and how the household production of yarn from plant tissues worked before industrialization.

  Don't Look Up is a fairly good, but not excellent, movie about societal dysfunction. I don't think it did a good job of exploring why the cast have the psychoses they have (like say, *The Office* does) but it did a good job of showing those neuroses in a comedy/sci-fi format. If you are looking for something to watch with mixed company it should be the top of the list but it's otherwise skippable.

  Greg Egan is a brilliant author, albeit an acquired taste. If you like stories featuring physics, you will love his latest work, [The Book of All Skies](https://www.gregegan.net/ALLSKIES/AllSkies.html), which is a crime/adventure novel set in a mostly self-consistent multiply-connected topology.

  The Long Now Foundation is a rationalist-adjacent nonprofit. It turns out that [their youtube channel](https://youtube.com/c/longnow) has had dozens of really excellent guest speakers from the fields of history and sociology over the years and is worth a look.

  /r/MapPorn is sometimes good, but the spinoff subreddits /r/mapporncirclejerk and /r/shittymapporn are hilarious as much as five times a week.

  /r/neoliberal, despite being a cesspool of navel-gazing and memes that go nowhere, has some very good military and strategy analysts lurking amongst the members. They have an automoderator system that lets you selectively *only* get notifications when a good post is made on just those topics (or other topics), so I suggest looking at what their ping system has to offer you.

  The trailer for the first movie in the Uncharted franchise looks pretty good, easily up there with the first *The Fast and the Furious*, if you like this sort of brain mush. I'll wait to see if it's actually any good before watching but my hopes are very high.

  Edit: Back in November I played through Final Fantasy V and VVVVVV again for a few hours and they remain excellent.

    *[The World as it Appears to Be](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149)* is an Overwatch fanfic that gets recommended here from time to time, written by the same author as *Cordyceps*. I read part of it, and I enjoyed what I did read. Ultimately though, I dropped it, as I found it a hard to follow without having already known the characters from the source material.

    Disrecommend. His posts about LOTR wars historicity were somehow shallow but not obviously wrong (he keeps forgetting "army marches on its stomach"). However his later posts...

    Like Roman usings torsion catapults as field artillery to counteract horse archers??? Is it history taught by Hollywood? Or am I missing some new archeological discoveries?

      My reading of the Gondor and Rohan posts led me to think he did a pretty good job in arguing with that exact problem in mind.

      To your second point: while I'm not deeply familiar with the artillery of antiquity I do know that animal sinews (that are rarely produced today) are better for tension and torsion than mere rope, so presumably they would have had access to reasonably small and portable field artillery that escapes the pop-culture image of a catapult.

    [Miraculous Trek](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/miraculous-trek-mlb-star-trek.963169/): One of the Miraculous characters gets sent to Star Trek, grows up, joins Starfleet, and comes back with a starship soon after leaving (time shenanigans).  It doesn't go as planned.

    [What the Cat Dragged In](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12063472/1/What-the-Cat-Dragged-In): Iron Man is visiting Paris during an attack, and becomes aware of the struggle there.  Aside from being generally good, it is well balanced between settings, with "Equal Opportunity Awesome, and its prerequisites: equal opportunity competence, amazement, and involvement."

    For ACOUP, I'll recommend his [Teaching Paradox, Europa Universalis IV](https://acoup.blog/2021/04/30/collections-teaching-paradox-europa-univeralis-iv-part-i-state-of-play/) series to this subreddit because it is directly engaging with popular culture (in the form of a video game), which is *like* talking about fiction IMO.

    I am not qualified to comment on the specifics of what the blog author writes about, but I find his emphasis to be strange at least some of the time. For example, in the post [So You Want To Go To Grad School (in the Academic Humanities)?](https://acoup.blog/2021/10/01/collections-so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school-in-the-academic-humanities/) he lists a lot of different things that he thinks are wrong with graduate programs in his field: very long hours, low pay, "academic hazing", "exploitation", low chances of getting an academic job after getting a PhD, complete dependence on your advisor who has "tremendous" power over you, etc. Again, I am not qualified to judge the specifics, but, assuming that everything that he writes about these issues is accurate, the advice that he gives to university administrators is rather odd:

    > without lowering stipends further, include mental health therapy in your graduate student’s medical benefits (cover it completely) and then make sure they know it is included and then make sure (since many of them have just moved to your town) you have a list of qualified therapists.

    I would expect him to start by suggesting ways to address the listed problems as opposed to ways of treating their inevitable results.

    That "commentary" is all from the protagonist's rants. He's an unapologetic misanthrope, so it's not surprising that he has latched onto whichever hypothesis will bolster his worldview. The story also points out that he partially goes on these rants as grandstanding to bolster morale for his followers. Speaking of his followers, some of them occasionally poke fun at his biases, so it's pretty clear that the protagonist's views do not equal the author's views, nor are the readers supposed to assume that the protagonist's take is meant to be right.

      I tried that fic before and my take was I didn't like the protagonist and I dropped it, precisely because he is such a misanthrope.  What the author was presenting didn't work for me.
      ```

      - u/TheTruthVeritas:

        Yeah I’ve been reading it and I found it immensely annoying because of the MC. He’s such a misanthrope and uninformed person. But none of this is ever explored or really changed throughout the story. He’ll constantly spew his bullshit about why all humans are garbage and rant about this or something, one of his underlings will look at him and say that he’s a misanthrope, and then it continues on as usual.

        I really don’t see the appeal in this story. Is it really only for people like that seeing super angy misanthropes wanting to burn down the world? The writing is rough to get through. Yeah, before anyone says it, I know the author purposefully wrote him to be a puffed up self important arrogant misinformed misanthrope, but it doesn’t add anything to the story apart from the savage terrible isekai world and people being exactly as terrible as the MC believes people to be.

        I’m up to date, as I was morbidly curious if there would ever be a payoff or growth for such an incredibly annoying MC, but he still has these character traits(along with somehow actually being empathetic) with no sign that he’s going to change. I don’t get why the people that don’t like this novel are getting downvoted, what’s the appeal in it? Even if he is purposely written to be a misinformed puffed up shit, those aspects aren’t delved into and mature in any meaningful way. In fact, I find him incredibly cringe with his obsession with acting and drama and mood, a lot of which seem pretty plainly unreasonable and crazy to me, especially with such an unlikeable MC who is supposedly also “charismatic” and “empathetic”

        Everybody that I directed to this novel also dropped it by the end of the first chapter. Is this just one of those “angry misanthropic guy wants to tear down the world” sorta stories that I’m clearly not the right audience for?

          >But none of this is ever explored or really changed throughout the story.

          Actually, the main character does change over the course of the story. He encounters situations that break his assumptions and force him to change his mind.

          >!Using Immolate shook him and forced him to reevaluate his callousness towards the suffering he causes. Having to work with people to survive forced him to stop viewing most people as 2-dimensional stereotypes. Seeing the reality of Cat Alley forced him to realize how badly he had behaved in some of his past relationships. Time and again he's forced to realize that his negative assumptions about people are false, such as when he stopped giving Biribo the cold shoulder and the most recent arc when a family of nobles turned out to be well meaning people.!<

          I enjoy seeing him grow as a person, and I keep reading because I want to see where the author will take that growth. Also, I appreciate the irony that being forced into a "villain" role is actually forcing him to grow into a better person.

          However, it's a very slow character development arc, and I fully agree with the people who say the protagonist was insufferable in the early chapters. (In my opinion he didn't become tolerable until chapter 6.) I don't fault people for dipping out of the story if that's not their cup of tea.

    Pacing - yes (though I personally prefer the slow build), dialogue maybe?, ethical frameworks - hard disagree.  


    I'd say the shape of the story is "pessimistic misanthrope meets reality", even though "reality" here is a fantasy isekai.  Its pace is slow (which I personally love) so it's hard to pin down exactly what the central theme is yet, but what I'm seeing is an empathetic take on "evil" and crime.  It's taking a society's conception of evil, along with the protagonist's initial "people suck" perspective, and turning those over piece by piece to instead show "dumb systems suck and make people suck".  The story so far has followed a climb up from the bottom of society, finding sympathetic angles and reasons for the actions of antagonists who are often turned around to join the MC.  Likewise, despite the MC performing some downright "evil" acts, they're often done for a moral good - arguably far more moral than the actions of the "Hero" in the story, and it's clear the clash between the two will probably be due to the Hero being unable to understand and empathize with the desperation of the lower classes which drove the MC to be so brutal (the Hero's a little bit simple, and just along for the ride).   To me, that's pretty complex writing, but maybe that's just where I am right now.

    Summary:  The story's thesis is very likely convincing the reader (and MC) that society's problems are overwhelmingly not caused by bad people so much as bad systems, and is actually a pretty optimistic take on the soul of humanity (as evidenced by so many redeemable side characters so far).  I suspect we might even get some sympathetic takes on the crime lord Lady Gray in the future, the noble classes, and possibly even the goddesses who started this whole thing - based on hints from that interlude chapter on the creation of the world.  Recommended for anyone who has already come to similar systems-theory conclusions of morality or wants some convincing.  Though possibly wait til the fic is done first (in a few years lol).  Also, the fic is decently feminist, if you watch for that kind of thing, which is rare.

    As an aside, when someone says they don't like hearing about politics and morality in stories... I'm sorry, but you probably should just not read anything, ever...  Politics is suffused in everything for a reason, and necessary for any complete moral framework or even mildly complex worldbuilding.
