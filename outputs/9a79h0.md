  Not vanished, I promise.

  I'm 1700 words into Chapter 12. Chapter 15 is what should be publishing tomorrow, so I'm three and a half chapters behind.

  And, yes, that's a real "behind," because I have four Patreon patrons and I promised them a chapter a week. As long as at least one person is sending me money, this is a real obligation.

  I'd feel worse about it, though, if I had more patrons. To be explicit, the guilt formula is:

  G = c*[ln(n) - 1]

  For c the number of chapters behind, and n the number of patrons. If I don't complete and publish Chapter 12 in the next two hours, my guilt will jump from 1.16 to 1.55. But a single additional patron being added would further increase the guilt to 2.44.

    Guilt is great and all but what's the correlation between guilt and speed of release?

    What about speed of release and chapter quality?

      The machine learning algorithm is hard to decipher, but I think G is strongly signaled in the fitness function for raising priority of writing over other creative activities and hobbies. 

      I don't "push through" just to get a chapter released. As far as I can tell, the chapters don't significantly vary in quality. If you feel otherwise please provide feedback.

  I've been waiting for the thread, can't wait for the next chapter.

  With the passing of Aeromancer (???) and disappearence of Bone-Blood-Sinue or whatever, it's down to APGTE and Worth the Candle for me more or less.

  The author claims it is just a temporary falling behind schedule

  I hadn't noticed the demise of Aeromancer, though, and for a reason that doesn't sit well in the context of rational fiction. I'm quite disappointed.

    Aeromancer posted his drafts for 14-17 and the outline for the rest of the story though. At least we get that.
