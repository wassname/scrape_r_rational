## [Challenge Companion] First Contact

### Post:

First contact shows up in a lot of science fiction, mostly because it's one of those neat things that you can't really get in many other places. Historical examples of true first contact are pretty rare (I imagine mostly because of poor record-keeping and mutually incomprehensible languages). *Modern* examples of first contact are fraught with a lot of social and political baggage.

Iain M. Banks coined the term "Outside Context Problem" in *Excession*:

> An Outside Context Problem was the sort of thing most civilisations encountered just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop.

I think that's what's most compelling about first contact stories; they're big and important ways of disrupting the natural order that existed prior to that first contact. It's this huge, uncertain thing that allows lots of room for legitimate drama (as opposed to manufactured drama).

I'm not so sure that there are many good examples of first contact within the sphere of rational fiction. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is [*Three Worlds Collide*](http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/).

This is the challenge companion thread, for discussion of the topic. If you have some ideas on the subject, recommendations of stories, or other insights, please comment below.

  Over the course of my life, I've changed from being scared of the potential absence of aliens to being scared of the potential presence of aliens. First contact with a random alien race is roughly equivalent to an AI FOOMing with a random utility function. Pray for the best. You can't even prepare for the worst. And there's barely anything in-between the best and the worst.

  [nBSG: The Scattering](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/20938058/) is on the verge of first contact with 1970-1980 Earth.

  [Emergence (RWBY)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/emergence-rwby.308628/page-130#post-20865796) is going through the fallout of a terrorist attack initiated by RWBY villains and White Fang terrorists. 

  Meanwhile, I am writing my own first contact story called [Mystery of Terra](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mystery-of-terra-nbsg-original.370871/), a nBSG first contact story crossover with an unfinished first contact story that I have yet to finish.

  I have lately been kicking around *War of the Many-Worlds*, which posits that the Martians from *War of the Worlds* were actually from a parallel Earth instead of from Mars. The story takes place in the 1970s of a world where Earth fought an ineffectual, losing war against aliens until death by exotic microbes, following which they began gearing up for a second invasion that never came. It opens on a British super-science program that's managed to stitch the bones of a secret "Martian" world-hopping engine back together as part of their Cold War analog.

  All that's well and good, but that leaves me with the rest of the plot, which is somewhat of a mystery. A few days ago I decided that it would be cool for it to be an Outside Context Problem story, and yesterday I decided that making it a first contact story would be sort of cool, since the original *War of the Worlds* was a first contact story.

  And that leaves me with two problems, one world-building related and the other plot related. The world-building question is what an inter-universal alliance looks like (or better, what multiple competing inter-universal alliances look like), but that's not really related to the prompt and I don't want to waste space here with my thoughts on that. The question I'd like help with here is what first contact between parallel worlds looks like, especially one in which one side has massive information or technology advantages over the other.

  (The other problem is that I probably need some additional plot element to serve as the main conflict, but I haven't found anything as fun as explaining how *War of the Worlds* was *really* about world-hopping Earthlings from a place where evolution beat humans to the punch.)

  Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang is a pretty interesting First Contact novella, centering on a linguist's efforts to communicate. 

  spoilers:

  However, I did find it dubious that a species could have a sort of 'integrative subjective experience' and still be able to intelligently plan and decide, and the extension of [Fermat's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_principle) to mean that somehow certain thinking is 'already done' seems quite strange. I mean, I could imagine that within this story's universe, the Heptapods are able to think/plan/decide basically automatically, and perhaps they're not even all that self-aware... but that's me reading too much into it, probably. I don't know... that seemed like a big limitation; if an intelligent process doesn't have the ability to think about causal relationships at all, how can they possibly solve even rudimentary problems that require abstract understanding of relationships?

  Oh, we should also keep in mind Blindsight, which has (SPOILERS!!!) some of the more alien aliens that I've read, at least. 

  Also, Echopraxia, though it's quite different and doesn't have the thematic coherence that Blindsight does. There is this gut-punching aspect of Blindsight that's really distinctive... and also somewhat disturbing in some respects.

  Man, I should do a first contact piece in *The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake*. Agricultural stone age meets intergalactic demigod conquerors.
