    False hope is Velorien's favourite thing.

    Same thing I thought about. I would love a good rewrite of Code Geass *so much*.

      That sounds so horribly tempting. But I've already resolved to make my next project original fiction so that I can move further along the road of becoming a full-time writer.

  Just re-read the whole thing over the course of the day while I should be doing real work. Still as quality as ever.

  Two things: one, who the hell is Raijin, who ctrl+f only found four times but apparently took care of Naruto as a kid?

  And second, wow, I forgot how frustrated reading that fight with Shikamaru made me. What a condescending prick with his super-Bayesian fighting style and throwaway koans, Sun Tzu-ish quotes, and references to solipsism. It's like he's only there as an object lesson that Naruto's not the smartest guy in the world whole while epitomizing some of the exact same character flaws, only without the protagonist's depth.  

  If I ever wrote Naruto fic myself I'd feel obligated to write a scene where Shikamaru proclaims he's, "ten steps ahead," and gets his nose broken immediately after by someone just plain faster and better than him. Laziness as a ninja vice should have real consequences beyond just social ones. Just once I'd like to see him be a little too slow to put one of his genius plans into action and watch things go wrong instead of coasting. Which, granted, happened in canon with Asuma, but still. It'd give me wicked schadenfreude to read.

    Raijin is my answer to "Who looked after Naruto while he was little, because it certainly wasn't the Hokage, and why did they disappear into thin air never to be referenced again?" There'll be more on him later.

  EVEN NOW THERE IS HOPE LEFT IN MANKIND

  I held out for this fic, keeping it in bookmarks, checking occasionally, but now
  Now it was all worth it.

  So what is the rewritten? I will have to do a reminder read either way but want to know if it big or editing or cut outs.
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    There are a few completely new scenes, and a bunch more rewritten to a single POV which gives a quite a bit more insight into the character. Plus things sprinkled throughout which aren't huge individually but enrich characterisation a fair bit when taken together.

    To be honest, it's been so long since the original that I can't remember all the changes, but some examples that spring to mind are Chapter X (the Hokage conversation), the opening of Chapter XI (Kakashi and Naruto's self-reflections) and Chapter XXIII (the Sakura/Ino fight).

  You magnificent bastard, I read your book!

    Velorien wrote a book??
    ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      I consider fics books too. Also, just saw an opportunity to meme.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Awesome.
  ```

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  I concur with /u/rationalidurr's question. Which chapters would you say contain the biggest changes in content?

  Just rereading the whole thing.

  Ch. 11:

  >"I think more works of transformative fiction should exploit their unique access to paratextual space"

  I'm So Meta, Even This Acronym.

  Glad to see you back.

    The former will be addressed later, and for the latter, he didn't really have a choice. There were two separate chÅ«nin-level enemies, and one was higher-priority than the other.
    ```

- u/SkyTroupe:
  ```
  So can anyone explain the whole team ceremony thing to me? I know Hiashi was messing with Naruto to see if he could measure up to formal ettiquite posturing but were the tea/cups actually poisoned?

  Or was the whole purpose to obfuscate the level at which Hiashi was playing?
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    Yes.
    ```
