  ```
  One can argue about the Tyrant's sanity or his endgame, but never his sense of style.
  ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    I believe his style points are all that keep him alive
    ```

    - u/Mountebank:
      ```
      Quite literally. Doesn't the Tyrant have a terminal illness, and he's staying alive entirely by involving himself in everyone's Story because he knows that Villains can't die to illnesses offscreen?
      ```

      - u/Oaden:
        ```
        He was said to not live till 12, though i think he's older by this point. 

        There's also some implication that whenever he uses his aspect Wish, he uses up his remaining life.
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          Oh my Goddesses he has the Make a Wish foundation on tap.
          ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    I am of the opinion that Kairos Theodosian is completely sane, pretending at being insane because he's having so much godsdamned fun.
    ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  Hahah, Cat's gonna stab an Angel.   


  And three gargoyles in a dress! Fantastic.
  ```

- u/RRTCorner:
  ```
  Wait did we get a description of Gargoyles at some point? How tall/big are they? I always imagined them basically human sized, in particular much taller than Cat.
  ```

  - u/xaleander:
    ```
    I always imagined them about garden gnome size or a little bigger and thought something in that direction was mentioned.
    ```
