  This is a sci-fi story written by my friend on wireheading.

  I was rather surprised that she actually took the mask off as planned. But where was her husband?

    She didn't, was the implication.

    At the start of the story, it's winter, and Maz is supposed to return exactly one year later. At the end of the story, he seems to come back, but it's *summer*, even after she takes off the mask.

      Ah, well spotted.

    ```
    ...or did she? ;)

      Fair point. Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
