## Looking for a beta reader or three for Set In Stone

### Post:

EDIT Plans have changed.  The Backstory will not appear as an infodump or a prologue.  I'll seed bits and pieces into the story, one bit at a time.  A Prologue might also be developed, but it won't be an infodump.

I'm still looking for beta readers, if anyone is interested.

I can't make this part of the editing process public.  Even though I do plan on releasing Set In Stone in places other than Amazon, Amazon will force my book price to zero if they find that it's finished content is available to the public elsewhere for free.  The blog should be immune to this, as it is an early draft.

I'm not so much interested in grammar as opposed to rationality and potential discontinuity.  If you are interested and choose to poke at grammar, feel free, but that's not expected.

  Honestly, I think the story stands on its own and contains enough implicit information for the reader to understand the context without the backstory infodump in the work itself.

  We really don't need to know the details of _why_ Albert has decided that humans are too prone to violence. If anything, the story is stronger with that left hanging.

  Well, here's the first history snippet, for chapter 1.  What do people think?

  *The Rocky Mountain locust originally went extinct in the early twentieth century.  My team and I suspected the size of the swarms had been exaggerated.  We were wrong.  On the third year after introduction, we were able to visibly track the progress of the swarms from orbit, with the naked eye.*

  Maybe one thing that could work would be to write it as an history textbook and have extracts from that book at the beginning of each chapter... This would get people to slowly discover the story of the world as they go through the story? 

  It would solve your problem regarding selling it as science fiction and it wouldn't be such a big infodump. And letting people read the backstory piece by piece might be better. It would allow readers to try and guess who Albert instead of being spoonfed.

  I've always liked books that do this (Dune is a good example), it creates a richer world without ever becoming too much of an infodump.

    Hrm.  This is tempting.  I'll have to dig out Dune and look at what was done.

      Another book that does this as well is Empire of the Ants by Bernard Werber (but it's with quotes of an encyclopedia). Dune's extract are on the shorter side (I've just checked again). I remember seeing it done with longer extracts (around half a page per chapter) but can't remember which novel it was. I just remember that it was something I enjoyed.
