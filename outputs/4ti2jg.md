## [Q] Uplift fiction?

### Post:

There isn't really a specific name for this genre as far as I know...I guess some kinds of portal fantasy count, such as "A Hero's War" and quite a few Game of Thrones self-inserts.

Either way, I suppose the criteria for a piece of "uplift fiction" is to have a character with the skills and knowledge of modern science/engineering/technologically related discipline inserted into a fantasy world that is stagnating in the high fantasy medieval era who proceeds to cause societal and scientific upheaval and drags the world kicking and screaming into modernity.

I've caught up with a few of these but I find myself wanting more. Anyone have some recommendations?

  The name of the trope is [One-Man Industrial Revolution](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution) and I think the foundational work of this kind is [A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court) by Mark Twain. You can read it here: [(link)](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/86?msg=welcome_stranger).

    I agree. Mostly by munckining D&D rules but it's definitely the outside modern perspective that makes it possible.

  Try the SafeHold Series by David Weber. It is basically about the main character uplifting the last human world after humanity lost a war with aliens. It is a great series with some of the best tactical land and naval battles I have ever read. It also contains an interesting religious undertone.

  A major theme of [With This Ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/) is uplifting DC Earth so that it can compete with other interstellar societies.  It's a very slow burn, and the beginning few episodes don't indicate the quality of the whole, but overall it's very well done on a number of levels and I would recommend it without hesitation.

  Much of the uplift is through getting various pieces of DC fiction to work together in order to improve technology everywhere.  Mostly, this includes getting the super tech made by mad scientists to become widely understood and distributed, and in making magic available to everyone.  As of the most recent update, this includes people working on making autonomous drones for controlling the weather on a large scale, special gates that are able to teleport you to their opposite gate regardless of distance, mass producing a superconducting wire for all kinds of uses, and advancing research in alchemy with a focus on human augmentation.

    Yup I loved this one
    The Britishisms took a while to get used to but it's a fun read, especially with the alternate "renegade option" universe

      The climax of Stars, Crossed was a masterpiece.  Or really just the whole thing. 

      "How are you still **alive**?"

      "*Spite*."

    Then again, I was recently reminded unpleasantly that the author, Mr Zoats, has what he calls "grammatical idiosyncrasies" where he purposefully deviates from accepted grammatical norms and it's actually really jarring in-story

      He does have a FAQ with them at the beginning.

      As a (somewhat) reformed pendant I can relate to the frustration. In reading WTR I've thankfully been able to put aside my pedantry in order to just enjoy the story as it emerges day by day.

    The pre-rewrite version, "The Human Memoirs", may be considered more uplift-y and rational.

    It's here: http://www.furry.de/charon/Fiction.html

      I agree, and I think that the two stories are different enough to warrant a read of both. But "The Human Memoirs" definitely reads more like fanfiction and less like professional fiction. Though I enjoyed it anyway.
