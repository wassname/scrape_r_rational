  Alright, I'll bite, been well over a decade since I read any Lackey. Help my memory a moment to figure out where in the timeline I was reading from.

   I recall a herald/fire mage, who ended up in a war, and at the end of the book there was some passage about pine-cones opening after a fire.

  I also recall one of the weapon-masters being introduced into the Heralds, and training a young assassin/thief/dagger specialist. 

  I suppose another story I recall I don't remember much about the protagonist, but I do remember they lived in some village in the boonies and had the village mage/medic/weather watcher (seemingly suffering from PTSD or brain damage) caring for the protagonist then burning themselves out on a bridge while enemy forces invaded.

  Where exactly, did those occur in the Valdemar timeline?

  I have never read lackey. Heard a couple of her songs and thought they were neat. What could you tell me about her writing?
