## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Can anyone recommend any non-fiction books about reconstruction after society goes awry?  I've been reading a lot lately about how societies descend into, for instance, a Nazi Germany-like state, but I haven't found much on how they get out of it.  Even just time periods to look to would be helpful.  I can think of the reconstruction of Europe after WWII, and German unification after the Berlin Wall fell, but in trying to think of other time periods my knowledge of history is proving insufficient.

    I can offer some recommendations on Japanese history. The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori by Mark Ravina is a book on the life of an influential samurai during the Meiji Restoration, now best known due to the Tom Cruise movie based on his life.

    Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II by John W. Dower is probably the definitive book for that period and is definitely the more easily accessible of the two. It presents a nuanced look at the US occupation of Japan following WW2.

    The Knowledge: How to rebuild our world from scratch- Lewis Dartnell
    > Human knowledge is collective, distributed across the population. It has built on itself for centuries, becoming vast and increasingly specialized. Most of us are ignorant about the fundamental principles of the civilization that supports us, happily utilizing the latest—or even the most basic—technology without having the slightest idea of why it works or how it came to be. If you had to go back to absolute basics, like some sort of postcataclysmic Robinson Crusoe, would you know how to re-create an internal combustion engine, put together a microscope, get metals out of rock, accurately tell time, weave fibers into clothing, or even how to produce food for yourself? 
    Regarded as one of the brightest young scientists of his generation, Lewis Dartnell proposes that the key to preserving civilization in an apocalyptic scenario is to provide a quickstart guide, adapted to cataclysmic circumstances.

  Used some of the holidays to catch-up with Ward and frankly I was a bit disappointed. I made it to arc 11 before dropping it, despite Worm being probably my favourite web novel of all time. I'd never seen much discussion on this sub around Ward though so I'm not sure how it's received here.

  I've noticed that now, I'm only actively following 2 series: The Wandering Inn and MoL, with nothing else having caught my attention for ages. Instead I've been reading far more non-fiction works recently The Global Minotaur and Why Nations Fail being the most recent. Both have interesting and provocative arguments on global economic issues and I would recommend.
  ```

  - u/Nobidexx:
    ```
    I dropped it towards the end of arc 17, though I'll probably binge the rest once it's over unless the reception is very negative.

    >!Victoria as the protagonist is the main issue for me. She was already one of the few relevant characters in Worm I cared very little about, and unfortunately Ward didn't manage to change that. I can't pinpoint what exactly makes her so unappealing to me, though I suppose her being the opposite of Taylor in pretty much every way has a lot to do with it, as I was invested in her story from the first Worm chapter.!<


    >!I generally like the rest of breakthrough more than Victoria herself, though that isn't enough to offset the glacial pace Ward has compared to Worm as a more character-driven story, especially since I don't enjoy the action scenes as much as in Worm either (again, Victoria is a problem as her power doesn't allow her to have the situational awareness Taylor had, which makes fights more confusing, and generally offers less interesting resolutions). I found the worlbuilding to be a mess as well, and the interludes on average weaker than Worm's, though I still did like a lot of them and they're my favorite part of Ward overall.!<

    >!I think it's overall much harder to enjoy Ward if you dislike Victoria as a protagonist than Worm if you disliked Taylor, which imo partly explains why it hasn't been as well received. I've seen a lot of Worm readers who didn't care about Taylor but continued anyway for the action scenes and interludes, which Ward has less of.!<
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    I bounced off of Ward pretty early (early arc 5), then listened to We've Got Worm, and now I love Ward. The more literary criticism based angle that WGW promotes fits it better than the usual fandom / watercooler conversation style. I'd also recommend We've Got Worm to Worm fans in general, it definitely made me enjoy it more.
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      WGW is great, I listened to we've got worm as a refresher and have enjoyed them when more with Ward. I'm just listening to the Ward Audiobook so having them point out key moments I might have missed is great.

      I also initially dropped Ward due to not emphasizing with Victoria but came back to it.

    How about Practical Guide to Evil and Worth the Candle. They update regularly and are pretty great too

  - u/panchoadrenalina:
    ```
    my drop point for ward was the worldbuilding. i just cant imagine the mega city popping up from nowhere in as little time as it did without a much much longer time frame. megalopolises are complicated affairs.

    how is wandering inn now? i dropped it long ago because i dislike when the mc is sidetracked from its own book. when i left the author was going in this long flashbacks and jumping characters half a world away while erin did alchemy in a corner over there.
    ```

    - u/Robert_Barlow:
      ```
      Keep in mind that they had the full cooperation of most of the surviving capes, as well as Accord's plans going into it. Picture >!everybody finally working together!< only a little less efficient. Additionally, the City was the designated east coast evacuation point, so they probably started construction a while before Gold Morning. Two years sounds impossibly fast, but when you only really have to worry about supplies and labor, it's not as unbelievable.

      > i just cant imagine the mega city popping up from nowhere in as little time as it did without a much much longer time frame. megalopolises are complicated affairs.

      Spoilers: >!That is actually something the author did on purpose. The city is pretty much an empty shell, it never could have worked out in the long term. After Gold Morning, people prioritised going back to how things were before, without putting in place the solid foundations they would have needed to do so. People were unwilling to move out to the countryside and become farmers or miners, they wanted back to fastfood and skyscrapers. As a result, shoddy construction and food crises cause issues not just within the City, but with their dimensional neighbors. That is part of Ward's message about recovering from trauma; you cannot expect things to quickly go back to how they were before the traumatic event, you need to deal with the fact that going forward, some things might never be the same again.!<
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The writing's very good (much better than volume one), but it goes progressively more and more in the direction of an epic tale covering happenings all across the world rather than focusing on Erin.

      I prefer stories focusing on a single storyline, and have been gradually losing interest (haven't dropped it yet, but I rarely reach chapters on the dya they come out anymore).
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I really like WanderingInn but it still wanders a lot. That being said quite a few disparate plot points have either come together or become obviously related recently. So that may make it easier for you to enjoy.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The Wandering Inn still wanders a lot. Volume 6 has longer side arcs than any Volume so far and a lot less time with Erin. I can see how its frustrating and you might not like it now even if the plot points are starting to slowly draw together. 
      But the Wandering Inn is my favorite running serial BECAUSE it wanders so much. I think it makes the world feel alive and lived in. I love being sucked in to some random new or returning character twice a week and learning to care about their world and struggles.
      ```

    - u/1000dollarsamonth:
      ```
      I dropped wanderinginn when the author decided that the antinium had feelings all of the sudden. During the antinium wars the antinium were known for the robotic ruthless efficiency. They were mindless cold killer robots and that's why they freaked out when they found out that Erin can turn ants into "individuals". The author clearly establishes this lore deeply and its a major plot point. But during a flashback scene in the antinium war, the female antinium commander was getting pushed back and used a morale boosting skill which reduces fear and bolsters hope to the soldiers? The author tried to make it an emotional scene showing how the antinium army is now fighting with hope. And thats my problem lol this nitpick which made me drop it. Antinium were feared all over for being ruthless killer robots with no empathy. But, this flashback scene suddenly humanized every ant there. They were fighting like humans and the other races able to feel fear and hope. They were supposed to be controlled by a queen hivemind and fight like how we were lead to believe for so long.

      I've started reading *Red Son* based on your recommendation, and I'm enjoying it so far. This take is especially intriguing since I'm a Russian myself and can, at will, look at the events through the prism of propaganda I was fed during my childhood.

      *Saga*'s premise didn't seem very interesting to me, to be honest, but considering the recommendation has been seconded after merely half an hour, I think it's worth checking out anyway.

          Sorry for taking so long to answer! Work and uni leave no time for Reddit (which is good, I suppose, since I've been spending too much time on social media lately). 

          I'm going to share my thoughts, so in case someone other than u/callmesalticidae reads this: there are going to be unmarked spoilers!

          First of all, the ending BLEW MY MIND. While I wasn't *that* surprised with Lex Luthor winning, and him being able to run government efficiently was foreshadowed in the first issue, the very last twist was *amazing*. I just sat here, absorbing that ending for a good minute.

          I don't have a deep knowledge of DC lore, but I recognized all the main characters, and, more importantly, could compare them to their usual portrayals. I really liked the takes on most of them, and I especially enjoyed how Lois 
          not-Lane was written here. Also, Batman the ushanka terrorist is probably my favorite portrayal of the character aside from *LEGO Batman*.

          The depiction of Stalinist and post-Stalinist USSR was fine—but since the story was about the characters, not the setting, it wasn't explored at all, and I didn't really mind that.

          I feel like timeskips between issues could've been handled better; sometimes the drastic changes were a tad jarring. However, I got used to them by the middle of the third issue—so it wasn't too bad.

          From the graphics standpoint, I found the style to be pleasant but not *outstanding*. I honestly can't remember a single frame that visually captivated me, but neither do I remember anything badly drawn. The color pallette was probably the best part. 

          Overall, I enjoyed reading the story and would probably recommend it to some of my friends (definitely to those who enjoyed *The Metropolitan Man* or *Injustice*). 

          The last but not least: Lex Luthor here is unacceptably hot. I never thought I needed a ginger version of that smug fuck, but I apparently did.
          ```

          - u/callmesalticidae:
            ```
            I didn't ask that long ago. No need to apologize!

            Thank you for being so in-depth! The only thing better than reading good stories is vicariously enjoying them for the first time again through other people. 

            Ushanka Batman and LEGO Batman are definitely wonderful Batmen. 

            Also, I realized that I have some recommendations I can make!

            COMICS BY WARREN ELLIS

            *Planetary* is about a team of "archaeologists of the unknown," who, in the process of digging up the secret history of the world, also dig up the history of superhero comics, their roots, and their influences on other genres (e.g. "here's the story where we see how 1920s pulp adventurers gave way to flashier, more inhumanly powered characters," "here's the story where we learn about a 1950s lab with atomic-powered people, atomic-powered ants, and, well, you get the idea"). Over time, a larger plot emerges. 

            *Transmetropolitan* is, if you haven't heard of it already, Hunter S. Thompson (by another name) In The Future. 

            *Black Summer* is another Ellis comic. Long story short, there were once seven superheroes who were all some spin on "Iron Man-type tech hero." They fought crime. Then some of them died or got injured. They split up. A few continued to fight crime. 

            Then in 2007 one of them thinks, "You know, I fight crime... And the President is a war criminal..." and straight up kills W. Bush and Cheney and kicks off a nightmare sequence of responses and responses to those responses, which is what the following seven issues are about. 

            Also, Warren Ellis is British, so there's an interesting "this is America as perceived from the outside" flavor to it.

            *Nextwave* is classic "people punching things and being witty" Silver Age superheroism, and I love it. There are tactical drop bears, broccoli people, and a dragon who wears purple underpants. 

            *Crécy* is a graphic novel about the Battle of Crécy, narrated by a longbowman as he marches to and fights at Crécy. It breaks the fourth wall a bit (our narrator is speaking to *us* and comments on modern events and contextualizes things in a way that helps them make sense to modern readers) but I don't think that detracts at all. It makes the important point that people in earlier times weren't stupider than us, they just didn't have the mass of accumulated knowledge from which we benefit today (which is probably an obvious point to anyone on this subreddit...). 

            COMICS BY KIERON GILLEN

            In *Uber* and *Uber: Invasion*, the Nazis discover how to make superhumans just in time to push the Russians back from Moscow. Luckily, a British spy is able to smuggle the formula back to the U.K., and so WWII enters a new phase, with new weapons. There *are* characters with superpowers, but the series pays as much attention to "how platoons and regiments of superpowered soldiers would be utilized" as it does to "what this individual superpowered soldier is doing." Also, Ukrainian anarchism becomes relevant in the second series! 

            You mentioned elsewhere in this thread that you're familiar with *Watchmen*, so allow me to recommend the 2019 run of *Peter Cannon: Thunderbolt.* You know how DC bought some characters from a dying comics company, hired Alan Moore to write a story about them, and then asked Moore to change the names because his story had rendered almost all of their newly-purchased characters dead or AWOL? Peter Cannon was Ozymandias 1.0, and Gillen's run does some interesting things with the character's relationship to Watchmen. It gets fairly meta, in a *Planetary* sort of way. 

            *Die* is Tabletop RPG Jumanji. Six kids were drawn into a weird fantasy world, and five of them were able to get out. Now, decades later, the game is coming for them again. 

            COMICS BY OTHER PEOPLE 

            *Miracleman* by Alan Moore is a peculiar one. It's another "revival of an old character from the days before DC and Marvel were synonymous with superheroes," and Moore does some really weird things with the character. Also, there's a (very much on hiatus) sequel miniseries by Gaiman which shows us a world transformed by Superheroes Who Actually Do Something. 

            *Dwarves* is a French fantasy comic about, uh, dwarves. Most of the issues center on different characters, but their stories intersect over the generations (I'm working on a blog post that tries to put things together, because some events are centuries apart from each other). I really like how fleshed-out dwarven culture is. Unfortunately, the other comics in this universe, *Elves* and *Orcs & Goblins*, are pretty bad. 

            *Superman Smashes the Klan* is basically what it sounds like. It's a loose comic adaption of the 1940s "Clan of the Fiery Cross" radio serial. 

            *The Manhattan Projects* is a Weird Superscience comic by Jonathan Hickman with nuclear ghosts, "Zen-powered Death Buddhists," and Oppenheimer's evil twin. 

            *The Private Eye* is a 10-issue scifi/mystery comic where, in response to a privacy breach to end all privacy breaches, people decide that they really like being able to keep secrets and go all-in on it: there's no longer any "clouds" for people's secrets to spill out from, digging into someone's search history is a federal crime, and the government guarantees your right to use a pseudonym in just about any situation. Also, everyone wears a mask in public so there are lots of great costumes and you should get the trade paperback editions because there are even more costume sketches in the back. 

            Last but not least, I wrote a [review for Jonathan Hickman's *The Black Monday Murders*](https://wmbsaltworks.wordpress.com/2019/01/04/media-recommendation-the-black-monday-murders-by-jonathan-hickman/). The story is complete in the sense that the initial mystery was solved but there are lots of sequel hooks dangling, and unfortunately Hickman hasn't gone back to it recently.

    After you read *Sandman*, I recommend trying some of the other classic comic series in the Vertigo imprint. For instance, *[Hellblazer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellblazer)* was a trend setter for many ideas that later became popular in the urban fantasy genre.  The series had its ups and downs as it changed authors and artists, and in some ways it's a time capsule for the issues that were important in Britain at the time it published, but the high points are definitely worth the read. It's not particularly rational (but then neither is *Sandman*).

    Literally glancing across my comic shelf...

    It's not as famous as some of the other recommendations you're getting, but I really enjoyed Neil Gaiman's *Eternals* run. It's available in a single paperback collection.

    *The Unbelievable Gwenpool* is widely acclaimed. If you enjoy it, or have read it, I just finished and quite enjoyed the next two comic series to follow the character (*West Coast Avengers* and *Gwenpool Strikes Back*), although they're not *as* good.

    If you're ok with rather wacky non-mainstream comics, *The Adventures of Dr McNinja* (by the same author as *Unbelievable Gwenpool* - it's what landed him the job) is surprisingly good. It's available for free as a webcomic, but also available in print as a series of slablike collections - and the fact I bought one despite having already read the whole comic for free should speak to how much I liked it.

  I need some more litrpg (and similar).  I generally stay away from vrpg stories, since the stakes never seem to be all that high.

  I've already read and enjoyed:

  * He Who Fights With Monsters
  * Azarinth Healer
  * Cradle
  * Mother of Learning
  * The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound (kinda trash, but I love it)
  * The System Apocalypse
  * A Thousand Li
  * Delve
  * The Scourged Earth
  * Everybody Loves Large Chests
  * The Salamanders
  * Allocation
  * Life Reset
  * Brimstone Fantasy
  * The Gam3 (the first two books at least...)
  * Dante's Immortality
  * Street Cultivation
  * The Magineer

  I've read but dropped:

  * Worth the Candle (might check back when it's complete)
  * The Wandering Inn
  * The Snake Report
  * Vainqueur the Dragon
  * Forever Fantasy Online
  * The Arcane Emperor
  * The Ritualist
  ```

  - u/Penumbra_Penguin:
    ```
    Most of the LitRPG proper I've read has been mediocre at best. What have your favourites been?

    If you liked Cradle, then here are two recs that are similarly LitRPG-adjacent and quite good: Sufficiently Advanced Magic, by Andrew Rowe, and Into the Labyrinth, by John Bierce.

    You may also like the webcomic Order of the Stick. It starts out as a series of unrelated jokes about D&D mechanics, but evolves to the point where it has some of the most impressive moments I've seen in a fantasy story in any medium. Given that it's a stick figure comic, that's incredible.

    > Azarinth Healer

    Does the writing in this one get better later on? I tried picking it up but either the writing quality or style had me dropping it pretty quickly. This was a year or two ago so I don't recall exactly what about the writing made it so unenjoyable to read.
    ```

    - u/iftttAcct2:
      ```
      The prose and structure remains pretty much the same, I'd say. I would describe it as workman-like
      ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Threadbear, perhaps?
    ```

    - u/fortycakes:
      ```
      Seconding this recommendation. Threadbear and the sequel, Small Medium, are both complete and excellent LitRPGs. Dragon Hack, the third in the series, isn't complete yet, but shows the same combination of good writing and worldbuilding.

      Other recommendations:

      * Cultivating Earth is excellent, but on hiatus at the moment.
      * Nanocultivation Chronicles is also good, and has the interesting conceit of having the Outside (real world, with nanotech) and Inside (a VRMMO), with most characters existing in both.
      * The Elemental Arena has been posted here recently, and is medium to good. Only a few chapters in so far, though.
      ```

    Some recs from the last thread:

    - Forge of Destiny 
    - Euphoria Online 
    - Defiance of the Fall
    - Reborn: Apocalypse 
    - The City and the Dungeon
    - New Game Minus
    - Irrelevant Jack
    - The Dream Trilogy

    I'll also contribute The Novel's Extra as well, a relatively good Korean one.
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Queen in the Mud, Arrogant Young Master, and  Elemental Arena (all Royalroad) all looks promising though it's still left unsaid whether they'll deliver.

    Here are two (relatively short) Worm parodies/crack-fics that I think are quite good.  A Black Comedy (recommended above) is also excellent.

    [Tank](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tank-worm-altpowertaylor-au-complete.700525/)

    Author summary:  Taylor triggers in the locker with the ability to turn into an arbitrary number of Soviet tanks. Easily a breaker 9/blaster 5/mover 3/brute 4/changer 8/master 7, our glorious heroine becomes the vanguard of the proletariat and brings about righteous revolution. Escalation, power wank, and stations of canon galore lie within these pages.

    [Timelooping Tinker](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/timelooping-tinker-worm-fanfic-au.338287/)

    Author summary: Oh no! The supergenius bomb tinker Bakuda has been trapped in an endless recursion of time! But don't despair, boys and girls! Blasting out of a piddling temporal anomaly will be child's play for the most explosive woman in the world! How hard could it be?
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      Worth noting that Tank is specifically a parody of fics where the literal nazis of E88 get portrayed as not so bad, and Taylor joins them, according to the author. I haven't come across any of that description, but I enjoyed Tank nevertheless.
      ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        [According to the author of *Tank*](https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/e16viy/my_compiled_thoughts_of_tank/f8o7ork/):

        > To the very minimal extent Tank isn't me having fun, it is a condemnation of centrists. Like, that's the "message," if you want there to be one, but the non-message stuff is the bulk and the goal was fun.
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    A Black Comedy by nonjon. Smart and funny HP fanfiction that looks plotless most of the way through then pulls everything together at the end.
    ```

    - u/ProfessorPhi:
      ```
      The Seventh Horcrux is also fantastic
      ```

- u/uwu-bob:
  ```
  Do you know of any fun webnovels/books featuring a **murderhobo protagonist**? Ideally fantasy with an internally consistent world.

  Example: [Everybody Loves Large Chests](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests)
  ```

  - u/MoneyLicense:
    ```
    The closest I've found have been [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) and [The Iron Teeth](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale)
    ```

    - u/uwu-bob:
      ```
      Thanks! I've already read Super Minion, it was really good but sadly not long yet.

      I'd skipped The Iron Teeth because reviews said the MC was dumb / inconsistent / holds the idiot ball. Is that wrong? What's the appeal of the story?
      ```

      - u/kmsxkuse:
        ```
        I skipped the first half of iron teeth and you don't miss much. Author has put the story out to pasture though so dont expect any updates.
        ```

- u/1000dollarsamonth:
  ```
  I am desperate for audiobooks since my work allows me to consume them on the clock. I went through so many of the major ones, stormlight, first law, dresden, kingkiller, etc and even dived into niche litrpg. I burned through everything on hpmor podcast and wildbow's works.

  Did I miss anything? Or am I stuck in limbo. My problem is that it has to be rationalist or I drop it. Any suggestions?
  ```
