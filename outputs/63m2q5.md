## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So, I decided my vampire society is very keen on titles and rank and seniority and all that. Originally I was going to give them all titles from ranks from all sorts of foreign countries and ancient cultures, but people pointed out that it would be rather hard to keep track of for a reader, so I decided just to use terms from English, and assume a sort of translation convention (i.e. in Ireland, vampires are Marquesses instead of Barons, and in India you might get a Raj instead of a Duke, or whathaveyou). 

  So I have a couple of issues:

  * If the vampire titles come from the local language, I run into a problem: the vampire travels between several countries (Italy, France, Czech Republic, Germany, Portugal, USA) and so if I'm respecting that translation convention, pretty much all the vampires are going to have different titles even if they're *the same "actual" rank*

  * I'm using nobility titles. It's a very world-of-darkness thing to use. I'm considering switching perhaps to military titles? 

  * Probably using model noble titles is a bit gauche, considering how the main vampire is 1500 years old, he would have started out using something different from the ~medieval/renaissance words that I've used. Should I just go and find words from the Roman empire?

  * There's a gap in my titles which I'm not sure what to call it. At the moment I'm calling it a Crown, and while that worked when I was using a variety of languages and cultures, amongst standard british peerage it seems really stupid.

  * Would vampires really have rigid ranks, or would individual vampires just feel arrogant enough to style themselves as >insert title here<? My conception of vampires is of having such large brain power that they can pay attention to lots of things at once, do deep analysis of things, etc, so I could see vampires easily having *a thousand* different ranks and corresponding titles. Conversely, I could see vampires having *n* ranks, where *n* is the number of known vampires, with each vampire being slotted into their exact place in society. In that case, titles become  completely unecessary, but may still have a ceremonial significance.

  Anyway, here's my ranks:

  - Emperor - hypothetical title for "king of all vampires" - has never really existed though of course there are ambitious vampires from time to time.

  - King - a temporary title given at a vampire convocation to essentially the chairperson of that meeting. 

  - Crown - Controls a large swathe of land. Highest "permanent" title.

  - Duke - Under the Crown, controls e.g. a city. 

  - Earl > Baron - Vampires who live in areas controlled by "Dukes". Not sure if we need two "levels" here or not.

  Looking at Ancient Rome, it's all very complicated, but we can get:

  * Rex (King)

  * Senators  (may be below Patricii; they are actually from different eras in Rome best as I can tell)

  * Patricii (patricians)

  * Consuls (may be above senators. Again, different eras)

  * Conscripti (may be equal to senators? Again, different eras)

  * Equites (knights)

  * Proletarii (landless poor)

  Ancient Roman Military is also tricky, but at least a bit more easily put in boxes because they share an era:

  * Legatus Augusti pro praetore  ~King

  * Legatus legionis ~Crown

  * Tribunus laticlavius ~second-in-command to the above

  * Praefectus castrorum ~Duke?

  * Tribuni angusticlavii ~Earl?

  Then the problem is, these ranks are hard to pronounce. But if I didn't insist on vampires using titles for each other (something I'm not married to), then I can just say "Elodia, the Tribunus of Genoa, was blah blah" and then only mention her rank if it comes up, e.g. "William glared at her "A tribunus like yourself  tries to tell a Legatus how to behave? How dare you!""

    Do both.  Vampires have one "Primary" and several "Secondary" titles.

    Your "Primary" title is what you use when traveling.  These are translatable, since the whole point is to convey, "I'm a noble.  Don't seat me with those commoners."

    Your "Secondary" titles are specific descriptions (often self-applied) of your age, accomplishment or role within your society. 

    So, "Queen Elizabeth" is also "Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith"

    Someone else could be, "Lady Mary," and also "Mary Stewart, Baroness of Whitchurch, Heroine of the Battle of New Bridge."

    ---
    Within this, I might just simplify the 'Primary' titles to something like:

    King / Queen: Sovereign leader of a territory
    Lord / Lady: Vampire with delegated authority
    Master / Mistress: Independent vampire without delegated authority
    No Title: Vampire who's someone else's servant / dependent.

    The reason for the simplification is that, if I'm interacting with someone across-cultures, the questions I'm really asking are: "Are you speaking on behalf of your state?" and "Are you responsible for yourself, or are you someone's servant / child / spawn?"

    A second benefit is that this framework is general enough that it can work for vampire societies that base power on something other than land-ownership.

    Your roman vampires, for instance, are using titles that imply they've got a military command structure going on.  In which case "Lord = Commissioned Officer," "Master = NCO" and everyone else lacks a title.

      Oh man, thankyou! The primary/secondary title thing is genius. Plus it lets me give them long, lofty, completely unwieldy titles but not have to keep them at the forefront and distract everyone. Plus I can go back to the more general "all vampires are Lord/Lady" thing I was doing before I tried to make it more complicated.

      Moreover, it means that each King/Queen can potentially organize their territory however they like (e.g. a King/Queen in Denmark might have a very rigid set of twelve levels of nobility, while a King/Queen in New York might have elected officials, and a vampire in ancient Gaul might have used military titles based on combat prowess). Gives them more to keep track of, and might make the distinction between territories meaningful, too. 

      Leadership is not exactly sovereign so King doesn't seem quite right. I'm not sure how vampires would resolve disputes about who controls what territory; generally I've had the one who is obviously less powerful cede their lands immediately, because when it comes to vampire physical abilities, having a few centuries on someone gives you a decided advantage if it came to combat. Then again, since then I've settled better on a concept of ritualised warfare that is essentially like the old-timey duels where you choose your weapon, only instead of choosing which type of gun you can choose to both write an opera and whoever has the best opera wins, or you can have a dance off or rap battle, or compete to identify the most obscure taxidermied animals, or you can even mount armies against each other if you agree to that. I suppose lesser vampires will pool their resources to resist a King they don't like, so a King's job is to maintain his position of authority whilst not being bad enough that people want to overthrow him. 

      Plus, the main vampire character, William, was actually a King of France when he was a human in the dark ages (I don't know if this will come up in the story), and he's also a Crown/Vampire King, so it seems a little on the nose. That said, when he was the King of France, France was more a warring tribe, so he was more a sort of general/warlord than what we'd think of as a King I guess. (I should maybe ask /r/askhistorians what being a King meant in the dark ages in terms of duties and day to day life and that sort of thing).

    I really like the idea that they just give themselves ranks, and then maybe if Vampire A bestows upon himself a title that Vampire B feels is wrongly outshining himself (i.e. "I only call myself a Duke, so there's no way I'm going to let you call yourself a King") then they'll tussle in whatever way vampires tussle (not necessarily personally or physically, I assume) until one party or the other cries uncle. 

    Titles can be pretty bland (i.e. "King Carl Boone") or grandiose (i.e. "Amelia Schwartz, Empress of the Great Lakes, Potentate of Detroit, Protector of Southwest Ohio, Hunter of Men and Slayer of Beasts, She Who Gives Gifts"), tending toward "as grandiose as possible, to the extent that it doesn't step on the toes of vampires whose toes can't be safely stepped on." 

    There's no real rhyme or reason behind the titles. They just pick whatever they like and, as described above, tussle on occasion when somebody picks a title that's too big for the britches.
    ```

      Yep, I'm really digging the grandiose titles. Now, the question is: is there a formula or webpage for generating them? I can definitely do it mad-lib style, with "<verb> of the <noun>" being basically what it comes down to. 

      I like the combo of simple, official titles that are essentially used for communication between individuals who are not well-known to each other and people assigning themselves their own titles in between, with associated tussling.
