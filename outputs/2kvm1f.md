  Well if you're gonna post it twice, OP, you'd might as well do a crosspost, to condense the discussion :P

  Either way, interesting chapter. Shorter than usual, but hey it was earlier than usual too. Not complaining.

  What's Quirrell's game? How can he benefit from this? I'm kinda wondering if he'll do something later, to further exploit the Time Turner weaknesses.

    The obvious motive is that as a result of todays events, Dementors will go extinct. Who knows what he knows about what happens if Death casts no more shadows into this world? Maybe he thinks immortality for everyone will also stop the "disease" that would presumably kill HPMOR-Quirrel at the end of the year?

      That... seems a bit too easy. I suspect that Dementors are caused by Death, rather than being the cause of Death. I mean, we already know about the physiological causes of Death, or at least that in most cases Dying Is Caused By Physical Things. Removing Dementors from the equation won't change the physics of being stabbed by a knife, or the reproductive tendencies of microbes, or anything.

        If nothing else, this will probably increase the number of True Patronus casters and noncasters who want Death dead. *That* benefits him, at least.

    He seems to want to set up potter as the hero of magical Briton. After harry stopped his prior suggestions to do so, he is having to force him. This is that plan.

    Quirrell cannot cast the Patronus charm.

    He has been shown to be seriously weak to Dementation in the past.

    He learned the truth about Dementors, and he fears death.

    He wants Harry Potter to become a Hero, worshiped by the masses.

    So, with all these facts, why *wouldn't* he arrange a situation in which every Dementor on the planet is destroyed by Harry Potter and those who he taught?

    It eliminates one of his most glaring weaknesses (One which Harry Potter and Dumbledore both know about), removes the one creature that Avada Kedavra doesn't work on from the world, spreads terror in the name of Voldemort  making his eventual defeat even more prestigious, and gives Harry the chance to be the hero.

    It hits all the points.

    Fair point. Oh well, too late now
