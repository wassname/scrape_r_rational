## [D] Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Patricia Wrede

### Post:

I remembered the first of these four novels fondly from teenagerhood and have started reading them again.  They're fantasy fiction suitable for kids or young adults.  The sensibleness of the main characters approaches Granny Weatherwax levels and makes for very enjoyable books.  Also, dragons.

So far I've (re)read the first two novels.  Here's a breakdown by rational-fic characteristics:

* *The characters are not stupid. No one holds the Idiot Ball (or at least not the main heroes or main villains).*

The intelligence of the main characters, in their extremely silly fairytale world, is remarkable. All factions make realistic mistakes, but the villains edge close to stupidity by not learning from past mistakes.

* *The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.*

Definitely fulfilled.  As soon as [a solution to a problem](#s " (in this case, a temporary but reusable method of getting rid of wizards)") becomes apparent, Cimorene announces and distributes it.  Next time the problem arises, she is shown to have kept the same solution on hand.

* *The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.*

The stories aren't mysteries or puzzles, but all information later relied upon is mentioned earlier in the story.

* *Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".*

The villains are depicted as close to evil-for-evil's-sake, partly of necessity because of [their characteristic](#s " magic, which must drain other magic to function"). However, their more evil plans tend only to be set into motion when the good guys rebuff non-violent attempts at getting what they want.

* *The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.*

Sane? Deliberately not: this is a fairy-tale setting and follows those tropes to the letter, often Played For Laughs (for example, a minor character is a wicked uncle who has to do something evil to his nephew or be socially shunned, even though he's quite fond of the boy - while the nephew actually *wants* to be evilly abandoned in the woods so he can have an adventure).

Consistent? Definitely: characters make intelligent use of the storybook tropes, which are reliable enough to base plans around (or to become a nuisance, for example when [those pesky](#s " princes show up trying to 'rescue' Cimorene from her employer, even when asked not to")).

Books in order, all by Patricia C. Wrede:

* Dealing with Dragons
* Searching for Dragons
* Calling on Dragons
* Talking to Dragons

  I'm a big fan of these books. I am not sure that I'd praise the [plot spoilers](#s "wizard's competency as much as you do - they struck me as ineffectual and not very grounded, and liable to making the same mistakes repeatedly - i mean, I understand losing to the bucket of soapy water once, but being defeated by the same method again and again is silly. That said, it was nice when the stone prince reasoned Morwen wouldn't melt by the state of her domicile in the climax of the first book, for example.") That said, the set of antagonists had fairly understandable goals they were working towards by fairly reasonable methods. It was only their preparation for others' interference I would fault. 

  Also, many of the characters are great and wonderful. I am a big, big fan of Morwen.
