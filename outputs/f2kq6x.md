  Amusing!

  You need significantly more^(*) Druids and Clerics than given, because they have limited coverage, limited capacity, and deaths aren't going to be evenly distributed. Since you need about 8 Druids to cover Waterdeep using Tree Stride, that leaves at least some patrol areas with only one Druid on duty, which will fail if that area has more than three deaths in a day. Which, assuming deaths are distributed randomly, will be basically every day. And the actual distribution of deaths is not going to be as forgiving as random, either, since a lot of accidental deaths are going to be from multi-person incidents like carriage accidents or sneezing wizards.

  ^(*) I'd give you a number but I can't find the right Birthday Problem variant and I don't feel like coding up a simulation.

    Yeah I could have gone all Poisson with this, but the numbers are order of magnitude estimates more than anything. You probably would need more Druids.

  I feel like the overall numbers in the plan don't hold out very well, because, IMO, it is too large/high level of a team for even a large city to field. TBF that's mostly just my gut feeling about magic and power levels.

  A better way to judge the viability of this plan is to count up the daily cost based on DM Manual figures for paying a professional to cast spells of these levels, counting for some sort of discount for regular wages rather than one-off work. Then use more cost tables to determine how that compares to the economic output of a spread of two million people. That would take longer so I'm not going to do that, but maybe someone else would be interested.

  Instead I'm mostly going to consider "what proportion of the population is actually of this level, and is it reasonable to think that from that number there would actually be enough people available with this specific build.

  I didn't find any actual "official" numbers for the level spread in the forgotten realms. u/fallencoder posted [this chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/597t3i/dd_character_level_demographics/) which assumed a fraction of lvl 1 characters based on the US armed forces percentage, and then from that level 1 number assumed that each level above that had half the numbers as the previous level.

  With that benchmark out of a city of two million you'd expect (.0012773%) only 25 level 10 people. Even considering that the high level people may gravitate to population centers for work I don't think you'd be able to create this team, especially considering that the 15 level 10 people you want are Druids, and those are the last people you're going to get to work every day in a dense city.

  Personally I have issues with the assumptions on that chart on both ends. First I feel like modern US is a bad example for %combatants. We (and many other modern militaries) are all about a very small number of professional volunteers, which is basically the opposite of the medieval "conscript a bunch of peasants into a militia for a campaign season" model which is probably closer to D&D. But while I think the level 1 number would be way higher, I think the dropoff should be steeper.

  I think the death and retirement rate of 50% is fine for the first few levels, but after, say, level 5 I think you'd be lucky to get 10-20% of the population to move on. Those people are either going to be higher fatality occupations (more adventurers and fewer city guards) or picked up in much smaller numbers for elite training. Additionally after you get to that point the retirements are going to shoot up. People will have avenged their Uncles and not gotten sucked into the next crazy adventure, they'll start to realize that their pockets have "retire forever" money in them, and they'll drop out of the business.

    Well, Waterdeep does have at least 5 17+ level casters. Lirael Silverhand, Vajra Blackstaff, Wyllow, Manshoon, and Halaster. Now, three of those are not likely to be helping out the world above anytime soon, but those are just the ones described in Dragon Heist and DotMM that I can remember off of the top of my head, and they seem to signify a higher proportion of casters than u/fallencoder’s analysis would say.

    Still, perhaps it would be easier to brute-force the Gentle Repose issue by enlisting a ton of 3rd level casters who ride True Polymorphed Nightmares or something. A Nightmare enhanced by Haste, Expeditious Retreat, and Longstrider can move faster than a Druid with Tree Stride. 800 feet per round I think? (90 + 10)*2 = 200, with a bonus action dash, an action dash, and a Hasted dash.

  There's a major assumption here that I don't buy. You are assuming that each person who would otherwise die prematurely must only be rescued once.

  It seems to me that there are plenty of situations where the same person would need to be rescued again and again:

  * Thinking about the real world, the most likely would be deaths due to severe disease (if you prevent this particular heart attack, the patient might just have another next week), but this might be fixable by adding more divine healing magic to your scheme, if that restores the patient to perfect health.
  * Once this system is in place, risk-taking behaviour could drastically increase. When the sport of beholder-go-kart-sledding takes off, your team is going to be quickly overwhelmed by a large number of 15-25 year-olds requiring rather frequent saving.
  * Even in the absence of extreme sports, it's not too hard to imagine that (let's say) one of the premature deaths each day is due to a risk factor which healing magic will not fix - let's say that that person has a 1% chance to die each day (due to personal vendetta, dangerous hobbies, criminal activity, etc). Waterdeep will eventually end up with about 15,000 such people, requiring 150 interventions per day just for this group. (Numbers made up to illustrate the effect)

  This doesn't sound like a great plan.

  * Step 1, Somehow get a bunch of high level characters together to stop death.  
  * Step 2, watch as all the druids and clerics lose their magic powers, because they're either not preserving the balance (and going directly against it) and abusing their magic against the wishes of their deities.  
  * Step 3, survive whatever complications happen as a result of the warlock patrons' machinations occur when they've revified a ton of people, since they are granted powers by an explicitly evil source.  
  * Step 4, die as the city gets a train run on it by the 50+ deities whose portfolios include death.  
  * Step 5, spend all of eternity in super-hell as punishment and warning to others.

    > Step 1, Somehow get a bunch of high level characters together to stop death.

    Adventurers commonly work together to keep people from dying. I don't see how this is different than getting them to stop an evil wizard.

    > because they're either not preserving the balance

    What balance exactly are they preserving? If they just have to keep overpopulation from being a problem there are other ways of controlling it besides premature death. And other ways of preserving the balance besides keeping the population low. You could also try to magically feed more people, increasing the population that can be supported.

    Also, they're not keeping people from dying. They're just postponing death. I imagine most people die of old age, so the life expectancy isn't even changing that much.

    > Step 4, die as the city gets a train run on it by the 50+ deities whose portfolios include death.

    Everyone dies eventually. And if you come up with a plan to make people live longer and have more children, that's more deaths. Sure they'll be later, but gods are old, and also patient.

    Also, plenty of adventurers do things like kill evil wizards that are killing people, and they don't have deities come stop them.

    > Step 5, spend all of eternity in super-hell as punishment and warning to others.

    See step 4.

    Could you link me to where Celestial patrons are explicitly stated to be evil? I mean, their spell list includes Cure Wounds, Leaser Restoration, Revivify, and Greater Restoration. Doesn’t seem very anti-life to me. By your logic, any time high-level warlocks try to defeat evil or save the world, they’ll be stopped by their patrons.

    And I should note that while some deities may be miffed, this plan doesn’t actually decrease the total death rate of Waterdeep. It just means that people die at older ages on average.
