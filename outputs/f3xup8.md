**Summary:** Red had always loved dragons. He wanted them. He dreamed of them. He desperately awaited the day he'd get a charmander, something that would one day reign as a mighty charizard. Unfortunately Red ends up with something quite different. Something cute. Something... cuddly. In a world where size is power and innocence is weakness, it will take all of Red's power to survive.

**Note 1:** This AU incorporates characters from the game-verse as well as the anime-verse

  Delia being a bad parent and knowing that she's a bad parent still makes a little uncomfortable, like I'm still not super sure that most bad parent's even have the self awareness to admit that they're not you know good at being a parent. But from what we see it makes a lot of sense of that she a young-ish woman, who is then a single mother who wants to do work that she's passionate and qualified for. It is a little selfish, but it's understandable that someone would do that. It probably doesn't excuse her failures but at least it acknowledges both that she had them and also that she's aware of them.

    >!You must realize, most 'bad parents' don't have a Kirlia shoving the memory and emotions of said neglected child into there head forcing them to view the incidents from the child's POV. Also, she was not trying to be a bad parent. Unlike some kids who would go ask for attention, we must remember that with Mia keeping him almost constantly happy, Delia (who was quite unexperienced) always thought her son was okay. This isn't justifying her actions, but at least it gives us an idea of why she behaved the way she did.!<

      Oh no I think how you portray it is completely reasonable, it's just the way that the portrayal shows her neglecting to care for her own son is what makes me uncomfortable. Like it's one thing to have a high fantasy problem, but the way that you're portraying it could easily be the way someone is currently experiencing it today. And that makes me uncomfortable, not at the way you're writing just in general.

  Why is "sweatdrop" being used as a verb so many places?
