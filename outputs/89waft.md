### Post:

He hasn't posted in months. Is there something I'm missing?

### Comments:

  ```
  He writes two stories. He writes an arc for one story then switches to the other I believe.
  ```

  - u/Draconomial:
    ```
    Whatâ€™s the other story?
    ```

    - u/LimeDog:

      But now that I'm digging into thing he hasn't posted an update on anything for months. His twitter seems to indicate he is in creative rut.
