## "Where, in short, are the flying cars? Where are the force fields, tractor beams, teleportation pods, antigravity sleds, tricorders, immortality drugs, colonies on Mars, and all the other technological wonders any child growing up in the mid-to-late twentieth century assumed would exist by now?"

  It bothers me that he keeps saying that "robot factories don't exist". They definitely do, and the vast majority of production is done by mechanical processes. Human labor makes up a relatively small fraction of production, and is only used in those cases where it's not cheaper to mechanize - which is rare. And this is about what you would expect, given a long tail distribution of work. We've got a saying in software development that the last 10% takes 90% of the work, and I have to imagine that's definitely true of mechanization as well.

  Much of the other stuff, like teleportation, force fields, teleportation, anti-gravity sleds, etc. will just never happen. The reason we got that stuff wrong is that people saw scientific advancements as being additive progress in blocks of equal size. The Less Wrong crowd will often argue that advancement is exponential - in that more and more of it is happening faster and faster - but I would actually that it's an S-curve. Initial advancements caused an acceleration, and then eventually you've done the majority of the work that you can do and you're left making incremental improvements. People might have looked from Newton to Einstein and saw these giant leaps in thinking, but it's really a matter of *refinement* rather than *revolution*.

  And then to decry computation as a basically worthless consolation prize is just so ... wrong that I barely know where to begin. Basically the only thing holding robotics back right now is computation, and if we could get our "mere simulation" of chemistry working correctly, we would be well on our way to all of the revolutions that genetics still promise. He talks about not having a cure for cancer, but that's the same misunderstanding of things that pervades the whole article - "cancer" is not just one thing, and a "cure" is not going to be some miracle. The truth is, unless the Singularity actually happens, curing cancer will be a matter of curing single instances of cancer one at a time, and increasing survivability, and getting faster treatment. You won't be able to say "We beat cancer", you'll instead say "Cancer is not as common or bad as it used to be". But you probably won't even say that, because people will take the cures for granted.

  A lot of this article bothered me.

    A lot of this article bothered me too, but there were some points that I think require some thought. The bureaucracy in research is one point that I think can really be improved on. My supervisor at uni spent 3 hours a week talking to his students, 1 hour in the lab during non-term times only, and the rest of his time writing grants, proposals, teaching, editing papers and other non-directly research related tasks. This extreme, but representative of the problems.

    A point I am less sure about is the general bureaucracy in life and the need to work. I don't know if our output is enough that most people shouldn't have to work, but I do sometimes wonder how much wealth is actually being created by all the people who sit at a computer all day. It may be that, yes the vast majority of people are actually contributing, but I can also imagine that if we could re-write the world we could remove a lot of jobs without any decline in output. Does anyone have any data/more knowledge (I'm just a student) on this?

    And in terms of space exploration, we really haven't been poring in the money that was being expended during the space race, and this has definitely slowed growth. There are many possible alternative methods to get to space, but none have really been explored past the design phase so we're still lighting various chemicals on fire.

  Starts out well, but it meanders a lot.  The author also constantly asserts facts saying that "I can't prove this, but it must be true that...."  That isn't a rational argument.

  I can't really say much about the research aspect of the paper - we don't know, after all, what would have happened had policy taken a different turn - but the analysis of liberalism as bureaucracy is pretty interesting.
