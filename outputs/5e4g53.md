## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I've been thinking a lot about counterfactuals lately, specifically applied to self-improvement.

  There seems to be a big difference between knowing what a specific good mental habit is and actually using it.

  [LessWrong link](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/o3j/mental_habits_are_procedural/)

  To that end, I'm trying to ask myself the important question of "How will I now act differently, given that I have this piece of advice?" or "Now that I have this collection of mental skills, what comes next for using them?

    When I was a teenager the solution seemed obvious, I could just decide to do things that way. It seemed simple enough for me, I saw it as a simple reprogramming of my thoughts, though that may have been because I'm autistic. However, I no longer think it's that simple. 

    I found myself unable to abandon my religious beliefs despite the logical arguments of atheists, discovered I didn't have any goals I was passionate about, and then I came down with depression that saps my motivation to self improve. Now I'm not sure what to do.

    Sometimes I wonder if being irrational is a psychologically healthy thing to do, that humans need at least some bias in order to function. Other times I question whether the ideal of rationality is impossible to achieve or if I just can't do it and don't know who to judge for being wrong.

      Try taking a more pragmatic approach here. Why is rationality important to you? What do you want to use rationality *for*? If you don't know what your main goals are, you could always donate 10% of your income to effective charities and to existential risk reduction efforts until you have figured out what you really want to do. No one is perfectly rational all the time. The important thing is that people are aware of their flaws and work to overcome them. There's always room to improve. If you're feeling depressed, you need to *see a therapist*. You also need to *go out and meet people and keep yourself occupied with other things besides your depression.* 

      Also, do you know why you haven't abandoned your religious beliefs? Are they still constraining your expectations, or are they serving some other function? And are there any healthier alternative methods you could use besides holding onto your religious beliefs? If letting go of your religious beliefs poses a serious threat to your mental health, then don't let go of them yet! Wait until you're mentally healthier and are in a fit state to think more clearly about such things. You could also try to let go of those beliefs very gradually and carefully, rather than trying to force it to happen all at once. In some ways religion is like a drug. If you're dependent on it and you suddenly stop taking it you'll go into withdrawal.

    In the link, the skills referred to as 'physical' are all ones where there's immediate positive feedback of failure.  You fail a magic trick, and the wrong card shows up.  You mess up playing an instrument, and you hear a grating screech or other undesired sound.  You mess up playing sports, and you lose the ball or whichever equivalent.

    With mental habits, there's often nothing to tell you if you messed up.  And when there is, it's rarely immediate.  If you try to build a mental habit of cleaning your room every week and you forget one week, you might notice during the next week, but it's not the same as immediately after forgetting to clean your room realizing like a kick to the gut that you forgot to clean your room.  With commitment, that kick in the gut can happen when a relevant topic crosses your mind, but there's no guarantee that you'll make that connection swiftly.

    Cleaning your room is a fairly easy example, though.  There are worse cases where there simply *isn't* a persisting reminder like the cleanliness of your room.  In those cases, all you have as a lifeline is the kicks in the gut that you give yourself when you realize you forgot.

    Just speculating now, I'm thinking that a way to improve on this problem would be to create persisting reminders for the mental habit.  Ideally, they'd trigger whenever the habit is relevant, but more important is that you don't get used to them. If you put an alarm on your computer or phone to regularly tell you to clean your room, it becomes incredibly easy to simply adopt a predefined set of actions that make the alarm stop and all the while not think about what it tells you.

  Presuming that the fermi-paradox wasn't a thing, and there were matroshka brains and the like around, what percentage of mass do you think would be "in use"?
  ```

  - u/gbear605:
    ```
    And if you think the answer to this is a substantial percent, isn't the anthropic principle an answer to the fermi paradox? We wouldn't be thinking about the fermi paradox if we were in one of those universes, and we wouldn't even exist in a large number of those universes.

      Also given intelligence explosions, it's likely that any civilization that much ahead of us will already be expanding to use all the resources in it's future light cone. So basically you might not expect to see any non-obvious signs of civilization in your past light cone.

  Can anyone going to a solstice event record it and post it online? I'd appreciate being able to see it, but I won't be able to make it there in person.

  I had an interesting exchange recently.

  After I took my date to a bus stop in the middle of night, I was walking home when I saw this group of four homeless-looking people who were behaving slightly aggressively. I walked past them, they started walking with me and a few of them shoot some questions at me. In particular, one of them who was slightly dark-skinned asked me "am I white or black?"

  I thought about this for a moment and decided that the best reply is "You're the same color as Obama."

  The slightly dark-skinned person joked and said something like "Yeah, my second cousin is Obama". Another person said "Fucking racist shit, let's beat him up". He sounded quite hesitant and there wasn't much conviction in his voice and everyone else ignored him and they went on their way.

  My interpretation of this was that they meant to ask a question that seemingly doesn't have any good answers from their perspective and then maybe harm me in some way if I do give a wrong answer?

  I think my answer was pretty good because a) it was true b) I was comparing him to a powerful high-status person, so it's quite hard to interpret it in a racist way.

  Of course it would have probably been safer to ignore them totally.

    They might have left you alone because your answer was funny and light-hearted. Or maybe you passed some sort of test, though you had no way of knowing which answer was correct.
    ```

    - u/Xenograteful:
      ```
      Yeah, and body language is important too. My main way of trying to avoid confrontation is keeping a calm demeanor without appearing weak either.
      ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    No, you took the correct route.  Really, any response that didn't reek of intimidation and "I am an easy mark" flags would have been correct.  Depending on the actual level of aggression/mental issues in that group, totally ignoring them may have been the least safe option.
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    >b) I was comparing him to a powerful high-status person, so it's quite hard to interpret it in a racist way.

    Hm. That's an interesting take on it: I would consider it MORE dangerous because Obama is such a socially charged figure that comparing someone to him can be a coin toss on whether the comparison is meant to be flattering or not.

    I imagine that's what the person who casually mentioned beating you up thought, but then, who knows? In any case, glad you're okay.

  What are some ideal ways of causing the spread and adoption of a counter-cultural meme within a 5-10 year timeframe? For instance, if you wanted to spread the idea in a military dictatorship that "the military should protect the people, not the leader", how would you go about doing that?

  I had a general question about genre identification, and was looking for more suggestions. Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask... I didn't feel this merited its own post.

  I've been enjoying the heck out of many of the recommendations here, and I've hit many of the popular ones (Worm, Time Braid, HPMOR, Shadows of the Limelight, Pokemon: The Origin of Species, etc...) but Mother of Learning especially has stuck out as a favorite. One recommendation I read about a few months back was A Practical Guide to Evil, and more recently, I heard about The Gods Are Bastards; I've voraciously devoured both series.

  But as I understand it, MoL is considered rational, but the other two are... not? Or at least, they have rational elements but are not as rational? If so... what genre do they fall into? And do people have more recommendations similar to those? 

  Thank you!

  If the EM drive really does work, what implications are there for our future light cone?
  ```

  - u/DataPacRat:
    ```
    > our future light cone

    Somewhat catastrophic in the near-mid term, as anyone who can shove an object into LEO could then accelerate it out into deep space and back at arbitrary velocities, allowing any group or individual with that level of tech to have access to a city-destroying WMD. If we can find a way to handle /that/, then astonishingly positive, as we would finally have a way to /access/ most of our future light cone.
