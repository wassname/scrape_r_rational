## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  On top of the mangadex issues, SB/SV are also down. If Reddit has an outage, I will officially have nothing to do (besides work) during the workday. Anyone got any good platform recommendations? Ideally something I can navigate on my smartphone, ideally something where the content isn't just brainless memes. (I have reddit for that.)

    Fanfiction sites? A few of the things I've read on SB/SV have copies of FF. Net and AO3 (or however you shorten them, I'm not too familiar). Some of the bigger works also have community discords.

  The Worm fanfiction [Camera Shy](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/camera-shy-worm-alt-power.685357/) is funny if you have read Worm. Taylor is blind but gains the ability to see from cameras and other people's eyes when they see her. She uses her jump scare superpower to horrify everyone.
  ```

  - u/Dufaer:
    ```
    I found this a slog to get through.

    The problem is that even once the narrative establishes how Taylor uses her power to move through an environment, it still insists on describing every little power use, movement and repositioning in excruciating detail, instead of letting the reader figure it out.

    It's like continuing to describe walking by listing individual muscle contractions, instead of abstracting and saying "OK, now you understand how the baby manages to walk. So what happens next is that it walks from *A* to *B* to *C*".
    ```

    - u/aponty:
      ```
      I strongly disagree that that's a slog, but my brain probably works a bit differently from yours.
      ```

      - u/gramineous:

        Fine for me, pretty solid and enjoyable read. I can understand why it wouldn't be for everyone though.

    So basically a combo of >!Kenzie!< and >!Mama Mathers’!< powers?

    (Minor Ward spoilers if at all, just mentions two characters’ powersets that are never much of a secret)
    ```

    - u/steelong:
      ```
      It's a bit more complicated and also involves teleportation/telekinesis.  That might sound overpowered, but there are limitations as well that keep it interesting.

      I also enjoyed it, but I'm not optimistic that the author will continue it for much longer.  I have been pleasantly surprised before, though.

        It's much more character arc and powers as trauma metaphors based. And it gets really weird towards the end. But all that said, I am still a big fan.

    I thought it was fun. Not rational(i.e. how does Taylor not notice that her power is literally >!horror movie logic!<) but clever and enjoyable nonthesame.
    ```

    - u/andor3333:
      ```
      Yeah i agree it isn’t particularly rational, though it has some clever moments about how she uses the power. I also agree with the guy who says it goes into a bit too much detail in some scenes. I just had to recommend it for the hilarious fight scene at the end of Act 1 and the fallout from that.

  Have you read something new recently about technological uplift / civilization building or something of that sort that's worth a suggestion?  

  I don't mind fanfics with the theme either, just need to scratch the itch.

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
    ```
    I just binged through [*Demesne*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne), and while it's not about civilization building per se (more like settlers/homesteading), it is pretty interesting.

    >Out on the frontier of a new continent, the wizard Lori and her group of settlers try to build a community for themselves in a land actively hostile to intelligent life. With their wits, their will, and their newly built Dungeon to protect them against the Iridescence, they should be fine. If they can survive the wild animal attacks. And the supply shortages. And other settlements poaching their people. And famine. And bandits... A slice-of-life fantasy story.
    ```

    - u/LaziIy:
      ```
      I actually had this on my plan to read, since someone had it as a unique take on Dungeons.   

      I'll take your recommendation for it and move it to the top of the pile
      ```

      - u/steelong:
        ```
        I also picked up Demesne based on recommendations here, and I am thoroughly enjoying it.  What we've seen of both the world and magic system are interesting and leave me wanting to know more.  The characters and perspectives are also fun.
        ```

    - u/Sinvin7:
      ```
      Does Lori ever have any meaningful character growth? I'm on chapter 13 and have yet to see any sign of improvement. As it is, reading it feels like a bit of a slog due to her constant attitude.

    *Mediterranean Hegemon of Ancient Greece* is a Chinese fic I've started reading recently about a Chinese guy that gets transmigrated into the body of a Greek mercenary right before the legendary *March of the Ten Thousand*. After that he goes on to found a kingdom and introduce modern tech, but I haven't gotten there yet. 

    I'm still in the early chapters so can't say how good it is, and the translation isn't great, but it's clear the author/SI is very knowledgeable about ancient greece. I'm particularly curious how the author is going to handle ancient greece's... "idiosyncratic" male sexuality, especially given china's censorship laws and antiquated social norms.

    - u/LaziIy:
      ```
      I'll check it out, thanks for the suggestion.
      ```

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
    ```
    [*Tales of the Reincarnated Lord*](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/tales-of-the-reincarnated-lord/) is the first thing that comes to mind. It a Chinese webnovel, but the translation is pretty good (some rough spots) and likes to poke fun of most tropes you see in other CN stories.

    *Sengoku Komachi Kurou Tan* (Chronicles of The Hardships of Komachi in The Sengoku Era) is a manga/LN that is about a girl who studies agriculture being transported back to Japan in the 1560s. I prefer the manga over the LN, since the way Japanese write (stylistically) doesn't really translate to English.
    ```

    - u/LaziIy:
      ```
      I've perused Tales of the Reincarnated Lord a while ago, so thanks for that. I will definitely check out this manga about the agriculture girl though. I find those to be pretty nice, think the last one I read in the similar vein was about a chef being sent back to the time of the shogunate.
      ```

      - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
        ```
        Nobunaga no Chef. The Japanese love Oda Nobunaga and the Sengoku era (both of which, to be fair, are really interesting and important).
        ```

        - u/LaziIy:
          ```
          Yeah that's the one, I see do see the genre being popular in LNs but rarely find ones translated well enough for me to enjoy.
          ```

- u/Weerdo5255:
  ```
  I'll start off with a new one, [Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song](https://myanimelist.net/anime/46095/) I have only seen the anime (2 episodes so far) so I can't speak to how well it maintains its tone if a Manga or LN exist for it. 

  Classic AI / Time Travel shenanigans, with the caveat that AI here are very utility function bound. They have a singular purpose, and fulfill it. So the AI sent back in time has the goal to (seemingly) stop AI development at all costs, while his accomplice is a Singer android. Her purpose is to sing and make people smile. 

  She eventually helps out of a want to continue singing, and making people smile, but not in an ignorant of the rest of the world kind of way.

  I'm enjoying it as so far the only main characters are AI, and they have sometimes opposing secondary goals / methods for approaching a problem due to their differing 'missions'. 

  The animation is good as well, I'm going to keep watching.

  [Apocalypse: Fairy System](https://www.amazon.com/Apocalypse-Fairy-System-Systems-Book-ebook/dp/B091CX1T54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) is out. This is the sequel to Apocalypse: Generic System, a decent litRPG that I thought was reasonably intelligent. In this one the main character has been kicked out of the main RPG system, and is sort of poking around in the guts of the system without actually using it directly—he now gains power through dealmaking, a la the fey. I enjoyed it, sometimes I had questions about the worldbuilding, but it's so much better than most worldbuilding in this genre I had few complaints. Barring WTC, this series is probably about the best the litRPG genre has to offer, which, unfortunately, is saying fairly little.
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I liked it but not as much as the first book, mostly because of my own hangups though. I keep noticing that the author writes everyone... distantly. We see moments of weakness and vulnerability from characters but they are brushed off and then a punchline for a joke happens, or something. Like yeah, I get it, it's not a serious story, but these vulnerable moments really help elevate the story. By the end of the book, it's like I know Jeb, but I don't really *know* him you know?

    Anyway, a solid 8/10 book. I don't think it's the best litrpg has to offer, but it's probably the best rational litrpg out there other than WtC.
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      I think it's good writing for a litRPG, and the author gets some things about human nature, economics, and the mechanics of leverage and bargaining pretty well. But it's not good writing, period, if that makes sense. I think the fast pace the author seeks is counter to the character moments.

      Any litRPG recommendations, then? Most I've read are pretty bad, and I'm down to slum it, so that kind of says something.
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        My opinions run pretty counter to this community lol. My current favorite litrpg is Ar'kendrithyst. It's not great at first, but 130 chapters in I'd call it some of the best that litrpg has to offer. As always, ymmv. 

        I hear good things about continue online, which is supposed to be more character study than litrpg adventure. I started it a long while back but didn't continue being chapter 10 for whatever reason, maybe I'll give it a try again. It's done too. 

        Of these, I don't think either have good writing, compared to the standard that you'd find in good published fantasy. But Ar'kendrithyst does get close at times after the author solidifies his style.
        ```

        - u/Amonwilde:
          ```
          I'm one of those who just can't deal with the early chapters, they're almost offensively nonsensical. I've tried a couple times now. Think it might just be a write-off.
          ```

          - u/CaramilkThief:
            ```
            Yeah I've seen a lot of people say that. Personally I don't really care about rationality if the characters and world are interesting enough, and Ar'Kendrythist did that for me. What did you find offensively nonsensical about it?
            ```

            - u/Amonwilde:
              ```
              Sorry, think I was confusing it with another story. Maybe I'll give it another whirl sometime, I did look at it, but it wasn't as objectionable as the one I was thinking of. Though someone wanting to be in the CIA seems pretty alien to me, though clearly some people must want to.
              ```

              - u/CaramilkThief:
                ```
                It's also pretty much never talked about again outside of chapter 1. It is a bit strange though, I went on the CIA website and they have a step by step guide for university intern applicants.

          I listed it as a suggestion in the recommendation thread a few weeks ago, and I keep going back and forth on it. I really enjoyed it for the first few dozen chapters, then it felt like a repetitive slog to the point where I almost was going to write a follow-up recommending *against* reading it, but then after 100 chapters the main plot finally started moving forward again and it got me hooked. Now up to about chapter 117 and I'm still really invested in it. 

          I've had such whiplash from this novel, haha.
          ```

          - u/CaramilkThief:
            ```
            Which part did you find to be a repetitive slog? When I started reading it I had a lukewarm opinion until book 1 ending. From then it has been a steady increase in quality to what it is now. Chapter 120 is one of my favorite chapters from a fic on RR. I did find some of the Daydropper arc a bit of a slog but looking back it was more because I was expecting Ar'Kendrythist to be an action novel instead of a slice of life with moments of action.
            ```

            - u/AurelianoTampa:
              ```
              >Which part did you find to be a repetitive slog?

              I felt like a good 60+ chapters of the book was a repetition of "a new character asks for Erick's help, he immediately runs to assist in a new location, develops a new magic to solve the issue, gets a power up, and then never uses his new magic again and the new characters only get mentioned from time to time." Rinse and repeat. There are some breaks, like the Jane PoV chapters, but generally speaking it feels like Erick gets pulled into a new direction every time the author has something else he wants to focus on. 

              How about a dozen chapters on growing citrus trees and chocolate? Dragons keep getting mentioned; let's have some chapters about dragon essence! We've mentioned other countries and cities - let's have some arcs where Erick or Jane go visit Oceanside or hunt unicorns so we can show other places off! How about a town management section?

              Now, don't get me wrong, the world building and exploration of the magic system are some of the strongest points of the novel. But it feels like Marty Stu Erick  is constantly getting pulled into B plots that leave a lot of the interesting plot hooks and characters to languish. I liked his growing relationship with Al, but then he hardly gets a mention for dozens of chapters. I wanted to explore more of Ar'Kendrithyst (the city itself), but it took the story almost 100 chapters to finally get back around to it. The most recent arc puts Erick solo, meaning no mention of Poi or Teresa or Kiri or Jane or any of the characters we've grown to care about. Meanwhile at the Feast, we get introduced to dozens of new characters, many of who only show up once or twice while Erick continues learning new magic at a rate that baffles the best practitioners in the world; his Marty Stu status grows and grows. 

              I guess it feels like ADHD (which I have). The author gets an idea in his head and HAS to focus on it, dropping everything else to do so. The pacing gets really messed up, and while the topics the author focuses on are *usually* interesting, I don't find them interesting enough to justify dropping the other interesting things that had been brought up long, long before. Erick's been made into the vehicle the author uses to explore all the parts of his fantasy world, but I want to know Erick's story, not go off on a tangent quest about a crime syndicate that puts bombs in children who are part of a society I didn't even know existed until over 100 chapters into the novel.

    ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    I read it while it was coming out, it's great for what it is. I had never seen the covers though, and I have to say, they are very bad. Cringeworthy really..
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Well, I'm not disagreeing buuutt... covers are like really, *really* important and these clearly work well despite the cringe. Arguably, covers are more important than even the book's synopsis. This is because, particularly in the kindle/ebook environment, competition is fierce and you need to convince a scrolling potential reader to click on your book instead of all the other books they're presented with. There are two, dead-simple strategies to do so:

       - **People like people, especially faces.** Our meat-brains are evolutionarily programmed to respond strongly to other people, and in particular, faces and their emotions. This is why so many youtubers put big, emotive, faces in their thumbnails--it draws clicks.

       - **Sex sells.** It sounds a bit eugh but just like people like faces, people like looking at attractive people. Putting scantly clad women and eight-pack adorned men on covers often comes across as tasteless, but it works, time and time again. More specifically, it attracts more readers than it turns away, so it works.
      ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      The art for the covers are pretty good honestly, at least in high resolution. It's just that the graphic design isn't all that good.

  I've been enjoying the heck out of [Demesne](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne), a dungeon/city-builder with a highly rational, if misanthropic, protagonist. The setting is well-conceived, and the main character has her share of flaws, yet shows a great deal of competence. The author frequently displays a marvelously dry wit. At times, it is even apparent to the reader that the protagonist is being hoodwinked, arguably for her own good.

    Virtuous Sons has been highly enjoyable.

    It's a cultivation novel set in ancient Greece and it's done very well. The characters are believable and behave rationally, imo. Does not read like a typical eastern cultivation novel. The prologue (over 20 chapters long) is just finished today so now is a good time to start!

      I finally got around to reading this, and it's really very good. The prose is a breath of fresh air, in that it's actually *good* (unlike the majority of cultivation and LitRPG, garbage), and also without the typical hyperanalytical and "modern" feel you usually see on r/rational.

      "Cultivation novel set in ancient Greece" is also an understatement, because the plot is really, *really* interesting in its own right, and the character dynamics are brilliant, enough to hold up the entire story alone. There's a lot of depth and imagination put into it.

  I'll preface all this by saying that the first several floors of the Dungeon Crawler Carl novel on RoyalRoad have been removed from the site since the author published them on Kindle, so you have to buy the released volumes or through... other means if you want the whole story. I do think it's very worth it though. Also sorry for the upcoming wall of text, it's a bad habit of mine.

  I've been catching up with the RoyalRoad novel, Dungeon Crawler Carl, and I've been really surprised by it. It does some unique things I think no other series does. It leans into over the top, absurd, bizarre, and quirky humor, but unlike other series where it's always cringe or overstays its welcome or doesn't mesh with the plot, DCC avoids all of these issues.

  It's a series about humanity pretty much being instantly destroyed because of a contract or debt that just expired or such after starting in like ancient times, and the survivors are forced into a massive Dungeon and fight through the levels to serve as amusement for the rest of the universe. All the while the Dungeon and monsters and levels all "use" human culture, or whatever bastardized version the aliens see it as. There's also programs about human culture aired to the universe as well, all mostly very misrepresentative and derogatory towards humanity. 

  The Dungeon and crawl has ridiculous lootboxes, stupid achievement names, ridiculous items and equipment, monsters ranging from drug dealing llamas to KraKarens to a giant rolling ball made out of a bunch of noble(actual nobility) orcs all in one massive orgy all wearing BDSM gear to a feral duck that has an aura that nullifies all magic, special effects, and equipment buffs, while also being completely immune to physical damage, and so on. There's a sand mage weeb who wants to turn his sex doll to a real human and accidentally unleashes an evil god, and other completely nonsensical things. There's a town inhabited by camel beings in the current level, and it's called Hump Town. Of course, it's only business is prostitution, which is run by changelings.

  The thing though, I think this all *works*. It's completely ridiculous, yes, but I never find it too overbearing or awkward or stale, even though I was not at all a fan of other comedy-oriented popular novels on RoyalRoad like Vanquier the Dragon, which has a lot of the problems I mentioned at the beginning.

  This humor actually works really well with the story as well. The remnants of humanity go through this cruel entertainment for the rest of the universe, on top of the dead corpse of humanity which is being paraded around by them. The bizarreness of the ridiculous stuff, like tiny flesh eating weasels being shot out tubes, really clashes with how dark and fucked it is, like when said tiny flesh eating weasels enter a person and eat them from the inside out.

  And the MC and his plans and the combat is actually pretty competent. The gimmick of the Dungeon Crawl season the MC is part of has the gimmick of infinite storage, and he really abuses it. I'm never left annoyed or unsatisfied watching him trying to progress, as he's simultaneously careful, but is still great in chaotic scenarios where things go wrong(and as you can imagine, things always go wrong in this fucked in situation). His main motivation and focus is on "They will not break me," and vows to return it to the bastards that destroyed and desecrated humanity and its grave, which I feel was well done too.

  I'm honestly surprised at how well DCC mixes bizarre humor, a serious and dark plot, and competent action and game-like abilities. 

  A recent arc highlights this blend that I think is really done well. A sponsor gifts one of the main characters, a talking cat, a robot toy version of herself, which quotes her, but is also pretty crappy so it mixes in Garfield quotes. But, instead of Garfield quotes, it says I'mSorryJon sort of things. It's also crappily made and explodes easily, as said cat's dinosaur pet shows several times. This is basically a joke whenever a newer model shows up and inevitably explodes, but it plays into the plot later on as well, in a beautiful way.

  The MC decides to take his first step, and begins setting up the pieces and steps. When he makes a smoke curtain and it "accidentally" gets used right on top of him and the robot cat, it turns its head around to stare perfectly at the MC through all the smoke and says a fitting ominous line. When he's about to show up for an important interview and ad filming, the robot cat turns around to them and tells them something along the line of "death comes for us all".

  [These little excerpts](https://imgur.com/a/3dlCVQe) were honestly surprising and touching, especially with how it interweaves the previously over the top ridiculous humor into a serious plot moment. Anybody else feel similarly on this novel?

  The series is nothing mindblowing like Worm or Mother of Learning, but I do greatly enjoy it for using all these elements and making it actually work, especially with me hating over the top comedy novels. I've been wanting to talk about DCC for months but just couldn't find the time or the words for it. I'd even put this above Super Minion and on the same tier as the likes of Journey of Black and Red for how good and unique it is.

    I liked your wall of text.

    I think the story works because it balances two layers, a serious layer in which Carl has to think strategically and wrestle with the ongoing tragedy as an existential issue, and the layer of the farce, which is only mildly entertaining in itself, but which is aesthetically self-consistent and provides a lot of grist for the strategic layer. Dumb jokes can be introduced as jokes, and they flesh out the motivations of the organizers, the AI, the political factions, and so on, but they also are details that a shrewd Carl can take advantage of, or which provide clues to the current scenario. The book also does a (really) good job at foreshadowing, where threats are telegraphed and then come to fruition at appropriate times. It doesn't usually feel as if the author is just making things up in the moment. I also like how Carl is always on the hunt for new strategic options, he never breaks the system completely open, which always winds up being unsatisfying except in a denoument, but scrounges up enough new options to move forward.

    Maybe everyone on this sub secretly likes this story and just never talks about it, but unless that's true, DCC seems like by far the highest quality to lowest coverage on this sub of any other story I've come across. It's really really great and it hardly every comes up on this sub.  

    Maybe because it's so unique that it doesn't really fit into anyone's requests for specific genre/story type recommendations? I dunno but more people should read it. I started it after the first book was only out on Amazon and I did not regret buying it even a little bit. 

    However, for folks on the fence, the Amazon "try a few chapters free" is probably enough to get a sense of the story and whether or not you will like it.

      Definitely the case for me. It's not even a secret, it just feels so well-known despite little coverage that I didn't see the point in making a rec. It's on the second page of best-rated RR works, so anyone with even a tiny inclination towards LitRPGs has probably read it already—at least, that was my reasoning for not talking about it.

      But I'm going to second the rec now. It's the best LitRPG I've ever read precisely because it's popcorn-y as heck, in a good way. It's very, *very* engagingly written.

    I absolutely loved this part; definitely did a "fuck yeah" fist pump in the air when I read it. The author did a great job with this entire plot line. 

    My only complaint about the series is that I caught up to it a little while back and now need to wait. I binged both of the first two books (which I got access to using Kindle Unlimited's free trial) within a few days.

  - u/TheAnt88:
    ```
    I really enjoy the series as well. It reminds me of the best portions of Gantz where the action is great, its darkly funny, but at the same time its also grotesque and horrifying at the same time. Every level more of humanity is killed, the jokes are being perpetuated with genocide in the background, and its obvious that the main character has gone more than a little crazy from his experiences.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I honestly like this more than Mother of Learning, which was good sure but some moments in this story are just poignant. This story does emotional beats well.

    Carl's background is sometimes a bit too tragic for my suspension of disbelief, but the way the author ties in his childhood trauma with story moments and later on Carl slowly moving forward is touching. Even Carl's mantra of "They will not break me. They will never break me. I will break them." never feels grating or undeserved. 

    The closest thing I can compare it to is Patriot the TV show. That mix of tragic and tragically hilarious.

  I just re-watched the movie "Arrival" and it made me think... the movie's main plot point is that the heptapods help humanity because they have foreseen that they will need humanity's help 3000 years in the future. Has anyone written a fanfiction about what *that* will be? Because it sounds like a pretty amazing subject.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Technically humans already helped them, the heptapods are simply closing the loop. It's not that they can see the future, it's that time isn't experienced linearly for them, right?

    That said, I'd be interested in a story about that too. Have you read the short story it's based on?
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      I have read it; if I don’t remember wrong, the main difference with the movie is that there’s no drama with China almost blowing the aliens up. 

      And sure, for the heptapods, the humans helping is a foregone conclusion, they’re just closing the loop. Still, how does the capacity to see the future affect human society through 3000 years? And what do humans learn to do in 3000 years that the heptapods can’t?
      ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        I'd say the main difference is the book concludes the opposite wrt free will.

        Her daughter dies from a preventable accident rather than a congenial disease being the most obvious indication of that
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

          ```

          - u/dysfunctionz:
            ```
            It changes things because in the story there’s no communication of information from the future to the past (which in the movie allows her to stop the attack and would’ve allowed her to prevent her daughter’s accidental death in the story if it worked the same way), the heptapod language just changes her subjective experience of time.
            ```

          - u/RMcD94:
            ```
            Because it demonstrates that there is no free will

            Even though all she has to do to keep her daughter alive is make her not cross the road or w/e she still "chooses" to make the same decisions that mean her daughter dies

            Because she cannot choose otherwise,

            With the illness she's just making a choice that having a daughter who dies is better than having no daughter. Not the same as letting her daughter get hit by a car for no reason
            ```

            - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
              ```
              I think the idea that there’s no free will - at least not in the classic, “sequential” sense - still comes out. In general it’s very clear that what she sees *must happen*, which is how she sees it. So, no free will, her decisions come from a bootstrap paradox.

  Any recommendations for dystopian sci-fi? I don't really read much sci-fi, but the small selection that I have read mostly makes it seem relatively 'normal' levels of dystopian (just on a larger scale) or borderline utopian.  
  I guess I'm kinda looking for space + aliens + cyberpunk.  
  [Quod Elim Erat](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15449/quod-olim-erat/) (scifi, following AI main character) has some dystopian elements. >!Messing with ship's minds/memories; government spying, etc.!<.  
  [Transcendent Humanity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity) is very much more on the utopian side, so not really what I'm looking for. I did enjoy it, but felt it could have been padded out a good bit more.

    How about [The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/), in which humanity is a newly subjugated race under a multispecies empire in the style of Halo's Covenant?

    The protagonists are human conscripts sent ahead of the more "civilized" alien species on a mission to explore a suspiciously derelict capital ship.

    For physical books, I'd recommend Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space. It's got the grim/grimy/corporate space future setting, and the central mystery revolves around artifacts left by inscrutable aliens. Very aesthetic and a good plot. I've got the second book in that setting sitting around somewhere and I really need to get to reading it.

    Which counts for shit since he doesn't try to improve himself and keeps holding the idiot ball. Admittedly, some of his plans fail hilariously >!(forgets to pose outside hero tower during time-stop run lol)!< and I could rationalize it as a normal man having his nerves fritz in high-intensity situations but there is a limit to how many times I can do it before it breaks my suspension of disbelief. 

    Hell, his whole reason for not sitting one loop out and watching the aftermath (who knows, maybe the perpetrator will out themselves) rather than running idiotically into the fray loop after loop when the bombs can kill even the top heroes is because it's morally his duty to save everyone. (MC doesn't like how he might be killing people with his inaction even if his ability might not spawn new universes where the people are dead.) Now I agree with the duty part but to pursue it so badly despite knowing he might be dooming millions of people each run tells me it's nothing more than a feel-good reason: Oh praise me because I'm trying to save the world. We don't even conclusively know if the bombing is happening only in his city or throughout the world! 

    The whole 'you should sit out this run and try to gather more information to formulate a better plan because the fewer loops it takes you to solve the mystery, the fewer people die and you can be morally satisfied that you helped save more people' was discussed in one chapter and the very next chapter MC ditched it. God. I dropped it then.

      Just gonna note that this is re-visited later and the MC actually *does* end up doing it and agreeing that it's the right thing to do. Mostly against his will, initially, but still. I'm just counting it as a character flaw. It's made pretty clear in-story that his position is pretty much wrong, IMO.

      I completely understand anyone dropping the story due to the MC's bone-headedness, though.

  Light novel, anyone?

  - u/TheTruthVeritas:
    ```
    My personal favorite is the series “So I’m a Spider, So What?” It’s an isekai featuring a high school girl reincarnating into a spider in a fantasy world. Her classmates were also reincarnated, but that’s reaching into the overarching plot. It’s my favorite isekai and litrpg, and I love the author’s take on it. Some people in previous weeks had some problems with it, but for a light novel series, the author does some truly exceptional things.

    You should know how lazy isekais and litrpgs are in lightnovels and animes, it's always the same template worlds and plotlines, the same tropes and cardboard cutouts, the same lazily implemented game mechanics to be cool. I really love how Spider approaches all this by actually making an isekai where the elements really matter. Where it's important that there's always a Hero and a Demon Lord, both recognized by the System, clashing. Why there's a game system, why this typical isekai element exists, and so on. In one moment when the MC gets a notification that an Administrator makes a skill just for her, she realizes how strange it is that there even is a game system in the world, and that there's apparently at least someone managing it, and watching it, and realizes that such a being would basically be a god. The human reincarnations also wonder why all the skills are explicitly used for war and combat. The reincarnations actually realize how strange and unnatural all this is, instead of just taking it for granted like basically every other series.

    The System and game-like elements are done fantastically. I suppose there might be some gripes or issues people may have with it, but I honestly think there are no plotholes regarding it. The battles are clever, and everything from the beginning to the end, powerscaling, and the power of other characters is well-defined and explained. There's no stupid things like "MC uses the System the Gods invented to kill said Gods" like you might typically see. It also relates heavily to the overarching plot and story, and I love how it's used to play into the mysteries and unraveling the truth. The System and game mechanics are done a lot better than most of the popular RoyalRoad litrpgs even imo(well of course excluding Delve's System).

    I like how the MC is written as well, she's really one of the main things selling the series. She's your typical antisocial high school gamer, and gets reincarnated in terrible conditions. Her narration and personality are fantastic and full of life, and really works well with how light novels are typically written. If I talk about what I like about her, I'd spend several paragraphs, so I'll just say there's a good reason why fans all love her so much.

    There's so much more I could say about this series, but I'll end off with a passage from an interview with the author about an "interesting" decision he made with a certain early-game opponent:

    Editor: Speaking of which, how come the Araba fight ended like that? In many "rising to the top”-type stories the protagonist feels good after they gathered enough power to defeat the final boss, but the Araba fight was nothing like that.

    [Baba: I wanted to embed the message that "winning is different from victory”

    Editor: Different from victory, you say?

    Baba: Winning against Araba was fully Kumoko’s personal feeling, while Araba didn’t have any self-interest in that battle. Kumoko was able to overcome her trauma by defeating Araba, but I thought about what that victory meant if I looked at it from bird’s-eye view. And so I had the unease that, if she was able to defeat and overcome her trauma known as Araba, then it means that Araba was nothing more than a hurdle with the sole purpose of making Kumoko satisfied? I thought no, Araba should have his own way of life. So I didn’t use him as a hurdle and tool to make Kumoko feel good.

    Editor: Looking at it now, that might have been unsatisfactory if she had won there normally.

    Baba: I also wanted to make it into a "meaningful battle” for Kumoko, so she would live on in the from then on precisely because of her battle with Araba. I thought that after leaving the labyrinth and fighting various powerful enemies, the existence of Araba would get blurry with time. Her battle with Araba turned Kumoko into who she is today. His warrior-like way of life definitely influenced Kumoko’s way of thinking, and I think that’s the reason Araba turned into such a memorable character.]

    And this opponent is a Dragon who never says a single word throughout the series.

    There's an anime of it currently airing too! It has some...issues, but most fans are happy with it, and I will also add that it leaves out a lot of the details and explanations that elevate this series to the next level in terms of concept.

    One last thing that really sells the novels are the [gorgeous illustrations](https://imgur.com/a/K816Tq1) by Tsukasa Kiryu. They're phenomenal, in each and every volume.
    ```

  - u/Darkpiplumon:
    ```
    My personal favorites are Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria (also known as HakoMari) and Overlord. 



    Overlord has an anime and is more well known, in it the MC is isekaid to a fantasy world with the same mechanics and servants of a MMO he used to play with his friends. Very OP MC and very dark, though it may not look like it at the beginning. You may like it if you liked the misunderstandings of Tanya the Evil and aren't completely oversaturated with OP main characters. Rich and interesting world, often more detailed than the protagonists. 



    HakoMari has seven or so volumes, and each one of them has a "theme" or "game". The first volume has time shenanigans going on, and it's not told in a chronological order. Can also get pretty fucking dark, though your millage may vary. If I had to describe it in a sentence, it's kinda like a mix between oregairu and a misery murder? 

    Really really good, not sure if the english translation is up to standards. The first volume was probably my favourite, so if you end up not disliking it not sure if it's your type.

    Each volume deals with a specific situation that can be solved and thought by the reader, with a main group of characters, each of them with defined but changing goals and personalities to which shit happens. 

    For another type of overview, a being is making people's wishes reality, and this is a very bad thing. 



    Also often recommended is Spice and Wolf, which is a ... economic slice of life romance? Something like that, haven't read it.

      I've had discussions and put forward recommendations myself in previous weeks for Overlord, I might find one of the detailed ones and edit a link in here later once I'm at my computer, bht it's important to point out that the author of Overlord is definitely weird.

      I mean volume 4 is about the main character taking over a series of Lizardma tribes that are dramatically weaker, basically as a test run to make sure everything is working right. It's a stepping stone the average novel author would spend maybe 5 chapters at most on, and instead Maruyama writes a whole novel on it. And ~90% of it from Lizardman's perspective. So there's definitely a weird take on worldbuilding and character perspectives across the novel, and temporary viewpoint shifts, or ones that last the majority of a novel or two, regularly happen. Also Neia is the protagonist of novels 12 and 13 and she is definitely Best Girl imo, so yes, the perspectives and characters are capable of being very engaging.
      ```

      - u/lillarty:
        ```
        It's probably useful to know that Maruyama is largely just adapting old D&D campaigns him and his friends had, then stretching them to make them fit the Overlord setting. I still find the series enjoyable, but it's definitely helpful to understand why he dedicated entire volumes of the series to plots that don't particularly advance the story of Overlord.

    * Prince of Nothing trilogy - Not so much the main overarching antagonists(who are definitely just plain evil), but just about everyone else. The sequel trilogy is even more grey on grey.
    * Ash and Sand trilogy - In the first few pages the protagonist eats another guy. That sets the tone for his story pretty well, but the other protagonists are pretty different.
