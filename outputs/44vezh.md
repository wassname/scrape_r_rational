## [RT][DC][WIP] Oh My Generic Monster Girls: Semi Monthly Update.

### Post:

Okay, moving takes a long time.

It should not take this long between updates in the future, life is finally settling down.

This is a deconstruction of a few different internet culture things, You can find it compactly mirrored and easy to read all in one go [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/oh-my-generic-monster-girls-space-battle-forums-edition.366441/) and you can read latest and greatest either at the end of that thread or [here](http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My%21-Generic-Monster-Girls%21-Wee-aboo-Intensifies&p=7892521&viewfull=1#post7892521).

Things hopefully should get moving at a better pace from now on. Critique, hate, love or random voting is appreciated.
