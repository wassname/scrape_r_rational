    This may be a dumb question, but how do quests work? I see a lot of them on SV/SB but I've never read one. Specifically, do I need to read the comments to understand what's going on? I usually just compile all the threadmarked posts into an ebook when I'm reading something on those forums, would that work for a quest?

      If you want only the canonical parts (and, like, one silly post each by u/eaglejarl and u/Velorien), do what u/faflec says and go to the Story Only thread. If you want all the fan-works to be included, pull all the threadmarked posts.

      E: Also, to answer your first question, quests work by all the thread participants voting on what are essentially writing prompts for the author. In this case, the players all vote on plans for Hazou to try to follow. There are tens of thousands of this point, so I would not recommend trying to read all of them if you value your sanity. My suggestion would be to read through all the threadmarks in Reader Mode, then follow the comments for a couple days to get a better handle on thread memes / culture / norms.
