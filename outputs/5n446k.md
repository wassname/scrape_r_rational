  Hmm... magic as a subsitution for black gold eh... i like the take on that however magic seems to be infinite resource unlike oil which have a finite amount. The trend might have a larger difference frm our petroleum based economy.

    It might not be infinite though. A while back they found a letter from someone in an old civilization, they talked about running out of magic. I don't think we know if that was a man-made phenomenon or something natural.
