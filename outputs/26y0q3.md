  Oh god yes this is good write more, this is the best, Lex's justifications for doing what he does are in villain character, which is great because he isn't presented as a villain that does harmless crimes.

  I'm enjoying reading it, as I did your previous fics; you're a good writer.

  Now that I think about it, don't Superman's language skills suggest some tantalizing hints to what's really going on, that Lex could pick up on?

  Consider two facts: 1) Superman claims he only arrived two weeks before his initial appearance and 2) He spoke perfect English at his initial appearance, but no other language.

  If Superman was able to obtain idiomatically perfect of a language in just a couple weeks, why hasn't he learned any other languages? And if it takes him a more human amount of time to learn, that suggests he's been here for longer than he claims...

  I think "Superman didn't speak English" should be "Superman didn't speak languages other than English". "I've looking out over the city" should be "I'm looking out over the city." I also think there's something wrong with "he'd it off."

  I don't get his reasoning about the existential risk superman poses. Surely antagonizing him would only increase the risk.

    Some of this is answered in the chapter I just posted a couple minutes ago, while more of it will be answered in the chapter that goes up next week. Looking back, I maybe should have put more of it into this chapter, but I wanted it for the chapter six.
