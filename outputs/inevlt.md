  I love this story. With that being said, I think this is actually not a great demonstration of the Anthropic Principle, or at least it was an improper way for the Hero to approach it.

  The hero has been summoned to a desperate land, which has been assaulted by the Dust countless times, and each time survived due to a sliver of luck. Early on, the viewpoint character states, “The Dust is terrible and our world should long since have ended. We are not fools enough to believe we could be lucky so many times by chance alone.”

  But it turns out that this actually *is* the correct conclusion, or at least that’s what the hero believes at the end. He thinks that the Anthropic Principle is the real ‘cause’ behind the Counter-Force; that the world has only survived so many times because otherwise he wouldn’t have needed to be summoned in the first place. He could not be summoned in a world in which the Dust had been victorious, or in a world in which the Dust had been defeated once and for all; so of course the Counter-Force isn’t real—it’s just the Anthropic Principle at work.

  This is a bad assumption. All things being equal, a hero who is summoned to assist a world in need should expect to find themselves in an average world—one in which there had been only one or two conflicts with the Dust. For the world to come to the absolute brink of destruction, over and over again, countless times (there are 37 heroes who say something similar to what this hero says immediately upon being summoned, so I think it’s safe to say that we’re talking at least triple digits) is so spectacularly unlikely that this is clearly *not* an average world. It is so extremely unlikely that the existence of a Counter-Force being real is something that the hero should genuinely consider as being possible. That he does not do so, and instead immediately goes to the Anthropic Principle as a solution, is in my opinion a poor evaluation of evidence.

    He also discounts other incredibly more likely possibilities, like “I’m being lied to” or “They’re being lied to” or “someone is playing both sides.” The anthropic principle isn’t a genuinely strong tool but he takes it as certain far too quickly.

      Or they are in a simulation run by the narrative. One clue is the fact that it's hard to science this world. Maybe they don't bother to simulate atoms.

        Personally, if I got summoned to a world that lined up perfectly with the narrative beats of a story I was familiar with (in this case, *The Lord of the Rings*), I would start from the presumption that either I was not being given a true history (either from deliberate lies, or a mythologizing of history), and then, if I could rule that out, that I was in a world where an Author was manipulating events for maximum dramatic effect.

        "Wait, the resolution to that story was pretty much an incarnation of the moral, 'Oft evil will shall evil mar?'  I am going to need to look at your previous heroes' tales to see if each had a coherent thematic throughline, because real life shouldn't."

        The good news, if an Author is playing for drama, is that the world should never lose one of these conflicts (although in a world running on narrative logic, that should of course never be stated aloud).  The bad news is that these catastrophes are bound to go on, regardless of the hero's efforts, for as long as it amuses the Author.

          I think we can safely assume that's a little in-joke and we're supposed to assume the hero is from the entirely-like-our-world-except-there's-no-LOTR world. Just like Brad Pitt always acts in movies set in a very realistic world in which however no one looks at him and goes "hey, you look EXACTLY like Brad Pitt!".
          ```

          - u/Nimelennar:
            ```
            Even if I'm unfamiliar with a *particular* narrative, the structure of a modern Western narrative is pretty unmistakable, and the following selection hints pretty heavily towards that kind of structure:

            >The boy whose dusty heirloom sword proves to be magical. The peasant girl who finds herself the heir to a great kingdom. Those who discover, in time of sudden stress, an untrained wild magic within themselves. Success born not of learning, not of skill, not of determination, but unplanned coincidence and fortunes of birth...

            ... That sounds a lot like the beginning of most stories based around a Hero's Journey structure.  There's really no good reason that a hero should typically come up from nowhere to save the world, *except* that it provides a chance for exposition (in the form of the reader learning the rules of the world along with the protagonist), and for a character arc.

            When you think of actual people who are in a place to do heroic or otherwise notable things, they usually aren't people who were recently raised up from nothing, or recently gained incredible gifts, they're people who were in the right place at the right time to do something incredible simply because their job is to be in that place most of the time: think firefighters, rushing into dangerous situations, or scientists, working hard on vaccines or treatments that either aren't needed until they are, or are proven unsafe or ineffective until they find one that isn't.

            If I were in a world in which the path to defeating a foe always, coincidentally, seemed to route through the path of maximum dramatic tension, I would, again, either be suspicious that someone is telling me a mythologized, misunderstood, or outright false version of events, or that the world is somehow under the influence of someone who wants the story of that world to be as compelling when re-told as possible.

          I'd just go grab a ship and see if I could find Cat, since we're clearly in A Practical Guide to Evil at that point.

          You're assuming that the written history is always going to be objective and true; that's not the case even in reality. Too easy for the historian to interpret history in their own lens.

            I am?

            Funny, I remember saying something to the effect of:

            >I would start from the presumption that either I was not being given a true history (either from deliberate lies, or a mythologizing of history)
            ```

            - u/fljared:

              Yes, but if you're looking for specifically things put there by out-of-universe authorial intent, you're very likely to find in-universe authorial intent by writers convinced of, e.g., the world-spirit balancing events around the 8 elements of mankind, or something else that isn't true. There's only one author creating all of reality, and dozens to hundreds of historians writing the diegetic history you'll be reading. Any apparent themes are more likely to be coming from the latter than the former.

      "Someone is playing both sides" was my first thought. Or even just that the Counter-Force only was engaging in a game with the Dust - a game with *rules*, not an endless war without quarter.
      ```

  - u/Areign:
    ```
    This was my thought when I read it a while ago too. Of all the worlds with probability mass that summon him, the one he ends up in is hugely unlikely if there is no actual counterforce.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      You're both missing the fact that there are an infinite number of heroes, and someone has to end up in the long tail.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        No. A world that gets anything close to an infinite number of heroes is very unlikely if there isn't something else that balances Hero vs Dust outcomes to be indecisive. So yes, in theory he could be in a world where Dust will at some point overcome it's handicap and should this give it his all, but to think that there is nothing like a Counter-Force is not supported by the evidence.
        ```

        - u/ArgentStonecutter:
          ```
          I don’t think you understand what I wrote or the Anthropic Principle or Quantum Immortality. There are infinitely many worlds, at all times, and infinitely many surviving worlds with infinitely many almost certainly doomed heroes and infinitely many lucky survivors.
          ```

          - u/Slinkinator:
            ```
            Yeah, that's why there being no counterforce is possible, what you've described is the setting for a world in which there is no counterforce, but if you are actually a hero summoned in this fashion it is actually more likely that something other than the anthropic principle is at work.
            ```

          - u/Bowbreaker:
            ```
            Of course. But whatever happens, one has to look at the probability. The chance that one gets sucked into a world that had hundreds of wars where it barely stopped a great evil through sheer luck is much smaller than the chance that one gets sucked into a world where *something concrete* made sure that hundreds of heroes bumbled their way into defeating some great evil, even if both possibilities exist.
            ```

      - u/Areign:
        ```
        No I'm not missing that fact. I'm explicitly talking about it.

        If you find yourself with a winning lottery ticket, it might be reasonable to not immediately assume something is amiss like you are being pranked or there was a printing error. But if you buy several lottery tickets and all of them are wins, you should, with overwhelming confidence, assume something is up instead of concluding that you have just witnessed a ~ 1 in 1,000,000^10 event.

        Just like if you find yourself in a world which has survived disaster on many successive extremely lucky occasions. It may be the case that the author has placed you in an extraordinarily unlikely world, but you would not be correct to conclude so unless you are aware you are in a story. Without meta-level knowledge or some other overwhelming piece of evidence, you would rightly assume there is an external cause unless presented with overwhelming contradictory evidence for something so unlikely.

        If this is not clear, consider how this situation differs from the canonical anthropic example of airplanes returning from dogfights/bombing raids with bullet holes in their wing but never in their engine. Notice how the average case is what justifies the anthropic conclusion with the alternative being that the bullets simply luckily missed the engine every single time up to now.

        Probability and logic don't just go out the window because outcome X is also correlated with observability.

        So yes, someone has to end up in the long tail but if you are at all rational, you have decided to forgo being correct in situations where the overwhelming majority of evidence points to a wrong conclusion in favor of being right when the evidence points correctly.
        ```

  - u/wren42:

    it's a strange scenario to try to build, from a bayesian perspective.   You need to have a certain level of improbability to be justified in invoking the Anthropic principal, and yet the more improbable the situation the greater the chance that there is a real counter-force behind the events.   so what evidence WOULD point to the Anthropic principal being more likely than a real meta-agent?

    &#x200B;

    edit: or, we can pose it more generally.  If we assume our understanding of physics is correct, what is the probability that Magic is real, given that we see evidence of it working?

    A case of "magic" occurring -- say, for instance, a fireball appearing when you incant a specific spell -- could be explained by low-probability coincidences, like spontaneous combustion happening at just the right time by chance when you spoke the words.

    There is some world in which it happens with perfect consistency for you 999/1000 times, and fails from there on out.  Even if we've seen it work 1000 times before, if to the best of our knowledge it is physically impossible for magic to work this way, but it can be explained by coincidence, it is more reasonable to assume that magic \*isn't\* real and we are just in a low probability world, right?

    In order to believe magic is real, we'd need to reach some threshold of evidence high enough to overcome the probability that everything else we know about physics is wrong.  But what is that threshold?  Can we ever reach it, personally?
    ```

    - u/IamJackFox:
      ```
      If I speak, 999 times in a row, an incantation that is supposed to produce a fireball, and it produces a fireball 999 times-- the evidence at that point leans towards the incantation producing a real fireball. The final arbiter of science is not the physical laws that we are taught in school; it is careful observation.
      ```

  - u/ajuc:
    ```
    I think this story heavily implies branching multiverse with infinite number of possible heroes summoned each time and only a few or even one of them results in survival of that branch of the multiverse going forward, and only these branches can summon another hero.

    So every newly summoned hero will hear that all the previous heroes succeeded, but almost all of these newly summoned heroes will then fail.

    This is good fiction, written by rationalist fiction genre-founder, containing the word "anthropic system" and other trope markers, which does not show a character acting intelligently and does not help you become more rational.

    So, is it a blegg or a rube? :)

    He can easily test it by deliberately trying to lose. If he loses and the world is destroyed then he was probably right about it being anthropic principle.

    Well, at least you realised it says *anthropic*. I just skimmed the word assuming it’s a made-up fantasy word, even though I’d realised it was meant to be something known to us, but not the citizens of that world.

- u/Aphrodite_Ascendant:
  ```
  Yes, it is a little odd that magic exists in this world, inter universal summoning spells and immortality at the very least, and yet the "hero" dismisses the possibility of any form of probability manipulation that looks like the counterforce.

  Since there are an infinity of worlds, there is not only an infinity of worlds in which the answer is "anthropic principle," but also another infinity of worlds in which the answer is "someone is covertly using magic to screw with probability." Not to mention an infinite infinity of other worlds with various other explanations that result in a useful counterforce.

  I would think the "hero" would be trying to weigh up which of those infinities was the bigger infinity, hence the more likely. And the "anthropic principle" infinity, requiring more luck, would look to me like a smaller infinity than all the other infinities.
