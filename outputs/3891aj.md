## [D][Q] Neverwinter Nights cRPG's suspension of disbelief suggestions

### Post:

Like many RPGs, Neverwinter Nights has, for no in-world logical reason at all, money and expensive magical items stored in random boxes and barrels throughout the game - available to the public.

What suggestions do you guys have for the Possible Worlds in which such an occurence could be common?

* Do the NWN people keep losing stuff, and/or are too stupid to take advantage of the situation? (There were many poor people there who could have simply taken an expensive item from the trash and sold it to buy food.)
* (How did all those items get there in the first place?)
* Is everyone paranoid that every single expensive item is a booby trap?
* Are they simply storing their goods outside their houses, trusting that noone would steal them?

Any other, more fun or interesting ideas?

I am trying to play a Lawful Good character and trying not to rob people when in their houses, even if they do not react to thievery (my justification for that one: they are too afraid of the Overpowered Hero to complain about his misdeeds, lest he'll kill them.)

It is a bit hard living a Lawful Good life in a Crazy World where a lot of crime is not being punished even with a single point towards an Evil alignment, and where you do not know the reasons for why people act the way they do; you are sometimes not sure which actions are evil/illegal according to that Crazy World's logic/laws, and which not.

  In Fantasy World, the possessions of the dead exist in a kind of legal and social limbo.  For the most part, the law considers such possessions to be the property of whoever happens to claim them, though a huge mess of laws and precedents give conflicting rights to family members, lords, and debt holders.  In the present, however, most of that's ignored, since to actually claim the property of a dead person has become a significant taboo.  This is due both to a fear of insulting family members or stealing from lords, and due to a widespread belief that the possessions of the dead are cursed to bring bad fortune to whoever claims them.

  As a result, when someone dies, their belongings are often left to rot in boxes in tombs, alleyways or out in the woods, most likely legally available to anyone, but unclaimed due to superstitions and sensibilities.

  Enter the Hero.  While an ordinary traveler or beggar would be shunned if seen rifling through the abandoned possessions of those killed in last month's monster attack, it's well known that the Hero wiped out those very monsters single-handedly, and anyway, those boxes were really starting to clutter up the street.  Thus, the Hero provides an additional service: taking any potential curses on themselves, and charging headfirst though the tangled morass of legality and convention to bring valuable items back into useful circulation.

  Assuming you're playing NWN1, I'd recommend Shadows of Undrentide instead of the original campaign if you want to roleplay. SoU is just significantly better about stuff like this. Random containers near people don't usually have incredibly valuable stuff in them, but instead things that are useful for crafting. Also, breaking into places/chests turns your character more and more chaotic. HotU is likewise better about this, but mostly due to the setting it's in. Both SoU and HotU are superior in other ways to the original campaign, in my opinion.

  In the OC, I'd just go with the explanation that your character is particularly skilled at scrounging things and/or takes a lot of time for each container that isn't shown due to the gameplay timescale. The valuable items are *there*, they just take a lot of effort to find. Or something.

  The NWN universe has an anti-entropic cosmological constant that leads to continuous creation of organized matter via Nixborn's Thaumaturgical Hypostases. Handwave handwave handwave obviously means it can be controlled by fairly low level mages who increase the local creation flux inside a box to the point where desirable objects show up inside it. However, handwave handwave means the creation of objects follows a probability distribution that means a lot of them don't materialize where they want, but show up in enclosed spaces around where the mage is working, leading to the random appearance of valuables in otherwise empty barrels and boxes in cities.

  Boxes and barrels aren't the kind of place that most people would think you would store valuables -- they're for bulky stuff of mundane utility.

  People who think at level 2, but who think that everyone else only thinks at level 1, would therefore think of this as a good hiding place -- after all, who would look there? Everyone else would think it's just going to be fish, or meat, or fur, or salt, or water, or something else ordinary. A thief might come into your home and ransack places that look like you might store valuables, but they'd leave your pantry alone.

  Of course, anyone who thinks at level 3 would then realize that this is therefore an OBVIOUS hiding place... but level 3 thinking requires more intelligence than a "normal" person would generally employ.

  EDIT: Of course, it's entirely possible that you occasionally will have people operating at level 4 -- they hide their REAL valuables elsewhere, and the token valuables in the boxes/barrels are a decoy to make a level 3 thief think they've found their haul (making the thief think the victim is operating at level 2) and leave.

    :) The barrels are outdoors, and there are many poor people in the cities. Hungry, scavenging for food -- a bigger priority to them than gold... though the gold could again buy them food.

    BOY will I have to make mental gymnastics to tolerate some of the situations! :P
