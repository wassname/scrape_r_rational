## I'm writing a rational!Smash Bros. fic - anything specific you'd like to see? (And no, it will not be called Super Rational Bros.)

### Post:

The main challenge is the fact that all the included franchises do not canonically exist within the same universe, and some characters are not even part of the same timeline - or they exist only in the far past/future of another character's timeline.

Therefore, the Smash Bros. 'verse is going to a be a slight AU of all the characters' 'verses, in order to have a cohesive, interlocking backstory and plot.

Of course, being Smash Bros., it is going to be centered around the universe-renowned fighting tournament founded by the Brothers of Smash.

With that out there; is there anything you'd like to see done? Any suggestions or ideas? Anything you'd like to see avoided?

  The Smash Bros verse is so nonsensical, I'm very curious how you'd go about it. Nothing in particular comes to mind, but with how many powers are at work, you'd think at least a few would prove themselves to be game-breakers.

    In respect to the tournament itself, the Brothers of Smash Judging Committee (composed of a few particular older characters from some of the franchises) has each fighter register a certain number of moves, each of which must be approved. These correspond to the moves in the actual game, i.e. b-air, n-air, down b, etc.

    In respect to everyday things, it's less of a problem and more just 'that's how it is'.

    Although in this world, Palutena - being a real-life goddess - would not be allowed to compete. In actuality she would never want to anyway.

  I'm curious how you'll resolve the physics issue. Will there be a singular meta-universe and its rules be responsible for the various supernatural technique and features of the various canons, or will it work something like "each character's home universe' rules apply to them, unless noted" (Ike shan't be able to turn into a pinball like Sonic does).
  ```

  I don't see why or how there's any kind of story here.  Are you sure you don't want to just build a game?
  ```

  - u/brandalizing:
    ```
    Um, we'll, 1 - it's already a game. It's called Super Smash Bros.. And 2 - of course there isn't inherently a plot, that's what I'M doing. Otherwise, what would be the point?

  Suggestion: A multiverse setup, maybe inpired by https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover , would make much more sense than trying to cram them into a single simultaneous universe.
  ```

    I have since decided on a combination of both - some characters (Fox and Captain Falcon, and perhaps Samus) would exist in the same universe, because it easily makes sense and provides interesting intertwining backstories. And other 'verses, like Fire Emblem, Hyrule, and Dreamworld, would be universes of their own.

    Luckily Kirby's Warp Stars provide easy transport between them. Hmm, maybe Fox can get a Warp Star-powered warp-drive made...

  Aw man, Super Rational Bros would've been a great title. Super Rash...super Ratio....I can't make the spelling line up the pronunciation. Whatever.
  ```

  This seems like it could be an interesting worldbuilding exercise, and thinking about who could beat up who is always fun. (The Smash Bros. roster would need to be broken into tiers to be even remotely fair.) But I'm having trouble imagining any actual plot. Arbitrary tournaments aren't really interesting, as plots go, particularly since they put constraints on characterization. Why would the timid psychic toddler fight? Who would sign his release form? Why would the mountaineers fight? Why were they even invited? Why would the King of Evil consent to leave his Triforce at home so he's not literally invincible? Who explained the rules to the monkey?

  In your place, I'd probably drop the entire fighting thing and just write a big crossover. But even then I'd have trouble writing an intelligent story where Link or Samus don't fix everything with time travel and overwhelming firepower.

  The story behind the smash bros games, while quite different, might help.

  The characters in the game are actually toys. They are being animated by the imagination of the child playing with them. When one character beats all the others, there is only one opponent remaining: the child. When the toy beats the hand of the child (master hand,) the child lets go and stops playing, thus rendering the character back to a toy. Pretty simple story, but it effectively explained why all those Nintendo characters were suddenly all in the same world and fighting.

  Please, be careful with Samua. She isn't an easy character to write about.
