  I'm mildly surprised that /u/alexanderwales hadn't posted this to /r/rational yet, but I assume that he was being modest.

    Or sleeping and doing whatever he does during the day (work of some kind?). It's only been 17 hours. Maybe he is organised and promotes his writing on a schedule?

    Hilariously brilliant story. Interesting how Wales' utopia resembles /r/TheCulture - reminds me a little of [this crossfic](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock).

      Partly humility, partly because I wasn't sure whether there was any interest. This [was posted to /r/hpmor some months ago as a self-post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2zakjx/spoilers_all_a_crackslash_epilogue/), and I figured most people had seen it by now. I've lately been trying to gather together a lot of bits of things that I've written into some kind of centrally organized way. That means putting things on ff.net or on [my website](http://www.alexanderwales.com). I don't really intend to post everything from this cleanup process here, even if some of it is intended for this audience, or was initially posted here. There are a lot of things that were posted somewhere and then forgotten about, either as a Google Docs link or a reddit comment. So me putting this on ff.net is just the first part of a spring cleaning of sorts.

      ([You can find my working list of that stuff here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/36o0mm/stuff_thats_not_on_my_website_fictionpress_or/) though some of it needs editing before I can post it in a more formal way.)

      (Work right now is web development, which means frequent reddit breaks. This message brought to you by one of those breaks!)

        A lot of people here came from /r/hpmor and would be interested. But it's very likely that some stopped paying attention to /r/hpmor when HPMOR ended and didn't notice your post. I know I wouldn't have noticed it if it weren't for the fact that I follow you on fanfiction.net.

        EDIT: Is there a reason the story isn't marked Complete or did you forget?

          I forgot, fixed now.

          He's probably planning a long series based on it

        If you're looking for more ideas, which you're probably not, I'd like to see your take on protagonist Moriarty. Or maybe you could do a Holmes fic set in the universe of ["A Study In Emerald"](http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf); I've always wanted to see more of that world.

      Thank you for a very enjoyable two hours reading that link. It's everything I wanted from a Harry Potter / Culture crossover.

      (Yes, it's unfinished, but I like stories that don't overstay their welcome.)

  ```
  That is some well-justified crackfic. It almost looks plausible!
  ```

  - u/Subrosian_Smithy:
    ```
    The best sort of crack.

  ```
  Ha-ha! This was awesome, hilarious, and slightly disturbing. But mostly awesome =)
