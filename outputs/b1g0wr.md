## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Last night I was having the usual nightmare where I'm back in high school for a math test and all the formulas have slipped out of my mind, so I turn to chat with a forgotten friend-

  And then it struck me. I'm *back in high school!* Quick, uh, Apple shares, bitcoin, 9/11, Fukushima, I don't remember enough daily news to immediately prove foreknowledge but I do know a *startling* amount of future Magic the Gathering trivia, maybe I should get vouched for by *Wizards of the Coast*...

  (Then I tried to leave the classrom and spent the rest of the dream in a pointless chase scene with the math teacher. Can't win them all.)

  &nbsp;

  On that topic: are there any good stories in which an [earthfic](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml) character who goes back in time tries to accomplish goals beyond their petty personal selves? It's a popular wish-fulfilment theme, but the ones I know are either fantasy worlds or people with depressingly small-scale goals.

    [Re: Trailer Trash](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash) is about a woman who was, as the title would tell you, trailer trash and gets to redo her life. It's pretty much slice-of-life about a woman who is doing her damned best to make a better life for herself as she goes back to high-school. It's very slow to update with about a month per chapter.

      I know about that one, and it's fun enough, but so far it's very much about petty small-scale goals.

      (Also, the protagonist somehow acquiring levels of willpower that would put a shonen character to shame is arguably *more impactful than time travel*.)

  I just got back from an eye exam, and apparently I'm near-sighted. I've known this for a few years now (just barely passed my last driver's exam eye test), but finally went in to have my eyes checked. I'm a little bit excited about having glasses, in the hopes that they'll make me look distinguished and intelligent, but this is a new world for me.

  Any particular tips? They'll probably only be on when I'm trying to use the living room computer on the big screen, or when driving.

    When someone gives you a question slightly adjust your glasses as you think. It'll draw attention to your intelligent look, give you more time and makes them biased towards believing your answer.

    ```
    Do you mind if I ask why you don't intend to wear your glasses all the time? 

    I don't understand why anyone would choose not to always have good vision.

    As for tips: Designate a space where you put your glasses every evening when you go to sleep. Looking for your glasses really, really sucks when you need them to actually see anything.

    Alternatively, or preferably additionally, get a pair of back-up and/or sports glasses. Sooner or later you will lose or destroy your main pair. Don't be like me and wander around France blind as a bat because your only pair of glasses fell into the sea on the second day of a two week excursion.

    Consider getting an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 bucks or so. You might get your lenses clean without it (though probably not that gloriously clean), but removing the gunk sticking to the nose pads is a pain without it.

    Speaking of the nose pads: they will turn green and/or yellow after a while. Apparently that's because the material they are made of is porous and prone to sucking up all the oils and lotions it can get its greedy little openings on. Here in Germany most shops will replace them for free, though I have no idea how the rest of the world handles it.

    Take a couple of minutes to work out how to open and put on your glasses quickly and while using only one hand. Not only does it look cool (it really doesn't), it can also save you time and grief in emergencies.

    Though from the sound of it most, if not all, of these tips will only become relevant once your eyesight has deteriorated a bit more.

      > Do you mind if I ask why you don't intend to wear your glasses all the time?

      Per the eye exam, I'm only mildly near-sighted, and my vision within about three or four feet is as good as it can be, glasses or not. Roughly 95% of what I do that needs vision occurs within that range (cooking, reading, writing, playing with my son, general hygiene), and wouldn't be improved by wearing glasses. Beyond that range is where I run into trouble. So if I'm going to be spending large amounts of time not getting any (or marginal) benefit from wearing glasses, it doesn't seem to make sense to wear them, except out of habit or the need to be able to have far sight at a moment's notice.
      ```

      - u/Robert_Barlow:
        ```
        As someone who *tried* doing this when I first got my glasses, it usually ends up as way more trouble than it's worth to swap back and forth. What I found is that I had habituated myself to not having perfect vision, and avoided doing tasks that would require it. So when I got my glasses, I found myself using them even for cases I didn't need them before. Add to that the fact that, when going out for the day, I needed to take them with me in the event that I had use for them, and the most convenient place to store glasses for occasional use happened to be my face.

        If you have computer-induced nearsightedness, chances are your vision will eventually deteriorate to where mine is at, where everything *works* without glasses, just with an extra layer of annoyance. I could go without them just fine - I spend most of my time indoors too - but it feels a little slimy and imprecise, like having a coating of grease on your hands.

        Thank you for your thoughtful and detailed advice.

        The problem with that particular pair of glasses wasn't the fit, though. It was that I decided to splurge and got the ultra light-weight rimless glasses. Which was great, until we took a boat trip and an unexpectedly violent gust of wind from diagonally behind me ripped them off of my face and cast them into the ocean.

        I haven't actually lost another pair after that, but I have had them destroyed or otherwise made un-useable or inaccessible in the mean-time, be it through my own actions or circumstances beyond my control.

        You're right that my claim of inevitability was exaggerated. On the other hand, just being careful is not enough to ensure your constant and uninterrupted access to any particular pair of glasses.

    Once you have your perscription buy your glasses online. Get transition lenses and if you do screen work get a UV filter and talk to your optomitrist about a less powerful perscription for reading spectacles (this is more for |diopters| > 3)

    >when driving

    A lot of people use sunglasses when driving to deal with bright sunlight, but I can't do that thanks to my glasses. So I usually rely on a baseball cap and/or open the sun visor.

    Give yourself more space between your car and other people's cars when you start out driving with glasses until you adjust. This will give you more time to react to any issues.

    I don't have them myself, but you can also get [anti-reflective (AR) eyeglass coating](https://www.stantonoptical.com/blog/anti-reflective-lens-coating). They are supposed to be good for dealing with glare from bright lights and help with eye strain from looking at a computer screen all day. I'm planning on getting them for my next pair of eyeglasses.

      I use anti-reflective glasses for 13 years. It sells as something that prevents “digital eye strain”. The advantages are actually [rather small](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/ask-ophthalmologist-q/advantages-anti-reflective-coating-on-eyeglasses).

            I used the word 'cost' a little differently than it should have been used. I didn't mean cost as in financial cost, but as in cost of time and effort keeping the glasses clean and scratch-free. I actually work in construction now and keeping my glasses clear of dust make this a serious concern versus if I was working some sort of office job. Appreciate the warning!

    Transitional lenses are a trap. They're cool for about a week, and then you're stuck indoors with sunglasses on for ten minutes every time you go outside. They barely work in the car too since windshields tend to block UV rays, which is what activates them. Buy a regular pair and a prescription pair of sunglasses instead.

    Anti glare on the other hand is a godsend if you use them at the computer. 

    I can recommend getting rimless frames, at least on the bottom of the frame. It makes reading much easier since there's less getting in your way.

    I too once thought about only wearing them when I needed them, but you know what's more annoying than wearing glasses? Carrying a bulky case on your person with the constant threat of breaking or losing them. Like, as thick as your wallet and as big as your phone. Annoying as shit. Plus your eyes are only going to get worse from here, may as well get used to it. 

    If you find a frame you really like, keep in mind that the next time you update your prescription you can just use the same frames. They won't usually tell you this.

    If you have an HSA, it can be used on glasses.

    There's a transition period while your brain rewires to compensate for the frames and slight visual distortion of the lenses. In my experience it's 3-5 days of headaches. If it's particularly bad bring it to the attention of your optometrist, but just be aware, I guess.

    Oh, and it *totally* gives at least +2 to both sophistication and nerd cred.

    My first pair of glasses were [thin metal wire frames](https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2017/02/01/rimmed-glasses/coastal.w710.h473.2x.jpg). They broke within months, as did the second pair and so on until I got a pair of [thick, plastic glasses](https://www.visionworks.com/images/product/1278110/12781103Q_raw_lg.jpg), which lasted years. Recommend you do the same.

    Frames vary widely in price for no apparent reason. I have seen $100 frames that were virtually indistinguishable from $10 frames sitting a few feet apart at Walmart's vision center. Get the cheap ones.

    Don't bother with transition lenses for driving. Just buy [clip-on sunglasses](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xQtvf9ysL._UX522_.jpg).

    Don't bother with cases. Easier to just carry them on at all times, or to hang them from your shirt's collar.

    If you end up taking them to bed for some reason, have a night stand or something within arm's reach to place them right before you fall asleep.

      Transition lenses don't darken inside most cars or buildings; they're only really useful when you are outdoors.
      ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Do you have eye insurance? If so check your coverage details: some will cover new lenses yearly but new frames only every other year or some such. In any case never buy frames from a glasses store, unless you want to pay a ridiculous markup for some particular look. Buy the frames online and have them put the lenses in, or just buy the lens online too.
    ```

  - u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
    ```
    Hmm, just some random practical thoughts:

    zenioptical.com is an excellent source of cheap lenses. Do not buy lenses direct from your optometrist unless you have great insurance, you will end up paying a lot more.

    If you have any kind of metal allergy make sure you get hypoallergenic frames to avoid awful rashes. Get something with replaceable nose pads to avoid long term grottiness, as well.

    Keeping the lenses clean can be a real chore, easier these days with microfiber cloths. Never ever use paper products to dry your glasses, it is astonishing how easily a lens can be scratched
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    I've worn glasses for most of my life and absolutely hate them, mostly for the looks and the fact that if they get broken I'm severely handicapped in outdoor life. I haven't been able to convince myself to get surgical correction due to the benefits of glasses and risks if the surgery though. Here's some positives:

    You can get completely used to them: After the initial discomfort, then some awkwardness, you will forget you're wearing them entirely. I have no problem doing any exercise in mine, and can even sleep in them without a problem when needed.

    Always on comfortable eye protection: Always wearing glasses means you rarely have to put on additional eyeware, and that you are used to it. Mine saved me an eye when I ran into a tree branch so hard it scratched them, and have helped far more times than I've noticed.

    UV blocking: Most glasses (and contact) lenses block 100% of UV light so you can stare at the sun without wrecking your eyes! More practically this means I find direct sun and glare much less of a problem than other people, and I personally know it isn't roasting my retinas. You will still want sunglasses for comfort, but health wise they aren't necessarily.

    Tips:
    Clean the nose pads and parts that touch your head with an astringent to avoid oil buildup and acne there.

    Clean the lenses for others sake, you might get used to or forget about dirty lenses but it will bother people talking to you.

    Have different lenses for: sports, casual, and formal. Sports is for durability and frequent cleaning, and you want them tighter than normal. Casual and formal for style since having a separate serious/formal looking pair really helps step it up and accent special occasions for friends.

    Put on your glasses to look at things "hard", even when it isn't needed. When asked your opinion about how something looks, or a paper make sure to put on your glasses. You don't need them up close, but everyone else has at least some feeling that you are entirely blind without them.

    If you happen to cycle a lot like I do, try looking for frames that are thin at the temples. I have glasses that have more than a centimetre vertical width at the hinge and get moderately thinner the closer they get to the ear, and I was really frustrated when spring came around and I found out that this frame introduced a wide obstruction in my field of view when looking out of the corner of my eye or over my shoulder (to check for traffic approaching from the back).

    Other than that: 

    * You can always retain the frame and exchange the lenses every few years, particularly if you happen to like your frame.
    * Glare reduction is worth it (for me, I don’t remember a time I didn’t wear glasses)
    * Sonic bath cleaners are worth it (they’re multi-purpose, not just limited to glasses, but also bicycle parts, for instance)

  A Flash of Colour in the Mind:

  Some say to remember that the finger pointing at the moon is not the moon. And some say that every time you call up a memory, you change it. But here's the best I can express what remains of a split-second of thought earlier today:

  I was enjoying reading a classic SF novel for the first time, and as my thoughts went over expanding on an idea from one line, I had a combination of seeing that expansion in the form of some Avatar-like glowing blue text, combined with an odd sensation. It took me some time to nail it down, which was a combination of thinking that the expansion was new-to-me, interesting... and what I now realize was the actual emotional sensation of hope.

  I'm not sure if I can describe what it's like to realize that I'd literally forgotten what hope feels like. I've cobbled together an intellectual approximation, so that, as a hyperbolic-to-the-unrealistic-extreme example, I can analyse the pros and cons of suicide, taking into account that I know my mind is prone to certain biases, and come to the logical conclusion that even if I don't anticipate anything ever getting anything better, staying alive is most likely the better choice. But that's an entirely different thing than actually /feeling/ "hey, that sounds like something better that just might happen".

  Sure, I've now been going over that split-second so many times that by now I mostly only remember remembering it. But I'm still taking it as a /very/ good sign I'm still on an upswing. (Sure, one step back every few steps forward, and there are days as blah as before... but there are days that /aren't/.)

  About the only downside is that re-thinking my latest story idea, I'm now realizing how bleak and depressing my outline is; so I'm going to have to change it so much that I might as well be coming up with something from scratch. Which is such a ridiculously contrived "downside" that I'm grinning lopsidedly to myself as I type this.

  Of course, given past experience, I may only be peaking before a return to previous depression; I've had such before. But... it may not be. And I'm looking forward to hoping my mental state will improve further.

  I've been playing a card game called Faeria for months now after Hearthstone had become too much money-sink and I couldn't play the decks I wanted to play. However, Faeria didn't have that problem and it had quickly become my favorite CCG due to several other reasons. It has beautiful artstyle, requires more tactic and planning ahead than other CCGs due to its unique living board, gives you all the cards in an expansion with 100% guarantee if you buy them. All in all, I'm pretty passionate about this game and realized it's currently on sale, so I thought I'd do some "subtle" advertising here.

  It's [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/397060/Faeria/) and this weekend it's free to play. So, try it out and if it strikes your fancy, remember it's on 50% sale ;)

    Hmm, looks interesting, but I think I'll be sticking to MTG Arena. It's incredibly hard to top Magic, especially now that it actually has an online version that doesn't look like it was coded by the team that brought us the original healthcare.gov (And doesn't require the fiscal outlay of the paper version). Progression is pretty decent, specific decks are easy to save for with just wildcard drops, and the free packs round out your collection nicely, but most importantly, it's just so much better balanced than most of it's competitors. Wizards has been doing this for a long time, and it really shows. So many interesting deck options.

  The site is my first experience developing something with a user-facing front end, and has been well received, so at least I got a good learning experience out of the whole ordeal.

      Wow, that was a great read. I agree with pretty much everything written and I wouldn't be surprised if my HBS rejection occurred because I ended up in the wrong bucket.

      My personal experience mirrors what's described in the article too. My test scores say I'm "smart", but the only reason I'm even on the path to applying to ultra-elite schools is because I lucked out and ended up with an ultra-elite SO. Without being pulled into that elite circle by my SO, I would almost certainly still be living an unexceptional life in flyover country.

  Designing a perfect country: Administration

  Many people fantasise about how they would improve the world were they put in charge of it, I'm sure in this subreddit we have a particular fondness for these kind of thought experiments.

  One of the least interesting and yet significant is how a country is internally organised.

  There is a reason we don't have a single central government that manages every aspect of government. Instead we split the government into sections each with their responsibilities, and we further subdivide that into more sections and ad addendum until we're happy.

  The question I have is what is a good method for administrative divisions? How should responsibilities be divided per level? 

  I'm trying to imagine if I was put in charge of say the UK and they wiped it clean so there was no government anywhere and they then said divide up the current government responsibilities into appropriate areas.

  In my opinion the ideal administrative system should be robust: it should be able to handle predictable future events, to do so it should be flexible, the size and shape and number of divisions on each level will likely change as people move and cities grow and shrivel. There must be mechanics for responsibilities such as public transport being able to be transferred to a single entity when for example London grows and subsumes the city). It should also be consistent and as universally applicable as possible. One area on the same level shouldn't have different responsibilities than another. That just causes unneeded complications. 

  Zeroth Level (technically ultimately responsible for everything): National Defence, Foreign Policy, National Infrastructure (railways?, highways?, some degrees of public transport?, how much of infrastructure is there responsibly), Education (to what extent, general guide?, management of schools directly?, standard exams?), Power, Water (?), Standards (deciding when to accept international standards or creating national ones), National Statistics? (collection devolved or maintained?), National Parks and Pollution? Healthcare?

  First Level: area? population? density? number? River pollution? 

  Second Level:

  Third Level:

  How many levels? 

  If anyone can point me to the best place to find information and discussion on the optimal administrative system I'd love to read something like that.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Libertarian.html

    There are several essays in there on why the optimal number of levels is 0, and that we should embrace anarcho-capitalism. They aren't necessarily true, but they are well written and thought provoking opinions that I haven't often seen argued for elsewhere. I think it'd be particularly a good read for you too since you seem to be taking it for granted that governments should be large.
