  The Antimemetics Division tales are great. SCP-3125, the main antagonist, is such a formidable foe. He is a living idea that knows when he is perceived thanks to his infohazardous nature, can completely infiltrate the minds of anyone who slightly perceives him thanks to his memetic nature, and can censor any written information about himself thanks to his antimemetic nature.


  Personally, I would have used the Cicada God SCP-3004 to defeat him. Since Fifthists vaguely worship an aspect of 3125 that they refer to as The Cosmic Starfish, this technically makes 3125 a religious idea. 3004 is a Pistiphage, a faith-eating entity that is snacking on Christianity. Theoretically, if a person were to astral project themselves to 3004's astral plane from inside 3125's inverted containment chamber, 3004 would eat 3125 along with the person's other religious ideas.

    Huh, I think that would work... at destroying 3125... only for major aspects of humanity to be destroyed by the Cicada god in cannibalistic rituals.  Or maybe it only adoptees cannibalism as a motif to lash out at Christians and it would develop some other horrible motif in the process of destroying 3125.

    I wonder how those-that-must-not-be-spoken-of-with-unique-nouns, (unnumbered between 3998 and 4002) would interact with the 3125.  3125 has used noun and word based memetics, so the fae-forest-path-creatures might have a chance but humanity would be destroyed in the aftermath.

    The anafabula has a good chance, 3125 seems to use enough pataphysical logic to be vulnerable to anti-narrative, but the world, or at least all narratives about it, might be destroyed in the process.

    Huh you know I think competitive eschatology needs a reboot with the newer SCPs involved.

  I was wondering how the story was going to have the final boss be defeated without it being "Here's the magic bomb. Now press the button to win".

  This is really creative! (and also kinda dumb)

    The alternative was that this iteration of the timeline was from a civilization of humans, infinitely familiar to ours, got wiped with no residue, and the current SCP is in a different continium.

    I'm okay with the mcguffin that's been Checkov'd since forever.

  Reify, again, is a great word.

  An epic climax to this tale series!  It seems theyâ€™ve dealt with 3125, but I bet there is still events worth exploring as the Foundation blindly bumps into and over the anti memetic aftermath.
