## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Another DnD optimization:

  You are in a low powered and low magic late medieval (just as professional non-feudal armies and early gunpowder weapons are developing) D&D setting (a 6th level spell caster with 3rd level spells is as rare as between 1 in a hundred and 1 in a thousand people, and higher level get exponentially rarer).  You are a high ranking general who has a Wizard ally who has developed a highly efficient curriculum.  By screening for the smartest 90th percentile soldiers with simple standardized testing, and using a curriculum that trades off on long term overall understanding for optimized speed of learning, they can learn 4 level 0 cantrips and 2 level 1 spells in only 3 months.  

  Under non combat conditions, a trained Wizard-soldier can repeatedly use cantrips indefinitely using a trick to recapture the magical energy, but can only use up to 4 cantrips in combat conditions as they cannot recapture the magic energy.  The Wizard-soldier can also cast 3 level 1 spells per day.  As with D&D wizards, the Wizard-soldier needs 8 hours sleep to fully restore their magical energy (less sleep means proportionally less magic), but thanks to your Ally Wizard’s optimizations, they only need a single water proofed sheet to study for their “spell book” and can prepare their spells each morning in only 30 minutes.  Caster level varies between 1 and 2 depending on the soldier.

  You have two apprentices of this Wizard to help in training as well, so you can pick 3 different sets of training curriculum to train subset of your smartest soldiers.  What 12 cantrips and 6 level 1 spells divided into 3 subsets of soldiers do you have 1 tenth of your army learn?

    Don't risk your soldiers on the front lines, instead use them to revolutionise your intelligence and communication.

    Cantrips:

    * Dancing lights: devise a semaphore system and use this for long-distance communication with a relay of casters
    * Mending: keep all the equipment in good condition
    * Prestidigitation: clean everything to improve hygiene and flavor the rations to improve morale

    Scouts:

    * Alarm: monitor all the key junctions and bridges for enemy troops, the caster just has to stay within 1 mile to receive the alert
    * Mount: horses are expensive and need to be treated carefully. Horses created by magic are entirely disposable and need no feed, removing the logistical burden and allowing your casters to ride them to death

    Spies:

    * Charm person: politely ask captured enemy officers or uncooperative local civilians for intelligence
    * Disguise self: this includes clothing and armour, so impersonate enemy officers or messengers to gather information and sow havoc with conflicting orders
    ```

      The webcomic Order of the Stick has [a great example](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0512.html) of Dancing Lights used as a communication system (although not with a long-distance relay).

      Edit: These are excellent suggestions in general. Especially the cantrips: Mending is great for repairing lightweight items (up to 1 pound), and Prestigitation makes good hygiene much easier (clean anything without using up soap or water).

      However, I don't think Alarm really works as a way to monitor locations for enemy troops. It activates anytime a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area without speaking the password. In other words, the spell doesn't differentiate between a stray rabbit, a harmless traveler, and an enemy army. If the Alarm is set outdoors on a public bridge, you will get a high proportion of false positives.

      Thinking along similar lines:

      The cantrip Message is good for short range secure communication during scouting (110 ft. range).

      Ray of frost might be worth it for being able to chill provisions to preserve them and it can double as a weapon if absolutely needed (1d3 is a decent chunk of damage relative to a commoner).

      Floating disk lasts 1-2 hours and can carry 100-200 lbs (depending on how good the soldier is).  That isn’t enough time or weight for long range logistics, but short range uses might exist...
