## [Practical Guide To Evil] : There's so gonna be goblinfire.

### Post:

Pretty much every book has had a problem that is eventually solved with truckloads of goblinfire hurled at a city.

Now there is a narrow pass through the mountains being scouted by ACTUAL goblins, a city that is evacuated of all but the military\(Harrow\), and a tripartite army that can pseudo\-teleport. There's so gonna be goblinfire chucked at people.

  She agreed to no sacking cities.  They aren't gonna harrow Harrow.

    Sure, but the pass people are using to get into callow isn't a city. The foundling gambit is fair, doubly so if she wants to cut off retreat.

      I feel like the whole point of the last couple of updates is that she does NOT want to cut off the Crusade's retreat.  Like, she wants to score several small victories and have them retreat.  She thinks Cordelia won't be able to sign her Liesan Accords if she has 50k dead Procerans to her name.

        Not just that. Cutting off the retreat of an enemy army is a really good way to loose battles. Because if they cant get away, they can still go *through* you.

    ```
    If the civilians are out, it isn't really a city, just a fortification.

    That said, it's still an ugly tactic, and by all indications she's trying to avoid those lately. If she starts using WMDs - even against combatants -, she loses a lot of moral high ground, and invites the same thing on her own soldiers.

    Worried about the Hell egg. Goblin fire isn't exactly well know for being easy to control, and it tends to destroy magic it interacts, e.g. demon binding spells.

      ```
      The fact it could be anywhere means that, Narratively, it's exactly where the fire would burn.
      ```

    Miracles, probably.

    ```
    There's like a dozen named marching against her, it's more or less a given that at least one of them is going to be able to pull something to quickly snuff out goblin fire.
