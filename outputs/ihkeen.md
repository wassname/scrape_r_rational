    Oh, also:  The first >!unlock for someone else!< that we've seen.  This will become important later.

  Aw, way to boop that snoot Athos. Really putting the team on your back haha.

  Eugene seems like he genuinely just wants to help Athos, dubious methods aside. It sucks that he's getting such a bad rap on RR for having a bad first impression (and second impression (and possible third impression (ok, so he doesnt seem like the greatest team player, but he's at least doing things that help the team, so i cant bring myself to hate him))).

  Wait, im confused, so Athos and Boy Muckface both got healed when spirit was transferred? How does that work? Shouldnt Athos have gotten worse by giving up spirit and Boy have gotten back to around his initial condition after the spirit transfer?

  DKS, thanks for continuing to work on this excellent story.   I've attempted to write up a [brief rules primer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcWtlDrhEbMtt-tkt5Xkfx5bFByglHaEhDoQ0cPdeoI/edit?usp=sharing) for the world, as much as I could deduce from what's been covered so far.  If you could comment if I'm on the right track, I'd be very appreciative.

  From my review, I found a few things that I'm unable to answer without a little Word of God:

  * Do Recovery/Restoration normally help Physique and Spirit return to max if reduced, or is this only a function of Spirit Transference? 
  * If/when Recovery/Restoration bring Physique/Spirit back to max, at the established rate of 100:1, does it apply to both Physique AND HP, or get consumed first for Physique then remainder to HP?
  * Does the stacking 1.5x cost for additional same-day attunements and unlocks count only attunements (as suggested in all the math), or both attunements and unlocks (as suggested by Chapter 3's Skillweb infobox)?
  * Does the 6x cost for Uncommon vs. Common, continue up the rarities with each tier costing 6x more?
  * Somewhere in the story, Athos got 10 more Essence (113 vs 103) than MrFloatyBox told him about, either from HP or MP.  As he's an unreliable narrator, can we assume these might be related to the unexpected Ding he experienced when opening his character sheet?

  I am fully aware I'm over analyzing the math behind an excellent narrative, but I think that's very much in the spirit of this subreddit.
