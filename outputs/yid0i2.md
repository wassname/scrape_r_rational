## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Dragon Ball Z Abridged](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6EC7B047181AD013) is one of the best pieces of media I've seen in months, and I'm *appalled* took me this long to hear of it, especially given my love for the Dragon Ball franchise.

  It starts out as a relatively low-key parody super-saturated with reference humour and easy targets, but even back then their delivery, voice acting (which is *amazingly* good), and timing made it pretty entertaining, although nothing very notable.  As it went on though, the quality curve just *kept on creeping up*.  I don't think I can make a stronger testament to its rewatchability and eventual quality than that I watched the entire series for the first time less than two months ago - and I'm pretty sure I've rewatched the entire thing a time and a half over now.

  I honestly can't think of anything I've seen that I can say definitively beats out DBZA for sheer comedic density (maybe Futurama?  But even that had 20 minute episodes, while this was usually far less).  Every character is revamped into versions of themselves that are about as close to being ideal in terms of adding to the overall humour (and plot - unintuitively, DBZA is really character-driven, and has characters I loved here more than in the original, like Gohan or Piccolo), not to mention some *inspired* creative choices like having the voices of Nail and Kami in Piccolo's head after they fuse, a lot of (actually pretty good) DBZ covers of other songs in the show, and that's not even getting into stuff like Mr. Popo, the eldritch omnipotent demon, or the *muffin button*.  They're also really good at attention to detail, callbacks, subtle references and jokes with a *really* long payoff time.

  The creators also do a pretty good job of balancing the humour with the serious stuff when it's necessary (it isn't *always* perfect, but at this point I'm nitpicking), and some of the scenes they play straight I enjoyed *more* than the original show (such as Perfect Cell's arrival, or Gohan's Unmei no Hi moment).  I can't recommend this series more than I am now, and if I were including YouTube series in my ratings list, this would be an easy SS entry.

    It really is impressive. I love how they nod to filler:

    > “Wanna go drive cars?”

    Hellsing has similar quality and style, but less emotional impact.

    The only comedic dub I’d rank higher is SAO Abridged, which manages to surpass its source in basically every way.
    ```

    - u/buckykat:
      ```
      The bar of surpassing the source is lower for SAO than DBZ though
      ```

      - u/netstack_:
        ```
        That makes it all the sweeter. Whenever SAOA hits a crescendo, there's this little voice in the back of my head going "yes! this is what *should have been!*"
        ```

    Other people are recommending these so I thought it would be helpful to post links:

    [Sword Art Online Abridged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0&list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU)

    [Hellsing Ultimate Abridged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4nmW5GZhQ&list=PL581218B72A4B9170)

    Both are awesome, but I think Sword Art Online Abridged is wins out.
    ```

  - u/Jokey665:
    ```
    Highly recommend Hellsing Ultimate Abridged. Same crew did it.
    ```

  - u/GeneratedSymbol:

    DBZA is pure genius.

    If you're in the mood for more Dragon Ball, [Dragon Ball Multiverse](https://www.dragonball-multiverse.com/en/page-0.html#h_read) is pretty awesome. It's basically a really good DBZ fanmanga. It has quite a few moments of, "Yes!!! This is what Toriyama *should* have done!"

    Man I'm still sad they decided to stop. The piccolo kami fusion scene still is one of my favorite scenes ever. The little spinoffs they've been working on are great I loved the Dragonshortz and the HFIL episodes I think are some of my most rewatched content and are probably my favorite watchable content in the last couple years.

  Am I allowed to recommend my own work? I only have 4 chapters on royal road so far, so I don’t want to make a top level post quite yet. I have a lot more in backlog if anyone is willing to beta read, though~

  https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59849/cleric-of-little-faith/chapter/1019102/chapter-1-the-beginning

  Not 100% sure if I qualify for “rational” fiction, but I’m giving it ye olde college try. 

  Cleric of Little Faith is a fantasy story around a mage named Jin. Except one of her magic experiments went wrong, and she finds herself sent forwards in the future to find her civilization in ruins and people claiming she is not a mage, but a cleric. She has little faith in their claims about their deities.

  I think someone on here recommended To the Far Shore on royal road. Seconding the rec - it's probably one of the best things I've read on the site.

  https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50836/to-the-far-shore

  Broadly speaking, it's set in a world (ours) after many, *many* apocalptic events, to the point where educated people even have categorizations and common frameworks of the recovery phases of different ones. The main character is a... genetically enhanced scion of an aristocratic House that falls in the first chapter (with a Dune-like specialty in (body-based) radiation-manipulation) on a futuristic Oregon trail expedition across a continent to a quiet farming community.

  Great character development and world building, wonderful use of language, and it's complete!
  ```

  - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
    ```
    I recommended this last week. I just finished it this week (the first book recently concluded) and I'll second that rec again. It's very well written. 

    The only downside is that the book is done, and the author is going to work on other stories in the same universe before (maybe) doing another book continuing this one's MC.
    ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Does it actually have a plot or is it slice of live? Quiet farming community makes me think the latter.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      I wouldn't really call it "slice of life" but it is generally a heavily character-focused story that's very introspective at times

      It definitely has plot though and the pacing is well done
      ```

    - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
      ```
      It's an adventure story. It's a farming story in the same way that the Oregon Train was a farming game.
      ```

    - u/jaghataikhan:
      ```
      More slice of (travel) life, though they def run into explosive situations on said big move
      ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    I'll second this with caveats. The story is, in the broadest possible strokes, "Naruto clans with the ninjas filed off, in a post-post-apocalypse", with all the strengths and weaknesses that implies. Don't get me wrong, the clans are interesting, but the story ends up revolving almost entirely around characters with inherited powers and philosophies and everyone else is chopped liver, because multi-faceted characterization is a privilege only the clanfolk can afford.

    The story is a ton of fun, and by ton I do mean a ton. There's a lot of it, and it was nice to pick it up whenever I had a quiet moment. The Oregon Trail format is something I've personally toyed with for tabletop rpgs, and seeing so well realized here makes me really happy. It reminded me of Modesitt's Recluce saga, too, in a good way.

    My "main contention" is the ending. It's the exact same problematic ending the Paragamer got. I'm not going to expound on it because I don't think it "ruins" either story, but damn if it doesn't feel nearly as good as a whole now that I got to the end. If you read The Paragamer and hated how that ended, don't go into this one blind.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      >Naruto clans with the ninjas filed off

      Eh, I mean *maybe* but it's not like Naruto invented this idea of powerful clans/groups with unique capabilities and knowledge--its basically a staple of the "cultivation" genre or more generally Eastern fantasy. My comparison would've been to the Bene Gesserit in *Dune*. They are also obsessed with genetics, breeding powerful heirs, hoarding secret knowledge, pulling strings behind the scenes, etc. 

      >everyone else is chopped liver

      lol I think they actually talk about this in the story where Mazelton says something like this to Lettie and she (unconvincingly) tries to argue she doesn't believe so.

  I've just read through most of  [Meguca Micro Empire Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/meguca-micro-empire-quest-pmmm.8632/reader/), a quest about creating an "infrastructure" around magical girls, and really enjoyed it. Are there any fics focused on magical girls trying to rationally make their lives longer, happier and safer, like in the quest mentioned previously? Or fics where magical girls get some kind of outside help rather than being almost completely self-sufficient? It doesn't actually have to be magical girls; I just want a story where there are institutions built to work with people having supernatural powers, like fantasy clerics and wizards or superheroes.

    If you have a month, you can read  To the Stars! https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984

    850k words,  sci-fi magic girl AI utopia gets attacked by aliens! Stellar worldbuilding, a bit too wordy for me. Unfinished, very slow updates but last chapter indicates some form of endgame approaching.

    EDIT: highly recommend at least the first 2 chapters, worldbuilding there already superb.

    Release that Witch! is a Chinese webnovel where a Chinese guy is transmigrated into a body of a good-for-nothing youngest prince of a fantasy kingdom where ~~magical girls~~ witches are outlawed and hunted down by the Church. He rapidly realized it's all bullshit and uses all the witches he helps and collects to rapidly industrialize and defeat the many threats that rise against him.

    It's a good story. Unfortunately, the translation is bad even by Chinese webnovel standards - it's *obviously* slightly cleaned up janky MTL.

  Can anyone recommend a good sports anime with at least some female characters that, you know, aren't only there to cheer for the male characters? Failing that, a manga.

    But seriously, sport is gender segregated. If you're okay with a mostly female cast, then there should be many sports anime like that.
    I also recommend Teppu. It's a manga about a girl doing MMA.

    Garupan. Because tank battles as a sport is awesome.

    Also I liked Uma Musume I suppose.
    ```

  - u/LaziIy:
    ```
    Definitely recommend Ao Ashi as a good sports manga, anime was decent from what I know. Sadly female cast is a bit of a minority in it.

    Maybe major 2nd?  Has decent female characters who aren't just cheerleaders but partake in the sport as well.

    ```
    All Rounder Meguru is a manga about a high school kid who takes up shooto. It's not Teppu, but it's very good. Since Meguru trains at a coed gym, you see a large number of women characters, many of whom are extremely good fighters. It's been a while (ie years) since I read it, and the whole thing hadn't been fully translated when I did, but I enjoyed it a lot when I was in my "martial art manga," phase.

  Qntm has recently published a collection of short stories, and several of them are available for free on their website. They're all really good sci-fi, exploring concepts like simulation, nanomachines, artificial intelligence, etc. Many of them left me feeling a bit introspective, a good, rare feeling from fiction.
  ```

- u/Prestigious_Dealer83:
  ```
  Since I haven't seen it recommended before, I want to recommend the novel Red Rising. It's basically like hunger games with an mc who turns the whole game upside down. Though not rational in the sense exploring hard rational concepts, its more so a intelligent mc who can think on his feet. The clever maneuvers and power plays the mc pulls off will leave your head spinning. However, it takes some grinding through the early part to get to the really good parts, but it's more than worth it.
  ```

  - u/jaghataikhan:
    ```
    Eh... I'd have to anti-rec unfortunately. I haven't read the recent books, but I read the original trilogy as they were coming out. 

    My main issue with Red Rising/ sequels was >!how small the solar system felt and that the MC is too awesome. Basically of an entire solar system, only like the five to ten people we meet in book one end up being of consequence lol. Add how the MC is SUPER SMART and can solve rubix cubes the first time he ever sees them as an illiterate miner, (sorry, HELLDIVER as he's wont to remind us), has SUPER WILLPOWER enough to awe the likes of the Iron Golds, learns SUPER SWORD WHIP SKILLS off camera from a recluse sword saint, everyone sees him as an SUPER LEADER, beats a guy lauded for his space admiral skills with SUPER STRATEGY via using mining equipment in space (which was funnily enough also done in the Thrawn books). I will say his imprisonment arc in book 3 was enough of a setback that it redeemed the series for me, but too much of the series was marred by the above issues for me to wholeheartedly recommend it!<

  Im finishing the Zombie Knight Saga up, and it has me wanting more. Specifically I’m looking for something with a good central tension, similar to the Vanguard versus Abolish/ order versus chaos dichotomy that’s a pretty main theme in the story. 


  It doesn’t have to be order versus chaos, just something where multiple ideas come into conflict and just about every character has an opinion on those ideas. For some more context on central tensions: [Matt Colville’s running the game video ](https://youtu.be/HpiT6RTlLYc)


  Some works that are a really good example of this
  -	A Practical Guide to Evil
  -	Only Villains Do That 
  -	The Eternal Champion series by Michel Moorcock
  -	Dark Souls 3


  I know there are more works that have a good exploration of central tension, with multiple characters having differing views on said tension, but I can’t think of any others off the top of my head. 

  Thanks in advance!

    [Night Watch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359375.Night_Watch?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=szhz2Us8Lr&rank=2) and its sequels by Russian author Sergei Lukyanenko come to mind. It's an Urban Fantasy setting centered on Moscow, following a Light wizard during his rise to prominence in the Other world scene. The central conflict between the Light and the Dark Side, and how both work together to keep the normal world unaware of their struggle, is the central premise, which is examined from different angles over the series. I liked the worldbuilding and generally was fond of the characters.  

    Sadly the author is an outspoken supporter of Russia's war against Ukraine, but if you can divide the person's political views from their creative work, that series is a decent read.
    ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      Lukyanenko has had political views stuffed in here and there long before Putin noticed that Ukraine exists. Though it's not something where you have to read a character's 78-page political speech, I *do* get constant jarring opinions while reading many of his books. It's not analogous to, for example, "Oh, I liked *Ender's Game* but then I found out Orson Scott Card hates gay people so I can't read it anymore." After reading *Night Watch* it is 100% predictable that its author would be an outspoken supporter of Russia's war.

      (That being said, I did read the whole series anyway.)
      ```

      - u/sl236:
        ```
        He used to be hugely anti-war and anti-colonialism in his writing, though. I actually spent some while trolling him on Facebook by posting quotes from his own books, back before it all descended into a mass of raving nationalists and I had to leave for my own sanity.

        The single biggest predictor of his current stance in his works is the consistent "Russia may be a shithole, but it's *our* shithole and so we gotta love and defend whatever it is and does" message. Which... was much more bearable before the thing it did was start a shooting war of aggression in Ukraine.
        ```

    - u/sl236:
      ```
      Note the sequels gradually drop in quality, and also after a point he starts ~~taking other people's fanfiction set in that universe and publishing that~~ collaborating with other authors on sequels as well.
      ```

      - u/jaghataikhan:
        ```
        Yeah the "one more book" syndrome smacks of him milking a cash cow, to say nothing of the authorized fanfics. I'd suggest reading through the first three books and leaving it there
        ```

    - u/jaghataikhan:
      ```
      Seconding Night Watch. It's very evidently inspired by somebody who grew up during the Cold War, and I love the picture of Moscow it paints. 

      Lukyankenko's got an anti-American streak that's pretty evident, but it doesn't detract from the books. IMO the first trilogy is unforgettable, but after that there's a noticeable decline with random deus ex machina plot resolutions and unnecessary additions to the story when it was already at a good stopping point.

    The Gods are Bastards web serial was good with having tense conflict between several factions with different moral philosophies. I dropped it a few years back when I stopped following web serials as much so I’m not sure how it ended up, but I think it’s finished now.

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      It's stopped on a hiatus just before the final arc while the author works some stuff out. They're currently writing Only Villains Do That, which is lighter reading.

      - u/NnaelKysumu:
        ```
        I remember hating all of the cast at the beginning of the serial, and then loving all of them at the end. I'm still amazed how the author managed to develop his characters by the end. Although it's indeed a very slow start, I think it's a worthwhile read.
        ```

      - u/DM_ME_YOUR_HUSBANDO:
        ```
        I'd say most of the early stuff is just about exploring the characters and the world without much dramatic world shaking action. Then honestly once the big reveal about the true nature of the gods came in, I didn't really like that reveal, and so I dropped it just as the action was really ramping up. I might pick it up again at some point though.
        ```
