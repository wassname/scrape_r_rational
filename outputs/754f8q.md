    New chapters being published once a month or so doesn't help either. But honestly I don't mind- it's slow paced either way, and those preparations are as much of a development as the payoff itself.

    ```
    My guesses regarding the dreams described:

    > A sea of suns connected by glowing threads

    Could describe the time loop. My rough understanding is that it's a "series" of pocket dimensions, instantiated one after another. The glowing threads are the looper's souls transferring or the transfer of whatever power is being used to sustain the loop.

    I can also see this representing (primarily) the non-looping reality/realities and how they're connected to other realms such as the Primordial prisons and celestial realm.

    > a massive volcano in the middle of an eruption

    I think this is going to involve one of the primordials. Edit: It doesn't seem like lava or volcanoes is their domain. The Primordial below Cyora seems to be noted for shapeshifting abilities specifically. Still looking for more and any information on others.

    This could also be an issue that they encounter when they go across the ocean searching for more keys. If the place is buried by volcanic eruption when they arrive, they may have a harder time finding a gate.

    Edit: ~~When they counter-assaulted the invasion with Alanic and Xvim, was there any indication of lava in the hole?~~ Doesn't seem like it, but ["bright red light"](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/60/Mother-of-Learning) as the ritual ~~activates~~ is interrupted and the loop ends could be lava. It's also completely different from the description he gave when scrying on the ritual completing in [chapter 52](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/52/Mother-of-Learning) (like a crack in reality as it breaks).

    > a carpet of smoke crawling across desolate lands

    This could just be the natural result of a volcanic eruption, which would explain why the lands are desolate. If not, it could be the aftermath of direct action by the primordial, or another party, to choke the life out of Eldemar. Possibly QI against Eldemar, maybe aided by RR?


    Could the second and third parts be outside the loop? If they involve a primordial, they probably have to be. Can prophetic dreams see into a future where Zorian has broken out of the loop?

    Edit: I'm wondering if the primordial might have gained (or expended) power from any time during the loop where the cult succeeds or partially succeeds. It would certainly be a surprise for Z&Z if the primordial breaks free by itself the moment they get out of the loop! Not that I think that's likely.

      > Could the second and third parts be outside the loop? [. . .] Can prophetic dreams see into a future where Zorian has broken out of the loop?

      That may be unlikely. Remember that prophesizing for people within the loop, as attempted by the aranea and the church at least, was impossible to do for any period beyond the end of the loop.

      Zorian may somehow be an exception, but that rubs me the wrong way. I think it's more likely that these are images of events from within the loop.
      ```

      - u/LucidityWaver:
        ```
        I was forgetting about that, yeah.

        BUT! When did he have the previous set of dreams in relation to when those things (perhaps) came to pass? Did he dream it during one iteration and encounter Xvim's marble pyramid in another? Edit: [Chapter 5, at the start of the second loop.](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/5/Mother-of-Learning) So he was definitely having those dreams during the first loop *at the latest* and possibly before entering the time loop.

        We know he's dreaming towards the end of the loop *this time*. Does that mean he can dream about his personal future beyond the current loop and into the next? If so, it's hard to believe he *isn't* exempt from prophesy beyond the loop entirely. Something like his personal future being involved, whereas that's not being the case for unmarked souls in the loop.

        Edit: This all assumes that the dreams he mentions are actually prophetic. I mean, it is actually hard to match up some of these dreams to events he's experienced.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          > Did he dream it during one iteration and encounter Xvim's marble pyramid in another?

          You're right. I don't feel he should be able to prophecize about things from future loops. Meeting Silverlake was only within the realm of possibilities once Zorian went through all those initial loops.

          You make a strong point: Perhaps, being a marked soul connects him to the broader loops of the Gate. But even so, I fail to see the reason for him to prophecize about Silverlake when she had so little to do with him and his future at that early point. Although, one could argue that having a mangled soul and a high level of discipline dramatically increases the likelihood that he would eventually search out soul mages, and since Kael was already on his way to the academy and has close ties with Silverlake. Also, there may be another link to Silverlake through his mother's witch lineage.

          Also, it may not be that the prophecy is predicting events from future restarts, but rather it's showing him events he could reasonably encounter that are important to his current situation.
          ```

          - u/LucidityWaver:
            ```
            The talking birds doesn't have to relate to Silverlake. What about the Iron Beaks? You could loosely say he was talking to them with his mind; thus, talking birds.

            Prophecies don't have to involve people and events you *already* know or anticipate.
            ```

            - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
              ```
              That's a good point about the Iron Beaks. If he's making mental suggestions to them, his dreaming brain could rationalize the Iron Beaks as talking birds.

              While it's true that prophecies don't have to involve known or anticipated events, I still feel like the seer should have some extended connection or motivation to the visions they see. But that's just me coming from the mindset of prophecies as probabilistic glimpses into the seer's possible timelines. I admit that's not really how most people view prophecies afaik.
              ```

              - u/LucidityWaver:
                ```
                > I still feel like the seer should have some extended connection or motivation to the visions they see.

                Well, the general idea with prophecy is that he will in the future, not that he does right now.

                Even if it's a form of probabilistic prophecy, nothing we've seen so far indicates any probability blind spots or nudging of probability towards certain outcomes. That suggests we're *probably* seeing the timeline with the highest probability of occurring. Which is a timeline in which Zorian encounters Silverlake and all these other things he had dreams about.

                If anything is likely to affect the probability of timelines, I'd guess that it would belong to the realms currently unreachable because of the time loop. That would suggest any prophetic dreams Zorian has would be purer inside the loop than out. Nothing in the story suggests any of this though; we don't have much information on how prophecies work in-universe.
                ```

                - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
                  ```
                  Yeah, it's all conjecture at this point. My major issue is that he's essentially telling the future across pocket universes that are only connected to each other by his, Zach's, and RR's souls.

                  But I agree that given he has a marker, which means he has so many attempts to retry the month, there's was high probability that he would eventually seek out Silverlake.
                  ```

        - u/zconjugate:
          ```
          > and possibly before entering the time loop.

          That seems fine. The following makes sense to me:

          Before he enters the loop, all the events in the loop are part of the future, so you can prophesy them. Once you enter the loop, the future is only until the end of the month.
          ```

          - u/LucidityWaver:
            ```
            That wouldn't account for his dreams mentioned in the current chapter. He's right near the end of the month already. I posit that Zorian can prophesy his own personal future (tied to his soul*) as it extends into any further loop iterations and, probably, back into the world beyond the loop.

            It would also be weird to see into the loop beforehand in that case.

            *Lore says souls are a tool of the gods to record a person's history, or something like that. May have been a work building post, but I think it appeared in-story.

            Edit: Ah, I can see one way that seeing into all loop iterations from outside the loop works. If the real world's reality touches all loop iterations or has a bridge (the gate) to them, but loops are not connected to each other.

            E2: That would mean he can see out of the loop and none of the current chapter dreams can take place until they leave.

            I was picturing the loops in series, like stepping stones where they move from one to the next. Although the loops don't seem to work like this, it works in terms of Zorian's soul 'travelling' from one to the next, and him being able to prophesy the future of his soul's timeline.

          The third eye of the wolf could be a metaphor for the heightened, human-like mind of the Silver One, kind of like how the third eye in some of our world's culture refers to a heightened state of awareness or something. It's also possible the Silver One is open to a degree, which is how they can command their mundane winter wolf bretheren so well.

  I'd like to put forward a theory about another aspect of being Open that was never explicitly stated but was hinted at a lot.

  In chapter four, Zorian jerks Zach out of the way of QI's beam without any forewarning.

  Whem Xvim threw marbles at Zorian, Zorian always knew if a marble was going to hit his head.

  It has been comfirmed that being Open will give the user prophetic dreams, so what if psychic people also get vague impressions of the immediate future?

  - u/cathemeralman:

        Maybe; on the other hand, it's not impossible that he sensed fear from someone else in the area who saw QI. Or he sensed QI's presence in some way; the lich undoubtedly has sufficient mental defences that he doesn't resort to mind blank unless absolutely necessary.

            > an aranea said that they can't detect him at all

            Chapter, please? I don't recall this.

            I do recall one of Zorian's tutors telling him that there was no way the Cyorian aranea broke into QI's mind to learn about the research facility containing the Gate (chapter 45). But that doesn't mean they're completely unable to sense his presence.
            ```

            - u/Ardvarkeating101:
              ```
              I stand corrected, I thought it was in chapter 70 but on looking for it it seems I was mistaken.  Still, an aranean elder unable to read a mind yet an untrained Zorian can sense him seems... unlikely.  He might not be able to sense him without the key marker anyway, otherwise he wouldn't have made such a big deal about being able to sense him by spamming key uses

                  I believe Mind Blank renders the person's "mental presence" invisible. If you try to read the person's mind, it'll be as if nobody is even there. But if you don't realize the person is there in the first place, you wouldn't know to read their mind to realize that they're mind is mysteriously not there.

                  ```
                  Yes, but Zorian never even attempts to read his mind ever, and makes a big point about being able to sense him with his key marker, which would be pointless if he could sense him normally.  And that's after years of mind sense training!
                  ```

                    ```
                    I'm pretty sure that the key detection has much better range and accuracy than mind sense. There's also a good chance that it doesn't require mana to use (since as has been pointed out, Zorian can operate his soul marker even in the Control Room where mana shaping is impossible), it's much harder to block or detect, and since it's tuned to specific objects, it's likely very efficient.

                      We don't have the hard numbers so I can't argue here, but if he could sense QI he wouldn't be so worried about getting death rayed in the back during the invasion in the early restarts

  Huh. Sure does adjust my belief that Veyers was a red herring way the hell downward. The immediate system 1 prediction was the Boranova heir really is the third looper, and that they had discovered a method to exit the Gate as a soul alone (presumably to soul parasite their original body), which would also be yet more evidence that Zach is the original. That said, it also sounds like a great bait-and-switch to have somebody Zach knew *through* Veyers suborn the time loop. In this theory, the third looper edits Zach mind and excises Veyers from the loop just to prevent Zach from tracking him down. At the very least it's fantastic that they found the appropriate link between the Cult of the Dragon and Veyers.

  I am surprised the lawyer didn't mention the entire company of mercenaries that were ALSO found dead of mysterious causes, sometimes in heavily warded homes, with no sign of a struggle. Maybe he didn't hear about it until after he'd panicked and put V in the chill chest.

  It's funny, I had generally imagined they'd spend a lot of time at the end of Arc 3 preparing for what they'd do once they got out. But it's starting to sound like they almost accidentally have that on lockdown. The answer might be a very simple, "Catch up to third looper early, curb stomp montage presumably set to X Gonna Give it To Ya; kidnap and tastefully edit Sudomir before dropping him and evidence off with Alanic; gather small army and boot the invaders back through their portal, possibly in a montage set to X Gonna Give it To Ya (Bass Boosted). Proceed to destroy evil, aid allies, provide payback, and coordinate better life."

  After their conversation about Zorian's soul perception, I am definitely leaning more towards a prediction of Zorian rejoining the world outside the gate as a sort of golem-lich (something like: piggy back as some kind of soul-package on Zach, Zach constructs golem with special soul anchoring mechanism, creates a simulacrum based on Zorian's soul that attaches the magical brain and physical appearance of Zorian to it, lets his soul detach from his own).
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Here's something to chew on, though: If exiting the loop meant that V's body was left soul-less, does that mean that he's the original looper?

    If he were not, then his soul would be part of the original template, so once he was gone, why wouldn't the Gate recreate his soul each time?

    Or was he indeed a bystander of some kind, who was ejected from the loop by RR?
    ```

    - u/cthulhubert:
      ```
      Yeah, I ended up thinking about that a bit after I wrote this. For some reason I think I'd gotten a wire crossed and thought of the true Controller as physically in the Sovereign Gate, when the deal is that it's their soul that's the only one not made by the Gate, which makes my ideas in the first paragraph a bit confused.

      That's a pretty interesting notion, very worth chewing on. It's a toughy to puzzle out with current information because we're already looking at a failure state. There's only supposed to ever be one person who leaves, and that's supposed to end the loop. But the Gatekeeper knows that the "Controller" exited, so we know that whatever method was used interacted with the loop's control systems. So I wouldn't be too surprised to learn that the results look like one of the control system's functions (a soul not being re-created at the beginning of an iteration: because that's the Controller's soul and they left).

      On the other hand, it does seem a bit odd. I think ultimately this makes me put more weight in Veyers being ejected just to prevent Zach from tracking down the actual Red Robe.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Thing is, I doubt that the Gate has any special logic for dealing with anything after the Controller leaves - because the loop is supposed to end. So there won't be any code that says "don't recreate the Controller's soul any more". Zorian's soul is presumably not being duplicated simply because the Gate logic says, "destroy all matter; collect all (permanent/temporary) marked souls into the Gate; recreate matter; anchor souls from Gate into their bodies; create and anchor other souls from template."
        ```

          > Zorian's soul is presumably not being duplicated simply because the Gate logic says [. . .]

          Why not? That seems quite possible:

          0. If one month has passed, gather any souls into the Gate.
           - The Gate gathers multiple souls because the controller can temporarily mark individuals.
          1. Destroy the loop.
          2. If there are marked souls remaining with a controller marker, check if there is enough energy to recreate the loop.
          3. If there isn't enough energy, then shut down the gate.
          4. If there is enough energy, then recreate a new loop.

          Maybe the creators of the Gate didn't anticipate there being three controller-marked souls, so they simply did not put in a "Validate there is only one controller-marked soul" clause.

          Or maybe the creators anticipated that shenanigans may occur. Maybe they realized that a significantly skilled soul mage might be able to, theoretically at least, make their soul resemble the controller's soul and the Gate would not be able to tell the difference. 

          Maybe the creators couldn't figure out how to make the Gate identify one soul from another hollistically, but it was relatively trivial to put a marker on the controller's soul and key the Gate to that marker. It's analagous to how it's much easier to make a computer read a barcode than it is to teach a computer to identify an item by shape, color, texture, etc. waved in an arbitrary orientation in front of the computer's camera.

          Unable to solve the problem, they decided that they'd ensure the Gate would, if it still had the energy, absolutely not collapse if a controller was still inside.

          By that same token, there isn't any code to say 'start using the template instead.' However, there probably is code to prevent the loop from crashing entirely if the expected controller's soul is not found to move into the next iteration. Even if that would trigger loop shut-down, the shut-down would be prevented by the check for an active marker in the loop (Zach).

            I agree. I think it's more likely the determines whether to restart solely based on the controller's presence instead of terminating once the exit procedure occurs. After all, once the loop is created, it costs nothing (or a relatively trivial amount) to let it continue running.

      Maybe there is just one copy of each soul it uses again and again instead of recreating it? Probably cheaper too. It doesn't have instruction to not create the body again, but the soul isn't there to join it.

          It can create souls, not too far to think it can at least reset them to what they were when they were created and have the marker and pseudomarker be something that excludes from that.

            From a safety perspective in programming, it's usually better to create copies of stuff and then mess with those copies rather than messing with the original copy and then trying to undo all the damage/alterations. This is because the changes could potentially be non-deterministic, kind of like how it's easy to carefully pull apart Legos and then reassemble them again, but it's difficult to burn wood, collect the smoke and ash, and then reassemble the wood.

            But magic of course can make anything work. Lol

    > it's starting to sound like they almost accidentally have that on lockdown

    Not necessarily.

    We don't know whether Zorian can track RR by soul marker, since he only learned how to do that after RR had already left. We don't know whether Veyers is RR, and if he's not, then we have no idea who it is. We don't know how paranoid RR is, and how carefully he'll cover his tracks after exiting. We don't know whether the ability to summon demons would convince the Ibasans to continue with the invasion even if their gate is stolen. And ZZ will have to be much more careful of their own safety once they're out.
    ```

    - u/cthulhubert:
      ```
      Oh definitely, I'm reaching for some of that, but between things like knowing who most or all of the super secret leadership of the Cult of the Dragon is, the exact details of how the Ibasans are reaching the place, and the web of support they've found, it looking a lot less like the desperate fight against an insurmountable challenge that it did near the beginning.

      I can't see the Ibasans continuing with the invasion if they lose the gate under Cyoria (or the one into Sudomir's manor), demon support or no. For one thing, Cyoria would have angel support. Their whole plan hinges on surprise, without the gate they wouldn't be able to even bring in the entire invasion force. The much bigger potential spanner in the works is pretty much RR taking out ZZ before they can implement any of their plans against the primordial unsealing and the invasion. Hell, he could even kill them but if they get a notebook with details to Alanic first, and RR doesn't know that, it's show over. The actual literal army comes down on Sudomir's or on the gate compound, and there is at the least too much scrutiny on the head members of the Cult of the Dragon for them to unleash the primordial on their own.

      Tracking down RR is definitely still the rough part, I just don't think there's much that one mage (who is described as roughly on par with Zach in 26: Soulkill) can do against them. I do think he's gonna be pretty paranoid though. He may've hoped that the gate would shut down without them able to leave, but who knows. I'd gamble against RR having a marker, since he's an accomplished mage with soul perception, I think if he'd had one, he would've found out about Zorian that way.

        It's uncertain how easily RR can track other loopers. During and maybe before Soulkill, we discover that RR was uncertain about how many people had joined the loop . . . if memory serves me.
        ```

        - u/cthulhubert:
          ```
          I've been assuming that RR could not easily track other loopers. He knew additional beings had been brought into the loop because he noticed the effect they had on the invasion. So I assume if he'd had a marker, he would've cast a divination spell on it immediately, then found and destroyed Zorian. Instead he had to find out about the aranea by mind-pillaging Zach, and assumed that Zorian was just one more of an unknown potential horde brought in by the Matriarch. (Your memory serves you correctly, I even went in and reread that section of Soulkill.)

    > somebody Zach knew *through* Veyers

    That...is an excellent point, and offers a motive for someone to soulkill Veyers. If Veyers tried to use the cult to help him out, then in the iteration where Zach tried to convince Veyers about the loop, a high-ranking cultist in contact with Veyers could theoretically find out. And after messing with Zach's mind, it would be reasonable for him to then kick Veyers out of the loop to hide the connection.

  I'm wondering about the whole pocket dimension thing. So the Orb is super special because it can be deployed or moved around very easily. Yet Z&Z make tiny portable dimensions within their first month. So why is the Orb so special? Is it just the size? Does making a pocket dimension mobile make it harder to make, or smaller?

  Two other questions about pocket dimensions, although not specifically related to this chapter: 

  what does the border of the pocket dimension look like from the inside? Is it just an empty void? Or is there some view of the outside?

  What lights them? Silverlake has a small garden, and the Orb had plant life inside, so presumably there is some light source. In the case of the Orb, whatever light source had to have operated continuously since it was last sealed, when most other magical devices had broken down.

      Quibble: Saying that the difficulty is proportional to the size just means that the difficulty of creating the dimension changes with the size of the dimension to be created; it doesn't indicate what that relationship is, whether it's linearly proportional, exponentially, or any other mathematical function.

      > Plus aquiring a spell is somewhat a political challenge : Daimen never managed to get the Gate spell for _political_ reasons.

      I thought it was simply that he never found someone that knew that spell. It's been mentioned a few times, but apparently teleportation isn't a commonly known spell among mages. I think it can't be that rare (5-20% of mages) because of the number of people we see use it, but it's not trivial to cast. Someone who knows the gate spell is even rarer, because dimensionalism is supposed to be really difficult. Zorian said something about people knowing that spell are "as rare as hens' teeth."

      > Individuals capable of making a pocket dimension do seem rare, individuals willing to share these kinds of secrets for "nothing" in return (Assuming you want to learn from many tutors, you can't afford apprentiship) are even more rare. 

      Actually, I think the way Z&Z went about getting the knowledge of pocket dimension creation is more or less the normal way. By the time someone has the necessary ability in dimensionalism, along with all the other required skills like mana perception, they would be too old for an apprenticeship. They would be full mages, and would trade for such a valuable skill with something else of equal value.

      And they're hardly trading "nothing in return". Grey Hunter eggs are probably the third most difficult thing to get seen so far in the story, exceeded only by the imperial dagger and crown. Silverlake had essentially no avenue to acquiring them, and they seem to be necessary for her potion of youth.

        Counter-quibble: Saying that the difficulty is [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_\(mathematics\)) to the size does imply a linear relationship.  If you wanted to say that any relationship is possible, one would say "depends on" or "is a function of".

    I'm guessing it's the ratio between the internal size and anchor size. The actual size of the contained space apparently puts it right up at the top of the scale for pocket dimensions, but its anchor is pocketable. Just as a guess I think Silverlake's cabin-front anchor is probably around the size of the footprint of the cabin.
    ```

        ```
        Yeah, it's pure speculation but I have this notion that a "typical" (in as much as you can say something so rare has a typical form) portable pocket dimension is something like backpack worth of space anchored to a pocket, or maybe a storage room anchored to a backpack, and a typical pocket dimension with enough space for a home is anchored to a moderately sized plot of land. We'll probably learn more in three weeks.

  So what do you guys think these could foreshadow?  
  I think the last could be something to do with a primordial in blantyrre or some sort of thing there.  
  The first makes me think of how minds connected to the great web are described as suns.  
  Not sure about the volcano.

  Edit: Looking at the continent blog post it might not be blantyrre but Ulquaan Ibasan or some other desolate place.
  ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    I think the sea of suns could be Zorian's hive mind - like the great web connections. It could also be the Bakora Gate network fully deployed.
    The massive volcano hints at the Cyoria Dungeon.
    Carpet of smoke hints of Sudomir and his wraith bombs. Not sure if desolate lands are desolate before or after the smoke carpets it.
    ```

    - u/Vakuza:
      ```
      The fact it's a sea of suns makes me wary of it referring to hydra-mind or whatever fancy mind magic he ends up creating, the simulacrum minds seem to take up a fair amount of mana and I don't think he can create a sea of minds alone.  
      Maybe it could be a mass aranean gathering?  

      If you're right with bakora gates that could mean there is some sort of UI, and a sea of suns makes a lot of gates, I wonder if there are a bunch way underground.

      If the smoke is the aftermath of Sudomirs bombs, that begs the question of why ZnZ haven't stopped him. A primordial is definitely another possibility, are there any other apocalyptic events that could happen? There was a ritual implied to have created the Xlotic desert IIRC.

      The volcano is really hard to tie to anything else we know of other than fire elementals, how could it relate to Cyorias dungeon? By metaphor of the monsters rising up and out of it? Now I'm wondering if the others are metaphors.
      ```

      - u/I-want-pulao:
        ```
        That's a good point regarding the sea, I didn't consider that. Aranean gathering could be it!

        I'm thinking something has to go wrong soon, no? Even today when I saw the chapter title I was like ok, something will go wrong. Could be interesting to see wraith bombs deployed in the time loop rather than in real life. (Sudomir has been consistently neutralized, true. But I'm not sure this is the end of him as a problem outside of the loop- ZnZ will have a TON on their plates).

        I'm thinking of the volcano - there was a reference to Zorian early on seeing the Dungeon with mage sight and it was described as spewing just massive quantities of mana. Could there be another Dungeon somewhere which they haven't tapped? Something where yet another primordial is trapped? (I'm reaching...)
        ```

        - u/Vakuza:
          ```
          ZnZ definitely have a lot to do outside the loop, though Sudomir is a major player in the invasion so it's unlikely he will be ignored unless something changes.  
          There is definitely something tough soon, especially since the crown and dagger are incredibly difficult to retrieve, though neither seem to have any relation to the dreams.

          Interesting thought about the mage sight - surprised that it hasn't been mentioned since honestly - though it is reaching in regards to the dreams, but there has to be unfounded high class mana wells around, especially if the theory of primordials causing them is true. Makes me wonder if something causes low class mana wells too...

    I don't anticipate her doing this, for the same reason that I don't anticipate Zorian invading Xvim's mind for extra training: it's much more efficient to cooperate with a willing subject.

    And Silverlake wouldn't benefit by tampering with ZZ's souls. Messing with Zach would likely trip the reset, and messing with Zorian might wreck his marker and drop him out of the loop, but neither benefits her.

    If she really wants in, she might want to *study* their markers and use them as a basis to experiment on *other* souls, and I would anticipate them being OK with that. If she has actual expertise on soul magic, they might gain valuable information from her experiments, giving clues about how RR gained a marker (or, if he was first, how Zach gained one). She wouldn't want to damage the two existing markers.

    She's too smart to make a risky attack with uncertain benefits on people willing to be allies.

        That's one perspective on the loop, but a more pragmatic perspective would be: if all iterations of yourself in the loop are indistinguishable, then giving your next iteration a 75% chance of survival is better than giving your current iteration a 25% chance.

        But even if she believes the loop exists, her best chance of entering it is willing cooperation with ZZ. If she wants to eg help take down QI and get the crown in case it allows them to bestow temporary markers, they'll gladly work with her. If she knows mind magic well enough that she could place a compulsion on Zorian to go to her at the start of the loop and restore her memories, then she probably also knows enough that she can simply hand over a memory packet that he'll willingly return to her.

        I can't think of anything she might want to do that would be better achieved by attacking them than by negotiating with them.

          > They might. If she can find a way to recreate the marker by experimenting on, say, mouse souls, then she might have a chance at giving herself one. In theory. In practice it's a long shot, certainly.

          I think what the person meant was, she needs to at least examine (even maybe from a distance) the souls of ZZ if she's going to recreate the soul marker. Thus, it's only the souls of ZZ that give her access to the time loop.

        Z&Z killed the spider and took its eggs, while silverlake never could. At this point they are simply more capable than her at combat, and attacking them will just end in one dead silverlake.

        - u/LucidityWaver:
          ```
          Although I think Z&Z may have more diverse combat options, I think that this instead stems from their unique advantage over Silverlake.

          Silverlake cannot simply try again as many times as she likes should she fail.

          She *does* have immortality though and doesn't *need* to go after this particular Grey Hunter and can take time planning or learning skills to help. Probably also has other items which are a priority.

          I agree with this. However, they probably eat food she makes. If she wanted to poison them, she probably could.

          Silverlake is someone who has survived for centuries. She did that probably by avoiding risky fights. She looks at both of these two mages who, as far as she knows, might have spent "eleven life times" as it were in this time loop. They could, in many respects, be more powerful than her.

          Working with a witch of unknown integrity, they may as a precaution be utilizing advanced anti-poison wards or treatments, much like how mages would use Mind Blank around a mind mage. She simply doesn't know and these two kids don't seem aggressive. Just the fact that Zorian is taking an extremely difficult and obscure route to soul sight says quite a lot about his character.

        Probably not, that's a pretty extreme view. No one else informed about the loop has reacted as if they were going to die. The Guardian argued that a one month reset is not death: "Others do not view destruction of copies as a problem, so long as they do not diverge excessively from the original".

  Zorian has soul sight! I wonder how that will affect his proficiency with his marker.
  Speaking of the soul marker, how does it work mechanically?
  Zorian was able to trigger the end of the loop & even connect with the orb while in the Control Room. Yet, it was said that they could not access their mana in there (only sense their reserves).
  I always thought Zorian was using his mana to control his soul marker, so I'm a little confused.
  Regardless, this was a great update!

  I've never really commented on this story here, so possibly you all have gone over this, but how deep into time loops do you think they all are?

  I mean, 400 years ago the Gods were suddenly cut off, which seems to indicate that the world was thrust into a pocket universe of some kind.

  What if, just to keep things going, someone who could create time loops did so every 29th day?

  28 days pass, the next day a time loop is created.

  28 new days pass in that time loop, then the next day a new loop is created.

  28 new days pass in that time loop, then the next day a new loop is created.

  28 new days pass in that time loop, then the next day a new loop is created.

  28 new days pass in that time loop, then the next day a new loop is created.

  ...

  I could be wrong about that 400 years bit, but if I'm remembering right then they could be in the 5,215th nested time loop.
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    That's a really interesting theory.

    People who can tell the future within the time loop feel as if they have been "cut off from the divine planes"; they are unable to communicate with angels or demons or and unable glimpse into the future. So, maybe 400 years ago or whenever the gods stopped communicating . . . maybe *that* was the start of a time loop that isolated the world from the gods, but did not isolate the world from the minor divine planes. But currently, they're in a smaller loop that *does* isolate them from the minor divine planes.

    However, if they are in a bigger, 400-year (or however long) loop, Zorian and Zach and most people who have no idea and pretty much no way to prove it one way or the other.

  I think that Zorian's decision to give himself the ability to usurp the body of another by physically thrusting out its soul when he so desperately wants to stay alive is a bad idea when you combine that ability with his habit of keeping multiple simulacrums, which sometimes set things up without him, and sometimes hide information from him, and which could decide to gang up on him and thrust out his own soul.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    They share his soul, so no, they couldn't do that.

    They have their own minds, and there might be a risk of them trying to overwrite his, but I think it's greatly mitigated by the fact that they already get to submit memory packets for integration, with whatever they feel is most important.

      The Zorian that we all know and love is, as it turns out, actually a copy of the real Zorian, and is actively planning on "stealing" the body of the real (outside the time loop) Zorian.

              They are, actually. Note the way that souls still animating skeletons (meaning they still had the bits that keyed them to human bodies enough to act as animation cores) had enough spare mana to power a ward scheme on that ship where Zorian found the simulacrum spell.

              And the reason using another person's mana is hard is because it's different from your own. If the mana came from a literal additional copy of the same soul....

        This is a relevant [TEDTalk on uploading ourselves to computers](https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_hanson_what_would_happen_if_we_upload_our_brains_to_computers/up-next) where the speaker essentially discuses exactly this problem of simulacra (he calls them emulations). Imagine you got really drunk and had a really fun time and experienced a bunch of stuff and met a bunch of people, but then you blacked out and forgot most of it? The next day, you'd maybe have a bunch of texts from people you don't really remember and you have a little bit of new information from what you can recall of the night, but most of what made you "end of the night"!you, the memories and experiences, would vanish. And yet we don't mourn that situation as the loss of a person; it's just an offshoot of you. 

        I actually find the death of a simulacrum to be more troubling than the replacement of Real!Zorian by Loop!Zorian.

        Say a simulacrum was created in the morning. By the end of the day, you have this: Zorian + (simulacrum's new experiences) and Zorian + (Zorian's new experiences). When the simulacrum dies, some of the simulacrum's experiences are integrated with Zorian, so finally you have Zorian + (Zorian's new experiences) + (some of the simulacrum's new experiences). Notice that a bunch of what made the simulacrum a person is lost.

        Using a similar logic for Real!Zorian, Loop!Zorian = Real!Zorian + (Loop!Zorian's new experiences). So, if Loop!Zorian totally replaces Real!Zorian, basically nothing of Real!Zorian is actually lost as far as memories and knowledge are concerned.

        Thus, it's arguable that the death of a simulacrum is more troubling than the replacement of Real!Zorian with Loop!Zorian because when a simulacrum dies, information is totally obliterated, whereas if  Real!Zorian dies, all his memories continue to live on in Loop!Zorian. 

        However, being a simulacrum, there are likely small imperfections in the magical brain, so perhaps the it's better to refrain from a total overwrite of Zorian by a simulacrum.

              Hmm. The spell needs a meat brain to copy?

              If so, presumably it would be theoretically possible to modify it to work on a simulacrum, but a bad idea, since each iteration would be more and more degraded.
              ```

              - u/nobody103:
                ```
                The simulacrum takes the soul of the caster as the basis for making the copy. Since the simulacrum have no soul of their own, them casting the spell would simply result in another copy of the original... not themselves.

                So I suppose simulacrums can technically cast the spell, but they would still be forking the original and not the simulacrum that cast the spell. Also, since their thoughts had subtly diverged from the original at that point, there would be minute incompatibilities between their image of base Zorian and his real identity, which would amplify the normally minor differences between the simulacrum and the original and possibly result in some kind of critical failure. So even though it's possible for simulacrums to create more of themselves, it's best to leave that task to the original.
                ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            That's easy. They can cast any spell the original could.

            Although, since the copying process is never completely perfect, it seems like a really bad idea to make copies of copies.

  Lately I've been wondering a lot what enhancement ritual Zorian will end up using shiny new blood-magic skills for (or from the similar angle, what I'd pursue if I were in an identical situation). It's a puzzler, because lots of permanent enhancements would be *extremely convenient*, but Zorian's becoming a high caliber archmage: every iota of mana he has could be used for a dizzying array of effects. Something needs to be very special to be worth permanently tying up any of his mana.

  Here are the enhancements and enhancement adjacent options I can remember or speculate exist:

  **Mana** (probably not possible): the obvious wishing for more wishes option. If we had Zach's mana pool it'd easily be like, "Okay, so staple half a dragon's worth of enhancements up one side of my soul, a gray hunter's up the other, but make sure you leave some room for a salamander+troll+hydra regeneration complex. After that we'll go look at some obscure creatures I've fought over the past thirty years of adventuring and play it by ear." But there've been a lot of questions on the wordpress blog about different options, like shifter soulmelds or necromancy, and nobody103 has mostly shut it down (that level of soul manipulation is the domain of gods and primordials). Though I'm sure ~~Flowey~~ the soulseizer will spark new rounds of speculation. My personal impression is that almost anything Zorian could do with *HORRIFYINGLY UNETHICAL AND VILE SOUL FUCKERY* he could do with more mundane mana batteries. (Which actually makes me wonder if he couldn't offload some of the simulacrum upkeep cost to a spell formula on his proxy golems.)

  **Mana Regen** (probably infeasible): almost as good would be the ability to generate or assimilate mana at the kind of speeds trolls regenerate flesh. In comments on wordpress, nobody103 implies that this is at least more feasible than adding capacity, but a creature or bloodline that actually does it is unknown.

  **A Familiar**: Zorian seems unlikely to take a familiar while in the gate, because he fears messing up his delicately, one-in-a-million damaged brand, but it's entirely possible outside of the gate. It could even help with mana, since with enough practice, using a willing familiar's mana is only a little slower and harder than using your own. Plus, if he learns more transformation magic, a willing and living creature makes an ideal template for temporary enhancements.

  **Shifting** whether mundane or magical: A lot of people are really interested in this one, though, as above, it's unlikely inside the loop. You can see why he'd want the ritual though. It doesn't even tie up any mana just to be a shifter—though it does to use their abilities. There's even the potential that a supernatural shifter would have more mana. Even mundane animal shifting has a lot to offer: superior senses, swimming or flying, strength or stamina, etc, and if he knows the ritual he can become a multi-shifter (meet my son the eagle-bear-shark). On the supernatural side, there are even more possible advantages, but you never know how big a barrier being unable to have sane kids would be to a given individual (not a dealbreaker for me). And whatever opinions Zorian/I have of his/my will, the risk of overestimating it is extreme. And there's still the fact that enhancement/transformation can give you individual advantages temporarily. The main advantage of shifter magic over transformation is the instinctual use of the other form—where Zorian is already ahead of the game on with his Openness. Sure, absolutely, the ability to call on a grey hunter's or a dragon's strength, resistances, senses, etc, at any time with no preparation is very appealing, but it wouldn't be a priority for me.  
  Some people have brought up the tantalizing idea of a shifter like soul meld with a spirit being. While you would theoretically get a lot of the spirit's (often impressive) innate magic, nobody103 gave the impression that the apt metaphor would be, "What if I tied a tender baby (my soul) to a pissed off alligator (a spirit)?" To quote, it is, "Insanely dangerous." To come out of a soul fusion sane, your soul needs to be the dominant one, and that kind of wrestling is occurring on the battlefiend where the spirit was born. You also don't get an alternate form, and there are few examples to show you how to do it. This isn't going to keep me from thinking about my DeviantArt-OC-tier Mary Sue that soulfused an angel or powerful fey or something.

  **Alteration**: given the time loop, it's almost surprising that Zorian hasn't experimented with bio-alteration magic (why not at least magi-lasik, for instance?). I guess since nobody else has had the protection of the loop, Zorian would basically be inventing a new branch of magic out of whole-cloth, and complex organic compounds are currently just out of consideration at their science/magic level. He'd be losing parts of restarts for any tests that went wrong enough, and there's no telling what continuing to grow after he stops resetting would do to changes. So I guess it makes sense, no matter how sweet and transhumanist it'd be to lace his skin and bones with carbon fiber or whatever.

  **Psychic Power**: Zorian already won the bloodline power lottery in getting this. Even if I lacked his absurd educational opportunities, if I were dropped into MoL-verse, I'd be scrambling to grab it. It's not just the intuitive mind magic and passive empathy, but the overall enhanced ability to interpret information. (It's common and potent enough that I've found myself wondering if a primordial's not involved.)

  **Ghost Eyes**: another for completeness' sake. I wonder if it'd be possible to use blood magic to make spirit perception an inheritable ability, and whether or not this "natural" version would work any better than the apparently slightly hack-y approach that potions or ritual murder give. I feel like giving my kids intuitive mind and soul powers is a ticket to getting the fam run out of town on a rail though.

  **Elemental Powers** (eg, Boranova or Grier): one of the things I really appreciate about this world is that there's no actual like, fundamental magical property to elements, they're just "a thing an elemental happens to embody". So there's no real earth magic, but there is a blob of Earth Elemental Essence that explains to a soul how to do all kinds of nifty high quality and efficient unstructured magic that involves earth and stone. I'm sure these are convenient and I'd play them up if I were already born with them, there's not a lot of reason for Zorian to pursue this kind of active ability.

  **Reid Family Bloodline**: in a wordpress comment nobody103 said that this makes them really resistant to toxins and allows them to analyze things they ingest. Honestly, between the defense and information gathering, it seems solidly worth considering trying to steal this, but being mistaken as part of The Family could be persistently annoying.

  **Physical enhancements**: I imagine there's a whole spectrum of these for strength, durability, regeneration, etc. Honestly though, unless he can find a ritual that's especially efficient (eg, peak human physical ability for 1% of your mana), I don't see him going this way. It might be emotionally satisfying to be double burly, but magic's more effective. And so long as he's not caught completely by surprise, his magic is a better defense than tanking some hit (for instance, I'm expecting him to very shortly develop a high speed "swap places with my golem-simulacrum" spell). And if he survives something he can heal later. Far better would be something that helps him not be surprised in the first place.
  ```

  - u/cthulhubert:
    ```
    **Enhanced or Additional Senses** mundane or magical: This is probably my first bet for the actual story, and I think one of the big reasons I'd personally become a shifter. Zorian seemed excited by the eagle sight and grey hunter tremorsense. More information about his surroundings is always going to be useful to avoid unpleasant surprises, and though divination can cover a lot of the info, a permanent sense can catch things even when he doesn't think to look out for them or be extra cautious. A better-than-humanly-possible mana-sense is a noticeable stand-out option, given how the better you are at sensing your own mana, the better you are at magic, period. There are also other or combined senses; consider that rabbit in the most recent chapter: two separate, enviably powerful archmages could not find a way to hide from them (plus a jewel embedded in your forehead that gives you magic powers is *always* cool).

    **Enhanced Mental Speed or Reflexes**: Another one of my top spread guesses, especially if he can nick a version with all the kinks worked out (eg, you don't feel like people are talking like the sloths from Zootopia). Imagine being able to see that disintigration beam or high-power stun wave coming and cast a defensive spell before it even gets there. This is one that that gets MORE useful the more things he can do with the rest of his mana, but it also sounds a little rare, expensive, or infeasible.

    **Nonsomnolence**: I asked nobody103 where it's possible to permanently do without sleep in his verse. It's one of my favorite oft-overlooked powers: 50% more active time (even simulacrums still need sleep), never at risk of ambush during sleep, and immunity to the whole spectrum of deleterious effects of sleep deprivation. But his response was that he decided it's possible, but has unpredictable side effects on ones mental state, taking it out of consideration for Zorian. I still wonder if it'd be possible to find a lesser version, like classic D&D elves' trancing (only need 4 hours of sleep a night and retain marginally awareness of surroundings).

    **Supernatural Accuracy**: assuming that the ironbeak's power is general enough that it'd be applicable (and not just with dropping things from the air), stealing this seems like stellar synergy with Zorian's low mana. If it works with telekinetically hurled items, this helps Zorian catch up on one of Zach's more useful abilities: you can't dispel a super dense rock. And if it extends as far as guns? That'd make it an automatic choice. Imagine just sniping the grey hunter.

    **Concealment**: Just rounding out the kinds of magical abilities we've seen monsters use, being able to go full tunnel octopus or chameleon drake has utility, but more the "let's make some potions" than "let's sacrifice 10% of my mana forever" utility.

    **Mobility**: Zorian's on record that teleportation is the ultimate tool for getting around. Flight, enhanced running speed, phasing, none of that for him. Personally, I feel like the ability to maneuver around foes and traps at high speeds in three dimensions makes a good supernatural flight worth practising, but again, probably not worth permanently tying up mana.

    **Unaging**: Another I'm including for completeness sake. Zorian probably won't work on this during the loop, but after? I sure know I'd prefer, you know, not dying. In a reply on wordpress nobody103 implies this is probably a unique alchemical potion (or series of potions) for each alchemist that does it. You can't just buy the recipe and make a batch for yourself and each of your friends. But surely between his own ability, ability to acquire ingredients, Kael helping, and maybe buying Silverlake's research notes off her, Zorian will have a leg up.

      Great posts. I agree that most of these abilities are better kept as enhancement potions in a freezer inside your pocket pocket-dimension. Some thoughts:

      **Mind Speed** Zorian may be able to increase his thinking speed and mental reaction time via mind magic.

      **Mana Sense** Pair this with mana sense and, as you said, not only do you improve your ability to improve your ability with magic (heh), but it'll be much easier for you to see how an opponent is manipulating magic before any spell effects occur. This gives the illusion of improving reaction time and strategic. Further, it acts like an invisibility, magical trap, and ward sensor unless special pains are taken against mana sensing.

      **Shifting** Bonds with powerful or aggressive creatures is unlikely to happen for the reason you stated: Shifting is not about merely getting the characteristics of the animal, but your rather melding another animal's personality with yours as well. So, doing this with a dragon would result in an individual who was probably more dragon like than human. Likewise, a gray hunter meld may result in a psychopathic, territorial, and homicidal individual.

      **Underwater Shifter** The deep ocean is a scary and violent place to be stuck with merely shaping exercises, and civilization takes place on land, so I feel that wouldn't be a great option.

      **Multiple Animals** Also, I think shifting multiple animals would take too much of a toll on Zorian's mind.

        I definitely agree that a lot of people underestimate the dangers of a shifter bond, especially to a magical creature or to a sapient creature. Like even a winter wolf or ironbeak would be too much for the average person; a dragon is on a whole other level. People point to Sudomir's insane experiment, but while there's a lot bad to say about him, weak will and personality are not among them. I do think it's within the  given Zorian's drive, he'd have a chance to, as Kael said, "—Master a grey hunter's soul and not let its urges rule [him]." But it's not something undertaken lightly, I sure wouldn't relish having to constantly be on guard lest my dragon half's personality overwhelm me.

        For an underwater shifter I was thinking more about quick travel through rivers or being able to navigate flooded ruins or caves.

        In [this worldbuilding article](https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/07/02/sapient-species-of-the-world/#comments) there were a lot of questions about shifters, and the author's responses to ones about fusing with multiple mundane animals made it sound less of a terrible idea than bonding a single sapient or magical creature.

          You make a good point that if someone could make bonding with a Grey Hunter work, Zorian with his advanced mental abilities could. However, I do feel it would make him (even more) antisocial and possibly aggressive over the long period. Sudomir kept it together . . . kind of. I mean, his sensibilities were questionable to begin with being a necromancer and all, so who's to say?

          I've been dismissing the grey hunter bond out of hand because it's so dangerous, but lemme think about it more carefully. What are the advantages?

          - Extreme durability to physical and magical attacks.
          - Extreme reflexes, strength, and agility.
          - Mana sense
          - Tremor sense.

          Critique:

          **Durability**
          Zorian has golems and simulacra. They can be made more durable (perhaps from Grey Hunter carapace?), could potentially be made modularly (detachable armors, etc. to switch up resisitances), and have the benefit of not actually being Zorian on the front lines (except in the case of simulacra if the enemy can use offensive soul magic).

          **Reflexes, Strength, and Agility**
          Reflexes and agility would certainly be useful to Zorian in a fight, although since Zorian is rarely a sole actor (golems, simulacra) or surprised (mind magic), it's a bit less important. Should he risk his mental stability for these? Well, let's say I'd definitely look into a reflex enhancement ritual because faster reaction times means faster spells.

          **Mana and Tremor sense**
          We both know how awesome these is. I would definitely take this as an enhancement ritual, but these two abilities, especially the mana sense, really make bonding with the grey hunter enticing. Tremor sense is a bit overkill because of Zorian's mind sense, but being able to navigate terrain easily and get information about aircurrents is pretty cool.

          **Transformation to Spider**
          This is where the decision becomes clear for me that this shifter bond is a bad idea. Zorian is so utterly effective in mage form that I feel turning into a spider wouldn't be of great benefit. Arguably, he could be a little more aggressive with his mana use, then upon running out, just turn into a spider and break shit, but then we're talking about melee combat when really he should have just teleported back to safety long before it got to that point.

          ---

          All in all, I'm itching to see where Zorian goes with the blood magic enhancements because it would obviate the need to deal with the Grey Hunter's psyche.

          I just took a look at the chapter you mentioned (chapter 62) and . . . I'd also like to see them draw on their life force to power spells at some point toward the end of a restart. Maybe Zorian uses it to dramatically boost his mind magic abilities and just wreck an entire base of Ilbasans by squinting aggresively at them.

          Oh, and he mentions an enhancement ritual to just passively have flight. That'd be pretty fun. If I were Zach, I would pack on a bunch of those.

          Interesting factoid:

          > a whole other level

          This phrase is actually supposed to be "a whole nother level" and is, of course, colloquial. It's an example of tmesis. [Check it out.](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/247855) :)

    Impressive write-up.

    I don't think completely offloading his simulacrum upkeep is feasible, though. Raw mana (eg from crystals) would be toxic to their delicate magical brains. Powering their bodies from ambient mana, by putting them in golems tough enough to withstand the corrosive effects, is a clever idea, but probably the limit.

    The most appealing bloodline, I expect, would be whatever Zach has. But we don't yet know if it's something that you could duplicate with an enhancement ritual.

  I dont know if this theory has been introduced, but it struck me that Zorian (zorian!loop) might want, instead of stealing the body of the zorian outside the loop (zorian!out), become a lich. It should be easier to accomplish I think, at least in the situation where he would need to snag the body zorian!out, since he wont have to take over a body.

  How much do we know about the ritual about becoming a lich in the MoLverse?

  I was trying to post here before but my new account wasnt allowed to, so I ended up creating a new theory and will try to put it all into this one post:


  My theory is that the lawyer Jornak is actually RR. Since Veyers shows the same symptoms as the spiders, it is highly possible that he was removed from the loop (template) by Jornak after Jornak managed to enter the loop. The main reason why I don't believe Veyers is the culprit, is because he is too young. A boy with basically no knowledge about magic, including no knowledge about soul magic, is supposed to have entered the loop using his brain alone? Think about how "knowledgable" Zorian was in his first iteration. He also has only one month left to find a way to enter the loop from the moment zach tells him. Veyers is also some kind of an outcast and with no help from anybody besides Jornak and maybe Zach he is supposed to be able to enter the loop? Even then Jornak would have tried to enter the loop as well. How could two kids be able to stop a grown up mage? Zach and Zorian are trying to find ways to enter and exit the loop and they are failing so far and they can be considered arch mages. But we believe that Veyers is capable of solving that without any real shaping exercises or other resources? Jornak on the other side could be perfectly capable. He might even know about the Sovereign-Gate through those books he has in his home. For all we know he might be a powerful mage, he even has basic mind magic skills. He has far more resources and the motive. He said it himself, that he was mistreated by the state. So the question would be why is he back to his normal self when he is supposed to be RR? Zorian was a part of the loop like Jornak until he got a marker. From that point onwards his soul was no longer recreated from the template. But Zorian also knows, that if something happens to his marker, he will lose everything and his soul will be recreated. So if Jornak leaves the loop, the Guardian will only find two souls with a marker and recreate everything else. The "new" Jornak does not know the loop exists and only finds a "dead" Veyers in his home and panics.


  I also had a nice idea how to "abuse" Jornak or at least find out if he is the culprit ;P ZZ could tell him about the Sovereign Gate and persuade him to help them. Zach does also have a motive to go against the State Leaders and he would believe them about the Sovereign Gate if he is RR. The main idea is that Jornak as RR found a way to enter the loop and maybe could do the same again. It is a little bit like playing with fire but this time ZZ are far too powerful to lose against him. They dont have to let him actually enter the loop. It would be enough if he is capable to find a way for people to enter. That would definitely prove he is RR.


  I am pretty sure he did some experiments with Veyers. But in the end the ability to remove people from the loop-template is supposed to be used that way. Get rid of useless people and maximize your own possibilities. One more important reason to test the ability on Veyers, is that it will never be public. Remember how everybody was talking about people (the mercenaries killed by RR) found dead in their homes at the start of the month? RR definitely does not want Zach to notice somebody else is inside the loop. Dead people will definitely change something and Zach would eventually notice.
