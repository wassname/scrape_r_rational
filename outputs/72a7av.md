  Now we know why the wandering bard [choked on her tea when she first looked at Anaxares](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/07/03/villainous-interlude-stormfront/):

  > “You’re a class act, Tyrant,” she said admiringly, still breathless. “Haven’t seen anything that brazen since Traitorous.”

  She could tell the Tyrant was working on turning Anaxares into a Name.
  ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  I did NOT see that coming. At all.

  **Mend** seems like a very useful aspect for Anaxares. It seems to be on the hero side of the ledger. What other aspects will he come into?
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I didn't understand how did he get named but boy didn't I enjoyed it.

  I'll have to re read this chapter and maybe the previous one, people keep saying this was hinted heavily but I was totally blindsided.
  ```

  - u/um_m:
    ```
    Ah, it was explained/foreshadowed in the previous interlude.

    >“An offer was made to the Secretariat,” she said. “Penthes as well.”

    >The pale-skinned man chewed thoughtfully.

    >“He aims to be Hierarch, then,” he said.

    >How the Tyrant had managed to exert pressure on Bellerophon enough they would agree to this would have to be found investigated. Such a lever was too useful to be left solely in the boy’s hands.

    >“Assuming he secures all the votes,” Amadeus said. “Intent?”

    >“Broader games,” Scribe suggested. “His methodology requires constant opposition.

    Basically Tyrant bought off all the other states to agree to make Anaxares their leader.
    ```

  - u/um_m:
    ```
    I think Tyrant understood Anaxares's **Wish** for death and used his gained power over Anaxares's superiors to prohibit Anaxares's death and (not sure after this point) ... a traumatic shift in Anaxares's beliefs/brain patterns to trigger it?
    ```

  - u/JdubCT:
    ```
    The council of Bellerophan made him their leader. Almost all rulers in Calernia get a name when they ascend to the throne.

    That's why he became so angry. There's only ever been one "Person of Value" before.
    ```

    - u/Oaden:
      ```
      He has the name of the leader of all free cities, not just Bellerophan
      ```

      - u/JdubCT:
        ```
        Really? That's... more troubling than I thought it would be. The Tyrant is really playing an interesting game here.
        ```

- u/sharikak54:
  ```
  Not sure why everyone's so certain Anaxares is on the side of Evil.  He really doesn't seem to care for either side (he certainly doesn't like Kairos), and we do have examples of Names that are "grey".   ~~I also thought Bellerophon was nominally Good, though I could be wrong about that.~~  Especially with his Mend aspect, I see Anaxares as very not-Evil.
  ```

  - u/Oaden:
    ```
    > Bellerophon 

    I'm pretty sure they are one of the two evil cities.
    ```

    - u/sharikak54:
      ```
      Whoops, you're right. 

      "Of the seven Free Cities, four were aligned with Good – Nicae, Atalante, Delos and Penthes. Bellerophon and Stygia openly embraced the Gods Below, while Helike waffled between one side or another depending on whoever ruled them at the time." Book 2, Interlude: Precipitation.
      ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    Hierarch is the leader of the free cities which iirc have an ongoing divide between Good and Evil. The leader being neutral on the topic would make a lot of sense, as Evil men leading Good polities or vice versa doesn't sound like a long-term solution.

    Then again, the first Hierarch was also the last until Anaxares stepped up.
    ```

  - u/chloeia:
    ```
    That reminds of a thought I had early on... what if Catherine becomes the Grey Knight?
    ```

    - u/Arganthonius:
      ```
      I also thought that. But unless the real story is about a truly radical shift in the setting cosmos, the Name of Grey Knight doesn't exist. 

      Cat will come into an existing name (theoretically the Black Knight, presumably something unexpected) unless she does something like burn down Heaven and Hell, or create a new Role by altering society.

      It depends on how big the story gets. I hope it doesn't overreach like I felt Worm did.
      ```

      - u/TwoxMachina:
        ```
        Seems like a lot of new names popping out tho.

        Adjutant. Hierophant
        ```

    - u/Taborask:
      ```
      Erraticerrata commented on one of the earlier chapters that he "couldn't think of a culture that would produce a name like Grey Knight" so that's unlikely
      ```

    - u/Oaden:
      ```
      Its touched on in some intermission. Names come forth from the culture that spawns them, and there isn't a culture around that would spawn a grey knight.
      ```

- u/Schuano:
  ```
  I'm not sure what the tyrant's game is.  

  He's terrifying and seems to always be winning....

  But I have to believe that every dread emperor was like this, before Malicia. The name of Tyrant is designed with a definite arc and it doesn't end well for the Tyrant.  

  The Tyrant seems crazy and unconventional... But that's what makes him conventional.  He's a flying fortress crazy emperor.  He is setting up the heirarch to kill him, and his lack of longevity is making him more nihilistic, but he's not a threat the way the calamities are.  

  He thinks he's got the Calamities and Bard all figured out... But why should we take his word for it?  Every Tyrant knows that their days are numbered by their names. This Tyrant is only different in that he was going to die any way.    

  I guess that's why Bard isn't worried about the Tyrant, because the Tyrant won't break the story... Rather he is the pressure release of all of the Capital E evil that Praes hasn't been doing for 20 years.
  ```

    Exactly right. Pretty much embodied by the starting quote in book 3, chapter 7:

    >*“Ah, but being defeated was always part of my plan! Yet another glorious victory for the Empire.”*
    >
    >– Dread Emperor Irritant, the Oddly Successful
    ```

  - u/Taborask:
    ```
    Also: what the hell is the Bard's game? Good already always wins, what long term goal could she possibly have? Short of killing the hell gods and ending the world
    ```

    - u/Schuano:
      ```
      That's what I'm saying. The Tyrant of Helike doesn't threaten "good always wins" because he's mustache twirling evil of the old Praesi style.   The Story can make one of his name powers fail at a crucial time or just remove him.   

      Black and crew are a threat to good always wins because they are using institutions instead of names.  He is still more of a threat to the Bard than the Tyrant.
      ```

      - u/Taborask:
        ```
        But we don't know the degree to which the heavens can manipulate things. It's more straightforward with named, but that doesn't mean they can't intervene directly if the locus of power shifts to big groups of non-named individuals. Also, given that good always wins I'm inclined to believe the hell gods are in on it and aren't actually trying to beat anybody
        ```

      - u/CFCrispyBacon:
        ```
        Black and his crew don't have to be a threat to "Good always wins".  If Good and Evil are constrained to narratives that fit within civilization instead of breaking down into endless warfare, Black and crew have won.  Ex: If a Good campaign to is to run for President instead of raising an army in revolt to overthrow the government, or an Evil plot is to become Vizier by manipulating votes, stay in power by manipulating votes, and be deposed by a Hero touting election reform, Black's won.
        ```

        - u/Schuano:
          ```
          Exactly, he is undoing the Bard.  They talk about the end of the age of wonders, but Black is doing even more to remove it.  When he's done, there won't be any more epic quests.  

          The Tyrant fits within the narrative.  Black is changing the meta narrative which is why he is an existential threat to the Bard.  (And I think the Bard isn't a person so much as the keeper of the Story.)
          ```

- u/JdubCT:
  ```
  PS: Did anyone catch the implication that Ashen Priestess was the sacrifice for Anaxares? He removed a weight from creation to shift it elsewhere.
  ```

  - u/um_m:
    ```
    I don't think so. Tyrant was answering Anaxares's assertion that Bard is losing because Calamities managed to kill one of her heroes. Tyrant is saying Bard allowed her to die because Bard could (and managed to) use her death/sacrifice to achieve something.
    ```

    - u/JdubCT:
      ```
      I also caught that. But if you look at the forces directing the ritual and the fact that there's suddenly new named walking around I wonder if that wasn't the balance that was achieved.

      We'll know sooner or later I guess.
      ```

- u/JdubCT:
  ```
  WHAAAAAAAAA? I'm so *happy* with our newest named. He's going to be the greatest monster of them all.
  ```

  - u/Mingablo:
    ```
    I respectfully disagree. I believe he shall become the ultimate saviour of the world. I would have said hero but this series convolutes the meaning of the word.
    ```

    - u/JdubCT:
      ```
      IIRC *The People* are on the side of Evil. But we'll definitely see.
      ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  I... need to reread this chapter. And maybe a few of the previous ones with Tyrant. I can't tell if he's crazy-sane (as in, he's totally nuts on the ground but has a clear view of the "big picture") or just completely biased like all good Tyrants seem to be. I really don't know what to make of this chapter, but it sure sounded interesting!

  * **Mend** is obviously one of Hierarch's aspects, but it feels like he failed to use it when it was mentioned? I'm not even sure what kind of mending could happen, because it sounds like a very rift within the fabric of his society. 

  * Tyrant obviously sees at least part of Black as he truly is - the wheels and cogs. Think he sees it right about how Black incorrectly views himself, and how he'll react as the Calamities start to die?

  More later as I think of them or reread...
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The use of **Mend** seems paradoxical, though I suspect he used it inadvertently on himself. The laws were broken, and **Mend** should fix things so the laws so they are not broken AKA making Anaxares the Hierarch. However, Anaxares has to be named to use an aspect so he is already the Hierarch. What it did was allow him to accept that he was the Hierarch. Additionally, it may have caused the other ruling members to outlaw his suicide / death so that Bellerophon is whole.

    Random thought, I wonder if Bellerophon is a name derived from Isabella the Mad, though it would make more sense if she was the first Hierarch and she was not. However, I could totally also see the first Hierarch picking a random crazy lady out of the crowd to be a military leader / namesake of the nation.
    ```

    - u/Ibbot:
      ```
      Or from something more like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellerophon).
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Thank you, learn something new every day.
        ```

- u/Mgmtheo:
  ```
  I think Hierarch's understanding of the law is going to translate into a Black-esque understanding of the laws of the universe which will be terrifying.
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    I don't think so.

    Anaxares is intelligent, yes, which could translate to Black-esque machinations, but the laws specifically are something he memorized out of necessity. I don't think the details of the byzantine Bellerophan legislature will help him understand the wider world significantly more than the knowledge of how to tie his shoes does.
    ```

- u/hoja_nasredin:
  ```
  So It is not clear to me. Is Hierarch the ambassador or the tyrant? Who was speaking?


  P.S. Still promoting my theory that Robber is the Assassin.
  ```

  - u/Oaden:
    ```
    Anaraxes is the new Hiërarch.
    ```

  - u/Taborask:
    ```
    But thief said she'd met assassin, and didn't recognize him when they met in liesse
    ```

    - u/GeeJo:
      ```
      > But thief said she'd met assassin, and didn't recognize him when they met in liesse

      I'm not on board with OPs theory. But this doesn't really prove much when it comes to *Assassin* of all people.
      ```

- u/everything-narrative:
  ```
  [Obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKopy74weus)
  ```

- u/Oaden:
  ```
  so... is the Ashen priestess dead or not? the paragraph regarding it is a bit confusing

  > “No no no,” the Tyrant said. “You’re looking at it all wrong. Even if my pretty little mages had been untroubled, the Beast would have survived. The Healer should have too, life split in half with her sister. A touching story of sisterly love, if you care for that sort of thing. She didn’t because she was a sacrifice. Her weight was stolen, because there was another use for it. With nothing you can only trade for nothing.”

  She should have surived but didn't cause she was a sacrifice for... what? It can't be for Anaraxes ascesion cause he's alligned with evil.
  ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    I think the implication is that Bard sacrificed her for some unknown reason, much like she did with Bumbling Conjurer.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      > much like she did with Bumbling Conjurer.

      Refresh my memory - for what reason did Bard let the Bumbling Conjurer be sacrificed?
      ```

      - u/ATRDCI:
        ```
        William and Thief theorized that since Bard and the Conjuror were background humor characters, Bard intentionally made sure her "character" developed, so the story would kill off the less developed Conjuror
        ```
