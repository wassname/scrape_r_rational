  I decided not to go with the magical translation, and to make Athos earn his linguistic abilities that hard way.  Don't worry; he's got a nigh-perfect memory, so he's going to learn fast.  There will be less and less babble as time goes on.

    It's working! While it slows the pace a little for those of us reading it serially, it'll be way more satisfying when it pays off, and binge-readers will fly right past anyway.

    Characterization is so important to a good story, and I'm enjoying how Athos, Marcus and Marza are learning to navigate each other's personalities. Plus some unusually opinionated and snooty Interface text.

    I'm excited to learn more about this world. What infernal plots await in Hellsport? What's Mr. FloatyBox's problem, anyway? Did Athos crash the funeral of the world's most powerful human? I'll be tuning in next time!

  Ahh yet another chapter in my favorite story of dog and his pet human!

  Just want to say, I am all on board the point and learn approach language method. It's not very important and lots of stories skip this part via setting or just handwave (am looking at you Rain) but learning in story even if not detailed is way cooler (mega cool YOLO daaabs*)
  Anywho if this doggy is to be a rational clever protag, may I suggest for him or some of his new friends to give him a spiky collar. 
  It's not full armor, but it has precedent IRL as used against wolves to prevent neck bites, maybe add a little frilly bow to make him seem not as scary.

  Oh yeah, good on Marcus for thinking ahead on villagers being afraid, big dogs are terrorific!
