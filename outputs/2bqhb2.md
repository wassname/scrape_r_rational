  I have the sudden distressing impression that Herrún is being fed the secrets of millions of black-alignment undead.

    If so, I wonder if using Helm of Opposite Alignment on those particular undead would be feasible.
    Edit: Probably not, if there are millions of them.

  In which Loki serves pizza...er, Chinese...er, curry.  Also, answers to the most important riddles of the universe start to unfold.

  As it says in the author's note, be aware that I'm on the opposite side of the International Date Line from usual.  It's Saturday for me now; if you're seeing this on a different day from usual, that's why.

  Waidaminute....

  Afi can scry on the town until it moves.  But the town's in an extradimensional space.  Only its entrance technically _moves._  Doesn't that mean that Afi can spy on 90% of the town any time no matter how far they run, unless they completely tear down and rebuild the town?

  Also, if I'm inferring right, either Jake doesn't fit into the world's alignment system or.... _Jake is eeeeevillll!_  Bwahaha!  His pally pallies are gonna have a fun time with that one.  I wonder if their protocol allows for evil overlords, or if they have to hogtie him and put a helm of opposite alignment on him 'for the land.'

    Afi can scry on the *room* they were in.  But that room wasn't in Grǫfhamr proper, it was in a Mage's Magnificent Mansion which was inside Grǫfhamr.  An MMM is its own extradimensional space, i.e. its own demiplane.  When it ceases to exist, they will put up a new MMM, which will be a brand new demiplane with no relation to the first except that it might have the same floorplan.
    ```

    - u/drageuth2:

      Yeah, but Ice-fi had to walk through at least part of Grǫfhamr to get there, didn't he?  It'd be smart of him to make a circuit of the town to get perma-spy on it.  So he'd be able to spy on the portable hole 'corridors,' but not the rope trick and MMM 'chambers.'  So not 90% of the town, but if he can see the entrance from the parts he _can_ scry...
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Valid point. I'll clarify that. Thanks for pointing it out.

  >she'll be inherently grateful to her creators

  This seems like interesting wording. Given that this is a resurrection ritual, I don't think that the people participating in the ritual could count as her creators. Does a god even have creators? 

  >We can manifest in our temples, or in places where someone is threatening ascencion or otherwise poses a danger to the world or to the gods themselves.

  Hasn't Loki and many other gods manifested to Jake without fulfilling these conditions? Arros and Ilara could perhaps count under a danger to the world, but not Shailos or Loki. Unless what they're doing doesn't count as manifesting

  Also, Jake's Orbital Bombardment trick appears to have curried favour with 2 gods, Loki and Arros. I think that it would clearly be in his best interests to come up with more creative uses of munchkinry such as that. Not that I have an ulterior motive here or anything. Would other acts of munchkinry such as the commoner railgun or celestial brilliance cannons also impress the gods?
  ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    The infinite wishes cycle definitely counts as attempting to ascend.
    ```

  We know that Loki is playng both sides.  He is probably thick with Afi (just like Jake), given Afi's apparent penchant for munchkinry and Loki's Neutral alignment.  The trick with destroying Herrún's temple to kill her off, then getting Grǫfhamr to sacrifice their secrets to bring her back is probably something they worked out together.

  Afi could be a pretty good ally, if they could get a Helm of Opposite Alignment on him enough times to get past his will save.  Could Loki be planning to do this to Shailos?

  The black flames are most easily explained by lots of evil undead making sacrifices.  The only way to prevent Herrun from being predisposed to evil would be to either compensate with more sacrifices from good people, or find the undead and HoOA them all.  Or maybe HoOA the evil Herrun, if that is possible.  To incapacitate the undead long enough, I'm thinking polymorph them into tree sloths, or something else that is slow moving.

  How broken is Polymorph Any Object, anyway?  Can one turn an anthill into a secret city containing billions of virtuous elves with all kinds of secret magic arts, say, to sacrifice to Herrun?  On the other hand, maybe actually use their secret arts for the war effort directly.

  The truthful-mandatory questions could be phrased in a way so as for the honest answer to be a set of numbers, with each one corresponding to a numbered piece of paper with a scenario written on it.  There could be hundreds of them.  By asking "what is the complete set of numbers corresponding to claims regarding this reality", the truthful answer would be a simple set of numbers with no room for deviation.

  The complete-honest questions could be more open-ended, e.g. asking for the 100 most likely plans to work, sorted from most likely to work to least likely to work, with percentages indicating probability in the event that the plan were attempted with no new information.
