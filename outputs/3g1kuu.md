If you want to just dive into the story, [Jump in here and enjoy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10pEQp8tBxZrx9k5PhdsADgIrNr5IHF3E_aoxLs0yXTw/edit).

If you're wanting to know more about the story, it's a first-person POV story told from the side of the main male protagonist, with planned flashback chapters from the POV of the gynoid protagonist.

The setting is heavily inspired by several post-cyberpunk works of fiction, such as The Diamond age by Neal Stephenson and Saturn's Children by Charles Stross, but I've so far managed to find my own twists on the post-scarcity not-quite-utopia.

So, this is the first place I've dared to put any of this work out there, mainly because it took me several painful rewrites to get an introduction that fit the setting without being too long.

    Thank you for the odd compliment, I guess?

    I found it very difficult to make a synopsis that didn't sound like the first episode of a harem comedy, even if in the writing I found myself far from that genre's tropes. 

    I've never really gotten much enjoyment out of that genre, an utterly whipped male protagonist with no real character traits against an increasingly unlikely number of female deuteragonists gets annoying quickly.

  Definitely some cool stuff. You're making me super jelly of your future society :P. If you intend to continue it (and posting it on the internet), please consider putting it on fictionpress.net and linking it so we can get automatically notified about updates.
