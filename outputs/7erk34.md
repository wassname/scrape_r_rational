## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So... time travel paradoxes.

  * One of the ways that authors of time travel stories try to avoid paradoxes is with "stable time loops"- time travel where anything you'll do in the past has already happened, and altering the past is impossible.  While this avoids the grandfather paradox, I think it necessarily causes a different paradox- it seems to create things out of nothing.

      Suppose you have a stable time loop time machine.  You withdraw $100 in cash from your bank, give it to yourself a week ago, and then past-you deposits it.  Where did the $100 in your account actually come from?  You might be able to do the same thing with a million or a billion dollars, even if you're flat broke before and after the time loop.

      I think this problem exists whenever some chain of causality stretches from the start of the loop, through the end, and back to the start.  If causality runs in a loop, then that chain of causality is independent of the rest of the universe.

  *  Another way authors avoid paradoxes is with multiple timelines- when you "time travel", you're actually entering a parallel universe that for some reason is identical to the past or future.  This does a much better job of avoiding paradoxes in general, but I think a variation of the same problem can still crop up.

      Say you travel the future, withdraw $100, return to your own timeline, and deposit it.  In this future timeline was an identical version of you who did the same thing- traveling to a timeline where yet another you did the same thing, and so on.  Since each timeline would be identical, there would seem to be an infinite number of them, each taking money from another.  So, you have a kind of [Hilbert's Grand Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel), with an infinite number of $100 accounts and one $200 account, but, like in the previous example, seemingly no causal origin of the money.

    It gets a good deal worse than that. Have you ever read a short story called "By His Bootstraps"?

    In short, a man gets bought to the distant future by a guy with a time machine. After a fair amount of stuff happening, in short, it turns out that the man who operated the time machine to get him there is his own future self - that is, his future self was only there to use the time machine because his younger self had been pulled into the future.

    That's not just a matter of the paradox creating something out of nothing. That's the paradox creating *itself* out of nothing.

    This is how physics works. That is, if time travel turns out to be possible (which I doubt), it would be within a single stable timeline. Quantum physics ensures this.

    > Where did the $100 in your account actually come from?

    So, if this were an actual hundred dollar bill that you give to yourself in the past, this wouldn't be possible. Each iteration of the loop (from the bill's perspective) would add more wear and tear until it breaks down. It's not stable.

    But you're putting it in to a bank, and then withdrawing? Fine. The actual object moved into the past already existed before the timeloop and will exist after. The only complaint is that it simultaneously exists twice within the loop. Of course, the whole premise of time-travel is that a thing moves into its own past, hence simultaneously existing twice.

    > If causality runs in a loop, then that chain of causality is independent of the rest of the universe.

    That's why it's called a [closed time-like loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve).

    If time-travel is possible (in the sense of people being able to travel into their own past), such causal loops are almost certain to arise, if only to prevent an intelligent actor from actually carrying out his plan of killing his own grandfather.
