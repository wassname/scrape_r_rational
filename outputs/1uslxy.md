## Rationalizing Sherlock [spoilers to 3.2]

### Post:

*Followup to [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1uoi1v/the_bbc_program_sherlock/).*

We've seen [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1uoi1v/the_bbc_program_sherlock/cek5wd4) [pretty](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1uoi1v/the_bbc_program_sherlock/cekcgxj) [valid](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1uoi1v/the_bbc_program_sherlock/cekond4) [objections](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1uoi1v/the_bbc_program_sherlock/cek8cox) to the rational status of the BBC program *Sherlock*. So I'm going to make a rationalfic for it. Or work on one, anyway. It shouldn't be that hard, as it's mostly there already, but it'll involve a reworking of the plot, anyway.

So. Disregarding [TV Tropes Sherlock Headscratchers page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/Sherlock) which I'll be consulting, what are some particularly egregious plot elements or anything that *you* think need correction? And what would you look for in a good Sherlock rational!fic?

  The [sitty-thing](http://25.media.tumblr.com/039459e4f585ba610d0ed1aa41531e93/tumblr_myyv2yWULP1staho1o1_1280.gif) was not really egg-shaped. At best slightly oblong. This gaping flaw of geometric description completely destroyed immersion for me.

    Oh, entirely. I'll fix that, definitely. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

  Moriarty needs a *complete* rework. His canon motivation is essentially just boredom, but any rationalist on that level of thinking could come up with half a dozen different pursuits that don't require a suicide. Even if you regard all the other humans around you as pets rather than peers, his solution seems a bit extreme.

    Intelligence does not imply values.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    So you don't like his suicide? Or getting caught in the robbery, I suppose?
    ```

    ```
    Moriarty *isn't* a rationalist. He's a bored sociopath.
    ```

      He possesses informed intelligence - we're repeatedly told by trustworthy characters that Moriarty is very smart and meticulous in his planning. That should compute to rationalist.

      /u/eaturbrainz is right about values though - there are very smart people who don't want to be alive. The scariest blog I know of is called "The View From Hell" and is written by a suicidal rationalist. See also "anti-natalism".

        Or, how about, since I've been summoned ;-), I *don't* see those, since I'm already much too vulnerable to this sort of thing?

          I was going to say "I discourage fellow victims of [memetic immune disorder](http://lesswrong.com/lw/18b/reason_as_memetic_immune_disorder/) from looking at these", but carriers of MID are almost pathologically compelled to look at things they're told they're better off avoiding. And of course now I've managed to get the worst of both worlds.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Oh dear.  I might as well go test the strength of my vaccination.
            ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Response: wait, you rated *this* crap as Memetic Hazard?  It's just another jumped-up intellectual who can't get past his own biases towards despair, misanthropy and nihilism!  Not a spark of real wisdom!

            Meta-response: wow, I *am* well-vaccinated.  That would actually have worked on me not so long ago, and I would have spent the evening trying to bend my mind away from the abyss.
            ```
