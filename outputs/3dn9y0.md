  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  Back in the '90s I started to write a story (before I realized that I wasn't actually good at writing stories) with this kind of theme. In this story, the skills belonged to a separate artificial "work persona" that was managed by an implant that basically took over the ego and tied new memories to that persona being present... there was no association chain for the original persona to access them. Lots of handwaving, and it's been 20 years so I forget the details now.

  This persona started out being identical to you. It was technically an organically-assisted AI, and was legally part of the implant, and had access to resources in the implant... but it had no continuity of personality or consciousness apart from when it was activated in the brain it was implanted in. It was aware of your life outside, because your regular memories continued to lay down without whatever tags or whatever tied them to the implant.

  With the implant off, you really didn't even think about your job, you went into work, you got switched off for 8 hours, and you went home. Theoretically, it's supposed to be like you turn on the implant, the new memories "come back", but you're still the same person. After all, the processing is going on in the same brain. You work for 8 hours, and then the extra memories and skills go away, but you're still you.

  But eventually the implant stopped being able to find associations for memories laid down while offline, it's non-work life became dreamlike, and then lost. Now you have a version of you that sees losing the job as an existential crisis...

    But, the version of yourself that sees losing the job as a self-imperiling proposition is only conscious while on the job; it would be potentially possible to quit while not running the implant. In that case, the job-persona would know, and work out ways to prevent its own destruction...  
    Hey this is neat. It would be fun to have a narrative from either perspective, or both.

  A somewhat similar idea occurs in the short story (and movie) "Paycheck". That's a more indiscriminate form of memory-wipe, but it's implied that this has taken the place of (or is a more extreme version of) an NDA.

  A funny inversion of reality.  A military blog I like follow sums the real state of affairs as: "You can't classify math." 

  <Semi topical old man kibitzing>
   It is absolutely disheartening how man science fictionish seeming military technologies copied by competitors can be summed up as; once they knew that we could do it they started doing the math, cribbing the papers our researchers wrote, and the like.

  TLDR Oppenheimer knew what he was talking about

  This means human clouds should be a thing. Employees are a commodity, characterized only by processing power, short-term memory capacity,  and ability to focus.

  Companies store decades-long thought processes that were run on dozens of employees through the history of company. In fact, they run these thought processes 24 hours/day jumping between people in different timezones.
