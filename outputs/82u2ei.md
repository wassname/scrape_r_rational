## [Biweekly Challenge] Meditation

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7z8jb8/biweekly_challenge_the_mentor/), the prompt was "The Mentor". Our winner is /u/vi_fi, with their story, ["The Emperor's Final Meditation"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7z8jb8/biweekly_challenge_the_mentor/dun8us0/). Congratulations to /u/vi_fi for their ninth win!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **Meditation**. TVTropes has a [useful notes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Meditation) page with a lot of links. I believe that meditation is of particular interest to the rationalist(-adjacent) community, largely because of its intersection with mindfulness and metacognition. In movies and television, meditation tends to be "magical", in the sense that it's really hard to show someone's thoughts on screen and is really easy to just show them sitting still and then snapping their eyes open with a sudden revelation. In prose, I think it's a good deal easier, because you can give the internal thoughts of the character and relate thoughts to metaphor, which gives a fair number of descriptive options. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, March 21st.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Premortem**, here referring to a specific technique first coined by Gary Klein in [The Power of Intuition](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Intuition-Feelings-Better-Decisions/dp/0385502893). In a pre-mortem, you imagine that something has failed, then imagine why that would be the case, as a sort of extension of [security mindset](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html) or [red team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team) thinking. For the purposes of this challenge, you don't need to center your story around an actual pre-mortem, only around someone catching a mistake before it happens (or failing to catch a mistake, but at least putting in the effort), which should sufficiently open up the story-space. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 3/21**. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/82u2v1/challenge_companion_meditation/).

      Aww, thank you :)

      (I think this is probably about average quality for my submissions. It's also a good representative concerning the themes I like exploring, so do check out my other submissions if you liked this one.)

          Nice! In this case, I can recommend [The Library Unpublished](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498), a somewhat longer work of mine (30k words). It might be up your alley :)

    >I agree with Carl's assumption that the leaders of the cult probably don't understand the signal. Claiming to do so gives them leverage over the members of their cult, which explains why they want to keep its true contents under wraps.

    Or maybe they do understand the signal, enough to know that recording it onto a machine is a Really Bad Idea. Maybe they tried to scare away the viewpoint character for her own good, and her uploading the program has guaranteed that something horrific will soon happen. You ever read the SCP Foundation? Our hero could be about to unleash a doomsday-level memetic monster onto the world, yet she's so smugly assured of her own intelligence that she will never stop to consider that she might be in the wrong (until it's too late).

    >I smile to myself. There's an even bigger hole in their plan: what will they do if I let that information go public? At that point, there's no incentive to kill me anymore. They will already have failed to keep the status quo, and killing me is unlikely to help them in facing the new situation.

    Why is the viewpoint character assuming that the cultists she's dealing with are as rational as she is? Maybe they'll kill her out of spite. How does she know that killing her is unlikely to help their goals? Maybe they'll kill her because she's been linked to their weird Earth-signal monster. She has no idea what's going on - she doesn't even have definite proof that the person(s?) who broke into her home and drugged her really are connected to the cult. They could be someone else entirely: her evidence is purely circumstantial. She doesn't even know if they really were malicious! They might have been trying to initiate her into their cult, by finishing her journey to signal-comprehension via chemical aids. *She doesn't know.*

    For a character who is supposed to be rational, she seems pretty irrationally confident in her own judgement, especially when it comes to judging the character of people she's never met. She also seems irrationally ignorant of the scope of her own ignorance. She's just discovered that meditation enables one's brain to pick up an encoded signal produced by the Earth's electromagnetic field, and now there's potentially a weird meditation cult trying to stop her research, and at no point does she consider that she might be out of her depth. She could be a monkey dancing on the Elephant's Foot and not even know it.

    I felt quite pleased upon realising that [(spoiler) ](#s "the police officer is almost certainly {one of}/{in cahoots} with the cultists!")

    Or, to phrase it as the thoughts occurred mentally:

    [](#s ""Those cultists' plan had so many points of failure!  She could have woken up when they were getting the door open, or before they'd finished drugging her!  Police might not have gotten there before she woke up, and she could have safely disposed of the pills before being caught with them!  The police might have a way of detecting that the room had been broken into!"")

    [](#s "\"*Or* they got there so quickly because they were waiting nearby for the call, the protagonist couldn't have thrown the pills away because the police officer was carrying them in the first place and never let go of them, and there were no signs of a prior break-in because the police officer was the only person to break in.  For the drugged state, maybe her food outside was stealthily drugged, or maybe a gas was released under the door, or maybe the part about the neighbours was a bold-faced lie and none of the neighbours knew anything was out of the ordinary; it's notable that the police officer mentions lab results, but then just says 'You'll hear from us', no blood test or custody or anything else, just the intimation that the pills are going to be tested (not necessarily any evidence that she's later told the truth about them having been tested), so ultimately nothing to suggest that she'd truly been drugged.\"  \"Quite amusing, if it was a misunderstanding on that part:  'Hah!  We'll strong-arm her by showing her how we have agents in the police and how they can easily destroy her life!' 'Eek!  They're clearly trying to scare you by showing you how they can secretly sneak into your room without the police knowing and drug you without you knowing and set you up to be misunderstood by the well-meaning authorities!  Fiendishly powerful!'\"")

    I do the thing with the cherry soda (except that it's green tea in my case, and a favourite pen I always use for exams). No idea whether it helps, but as long as I believe strongly enough, the placebo effect is on my side!

    (Not studying seems unwise, though.)
