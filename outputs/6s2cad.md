## [META] A suggested rewrite of the 'Characteristics of Rational Fiction' in the sidebar

### Post:

I've several times seen people in other forums whose first reaction to the current list of characteristics in the sidebar is to claim that these are the characteristics of *any* good fiction. Though I think they exaggerate (e.g. Lord of the Rings is very good fiction, but not 'rational' at all), I nonetheless myself feel the sidebar description doesn't really capture well enough at all what we mean with 'rational fiction'. 

I propose the following description instead:

**In Rational Fiction:**

* The author displays respect for the value of intelligence, reason, forethought, and preparation.
* The author attempts to explore the moral and material implications and consequences of the elements in the story, and to investigate alternate solutions to presented problems, even if they violate the usual conventions of the genre. 
* The author doesn't use 'narrativium'. The characters should not rely on events happening as they would happen in a story, unless there's explicitly a force conspiring to make them happen this way. (Any usage of destiny, divine providence, miracles, willpower-produced powerups, etc, must be justified in-story or not used at all.)

----

I also suggest adding a couple links (to a separate page) below the list for what we would consider "rational fiction", and what we would *not* consider such, by explaining how the above apply or don't apply.

For example:

----

**Examples of Rational Fiction:** 

* **The Martian:** [spoilers](#s "The character calculates the calories he needs to survive long enough for rescue, and begins on a plan to grow enough food, using materials available to him in unconventional ways. When an accident reduces the available supply, he immediately starts on a different plan that will have better chances of helping him survive, rather than just hope he can live with fewer calories than he calculates.")

* **The Misenchanted Sword:** [spoilers](#s "The cursed sword that is magically bound to the protagonist is treated reasonably: Its advantages are used like the advantages of any powerful tool, its disadvantages like the disadvantages of any ailment, and the very fact that it has the qualities it has is in part just a mishap, not any sort of destiny.")

**Edge-case/controversial examples:** These stories are sometimes considered to belong to the genre by readers who appreciate their rational merits, but they'd be probably excluded because of other reasons. Also the authors themselves have explicitly rejected the claim that these stories belong to the rational genre.

* **Worm:** [spoilers](#s "Rational elements include characters seeking to investigate and logically apply their powers in often unconventional ways, as well as the author seeking to have the plot proceed naturalistically. However this setting is mostly deliberately designed so as to *preserve* the conventions shown in the superhero genre (examples: powers mentally manipulate and drive people to conflict, tinkertech cannot be mass-produced, the Simurgh goes after people who would use their powers in globally-transformative ways), rather than fully explore how superpowers, if real, would violate these conventions.")

* **Unsong:** [spoilers](#s "Though the story does seem to fully investigate the moral and material implications of elements introduced in the story (e.g. companies mass-producing names of God, the moral implications of the proven existence of hell), the plot deliberately relies on narrative logic to the point that characters actively seek to utilize it. Aspects of the setting like 'This is not a coincidence, because nothing is ever a coincidence' are probably at the antipodes of exploring a setting rationally.")

**Counter-examples (Non-rational fiction):**

* **The Lord of the Rings**: [spoilers](#s "The plot often relies on the characters believing that things were 'meant' to go one way or another (Frodo taking the ring to Mordor because this task was 'meant' for him), but the dependability of this helpful divine providence isn't and can't be seriously investigated, even though it definitely impacts the story (Gandalf's resurrection). Alternate paths to the reached decision of taking the ring for its destruction to Mordor, are again not seriously investigated (using Tom Bombadil, sending the ring overseas, using the ring against Sauron), merely touched upon only to be dismissed. The whole story effectively relies on faith that whatever divine providence chose Frodo would reward all of them for choosing the most morally uncompromising path -- rather than on any discussion about what their chances of success are, given different courses of action.")

------

So, what do you all say? Do you feel my bulleted items summarizes what we mean by 'Rational fiction' better than the current list? Would you support using this in the sidebar instead of the current list?

Btw, I understand my third bullet may be slightly long-winded, and is probably trimmable down to "The author doesn't use 'narrativium'. The characters should not rely on events happening as they would happen in a story." (Basically the exceptions I list are possibly not worth the space needed to explicitly list them. Let me know what you think about this as well.)

    I agree; I talked about this definition [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6gd97l/meta_the_definition_of_rt/dippn6n/). Rational fiction is defined by being populated by Level One+ Intelligent characters. It's not about sending a message, or exploring a theme, or being set in such-and-such setting, or having plot with a particular direction; it's about goal-driven characters interacting with each other or environment. In a way, it's akin to a role-playing campaign, except the author is both the DM and the players.

    It's not *just* good characterization. An author could define a good character, give them good development, then sneakily put an Idiot Ball in their hands, or have them not think about something, or make something happen to them to force them to conform to the plot. Rational fiction is fiction where characters with good characterization remain true to this characterization in spite of plot convenience.

    Or, looking at it from another perspective... Yes, I suppose it would be true for any all-around good fiction. Rational fiction, then, is merely fiction that is *good in certain ways*; to be precise, in ways related to characters and characterization.

      I agree with this, and think Diskworld might be a useful example.

      I like Diskworld.  The characters are fun.  They totally make sense within the context of their stories.  It's good fiction.

      But the setting requires a fair amount of suspension of disbelief.  It's stylized, rather than realistic.

    > As far as I can tell, the only hard requirement for something to be considered "rational fiction" is for the characters' patterns of reaction be consistent and realistic. 

    That would be a bad definition, because it'd just mean we want good characterization.

    I believe the quotes by EY you bring up refer to the writing of intelligent characters, not rational fiction per se.

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      > because it'd just mean we want good characterization

      One of the things that really ticked me off at school was when the teacher would wax rhapsodic about the characterization of the most bizarre and strange people.

      For example, near as I can tell none of the male characters in Jane Austen's works consistently behave like a human male would ever behave, no matter when the story was written or set. They are clearly created to fill a slot in the story for Emma or whoever to react to. But Austen's books are "great works", so Austen's characterization is automatically "good".

      So when you say "we want good characterization" you need to qualify that to mean "for the characters' patterns of reaction be consistent and realistic", rather than the artistic meaning of "good characterization" that basically everyone in the literary fold cleaves to that has nothing to do with writing realistic or rational (or even credibly flawed) characters.
      ```

  - u/LupoCani:
    ```
    Hmm. I think this is a very accurate definition, in the sense that it allows us to easily point and say "Yep, that's rational" or "Nope, not rational".

    I am not sure, however, that it is a good introductory explanation. I think there is still value in elaborating around it, what we use these L1 characters to accomplish and why. Sensible world building, rewarding the reader's thinking, solvable problems, all that. Ideally, all of these things follow from hang L1 characters, but I think it deserves explicit expanding upon.
    ```

- u/EliezerYudkowsky:
  ```
  It's certainly far better than the current list.

  I'll remark that the whole phrase "rational fiction" is not something I invented or would have invented. "Rational*ist* fiction" makes sense.  And there's another genre to point to that isn't rationalist fiction, but grew up around it, and the stories in that genre do have something in common.  But I wish this genre had been called something other than rationalfic.  "Rational" is a dangerous word and should only be used judiciously and probably in front of well-selected audiences who understand it as a reference to [a quality of cognitive algorithms](http://lesswrong.com/lw/eta/rationality_appreciating_cognitive_algorithms/); for most people "rational fic" is just going to sound like "fic the author thinks is somehow better or correct".  It's not smart to ever describe a character as "rational" because, again if somebody hasn't been introduced to the cognitive-algorithms viewpoint, the word "rational" often doesn't mean anything to them other than "correct", and whenever they see the character do something they think is incorrect, they'll go "Lol that character isn't rational!"

  Empirically, if I were to try to describe what Luminosity and The Last Christmas actually do have in common, I would say the most standout literary characteristic is a hard-to-define open-world quality of thinking, like Skyrim vs. Half-Life.  The character's thoughts don't *appear* to stay on a plot-determined railroad, they seem to think all over the place and look all over the place because that's part of what it means to be sane.  Now, the masterful author will have it add up to the plot anyway, but you should still get the impression that the "rational" character lives in cognitive Skyrim.  Rational!Isabella Swan sees a vampire and thinks about the global implications of immortality, not just a hot guy in love with her--although she thinks about that too and at great length!--because her thoughts aren't following what another author would have taken as the railroad.  She thinks what *you* would think and that's a key appeal that good rationalfic tries to capture.

    Part of the problem with the branding is that there was no conscious effort involved in branding. It was literally just ... some people decided that HPMOR was in a dry spell and wanted a place to collect fiction like it, so they took over /r/rational. There wasn't really any debate on terminology in regards to public perception, attracting an audience, etc.

    Similarly, the sidebar as it exists now is only slightly modified from [this post in HPMOR](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rkkam/in_light_of_the_recent_slew_of_recommendations/) from four years ago which dates from prior to the creation of this subreddit and any sort of community here, let alone community consensus.

        It is slightly more involved than that. A move is possible, but requires this subreddit be locked down and the front page spammed with posts saying "this is the new home". Anything less just splits the community or breeds uncertainty.

        - u/InfernoVulpix:
          ```
          I'm pretty sure we could do a thing with CSS to make /r/rational automatically redirect to another subreddit.  That would be the smoothest way to get the community from point A to point B, but if you automatically redirect I think that would prevent access to all the previous threads here.

          It should also be possible to have CSS put something in front of the subreddit proper with a link to the new home while we lock the original.  We could also do the minimal-damage version of staying on this subreddit but changing what we call it.  It'd still be /r/rational but we wouldn't say 'rational fiction', we'd exclusively say the new term.  In any case, even if it isn't trivial to organize a smooth transition it's well within our abilities, and if doing so increases approachability for the genre then it's probably the smart move to do so.

          The bigger problem, really, is finding a better name.  Too many potential names have the exact same pitfalls as rational, so we need to be very careful that the name actually describes the genre but doesn't sound elitist.

              But even if not, that still leaves the minimal-damage option of just keeping it /r/rational but calling the genre something other than rational fiction and your option of locking the sub and forcing a migration.  Both would still work.

        Not exactly.

        Some time ago the rules were altered to focus more on posting fiction rather than discussion / ideas threads, which had become spammy. This is probably the change you're thinking about.

        The people posting relevant content (fiction) were given an allowance to post discussion threads here and there while non-contributors were discouraged from doing so.

        Such discussions are otherwise relegated to the weekly and monthly threads including Monday General Rationality, Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread, Off-Topic Friday, Thread, Saturday Munchkinry Thread, Monthly Recommendation Thread, etc.

        To go back further, the sub was at some point a different community entirely, though dead and abandoned. The HPMOR community took over moderation of the subreddit and repurposed it for rational fiction. Older posts would have been removed.

        Alternatively; perhaps the turning point was when the sub contributors had already discussed a lot of the things they wanted to discuss with their 'shiny new community' so there was less interest in general.

    There is a common failure mode which goes like this: I like X. X should be more popular. The name of X must be turning people off.

    Usually the answer is something else, however. Yes, people think that "rational fiction" is arrogant and snooty. Also: Atheists. The solution of Richard Dawkins? Refer to ourselves as "brights". 

    People don't think "Rational fiction" is pretentious because of the name, they think it's pretentious because we *genuinely do* think rational fiction is better, just as atheists *genuinely do* think they're smarter and more correct. If we come to websites and advertise ourselves as more rational, we'd better be able to back it up. And the fact is that many of the rationalist stories spread around are simply not very well-written as stories, and rely mainly on geek-appeal to be successful. Take those two factors together, and that's when you turn people off.

    I think we'd be better off fixing the fundamental flaws of rational fiction, not worry so much about the branding.

  Your description of rational fiction seems fine to me other than that I don't think the edge-cases category is particularly useful to list explicitly. And I have also witnessed the phenomenon you describe where people claim that the current description just describes well-written fiction rather than carving out a unique genre.

  But I also don't think that the contents of the sidebar really need to be up for democratic debate. I am in favor of the mod team having unilateral power over what the sidebar says and not spending a long time trying to reach a consensus among the entire community. One of the purposes of having leaders is to avoid the problem of 7000 people having to come to agreement on every small issue.

      We're not, so far as I can tell, debating what *is* rational fiction—I'd want to see as much community involvement as possible in a conversation like that. But I think we all kinda [know it when we see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio), and we're just deciding how to vaguely gesture at it in a couple of sentences in the sidebar here.

  I think the sooner this problem gets addressed the better, because the current version will only be keeping gaining momentum if it’s left untouched. It’s much easier to change something now when there’s only yet ~7,000 readers here than further down the line when the number of active participants will increase.

  I can also see fans or authors trying to label a story as a rational one even if it’s full of your regular bad writing tropes just for the additional bragging rights and\or marketing opportunities (e.g. advertising through [TVTropes.org/RationalFic,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic) through relevant goodreads bookshelves, etc).

  One problem I can see is that different people will have different definitions of what they consider a rational story. One thing that can help with this is trying to collect a bunch of different definitions and see which ones become “adopted” the most. 

  Another thing would be formulating the definitions in such a way that they will allow for a “sliding scale” of rationalism on multiple axes. If we try to break down the “rational” genre into smaller “sub-tropes”, then here are some of the themes (regardless of how “justified” they are) that are usually prevalent in the stories that people often associate with this emerging genre: 

  1. rational protagonists
   * rational inhabitants — an expectation that *all* characters in the story will be acting in a rational manner
   * straw Vulcan pseudo-rational characters
   * or, in contrast, perfectly rational characters — an example of a story suffering from this was HP:MoR, in which the protagonist had, for instance, near-perfect emotional intelligence and control. 
  * intelligent protagonists
   * intelligent inhabitants
   * [straw intelligent](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius) characters 
  * lack of plot railroading
  * lack of out-of-character reactions
   * lack of [zombie characters](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent) — characters that at best don’t act like humans. Or ones that act like videogame NPCs (no real intelligence, [no peripheral vision,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeripheralVision) [no attention to their surroundings,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens) [or to the weird things happening around them,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor) etc)  
  * lack of [bad writing tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadWritingIndex); lack of simplistic plot design, character designs, worldbuilding, etc; high-quality writing; etc
  * character actions (and discussions) relevant to morality, ethics, pragmatism, and ruthlessness
  * deconstruction of the genre, the worldbuilding, the canon-material, etc
  * highly ambitious protagonists, gradually improving protagonists
  * munchkining, 
  * high-conflict environment
  * technological uplift 
  * emancipation of the masses, fighting for equal rights, etc
  * ersatz mimicry of rationality sub-tropes, which can be confused for an actually rational story and generate something like a cargo-cult reaction (see [EroGamer](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6oje2x/nsfw_the_erogamer_a_quest_about_a_girl_who/) for a recent example) 
  * and so on.

  So just giving the genre a one-sentence (or even a several sentence-long) definition and then interpreting that definition by the letter of the law would not solve the underlying problem. Instead, these “sub-tropes” should be collected and then combined into different flavours of a rational story, with the faulty ones being discussed and eventually pruned out of the “meta-definition”.

  ---

  Another problem is that it can be unclear sometimes whether or not the story’s trying to abuse plot devices (e.g. deus ex machina) or characters’ decisions (e.g. “was that character’s behaviour an OoC moment for railroading the plot or would such a reaction from him be a reasonable one in the given circumstances even if it seems to be in-congruent with his past actions?”) or if the author sees those developments as the natural, unforced outcome for whatever reasons. But maybe that’s something that should be addressed as a separate discussion of its own.
  ```

- u/ketura:
  ```
  I can appreciate the sentiment but I'm not a fan of your definitions as laid out. One of the primary benefits of the current sidebar list is that it's straightforward to identify: Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil". The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources. The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.

  These are concise and contain zero jargon. I can take any work and see if they do or don't do these things. By contrast, comparing a work to three bullet points that go "the author displays respect for X", "the author attempts to explore X", and "the author doesn't use narrativium" might be helpful when explaining the concept to someone but does not feel conducive to actually judging a work. Does an author who has a low view of intelligence while yet having characters who are *actually* intelligent mean the work is not ratfic? Should we care so much about the author and their intent or focus when identifying works that would be enjoyed by those who also enjoyed HPMOR or Luminosity or Metropolitan Man? 

  If I was to take your proposal and attempt to rework it into a set of guidelines that are easier to use for evaluating fiction, I think they would look more like this:

  * Characters utilize intelligence and reason while applying their resources to overcoming their obstacles, and incorporate a reasonable amount of preparation and forethought into their plans. 

  * The premise of the setting is respected and sufficiently followed through: rules breed limitations, actions lead to consequences, and events propagate and echo through the world proportional to their actual impact. 

  * Characters react to the world with something resembling realism: they explore and experiment with the rules of the world, challenge unfounded restrictions, and investigate and react to alternate solutions to their problems. 

  * The plot flows around the events of the world and not the other way around: plot is the effect, and not a cause. 

  Personally I am also against listing specific examples in or associated with the definition. Doing so is a form of anchoring and doesn't actually let us know if our definition is any good; I'm sure eventually we would like to have moved away from any definition that has "something like HPMOR" as fundamental, and unnecessarily restricting ourselves (and newcomers) does not move in that direction.

  - u/LucidityWaver:
    ```
    Just throwing in my support here.

    I find these points to be more accurately descriptive of what rational fiction is than points suggested in the op. This also addresses the issues and points I've seen raised in previous discussions on this topic, and the definition of rational in general.
    ```

- u/beetnemesis:
  ```
  I've only read a handful of what this community generally calls rational fiction, but a LOT of it seems to sync up with [Deconstruction,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction). 

  (Deconstruction: breaking down a a story (or aspect of one), seeing how it works, thinking about how it would work in the real world, etc).

  Rational fics seem to often incorporate [Reconstruction,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction) as well. 

  Worm, for instance- deconstructs TONS of superhero tropes. It takes elements that are common in a superhero story, and goes, "What if this was true in the real world? How it work? How would people react to it? Would it be justified, or would people never do that in real life?"

  Worm also reconstructs a ton, providing good, in-universe reasons as to why people do these superhero tropes. 

  Rational fanfic, especially, shows this off- the writer wants to pick apart and deconstruct the original canon, but if you make it too different you often lose the feel of the original. The trick seems to be, examine, explain, justify. Put it back together better than it used to be, without losing the original spark. (Good example of this would be [Pokemon: The Origin of the Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) IMO.


  ____

  So, after all that said... I guess I'm just agreeing that this is a tough genre to define? 


  Or, how about this: If we just called all "rational" stories, "Deconstruction" stories, what would we be missing?

    Right, I wanted to list examples which are NOT ratfics because of a very important reason, even though each of them seems to satisfy atleast one of the other criteria.

  I think many people conflate the term "good fiction" with the concept of "fiction I personally enjoy."

  There's plenty of fiction that's widely regarded as good (by critics, fellow authors, and/or readers in general), but clearly does *not* fit the characteristics of RF. But if an individual sees those RF characteristics as requirements for "good fiction," it's likely they're just personally drawn to stories with those traits.

  Basically, I don't think this reaction to the characteristics really speaks to any issues with the characteristics themselves.

    > But if an individual sees those RF characteristics as requirements for "good fiction," it's likely they're just personally drawn to stories with those traits.

    No, these people weren't really fans of rational fiction, it's just that the rules as currently written don't really communicate the distinctions of the genre. For example 'The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.' Does that mean no stupid people are allowed in these stories? Does it mean that the character are not allowed to fail? Does it mean that they're never allowed to have luck contribute?

    I think my bullet point that the story displays a respect towards the use of intelligence actually captures the point we want to make better than the one we currently have.

    And the other 3 rules seem to mostly sneer at non-rational stories. Things that happen must have a reason, is that really the best way we have to express what we want to say? Gandalf coming back from the dead did have a reason, God made it happen. But that reason doesn't actually suffice for rational fiction...

    > Basically, I don't think that reaction to the rules really speaks to any issues with the rules themselves.

    If the rules don't communicate well enough the category of stories we are talking about that's an issue.

  I don't think your controversial examples are reasonable (except that they are controversial).

  I would say instead that there's a difference between stories _about_ intelligent actions of characters, and stories _with_ intelligently acting characters.

  Worth The Candle, HPMOR, Drop of Poison, etc - these are all in the first category.

  Worm, Unsong, etc - these are all in the second category.

  I don't think I know a single piece of mass-appeal fiction - or fiction that wasn't explicitly written to be "rationalist" - that fits the first category.

  I'd call the first category "rationalist" - as that's a thing it's attempting to be - and the second "rational", as it accurately describes the fiction.

  Perhaps it would be useful to provide a list of counterexamples? Not on the sideboard, but perhaps in the wiki, we could expound upon each bullet, what makes it rational, what well-known works have the trait, and in particular, what well-known and respected works do not have the quality. This would make it plain that these qualities are distinct from "good" fiction. If there are no counter-examples, then perhaps we don't need the bullet.


  Also, I'd like to see something about how rational character often reveal their knowledge and plans to the audience, showing their reasoning in the process.

  >* **Worm:** [spoilers](#s "Rational elements include characters seeking to investigate and logically apply their powers in often unconventional ways, as well as the author seeking to have the plot proceed naturalistically. However this setting is mostly deliberately designed so as to *preserve* the conventions shown in the superhero genre (examples: powers mentally manipulate and drive people to conflict, tinkertech cannot be mass-produced, the Simurgh goes after people who would use their powers in globally-transformative ways), rather than fully explore how superpowers, if real, would violate these conventions.")

  I realize this is tangential, but *wherefrom comes this infernal idea* that Worm is lesser for "merely" building a classical-looking universe instead of "truly" exploring the idea?

  Deconstruction and reconstruction are different things. Normally, I'd try to elaborate on each and try to demonstrate why they are different things or equal value, but it's almost 04 in the morning. I'll have to settle for something more aggressive to convey the same emotion.

  *Deconstruction has been done*. Yes, supervillains should just sell their inventions on the market. Yes, Superman should fly grain to Africa. Yes, armies of vigilante enforcers is trouble, and yes, between injuries, expenses, and government crackdown it's all unsustainable. *We know*.

  Looking at this situation, where a thousand people have let the cart loose and seen it go into the ditch, *of course* you should add steering wheels to it. You shouldn't "truly" explore its path by sending it into the ditch *again*, as opposed to "merely" keeping it on the damn road. Anyone can nail together a house per blueprint band watch it collapse. Changing the blueprint so you still have a house, but it doesn't collapse, is hard. Worm is not lesser for setting out to solve the problems of classical heroes instead of watching them play out for the umpteenth time. Problem solving is the next, more advanced step to problem observing, not a lesser copy.



  >* **Unsong:** [spoilers](#s "Though the story does seem to fully investigate the moral and material implications of elements introduced in the story (e.g. companies mass-producing names of God, the moral implications of the proven existence of hell), the plot deliberately relies on narrative logic to the point that characters actively seek to utilize it. Aspects of the setting like 'This is not a coincidence, because nothing is ever a coincidence' are probably at the antipodes of exploring a setting rationally.")

  Again, objection. Rationality can only amount to describing reality. If you live in a reality where NIEAC, then NIEAC is a real thing that you can and should work with. It does not detract from its rationality.

  Finally, as for the definitions you propose... Nah. Like the sidebar, it hits on some points and completely misses others. It's just a question of what is which. Too much emphasis on world exploration, too little focus lvl-1 intelligence. To enthusiastic on some points, and a tad exclusive.
