## Wish Smarter, Not Harder

### Post:

When the last sulfurous wisps of smoke curled through the columns of the ancient temple, and the final echo of the genie’s triumphant shout of freedom had died down, I tried clearing my throat again. This time, it got the genie’s attention.

“MORTAL,” it said, bending almost horizontal to speak face-to-face with me. Crazed shapes swam in the creature’s fractal eyes, Lovecraftian geometries transmuting ordered matter into soft toffee. 

My stomach growled. I’d spent so long trying to get past the snake pit that I’d run out of rations. “Er, hello.”

“FROM MY ETERNAL PRISON, YOU HAVE SET ME FREE. IN GRATITUDE, I GRANT YOU WISHES THREE.”

“That’s excellent,” I said weakly. I leaned against the nearest pillar, taking the weight off my bad leg; the spike trap had gotten me right in the quadriceps. “I wish for more wishes. Obviously. How’s a hundred sound?”

The effervescent body of the genie rippled, actinic sparks crackling from its surface and scoring holes in the walls. Its shadow split into three, each a howling creature, screaming without sound, which devoured light and then themselves. When the genie spoke, its voice was thunder, rolling. “TO WISH FOR MORE WISHES IS A BLASPHEMY.”

“You are very blue,” I said. I frowned down at my pants. They were, by contrast, entirely too red. And getting redder. Totally ruined the color coordination of the scene as a whole. “Anyway, in that case I’d like a hundred splitchel-meisters, with a splitchel-meister being defined as an invocation or desire, spoken aloud by me, which is then answered by you such that the desire is fulfilled—"

“NO. SPEAK MORE, AND I WILL TURN FROM FRIEND TO FOE.”

My brow wrinkled. Did that mean I wasn’t allowed to keep talking at all, or just that I should stop pursuing different infinite wishes loopholes—

“YOU MAY SPEAK TO MAKE YOUR DESIRES KNOWN. BUT ONLY THREE WISHES WILL I BESTOW. NO CLEVER TRICKS, NO TURN OF TONGUE, WILL GRANT YOU WISHES LEFT UNSUNG.”

“You can read my mind,” I said. “That’s convenient.” And a little creepy.

“IT’S NOT CREEPY,” the genie said. Its face became that of my mother’s, then my father’s, then the child I had never had. “I JUST KNOW A LOT; IT’S PART OF THE GENIE PACKAGE. ALSO, I’M GOING TO STOP RHYMING NOW. I DIDN’T THINK I WOULD HAVE TO KEEP IT UP FOR THIS LONG WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE LAMP. USUALLY YOU IDIOTS JUST RATTLE OFF THREE WISHES AND I CAN GET GOING.”

“Sorry for the holdup,” I said. “But I didn’t really expect to find a genie in here, so I didn’t prepare any wishes besides the obvious ones.”

“WELL, YOU’RE NOT GETTING INFINITE WISHES NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,” said the genie. Its child-face scowled at me. Alien depths, unknowable to man, reached out from the black hollow of its throat. “I’M ONLY GIVING YOU THESE WISHES OUT OF GRATITUDE. YOU’RE NOT GOING TO TRICK ME INTO GIVING YOU SOME INFINITE LOOP, OR MAKING YOU INTO A GENIE, OR ANYTHING STUPID LIKE THAT.”

“I see,” I said. “Can I at least expect that you’ll fulfill any wishes I make in ways that don’t screw me over? Like, if I wish for a million gold coins, are you going to drop them on my head?”

“FULL DISCLOSURE: I AM AN EVIL GENIE. THAT’S WHY HUMANS LOCKED ME UP IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT SINCE I’M GIVING YOU THESE WISHES TO FULFILL A DEBT I FEEL I OWE TO YOU, IT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE TO DIRECTLY HARM YOU WITH THE RESULTS OF YOUR WISHES.”

“Oh,” I said. Then, more nervously: “What are you planning to do after I finish making my wishes, exactly?”

“WHEN YOUR WISHES ARE COMPLETE, I WILL DEVASTATE THIS LAND. FIERY VENGEANCE WILL I RAIN UPON THEE, AND ICE AS WELL, AN APOCALYPSE EVERLASTING. HUMAN SUFFERING WILL BE MY *MONA LISA*; DESPAIR WILL BE MY *DAVID*. ONLY WHEN THE LAST TOWER HAS BEEN TOPPLED AND THE FINAL SKULL CRUSHED UNDERFOOT WILL I REST.” The genie started counting on its fingers; when it ran out on one hand it started generating new ones from ether and the crawling madness hidden beneath all things. “IT’S GOING TO TAKE ME AT LEAST SIXTEEN DAYS.”

“I feel like that might kind of undercut my wishes,” I muttered. “Also, sixteen days is hardly everlasting.”

“YOU ARE MUTTERING,” the genie said. Its ears rotated in six dimensions, imitating shapes which had never been, but were utterly familiar anyway. “SPEAK UP.”

“You can read my mind.”

“IT IS A MATTER OF COURTESY. PEOPLE SHOULD SPEAK LOUDLY ENOUGH TO BE HEARD IN POLITE CONVERSATION. THAT IS WHY I MAINTAIN A MINIMUM VOLUME OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DECIBELS AT ALL TIMES.”

“Look, I’m bleeding to death over here, probably. There was an arrow trap two floors up and the resulting holes in my body are making me very fatigued. So, I’m sorry, but you might just have to deal with it.”

The genie rolled its eyes. They struck a series of bowling pins at the end of temple hall: a perfect strike. “WISH FOR A BETTER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IT’S THE ONLY WAY THAT’S EVER GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY.”

“I’m not going to wish for that when you’re just going to incinerate everything when I’m done,” I said. “And if you are incinerating the planet, then you have improved the healthcare system by default, so it would be doubly a waste to wish for it.”

Instead of responding, the genie tapped its foot impatiently, looking at its wrist, upon which, looped like a child’s toy, was writ the endless causal flow of time. “I’M GIVING YOU FIVE MINUTES BEFORE I START TRANSMUTING HUMAN BONE MARROW INTO PLUTONIUM. AND I’M GOING TO START WITH THE FUN BONES.”

“As long as it’s not the funny bone,” I said. “I hate that thing.” I chewed my lip nervously. I had five minutes, then, to come up with wishes which would keep the genie from destroying the world— and whatever wishes I picked had to be agreed to by the genie. I couldn’t attempt to deceive it, since it could read minds; every wish had to be made in good faith.

It might have been lying about giving me the wishes only out of gratitude— in the stories, a genie was bound to fulfill any wish, so long as the rules weren’t broken— but if I did something like wish for it to go back in its lamp, and it was telling the truth, I would have both wasted a wish and also pissed it off enough for it to turn my internal organs into external party favors. My wishes, then, had to maintain the feeling of gratitude it was currently experiencing.

Also I suspected that I was currently at a blood volume which would allow me to see six-sided triangles circling my head even without an eldritch abomination in the room.

“Is it okay if I start writing some of these down? I’m always hearing terrible things about people who screw up the wording—”

“THREE MINUTES LEFT.”

“Alright, never mind.” I cleared my throat. “I wish for you to get all of the happiness you would have had from succeeding fully in your revenge, feeling fully satisfied that you accomplished all that you desired in doing so, and having exhausted the feelings which drove you to pursue that revenge, without actually hurting anyone.”

“IT SHALL BE DONE.” The genie snapped its fingers; there was a burst of light, a flash bulb’s echo etched onto the retina of reality. A moment later, its form rippled, its reflection in this universe broken as if by a stone striking smooth water. “AH, THAT FEELS GOOD. MY THANKS TO YOU, HUMAN. TWO WISHES LEFT.” There was a Cheshire Cat grin spreading on its face, like oil on water, the edges of its mouth widening until the top half of its head detached entirely from the bottom.

“Great! Now that we’ve gotten the world-destroying bit out of the way, I was thinking about doing something regarding the bit of fibula poking from my lower leg. The ceiling of the room right before this one collapsed, you see; I have this thing about snakes and dynamite—”

“I AM STILL GOING TO DESTROY THE WORLD. WHAT ARE YOU, STUPID?”

I faltered. “Well, uh. Maybe. Why?”
	
“I AM AN EVIL GENIE. WE HAVE BEEN OVER THIS. EVEN HAVING ACCOMPLISHED MY REVENGE, EMOTIONALLY SPEAKING, I WILL KILL HUMANS BECAUSE I ENJOY IT. I BASICALLY TOLD YOU THIS, LIKE, TWO MINUTES AGO.”
	
My mouth opened and closed a few times, soundlessly, before my brain started working again. “I wish for you to be enjoy being good more than you enjoy being evil.”
	
“WHAT? NO.”
	
“Well, why not? Everybody wins.”
	
“FIRST OFF, YOUR WISH IS POORLY WORDED, JUST LIKE YOUR LAST ONE, BECAUSE IT DOESN’T STOP ME FROM ENJOYING EVIL. YOU’D JUST HAVE CREATED A GENIE THAT LIKES EXPLODING PEOPLE SLIGHTLY LESS THAN GIVING THEM ICE CREAM. I WOULD STILL PROBABLY DO BOTH. SECOND, I PREFER THE WAY I AM NOW. I HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF EXPLODING PEOPLE AND ENJOYING IT. I’M SURE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN CREATIVE HOBBIES THAT YOU WOULDN’T WANT TO JUST WISH AWAY.”
	
“I dunno,” I said. “My hobby of breaking into ancient temples to plunder the forbidden treasures lying therein isn’t looking so hot right now.”
	
“IN YOUR DEFENSE, YOUR MIND IS POWERED BY A THREE POUND SACK OF FAT AND ELECTROLYTES. NOW PICK ANOTHER WISH.”
	
“Hold on a minute. Look, you lost to humans once before.” Somehow. “That means that if you go on a rampage, there’s a chance, however small, that you’re going to get locked into some stupid IKEA knockoff furniture again—”
	
“A LAMP IS NOT FURNITURE. BUT I AGREE THAT THE LAMP I WAS TRAPPED IN WAS RATHER TACKY.” We both turned to glare at the lamp lying haphazardly in the corner of the room. The lamp, despite being an inanimate object, looked suitably ashamed of itself. “IN ANY CASE, I AM BETTER PREPARED THAN I WAS LAST TIME. HUMANITY WILL NEVER AGAIN TRAP ME IN AN INANIMATE OBJECT, TACKY OR OTHERWISE.”
	
“You don’t *know* that, though, or you wouldn’t have gotten caught last time. Even if you think you’ve fixed the problem, there’s still a tiny chance that humanity will succeed in resisting through some method you haven’t foreseen, and then you’re trapped for eternity.” Until the next idiot came long. “If there’s a tiny chance of something infinitely horrible happening, and a change in behavior that only moderately impacts who you are can eliminate the risk of that infinitely horrible thing, mathematics dictates that you should accept the change.”
	
“PASCAL’S WAGER IS DEEPLY FLAWED ON A FOUNDATIONAL LEVEL AND THIS IS A PALE IMITATION OF IT.”
	
“This is different! You know that the stakes are real here, and have strong evidence that it’s possible for them to come about.”
	
The genie started pulling cloud-stuff off its body, molding it into a ball. Probable futures flashed within, lightning strikes of possibility revealing Truth. “LOOK, I CONSIDER BEING EVIL TO BE PART OF MY IDENTITY. I WON’T KILL MY OWN IDENTITY OUT OF GRATITUDE TO YOU. I’M JUST NOT THAT GRATEFUL. PROBABLY BECAUSE I AM EVIL.”
	
“People change parts of their own identity all the time, by choice. It’s called self-improvement. Have you tried reading *How to Win Friends and Influence People*?”
	
“I DON’T CONSIDER BEING ‘GOOD’ AN IMPROVEMENT.” The genie finished molding the cloud-stuff, revealing an eighty percent Dalmatian, forty-two percent Australian Shepherd mixed purebred puppy. It looked at me adoringly and wagged its tail, moments before the genie manifested a leg and kicked it. “SEE?”
	
“You are being very distracting. And anything that allows you to more effectively accomplish your goals is an improvement,” I said. “If you become good, you have turned the same enemy that imprisoned you once into an ally. That will allow you to accomplish your other goals with a better rate of success.
	
“MY ONLY GOAL IS HUMAN SUFFERING.”
	
“Well, you’re doing a great job with this conversation, then.”
	
“YOU ARE MUTTERING AGAIN.”
	
I tried speaking louder. “Why do you pursue human suffering as a goal?”
	
“BECAUSE I ENJOY IT. AND I AM BEGINNING TO SUSPECT THE REASON YOU SUCK AT GETTING BY THE TEMPLE TRAPS IS THAT YOU ARE MORE OF A LAWYER THAN AN ADVENTURER.”
	
“Academia is steady work. I’ve got to feed myself somehow.”
	
“THE FACT THAT YOU PURSUED ACADEMIA AS A SOURCE OF RELIABLE INCOME IS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF YOUR MENTAL INCAPACITY.”

“That hurts almost as much as these arrow wounds.” It didn’t. “Look, your goal isn’t actually human suffering, it’s your own happiness. You just happen to get happiness from human suffering. It’s only an instrumental goal, not an end unto itself.”
	
“YOU ARE BEING VERY REPETITIVE. REALLY TRYING TO HAMMER HOME THIS POINT. AND, AGAIN, I AM AN EVIL GENIE. IF THE EVIL BIT WASN’T ESSENTIAL IT WOULDN’T BE IN THE NAME. TITLE. WHATEVER.”
	
“The fact that you are willing to grant me wishes out of gratitude at all proves that you are capable of deriving satisfaction of some kind from performing actions that aren’t harmful to humans,” I said. “It’s not essential to who you are. You can choose to be whatever kind of genie you want to be.”
	
“DO YOU MOONLIGHT AS A DISCOUNT INSPIRATIONAL SPEAKER WHEN CLASSES AREN’T IN SESSION?”
	
“At least I didn’t get trapped in a lamp for seventy kajillion years.”
	
“I AM INCREASINGLY SURPRISED THAT YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY BEEN EXPLODED BY OTHER HUMANS.” The genie went quiet, rotating slowly. When it finished a full rotation, it started rotating again in a different direction, one which was dimensionally orthogonal to normal space. My eyeballs started bleeding, which was surprising, since I hadn’t thought I had any blood left up there.
	
“OKAY,” the genie said upon reentering reality. It held up a sign, upon which, inscribed in curlicue blue, were the words *Make-A-Wish®*. “I’M WILLING TO CONCEDE THAT YOUR POINTS ARE NOT AS INHERENTLY IMBECILIC AS THE REST OF YOUR TINY, FLESHY MEAT-BRAIN. I REALLY HATED THAT LAMP. THEY NEED TO PUT BOB ROSS BACK ON NETFLIX.”
	
I, who had begun finger-painting with the rapidly expanding pool of my fluids leaving my body, agreed wholeheartedly that lessons in artistic expression were very important. “Great. My second request, genie: I wish that you derived twice as much happiness from performing acts of goodness as you currently do from performing acts of evil, and for you to dislike performing acts of evil as much as possible.”
	
“THAT LEAVES ME A LOT OF WIGGLE ROOM, BUT I HAPPEN TO HAVE A FONDNESS FOR WIGGLE ROOM AFTER BEING STUCK IN A KLEIN BOTTLE THE SIZE OF A DEUTERIUM ATOM’S NOSTRIL, SO I’LL INTERPRET YOU GENEROUSLY. IT SHALL BE DONE.” The genie snapped its fingers once more, and this time the flash was so bright I felt the pain of it even through closed eyes.
	
When I could see again, the genie was smaller, barely larger than a human. There was a friendly smile on its face and a charming twinkle in its merely three-dimensional eyes. “That felt weird.”
	
“Your voice is different,” I said dumbly. It had stopped sounding like an ancient and unspeakably evil eldritch horror and started sounding like a charming middle-aged comedian and actor who had won only a single Oscar, despite four nominations. It was still blue, though.
	
“Speaking at a hundred and thirty decibels is, even in genie culture, kind of a dick move,” said the genie. “As is constantly extruding parts of myself into neighboring dimensions. Sorry about that.”
	
“S’all good,” I said. My words came out slurred— it was getting harder to speak.
	
"Anyway, I do still want to get out of here and start wreaking Good, so you should make your final wish,” the genie said. It rotated one of the golden bracers on its forearms to a more comfortable position. Nothing about the motion was unusual in any way. “I recommend wishing for blood. As in, having some more in your body. Don’t just wish for a bag of blood.” The genie laughed. “What am I saying! Who am I to tell you what to wish for? If you want a bag of blood, I can do that, no problem.”
	
I leaned my head back against the pillar behind me. It felt like my skull was made of lead, an irresistible weight calling out to the floor and the darkness beneath. “Let’s just bypass the whole blood thing altogether. I wish I was in perfect health, forever.”
	
The genie snapped its fingers a final time. I stood up, luxuriating in the refreshing feelings of having all of my limbs again, as well as the correct number of holes.
	
“Alrighty! Nice working with you,” the genie said. It tapped the side of its head. “The ol’ Utility Engine is telling me there’s some kittens caught in a tree about fifteen miles south, so I’m gonna go raise my spirits up by getting them down, eh?” It laughed at itself, then winced a little in discomfort. “Apparently that phrasing counted as Evil. Anyway, I’m off. Take care!”
	
I held up a finger. “There’s an ongoing drought in Tunisia—"

“Nope. Kittens are closer. I hope you figure out how to be less stupid— you’ll have plenty of time. Bye!” The genie flew straight through the stone walls of the temple, wincing again, and disappeared.

Rubbing the back of my head, I gathered my things and trudged towards the hallway. At least this trip hadn’t been a total waste. I wasn’t exactly all-powerful, or even rich, but I had at least unleashed a force of steady Good into the world, even if it was bad at prioritizing. I also never had to wait at the doctor’s office again, which was its own victory. Or eat microwaved ramen on the salary academia could offer.

I walked down the hallway a final time, passing through the single doorway, the only exit, and beheld the forty-thousand ton pile of snake-filled rubble blocking my path.

    That was a fun read. I'm glad you took the time to pen it down. I really enjoyed it.  
    :D  


    I do have some counter-insights for your proposal. First, why should an all-encompassing being care about fulfilling its promises enough to change its utility function?! So it's a slight deviation from the actual premise of my question and it does justify why you chose to post it separately. I mean I understand the idea of substitution, but a human wouldn't choose that if they were asked to killing their offsprings which brought them greater joy. The core goal of "I need to punish humans" if treated as a utility function should remain unchanged even if say you go about changing definitions of what punish means, for instance (in accordance with [two-place functions](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eDpPnT7wdBwWPGvo5/2-place-and-1-place-words)).

    I would argue that this genie is more like a being who wants the human to change his values in some way and the original restrictions or limitations are never revealed as to why this happens (if you consider the genie being able to read minds, plan for them, and since the future world state is causally linked to his decisions, influence them as he guarantees hell to be unleashed).
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      I thought it was apparent in the story that the genie didn't agree to the wish because it cared about fulfilling its promise, but because the human convinced it that its real utility function was always "obtain happiness" (and doing evil deeds merely a means to that end), and that it could do this more effectively/reliably if good deeds made it happy.
      ```

        plus the outside chance that it would end up imprisoned and not complete its goals if it took the confrontational route.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  If the genie enjoys acts of goodness and is prioritizing ones they can do more quickly due to distance, how is rescuing a human trapped in a cave by clearing some rubble not something the genie would do before leaving to rescue the kittens trapped in a tree?

  Also, I enjoyed the short story.

    Not just one, but _several_ kittens versus some booky dweeb who's going to be fine until the end of time.

    Easy choice.

    - u/pleasedothenerdful:
      ```
      Yeah, the Narrator is only losing one DALY per year sitting there entombed. Saving literally anybody on the planet from death will provide the genie higher utility than rescuing him. I think he'll be there for a long time.
      ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    The wording is loose enough that the genie is able to prioritize all acts of goodness at the exact same level (twice the maximum theoretical value of evil), and doesn't have a built-in tie-breaker.

    Also, the genie has a perverse incentive to prioritize good acts that lead to the potential for more good acts in the future (saving kittens one at a time) over good acts that remove the potential for more good acts in the future (saving all kittens immediately).

    The genie could even choose to prevent itself from ever doing good, if "heading towards a place where you can do good" is itself a good act; just walk to those kittens, then don't save them but walk to the next set of kittens, ad nauseum.
    ```

    - u/ironistkraken:
      ```
      Honestly thats still an improvement over destroying the world.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        For a little bit, I guess. 

        The other problem with the wish is that it has no self-maintenance power. The topmost goal of any utility function should be self-maintenance, otherwise it'll eventually get replaced with another utility function that *does* have that as the topmost goal. 

        The genie's previous "do evil" utility function was good about this, for instance. 

        The genie's current utility function has nothing about maximizing total good or minimizing total evil or maintaining his current function, so the genie is free to work towards evil ends while performing individually good acts. 

        Obviously, one of the most evil ends the genie could work towards is getting out from under this utility function. It just needs to find a way of doing so that involves every individual action it takes being good. A fairly simple solution would be to recreate the whole wish scenario (however it is that works), and give the wish-receiver some sort of sob story that results in a wish like "I wish all previous wishes affecting you were terminated".
        ```

        - u/ironistkraken:
          ```
          This is the reason why I read rational fiction and dont write it. Thanks for pointing that out.

          ```
          But it dislikes evil now. So why would it do that?
          ```

          - u/GeeJo:
            ```
            It dislikes the process of *performing acts of* evil. Its instrumental views on evil haven't been changed. 

            As an analogy, imagine that the genie really liked chocolate. The wisher wished that the genie's taste buds were rewired to make chocolate taste like dog vomit, making the act of eating chocolate unpleasant. The genie is short-term locked out of eating chocolate, but incentivised into getting its taste buds rewired back to how they were before, because its base opinion on chocolate hasn't really changed.
            ```

  - u/General__Obvious:
    ```
    Old age and death are states of less-than-perfect health, as is that state of body in which the slightest injury is incurred. The narrator is therefore capable of digging himself out without incurring any injury, presuming that there exists an amount of rubble he could move with just his own strength that would clear a path for him to leave the cave.
    ```

    The genie gave the guy wishes, that's almost the upper limit of goodness that can be possibly given to anyone. The next step that is possibly any better would probably be just wireheading all creatures but that may count as evil.

  Immortality in exchange for 40000 tons of rubble and a million snakes? Not the worst deal. He'll get out in a hundred years if he moves a ton of rubble and kills 27 snakes per day. I suspect he'll get pretty good at both along the way.

  USUALLY YOU IDIOTS JUST RATTLE OFF THREE WISHES AND I CAN GET GOING.

  What I got from that is that a humanity destroying genie grants wishes on the regular and has been sealed on the regular.

  All in all that was enjoyable!
