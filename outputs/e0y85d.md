  Could you give a brief summary of what this is about and why you think it is relevant to this subreddit?

    It’s a story about an anti-intellectual civilization. It involves physics as a story telling technique.

      The really sad thing is that I can totally see this happening in about 30 years.

      For one story, perhaps; four threads for four Greg Egan stories in a single day is a bit much.

        They're all *really* good though.

          Maybe so, but one thread entitled "Four Rational Greg Egan Stories" would have been sufficient.

    The first line of the first chapter summarizes this story perfectly. 

    > You’ll never get tenure.  You don’t have the abs.”

  I've never quite been a fan of the way Egan wrote this as a pretty shallow whine of "kids these days with their social media and their streaming and their outrage culture".

    On the one hand, I can understand *why* he writes that.  From a rational perspective, there's a lot of evidence that social media is doing a lot of harm to our collective mental and emotional health.  This is just a sort of "darkest timeline" of how bad it could get, kind of like what's shown in the comic Two-Step.

    On the other hand, yeah, it's super annoying to have an entire branch of communication technology dismissed as the cause of the end of intellectualism.  Like, that's a *people* problem, not a source-of-conversation problem.  I'd kind of like to see a parallel to this story where social media is what's enabling the surviving rationalist scientists to work together and put up some resistance against the downfall of the educated world.  That'd be cool, even if it had basically the same tropes and arc to it.

  One of the main plot devices is one of my favorite etudes in physics, which is enough of an excuse for me to write my pet approach to this in a comment. Physics and math below.

  The use of velocity space goes back to Maxwell and Hamilton (see "*hodograph"* on Wikipedia). One can actually derive the elliptical/parabolic/hyperbolic nature of the orbits from circularity of velocity orbits (see "Feynman's lost lecture", as a book, as an audio, or in 3blue1brown version on youtube). I like the following proof of the circularity of the hodograph (which I call "velocity-orbit"): the rate of change of velocity vector is dv/dt=a, which by inverse square law is  -C r\_hat / R\^2 for a constant C. To parametrize the velocity trajectory by arc-length (as one does to study geometry of a plane/space curve) one needs to use parameter whose time derivative is L/R\^2 for a constant L. Amazingly, this is true for the angle from the sun -- conservation of angular momentum implies "constant area sweeping rate" (see below for details) which means (d theta/dt)R\^2=L, so (d theta/dt)=L/R\^2.  Hence the arc-length parameter for velocity orbits is proportional to the angle to the sun; we can confirm this by computing dv/d theta=dv/dt dt/d theta = \[-C r\_hat / R\^2\]\[R\^2/L\]= K r\_hat, which indeed has constant length.  The arc length-proportional parameterization is the one best adapted for computing the curvature of this velocity-orbit, which is then proportional to

  |d/d theta ( dv/d theta)|= |d/d theta ( K r\_hat)=|(constant) theta\_hat|=constant!

  Thus velocity orbit has constant curvature -- so the velocity-orbit is a circle.

  Further details about area sweeping rate in polar coordinates: The constant area sweeping rate is Kepler's 2nd law, which is true for any central force and follows from conservation of angular momentum r x v. Indeed (rxv)'=vxv+rxa=0+0=0, so angular momentum is conserved. I leave interpretation of both rxv AND (d theta/dt)r\^2 as area sweeping rate to you, but derive  (d theta/dt)R\^2 =L. Indeed, in polar r(t)=R(t) r\_hat(t) (here r(t) is a vector, R(t) is the length of r(t), and r\_hat(t) is the unit radius vector as before). Differentiating this we have v(t)=R' r\_hat+R r\_hat'; taking x r we have vxr=R r\_hat' x r=R  (d theta /dt) theta\_hat x R r\_hat=R\^2 (d theta /dt) k\_hat, so L=|vx r|=R\^2 (d theta /dt) is a constant, as we wanted.

  PS On Kepler's orbits one should really read Givental: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40598-015-0030-6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40598-015-0030-6).
