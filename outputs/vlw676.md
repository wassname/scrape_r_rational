## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  What are some works of fiction where the conflict is against forces of nature or monsters instead of evil people/bureaucracies? Because I want a satisfying story where everyone's on the same side cooperating as equals, instead of being screwed over by an unjust society or unfair and ineffective bureaucracy. Something as idealistic and sincere as RWBY or [Exodus](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/exodus-worm-big-hero-6.35527/reader/), where America has free healthcare! (instead of [being charged for giving organs](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/21/opinion/fry-revere-organ-transplant-donors/index.html))

    Another Worm fic, [Moon Shot](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/moon-shot.14085/) by ShaperV (aka E. William Brown, the author of the Daniel Black series of fantasy novels), is a pretty good match. It's in QQ's NSFW forum, but what was posted before the fic's untimely demise/hiatus was not NSFW except for some "gore and viscera" scenes.

    The last few chapters took the fic in a slightly ... odd direction, but the first 75% was a pretty solid "base building during an apocalypse" setup. The MC is not the nicest person imaginable, but then again, he is in a race against time to save humanity and has little time for pleasantries.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Also, possibly one of the (apparent) inspirations for Moon Shot could work - Neal Stephenson's [Seveneves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seveneves), or at least the first half of it.
      ```

      - u/SomewhatSpecial:
        ```
        I would derec Seveneves. Even though it's a book about an apocalypse, the major source of problems is people doing dumb things for dumb reasons. Not too say that it was too unbelievable, but I wasn't particularly engaged by the drama of it, just frustrated.
        ```

        - u/Dragongeek:
          ```
          Yeah. Seveneves is a great book but compared to Stephenson's other works, it almost seems specifically designed to piss the /r/rational crowd off as much as possible most, if not all the conflict is caused by selfish, shortsighted, and plain evil humans. 

          Also, it seems a bit dated now because it was designed to take place in the "present day" back in the early 2010's and a lot of characters are obviously real people. Some things haven't changed, but a lot has. 

          Furthermore, one of my favorite parts of the book was how Stephenson wargamed out the global apocalypse space launch effort from a collaborative and technological viewpoint. It would be interesting to see someone do this again but for the present day (or 5 years in the future), because a spring amount about the world of space-launch has changed since 2015

    Graydon Saunders's "Commonweal" books are primarily this; society is egalitarian and engaged in long-term conflict against, primarily, the monstrous Power itself and the monsters/monstrosities of nature that inhabit the world. There are external polities that threaten the Commonweal, but they're a reflection of the state of the world, kinda? Anyway, it's **extremely** sincere and idealistic in its way.

    Millenial Mage is also kind of like this, despite what the MC initially thinks / how she feels / her backstory.
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Strong rec for Commonweal. Only read book 1, but it's such a cool and well-executed concept. Due to hyperegalitarianism there are no gendered terms used anywhere in the book, including third-person pronouns; this takes some getting used to but is worth it for the atmosphere it induces.
      ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    [Ar'Kendrythist](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) fits pretty well I'd say. There are enemies and villains that come up, and have to be handled by the main characters. There's also quite a lot of unjust society going on. But the main "big pictures plot" is about making the world a better, more just place. To do that the protagonist has to do a lot of diplomacy and international relations, as well as fight people and monsters with amazing magical power of course.

    It has a morally good protagonist who starts off naive and somewhat dumb (which is where a lot of people's complaints come from), but he really develops very well later on. The protagonist's empathy and moral goodness (as well as his magical power) is a driving factor for a lot of his success, and that part is shown in a nuanced and multifaceted way which I loved.
    ```

    - u/brocht:
      ```
      I'll second the rec for Ar'Kendrythist. It's a slow burn, but it pays off.
      ```

    Does it have to have an ensemble cast?

  In my free time a couple weeks ago I saw a youtube video analysing 2001 that, besides the film buff 101 stuff, argued that the human characters are heavily infantilised in the film to analogise HAL as a maternal figure. I followed up by rewatching 2001 and, to continue the theme, HBO's Raised by Wolves.

  Can anybody recommend some more stuff along the theme of AI as surrogate mothers/fathers/parents?
  ```

  - u/dysfunctionz:
    ```
    None of these are ratfic, but enjoyable:

    I Am Mother (film, on Netflix): entirely about this premise.

    *Terraforming Earth* by Jack Williamson: multiple generations are raised by AI on the moon after Earth is hit by a meteor waiting for it to become habitable again.

    *The Songs of Distant Earth* by Clarke: has this as part of the backstory.
    ```

    - u/ADotSapiens:

      I've actually got Terraforming Earth in my pile of unread books, so thanks for mentioning it.
      ```

      ```
      > I Am Mother (film, on Netflix): entirely about this premise.

      This one is a remarkable disappointment by the end when it has to pile illogical twist after twist to explain events in the second half. Don't watch it expecting any satisfying reveal to the mysteries.

  Quick recomendation of Adrian Tchaikovsky's "Dogs of War". Brilliant transhumanist (transcaninist??) xenofiction, with lots of rational (for an animal cyborg) characters.

  Does someone have recs for MC with a power(may or may not be unique) that is weak/difficult use but mc uses it effectively. 

  And I mean actually problematic powers and not a power that for some illogical reason the world thinks is weak but anyone with half a brain can tell that is just the author giving MC powerful ability while also trying to paint him/her as an underdog
  ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    It's not a perfect match, but the MC in [Pound the Table](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pound-the-table-an-x-men-self-insert.951637/) has a weak illusion power that she uses to hide that she's a mutant, in 1980s Marvel. She's not really a combatant though; she's a lawyer.
    ```

    - u/Kaljinx:
      ```
      Thank you so much!
      ```

  - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
    ```
    Lawrence Watt-Evans's [With a Single Spell](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/320216.With_a_Single_Spell) is a decent match -- the title is self-explanatory.

    It's the second book set in the Ethshar universe, but the books are pretty much all standalone with occasional nods to other characters in the series. Like most other installments, it's a good example of "light fantasy".
    ```

    - u/vorpal_potato:
      ```
      The kicker here, revealed in a later book, is that the basic fire-starting spell is *almost* extremely powerful. About 800 years ago someone miscast it in exactly the wrong way and ended up creating an eternally-burning pillar of flame. In the years since then it has become a major tourist destination. People camp out next to it and cook their food on very long sticks.

      This is one of the things that's so charming about the Ethshar books: the people in them act like they're actually living in a real world and have some brains, rather than acting in whatever silly way some railroad plot demands. If there's a Tower of Flame, people are going to sell long sticks and commemorative memorabilia. If wizardry requires exotic components like [a rope which has hanged a man and a sword which has slain a woman](https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/74), then there are going to be people making a living as exotic ingredient middlemen with large networks of suppliers, quality and freshness guaranteed. (One of them was the protagonist of a book.) If someone sets out to slay a dragon, he might slay it -- or he might get to talking with it and negotiate an amicable resolution to the situation. Or he might decide that tangling with a dragon is stupidly reckless and go do something else halfway on his journey to its lair.

      It's refreshing that the plot can go almost anywhere as long as it makes sense in-universe.
      ```

    - u/Kaljinx:
      ```
      Oh man, I was looking for something exactly like this. Thank you!
      ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Depends on how you mean weak. Weak as in the power has very little magnitude of effect, or in that there's no combat ability in the power whatsoever? These are more of the latter, and maybe not exactly what you're looking for. 

    [Delphic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54450/delphic) has a protagonist whose power is supercharged google earth, but he has no combat ability whatsoever. He uses the power to be an international information broker. A lot of the plot takes place thousands of kilometers away, which adds a different sort of tension. 

    [Dungeon Scholar](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43346/dungeon-scholar) protagonist has the ability to communicate with dungeons. The problem is that she can't figure out why or how it happens, and a lot of the story is spent on her figuring it out, in between social commitments and overall going from a shut-in to a more social person. Heavy on the slice of life. And on hiatus :( 

    [The Way Ahead](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42202/the-way-ahead) has an alchemist protagonist whose unique power is Wikipedia, sort of. It's a very useful power but the thing is that the protagonist is nowhere near the level of power he needs to be to make actually good use of it. Besides that he's a pretty good alchemist. Heavy on the angst, but the worldbuilding and power mechanics and experiments are well done.

      >Dungeon Scholar

      There were parts of this I quite enjoyed, and then there were parts which were 15k words of shopping where absolutely zero character development happened and no plot was progressed. It felt like the writer of Brockton's Celestial Forge ghostwrote those bits with how insubstantial they were.

  Posted this in its own thread, but also I shall post it here!

  https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46378/frameshift

  My story, Frameshift, is now complete and published on Royal Road. It clocks in at just over a quarter million words over 150 chapters, and wraps up all of the plot threads you'd expect to be wrapped up while leaving things open for future adventures.

  Here's the blurb:

  > Magic. Math. Not a whole lot of context.

  > Two months ago, I was a wormhole navigator, ripping open a hole in the universe to save a ship of people who only vaguely tolerated me. Two weeks ago, long story short, I threaded an impossible path through the void between dimensions to crash-land into a dungeon. You know the kind: monsters to defeat, corridors full of traps to avoid, and magical powers to earn.

  > I'm not ashamed to admit that it's been two weeks of loneliness, fear, adrenaline, and constant injury. But I'll make it out of here by myself if I have to, or my name isn't Adam Leviathan James.

  > ... too bad the Levi doesn't stand for Leviathan, huh.

  It has a fair amount of sex, violence, trauma, and engineering. It's very in medias res; not in the sense of "open in the middle and then go back to the beginning", but in the sense of "the story opens with him on the third floor out of five and moves forward from there". Straight-up answers are given out eventually.

  The first arc is rough by my standards, but it gets up to speed pretty quick. If you're at ~chapter 12 and you still don't like it, sorry, go ahead and drop it.

  Inasmuch as this is a power fantasy, the power in question is "healing from emotional trauma" and "having friends who are awesome". Speaking of emotional trauma, there's cult-level emotional abuse and trauma in the MC's backstory and at least one person has benefitted from a content warning about that, so consider yourselves warned.
  ```

  - u/Nnaelo:
    ```
    As of chapter 15, I still have no stake in this. There's no set up for any of the conflicts that are happening, and the story reads more like a list of bullet points of wish fulfillment it has to check than anything else. 

    Also, the fact that it's specifically mentioned that Adam hasn't talked to anyone in weeks when he summons his Geniric Amazon Waifu, Variation 3 Template 4 and right after they fight a couple of orcs with pithy banter and all included is just unlucky for him, I guess.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Yes, it's deliberate that each floor is structured; as he ascends, it's less "stark, inhuman dungeon populated only with monsters" and more "scenarios structured around people". I may not have made that sufficiently obvious.

      I think if you get to chapter 15 and you still have no investment in it you're probably best off dropping it, unless you really want to get to the puzzle-solving chapters for some particular reason. :)
      ```

- u/Jello_Raptor:
  ```
  This explicitly isn't rational but I'm in the mood for a good comedic "X has game breaking powers but about half the INT needed to effectively use them" fic, ideally with the surrounding chars acting decently smart. So far Anya in "Spy x Family" and Katerina from "My Next Life as A Villainess" have scratched that itch.
  ```

  - u/grekhaus:
    ```
    A Bad Name is a Worm/Gamer crossover fic with this premise: Guy who isn't terribly smart gets a stereotypical Gamer power & immediately starts making bad decisions with it because he has awful mental attributes and single digit luck. He ends up joining a gang and the gang leader actually understands what this guy is capable of and sets him a training regime to make him useful.
    ```

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  Are there any good fantasy/sci fi stories about solo exploration into dangerous areas, with a focus on character growth? I'm thinking a fantasy/scifi equivalent of the manga Kokou no Hito, which was amazing.
  ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    There's [Azarinth Healer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16946/azarinth-healer/chapter/198097/chapter-1-boring-introduction-where-is-the-magic). The setting is interesting, in that there's a map of the known world (to humans), but the edges of the map are quite literally "here be monsters." Humans are very much penned in, in this setting, and seeing the MC push those boundaries is the best part of the story, imo. It's not particularly deep or heavy, but I enjoy it.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      I tried to get into Azarinth Healer a few times but never really liked it enough to really get into it. Thanks for the rec, but not the type of character growth I'm requesting for. 

      The Road by Cormac McCarthy has the same sort of introspection and solo exploration into dangerous areas, although it does have a dad and his son. 

      The exploration parts of the farseer trilogy were also really good, with just Fitz and Nighteyes.
      ```

- u/TheAnt88:
  ```
  So I recently read a actual college paper analyzing the themes of Alien and got into the habit of watching some good video essays doing something similar. Any good video essays or youtubers that do a consistent good job analyzing movies or tv shows that peopel recommend?

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    Given your interests, it's likely you already are aware of them, but Red Letter Media (most famous for their quasi-satirical reviews of the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy) have a series called "Re-View" that might fit the bill. All the rest of their stuff is highly entertaining as well, in my opinion.
    ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I like Every Frame a Painting, Lessons From a Screenplay, and Thomas Flight for movies.  Kaptainkristian is ok too, but not on the same level as the others, imo. 

    MandaloreGaming reminds me a lot of RLM, but video games.

    1. [Lindsay Ellis](https://www.youtube.com/c/LindsayEllisVids) is the OG, but she got harassed a lot and left youtube.
    2. [Folding Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/c/FoldingIdeas) isn't consistently media, but he got his start there.
    3. [Maggie Mae Fish](https://www.youtube.com/c/MaggieMaeFish) has some great videos, especially on less well known media.
    4. [Renegade Cut](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9infsKo33_2LUoiqXGgQWg) is probably the most media centric.

    I'll also throw in a rec for [Jacob Geller](https://www.youtube.com/c/JacobGeller), though he does his stuff in Video Games primarily.
