## Asymmetric Relationships and Why You Should Write Them

### Post:

I feel like *Worth the Candle* is one of those stories that is as much on the fringes of our little subgenre as it is *indisputably* in the dead-center. There are a lot of elements that aren't part of what we consider explicitly rational, either because we didn't put them in the side-bar or Eliezer didn't write about them in his essays. So, to help advance our cause, I'd like to propose an additional genre element: asymmetric relationships.

Alice and Bob are friends. A naive (or, alternatively, *efficient*) author says that they are unconditional friends because that is the depth of the relationship explored in the text. When we were children, that *was* the extent of our friendships. But it doesn't take a rationalist to know that intimate friendships aren't that pleasantly symmetric. In the real world, we know that the connection between two people can be explored indefinitely, and that you don't have to spend too much time before you find some elementary disconnect. That doesn't always mean a disagreement, just that there's a difference between what one wants from the other, and what the other wants from the one.

Maybe Alice is a pessimist and Bob is an optimist, and they each feed off of the other's complementary traits. We'll say this relationship is in a stable equilibrium - if Bob neglects Alice or Alice neglects Bob, they will eventually fall back into line, unless the force that disturbs them is sufficiently large. That doesn't mean a stable equilibrium is happy - there's a reason *cycle of abuse* is a staple phrase - there are other types of mutual dependency, and not all of them are pleasant. You see these relationships a lot in sitcoms and cartoons, where it's convenient to give characters a reason to fall back into old habits after some emotional change.

On the other hand, maybe Alice and Bob are fundamentally incompatible, the way they are now. Maybe Bob is madly in love with Alice while she's acting under the obligation to be polite. Or maybe the two of them are friends, but one is hiding a secret that would upset their whole foundation. In this case, the relationship is unstable. These relationships are good for stories which are shorter, or for subplots of a larger work, because they have an easy identifiable conflict and a clear end-point. In the examples I provided above, the result is tragic. But you can easily imagine an unstable relationship in the opposite direction as well - maybe both of them are mutually attracted to one another, but currently exist as nothing more than friends. When some tiny nudge pushes them out of place, chances are they'll "fall in love". Only instead of it being a metaphor for slipping on your feet and hitting the floor, it's a metaphor for falling down the slope of a potential energy curve.

Of course, all of the examples I've given are outside the purview of rational fiction - we literally have zero cartoons, sitcoms, or romance novels. (to the best of my knowledge!) Or maybe I've defined the concept well enough that you're having trouble finding counterexamples. But I think what distinguishes rational fiction from normal fiction is an awareness of these relationship dynamics, *as well* as the extent to which they are used. One thing at a time, though -

For examples of when this *isn't* done, you can take a look at stories where relationships between the main cast aren't the focus of the story. Sitcoms and cartoons are actually working at the bleeding edge of this trope, because they're designed to be accessible to the masses, and humans are social animals. Whereas science-fiction, fantasy, and thriller stories aren't always as focused on the *who* so much as the *what*. Ron and Harry aren't friends for some definite reason, they're friends because they enjoy the other's company on a very superficial level, and because they became friends as children. Part of how the Harry Potter books grow up is showing Ron and Harry demanding things from one another aside from pure companionship, as well as how they cope with that change. Or maybe a relationship is symmetric because it exists in the void between being defined and being explored - *traditionally*, the relationship between two side characters, neither of which quite enter the limelight, would be wasteful to spend energy on.

Here enters rational fiction, our detail-obsessed hero. In rational stories, a very easy, intuitive way to show that the characters are at least [level 1 intelligent](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent) is to show that they're capable of reaching depths of relationship that our protagonist has. Whether this means giving the antagonist a genuinely complicated relationship with their [Morality Pet](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet), or [leveraging the surprisingly ordinary broken relationship between two minor villains in order to get what you want out of them](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/colony-15-3/). It's at once a way to improve the realism of your story, and also a way to demonstrate that you understand a world exists outside of your protagonist's head.

If you've read half a chapter of *Worth the Candle* you know it's packed densely with this kind of relationship. I think the only relationship that *doesn't* revolve around some kind of weird asymmetry is the one between >!Ropey and the Bethel!<, and you could even make arguments for that. *Worth the Candle* likes to have its cake and eat it too, when it comes to playing with tropes. In this case, it uses the typical LitRPG trope of reducing complicated phenomena down to a single number as a source of drama and tension. Juniper spends a lot of the time worrying about what *precisely* the loyalty number means, and the story itself dedicates most of its interpersonal conflict to showing that it's not some kind of get-out-of-social-intelligence-free card. It uses this trope to challenge our preconceptions about how relationships work, in both fiction and real life, and that's one of its biggest strengths as a piece of rational fiction.

*Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* has this. I think it's mostly a consequence of trying to establish the diversity of all of the different third-person viewpoints it jumps between. Each character tries to contextualize the relationships they have with each other in terms of the type of literature they've read - Hermione views things through the lens of romance, Draco through the lens of a mind-bending thriller, Harry through the lens of a science-fiction novel. Dumbledore *explains* his viewpoint in terms of fantasy stories, but there's a chance that was just him trying to connect with Harry. It logically follows that each of the characters get something different out of their friendships. Harry views his relationships as a research partnership, Draco as a transaction, with give and take.

Finally, I'd like to mention *Worm*. I feel like this is another reason *Worm* deserves to at least be on the fringes of rational fiction. As a part of Wildbow's mission to make superheroes into real people with real problems, pretty much every character in *Worm* has some kind of dysfunctional relationship, where one party wants more than the other can give, or someone is keeping a secret from everyone else, or everyone is trying to tiptoe around another character's trauma. And this is something that he's only gotten better at writing over time. If *Worm* is an intricate web of relationship fuckery, *Ward* is a tapestry.

**TL;DR: Relationships shouldn't be strictly mutual. If you're writing a relationship between two characters, it's more rational if 1) there is a disconnect between what one party wants from it and what another does, 2) the protagonists are aware of this disconnect and try to leverage it, meeting either success or failure, and 3) this level of care extends to every *relevant* character with a significant role in the story, not just the main [Love Triangle](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle) or [Five Man Band](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand).**

  If we're already recommending Wildbow works, I have to throw a vote for [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/). It's a coming-of-age story with a devious social manipulator as the main character, laced with Wildbow's trademarked biohorror and set in a Frankenstein-inspirated 1920ies America.

  Sylvester is awesome if this kind of relationship interests you, because he's able to recognise such relationships >!(...when he's not mentally castrating himself to keep things from getting awkward)!< and he's then able to use these relationships to get people to do what he wants.

  There's a fan-made [audiobook](http://audiotwig.dauber.kim/), but it's only up to Arc 6.5 at the moment.

    It's no coincidence that Wildbow got immensely better at this *after* he resolved to write a more episodic, character focused story. I've been saving *Twig* for a rainy month, but even after only the first arc the characters are lodged in my head.

  That opening sentence = whiplash. Re: asymmetric relationship, I don't think it's so much a feature of *rational* fiction as much as writing complex relationships applies to *fiction* as a whole. It's also sort of implied by ratfic feature #2: 

  >Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear. 

  The current sidebar definition was an active effort to move away from describing good fiction in general and distinguish *rational* fiction. Unfortunately that also means some literary characteristics are left implicit. In this case, if characters have clear goals and motives, that presupposes that they think and act in ways that are consistent with their beliefs/values, motives, and worldview. And when all characters have psychological depth, it's pretty hard to write one-dimensional relationships.

  Counterpoint: focusing on asymmetricality detracts from the relationship gestalt because the spotlight is split between what each character wants (skewing toward Machiavellian/utilitarian archetypes), rather than what they get and how that shapes the relationship's course. 

  IMO, relationships are a weakness in WTC and HPMOR. In WTC, the weird asymmetry is expected from a DM-hand-selected cast of companions and there's always the suspicion that every character is some sort of commentary on Joon. But Joon's not prone to self-reflecting on his relationships and the relationships sit on the surface of that 
  asymmetry and rarely poke beneath. Even now, it's not clear what Joon is *getting* from his relationships. In HPMOR, the relationships suffer exactly from the asymmetry - they feel more allegorical than organic (though the story  doesn't take itself seriously).

    >That opening sentence = whiplash.

    You know when you start a paragraph on one point and then you get distracted and end on a completely different one? I have a bit of a problem with that. If you thought that was bad, I should post my first couple of drafts.

    >Counterpoint: focusing on asymmetricality detracts from the relationship gestalt because the spotlight is split between what each character wants (skewing toward Machiavellian/utilitarian archetypes), rather than what they get and how that shapes the relationship's course.

    I think it was a mistake to phrase it so much in terms of give/take. The giving and the receiving is part of the equation, but it's not always on the literal level. Two characters sitting out and literally negotiating the terms of their friendship would be counterproductive - which is also why, whenever that happens in *Worth the Candle* or *HPMOR* there's loads of stuff left implicit. Juniper seeks out relationships because he's still grieving over Arthur's death, and to a lesser extent, grieving over the friendships he tore apart in the wake of Arthur's death. Not only does he need allies in a utilitarian sense, he's also trying to slot people into his old worldview, which is why he isn't super introspective about people he's gathered into his new in-group until a crisis comes up. Draco *believes* that he and Harry are exploiting each other for their own mutual gain, but he eventually realizes that what he got out of it didn't cost Harry anything at all, and that's when his character arc hit its peak.

    The important part isn't that one character gets something from another. The important part is that they are *different people* and have different emotional needs. It's that realism that I'm advocating for. Otherwise, the line between characters gets blurred. Which brings us to -

    >In this case, if characters have clear goals and motives, that presupposes that they think and act in ways that are consistent with their beliefs/values, motives, and worldview. And when all characters have psychological depth, it's pretty hard to write one-dimensional relationships.

    I was going to mention this in the original essay but then I got distracted. Sure, you *can* rely on plain ol' human intuition to fill in the blanks in your relationships, but if you do, you risk falling back on old habits informed from years of dumb media consumption. (if HPMOR feels more allegorical than organic, it's probably because of that) The same way I wouldn't advocate someone writing a level 1 intelligent character by saying: "Do it the same only *smart* this time!" I wouldn't advocate writing a meaningful relationship using only your experience with other stories. That doesn't mean the source of self-awareness needs to be a focus on relationship asymmetry (although I would be flattered by that) - just that it needs to be *something*, otherwise you risk filling up stories with a jumbled mess.

    Sure, if you're smart enough to write an intelligent character, it's *hard* to write a relationship that doesn't have at least a little bit of depth. But not only is it still *possible* that you might get it wrong, it's likely that you won't use that relationship to its full potential. If you get anything out of this, it's that you should treat the interactions between two people with the same care that you treat the people.

    ([If you picture a group of characters as vertices on a graph, the intuitive way to connect them is with relationships as the edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network); relationships are as much of a concrete mathematical object as characters are, whatever that means to you.)

    I actually dropped it for similar reasons. The relationship drama was just too heavy for my tastes without providing sufficient payoff or reward for me as the reader for suffering through it. 

    I remember one particular instance that was quite a turnoff for me fairly early on where, in a flashback, one of the MC's female friends was psychoanalyzing him and his reaction to Arthur's death to his face in a very irritating way. I would never want to be friends with that kind of person in real life, but more importantly, I don't particularly want to read about them in fiction either. 

    I think it's important to remember that we read fiction (particularly fantasy and sci-fi) because it's *more fun* than our day-to-day lives. When certain aspects of reality are missing from fiction, it becomes a detractor to the story for those of us who prefer rational fiction. **But that doesn't mean that the more reality you stuff into fiction, the better that fiction is.** 

    Fiction contains an implicit promise of a *satisfying payoff for anything the reader is made to suffer through*. 

    * If I sit through a boring info-dump or a lot of exposition or a description of fantasy mechanics, I should later gain some satisfaction from being able to better understand the world or predict a plot point or solve a mystery because of that information I put effort into reading, understanding, and remembering. 
    * If I'm feeling sympathetic pain for a character in a story because of their circumstances, I should later feel sympathetic catharsis or happiness when that pain is eliminated or avenged or ends up leading to something good instead. 
    * If an unpleasant aspect of reality is dragged into a fictional story even when it's not necessary, I similarly expect a payoff from that sooner or later (preferably sooner). So when that flashback character in WtC does annoying psychoanalysis on Joon, I will only feel it's worth it if he either has some kind of mental or emotional breakthrough because of remembering that event or if he establishes a new relationship that's refreshingly different from that old one.

    That's one of the primary charms of storytelling as opposed to reality, so having the readers suffer along with the MC purely for the sake of realism and rationality is not something I can get on board with. 

    Asymmetric relationships are definitely more realistic and that asymmetry can absolutely be leveraged to make the story more interesting, but I don't think that focusing on that asymmetry for the sake of realism is a correct decision unless there is a satisfying enough payoff for the trouble.

      > I think it's important to remember that we read fiction (particularly fantasy and sci-fi) because it's more fun than our day-to-day lives.

      This is a statement of personal preference. There are lots of reasons that people read fiction, not all of which are about fun. Sometimes we read to get a different perspective, because something is emotionally resonant, because it gives us a feeling that we're in need of, etc., not all of which are analogous to fun.

      To stop reading something because you didn't find it fun anymore is completely fine, but I really disagree with the notion that fun is the only reason that people read, or more to the point, what authors should strive for when writing.
      ```

      - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
        ```
        I guess I was a bit loose with my words when I said "more fun". You're absolutely right. I guess a better description than "more fun" would be "more satisfying" or "more rewarding" or even "more condensed". 

        Nobody would ever read a complete moment-by-moment breakdown of the daily life of even the most interesting people on the planet since most of those details are boring and irrelevant to the reason the person is considered interesting to begin with.

        Fiction has evolved well-known patterns to cope with this tendency of people to want to focus only on the interesting and relevant details. Of course, even in fiction, not *everything* can be interesting. That wouldn't work for the story structure and it wouldn't allow delivery of details that are not interesting by themselves but that are necessary for the story. That's why fiction typically delivers its "payoff" according to a general pattern. When there's a long stretch of something that's not the "payoff", it's usually followed by something that *is*. Otherwise the reader won't stay engaged.

        The "payoff" I'm referring to, within fiction, does not, of course, have to be "fun" or "happy" at all. It just needs to be "whatever fulfills the implicit promise" of the work, whether that's emotional resonance or catharsis or a different perspective, or a particular emotion or whatever. And it doesn't have to be only one of those things either. However, I think it's *usually* fairly easy to draw a line between "stuff that's included to keep the story moving along or for the sake of realism or consistency or detail" ("story glue" if you will) and "the meat of the story" or "that which the reader feels as if they're gaining from reading the story" (what I previously referred to as "payoff", but that word implies resolution or release of tension, which isn't fully accurate). 

        Traditional story structure theory talks of rising action, climax, falling action, etc. This pattern typically repeats multiple times in a story, eventually reaching higher and higher heights. Every part of that curve is all the "meat" I was talking about earlier, but even within that category, there's still an implicit promise that when tension has accumulated for a while, it will be followed by a release of some sort. That's because tension building adds psychological discomfort to the reader which needs to be rewarded for the reader to feel satisfied. 

        My claim is that "story glue" and "meat" share a similar relationship. Reading "story glue" adds psychological discomfort (because it isn't the "meat" for which the person is reading the story), so if a reader "suffers" through it, they then need to be rewarded with "meat" or they'll become dissatisfied. That "story glue" should also eventually prove important to some future "meat" or else the reader will feel dissatisfied that they wasted their effort reading it. Therefore, *excessive* detail and realism are often not good for a story and should be minimized except for when they can be considered "meat" in themselves.

        That line between "story glue" and "meat" is not easy to draw at all in real life though. In real life, most details are not relevant to any particular aspect of your "story" that you may want to focus on. Most conversations and experiences don't significantly affect your mindset, your relationships, your progress toward your goals, or anything else. They're just "story glue". Any "story" you might tell about any aspect of your life would ignore most of those as irrelevant unless they're necessary to understand the story as a whole or are inherently interesting. When telling a story, *Conservation of Detail* is important.

        A story is only worth telling if it's in some way *extraordinary.* If you can perfectly predict how a story will go after being told the premise and the starting point, then it's not so much a *story* as it is just a series of logically connected events. It's that *extraordinariness* that is lacking from most parts of normal daily life that people seek when reading stories. There's a limit to the detail that can (or should be) included, so most of what's written in a story should either be relevant to some "arc" in one way or another or be the "glue" that holds the story together. 

        That's what I meant when I said that stories are "more fun" than reality. They're more condensed, they ignore the boring parts, they primarily focus on the extraordinary and interesting details, and they provide something that's not common in everyday life (even if it could in no way be classified as "fun"). Therefore, when a story strays too far away from those aspects in the name of realism, it feels like it's missing the point.

        I believe that even for rational fiction, realism for its own sake when it's not also either interesting or extraordinary falls into the category of "story glue", so it should be omitted except where necessary in favor of focusing on the "meat" or "payoff" of the story. 

        Of course, different people consider different things interesting and people will feel different levels of psychological discomfort from the same event within a story, so there's no perfect standard. I guess I either have a lower tolerance for invasive, unhealthy, and toxic relationship drama in my fiction than other readers of WtC or I find it less inherently interesting which causes me to accumulate more perceived "debt" for having read it than others. So for me, while I won't say that it was completely irrelevant to the story or Joon's character growth, I didn't feel that I was adequately compensated for the psychological discomfort that reading it caused. It felt more like pointlessly detailed realism for the sake of realism rather than for the sake of using it to enhance how interesting or satisfying a future "payoff" would be.

    To each his own? I guess I can agree - it is very emotionally draining to read scenes like that. But I think it's relatively easy to find a middle-ground between constant group-therapy and action scenes.

    (I had trouble with *Worth the Candle* for the opposite reason - I felt like the plot kept dashing in to ruin a perfectly good group therapy story! Maybe both of us would be satisfied if Alexander Wales let the characters 100% solve their interpersonal issues before the next plot point came up, that way I would get resolution to the character drama and you would get to experience action uninterrupted.)

      I assume you've read it based on your comments about Wildbow's works, but in case you haven't I'd recommend Ward. I've only read until Arc 11, but thus far it's essentially one giant group therapy session with bouts of combat in between, but the combat also functions as group therapy. 

      Personally I find it unrealistic that everyone in a story would be doing some meta-analysis of their own emotional states and motivations, but as you mentioned, to each his own. I much preferred Worm's style where Taylor was often literally unaware of her own emotional reaction to things because she's offloading it onto her swarm.

  You're just kinda repackaging a basic concept of effective relationship writing and calling it 'rational', dude. Yeah, well written relationships often have some sort of core disconnect or tension between the two people that they have to deal with as part of the conflict of the narrative. This is how most rom-coms work. Hell, this is how friggin' Fifty Shades of Grey works. It's not good at it, but it does it.

  This sub really should take stock and figure out what is actually a feature of rational fiction, and what is an already existing principle of fiction writing that you're just giving a long winded coat of rationalfic paint to.

    ```
    That's a needlessly agressive way to put it. For one, I made it perfectly clear that romantic comedies and television shows do this - I'm not claiming that this is exclusively in the domain of rational fiction. Just that stories like *Worth the Candle* use it on a completely new scale. And putting a new coat of paint on it is *important*, because sometimes it's hard to tell what parts of traditional writing are compatible versus what parts are holdovers from hundreds of years ago.

  RE: romance novels

  I've not read any, but the impression I've received is that "classic" (i.e. older) romance-adjacent novels might do a good job of portraying realistic character motivations and actions. I'm thinking mainly of *Jane Eyre*. Can anyone comment if this is the case?
  ```

  - u/Robert_Barlow:
    ```
    I skimmed Jane Eyre a bit when I read it for AP Literature, which means I'm qualified to make assertive statements about the contents inside of it. Personally, when I read it, I didn't think Jane Eyre was particularly concerned with being realistic. It's filled with conveniences for the sake drama and tension, like Rochester's mysterious and tragic backstory, or the tree that he proposes too Jane under splitting because of a lightning strike that very night. Or Jane surviving the act of wandering through the English countryside in the middle of a storm with no food or water until she *happens* to stumble across a church.

    In an ideal world all of those old romance novels would trade plot-realism for character-realism, but Rochester alternates between abusive and caring for basically no reason. If he was reasonably motivated, he wouldn't have let his immense lust for his new [secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governess) overpower his common sense. And maybe he would have sought actual help for his first wife, instead of locking her in the attic and then brooding over it for the rest of his sorry life. Speaking of, supposedly she was the way she was because she went *insane*, which was treated with all the nuance and intelligence you would expect out of a novel from the period where[ insane women were locked in asylums and treated with genital mutilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_hysteria).

    I'm sorry if someone else here has read the book and has a higher opinion of it than I do - like I implied, I'm not super confident about the assumptions I'm making here. What I do know is that looking for rationality in a story written nearly two-hundred years ago is almost a lost cause.
    ```

  - u/Ms_CIA:
    ```
    Personally, I thought Jane Eyre did a fantastic job at creating realistic characters. Everyone in that story is struggling with a difficult situation, and they all have different ways of handling it.

    Jane Eyre: A plain woman with no money, connections or family. Can't express herself freely, has to constantly act like a proper English woman of her station, and has a very small chance of carving out a meager life for herself. When she finally gets a chance for real happiness, she has to decide if she's willing to sacrifice her principles to obtain it. Her constant struggle is to find a way to be true to both sides of her nature, the head and the heart.

    Edward Rochester: Passionate rich man who lived a life of dissipation. Could always get what he wanted with his money, until he was struck by tragedy. After learning to live with unhappiness, he sees a chance at freeing himself, and rationalizes himself into thinking it's okay. 

    St. John Rivers: Polar opposite of Rochester. He is a kind, noble person who is also very cold and austere, in part because religion demanded it of him. He gives up the opportunity of happiness with a girl he likes, to go abroad as a missionary, because it was the more logical choice. 

    While some fiction elements of this story are classic gothic tropes (scary dreams, ghosts, etc.), that doesn't really undermine how real the characters are. The story brings up a lot of social issues that affected the people of that time period, especially regarding how women and the poor were treated by society. But it's still a relevant and relatable story today because of how the characters dealt with the hand that life gave them.

  I definitely agree that this is an enjoyable aspect of good writing and that it can accentuate various enjoyable aspects of rationalfics in many contexts, but I disagree that it's *itself* a rational element. In terms of the intensional definition of ratfic as stories with consistent characters and worlds and so forth, it's neither sufficient nor necessary as a criterion. In terms of the extensional definition of ratfic as stories such that people who read this subreddit are likely to enjoy them, it might in some sense increase enjoyability, but not obviously moreso than any other way of adding depth to the story would.

  So, while I think this is a good and interesting bit of writing advice that I may very well take as inspiration in my future writing, and that it's as relevant to ratfic authors as it is to other authors, I'm not convinced that your assessment of it as making a story *more rational* is correct.

  (Which, to be clear, isn't an attack against your posting it here, just a disagreement with a chunk of your content; I enjoy the various long how-to-write-well posts people make on this subreddit even when the posts' advice isn't ultimately all that particular to ratfics.)

  Anyone's thoughts on the relationships in With This Ring? There's definitely some degree of mismatch, in both the Paragon and Renegade timelines, although it's further complicated by superpowers giving more obvious gaps between them.

  Paragon and Jade are particularly interesting because he has empathic vision, letting him literally see how she's feeling, know that it doesn't exactly mirror what he's feeling, and work on that.

    Having read more of *With This Ring* than I honestly should have, I think it squarely falls into the *maybe* category.

      "characters have agency outside of what they're like in the show and comics"

      I'm not sure what you're trying to criticise here. In the case of both Luthor and Nabu, the author showed two quite different ways of dealing with them, resulting in quite different outcomes in each timeline.

      But he generally does try to let canon happen unless it is disturbed by ripples from the SI's actions. So, the League's reaction to Nabu is entirely justifiable. And since the Paragon timeline has never had the same insider view of the Light as Renegade, I think it's premature to say that Luthor is out of character. Especially since it's been established that one of his major character flaws is paranoia.

        Whether or not it's justifiable has nothing to do with whether or not it happened in canon - it only matters whether or not it makes sense within the context of the story. Even in *Young Justice* >!letting Nabu take over Giovanni Zatara was ambiguous and poorly thought out!< - it contrasts with the characterization we've come to expect from the Justice League, and it only really serves to emphasize the divide between the Team and the professional heroes. A *rational* story wouldn't let the event happen at all, although maybe in a more polite way than Renegade did. And it would have handed over the capability to make that decision to the people that should logically have it - the Justice League. The only reason the burden should be on the shoulders of the author-inserted character is authorial fiat.

        Fanfiction only has to resemble canon if you allow it to. If you migrate something from canon that doesn't make sense, and then the *only* change you make is that you [point out it doesn't make sense](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging), that doesn't mean you've fixed the problem. You've just made it *your* problem. [If someone starts pissing in the middle of the street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzocnfLccs8), shouting: "I'm pissing in the middle of the street!" doesn't absolve them of the very real crime of pissing in the street. In fact, it makes it worse, because it demonstrates that they were *aware* of their own poor behavior.

        The self-insert spends literal *years* whinging about how strange and illogical it is that his role models would do such a thing, when the only reason it happened at all was that the author made the arbitrary decision that it should. This is another one of those situations where the author really should have *listened* to what his characters were telling him. Why *yes*, this plot point does happen to make no sense whatsoever - why don't we just not do it?

          It seems to me that Mr Zoat prefers to come up with a consistent explanation for canon events, if possible, rather than drop and replace them. This is probably a lot harder to do, and I think it has Chesterton Fence kind of merit.

            In a sense. But I think it requires *tremendously* more effort to retrofit logic into a setting that didn't have any (or selectively applied it) than it does to go with your gut and write something better. Writers are not infallible, and classical superhero writers even less so.

            (Zoat disregards canon when he wants to anyway. What that implies, at least to me, that he either made the conscious decision to keep that fuckawful plot point, or somehow forgot that he could just change things whenever he wanted to.)
            ```

            - u/GodKiller999:
              ```
              Every once in a while Zoat will understand that some canon element is so bad and would have such negative impacts on the story that it's simply better to not integrate it into the story.

              But generally he's painfully anal about following canon, even when not doing so would massively improve a part of the story and would make it so he doesn't have to bend himself into a pretzel to explain away some moronic decisions made by a previous author/executive.

              It's been a point of contention that's been discussed in the thread more than once by his readers.

          Nabu asked for a guarantee that Zatara would put on the helmet. Zatara gave his word in backwards magic speak. Since Nabu considered that sufficient Zatara breaking his word most likely has consequences we aren't aware of. Zatara being unable or unwilling to follow through might have killed him, turned his magic against him or placed him within Nabu's power regardless. 

          &#x200B;

          Afterwards Nabu was an extremely powerful wizard with prep time. He could easily have set up various dead's man switches to secure his position, coerced the members of the justice league into magically binding agreements, spied on attempts to make plans against him, started a takeover of the surface magical community and eradicated chaotic practitioners like John.
          ```

            I'm not saying the plot couldn't have been done justice the way it was in the original, necessarily, just that it would have been harder for no reason in particular. Every dead-man's switch, magically binding contract, and hour of prep-time is another complication tacked on to the end of the plot. But if Zoat had bothered with all that (which he didn't) it doesn't get rid of the stink of improvisation. Nabu suddenly acting more competently after the deal has been struck doesn't eliminate the fact that the circumstances that led up to the deal are kind of stupid. Like, if Nabu waited for hundreds of years in some tomb in the ass-end of Egypt only to agree to a timeshare in Kent Nelson's body, why is he jumping at the bit for a full-time position after only forty years of neglect in the Tower of Fate?

            (This argument continues ad infinitum - maybe the post hoc explanation for that is that Nabu witnessed Chaos commit an act of mass terrorism. But that only pushes the scrutiny further down the line. Is chaos so much more dangerous now than it was in the two thousand years he was just chilling out in a cave? *Why?* Oh - it's the Light? More complication! Why are there suddenly more evil acts of superterrorism *now?* The point isn't whether you *can* come up with an explanation for this - with enough time and effort, of course you can. The point is that, for each explanation you have to come up with on the fly, you're spending exactly that much *more* effort than you would have had the initial plot been sane enough that it didn't draw scrutiny in the first place. That's more effort than a plot point that was barely thought out in canon deserves.)

              > "Aaaaggghhhh! Are you all! Completely! Retarded!?" Shocked expressions. "Aaaaaaaaaggghhhh! Right!" I transition to the bound prisoners and haul them up by the chains. "Since I clearly have to fix every **** problem myself around here, I'll deal with these gentlemen as well." A burst of FTL takes my prisoners and me over the North Pole before a Boom Tube takes me to my actual destination over the Great Wall of China.
