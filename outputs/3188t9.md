## [RT] Classic rational sci-fi: The Mote in God's eye by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle.

### Post:

I've read Blindsight, but only just got the chance to pick up this classic in audiobook form.

The Moties are a really interesting species collective, and I can see the parallels between them and the later codified concepts of AI optimized social combat and evolutionarily optimized specialized subroutines.

Both factions of the story are very intelligent and rational, with individuals within the factions having their own individual philosophies and worldviews that one could write a treatise on the characters alone.

Spoiler for a reveal which someone who has heard of the story but not actually read it follows.

[]( #s "about halfway through, it's clear to the reader that they're hiding the fact that they cannot control their population effectively, pregnancy is a mandatory part of every motie's yearly life cycle, and any form of effective contraception put those who could use it at an evolutionary disadvantage against rivals which didn't. Many people on the human side of the story think that the Moties are "hiding something in plain sight", and it's a fun exercise to the reader to pick up the clues that the Moties slipped.")

[](#s "And then suddenly, the narrative reveals a second secret to both the human faction and the reader at the same time. What a masterpiece of emotional rollercoaster, getting both the anticipation of wondering how the humans will react to the reveal, the sleuthing of spotting the clues laid out for the human faction, and then being totally bowled over by an even bigger reveal which had just as many clues which I mostly passed over, but totally failed to put the big picture together early.")

[](#s "This narrative technique of having a fake secret occupy the reader's attention in the "faction a knows this, but faction b doesn't" in order to distract the reader from the possibility of a seperate secret that faction a is keeping from faction b AND the reader is one of the greatest parts of the book. Despite how this book was a massive award winner in its day and is still considered a foundational pillar of the genre, I simply can't think of any other authors who took a shot at emulating this narrative structure.")

  This is a really great book. Re-reading it recently, it was interesting how dated its depiction of gendered behavior is (I think Asimov has aged best of all in that regard). In competent hands, I think this could really benefit from being made into a movie.

    There's several examples of physical zeerust in the book, like how there was still physical film in their cameras and their pocket computers were unusually slow searching ship records. Edit: And how did I forget that the messages used telegraph style punctuation?! 

    But honestly, the gender roles depicted in the book didn't feel that dated alongside how the second human empire was a multi-planet heuristical monarchy with some form of Christian church support. The gender roles were there, but they weren't cripplingly rigid, just look at the heiress who decided to go into anthropology, and then onwards to successfully getting a place on the Mote Expedition.

    A movie based on this book would be incredible - if done well.  It would have to be carefully done though, because if done true to the book, the warrior Moties would be very, very frightening, Close to 'Alien' frightening, and might easily overpower the rest of the movie.

    In fact I'm rather surprised I've never seen a Motie warrior vs Alien or Predator fiction.  *wanders off to google*

  ```
  [A Deepness In The Sky](#s "has similar secrets. On the surface, the humans are lurking above the Spiders' world. But the Spiders have set up a counter-Lurk, conspiring with the Focused humans, and this is not directly revealed to the reader until the end - there are just a few clues. Finally, there is the greatest secret of all, not revealed to any factions or the reader within the book: the Age Of Failed Dreams, the impossibility of FTL, and so forth are all caused by the Zones, and Nuwen's triumphant journey to the heart of the galaxy is going the wrong way.")
