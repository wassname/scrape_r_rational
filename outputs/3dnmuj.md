## [D] [BST] [FF] Munchkin the "Inheritance" magic system

### Post:

I am planning to write a rational!Inheritance fanfic. In light of that, I thought I'd ask /r/rational for help with the magic system.

What are inconsistencies I'd have to patch? Exploits the characters could be using? Trivial exploits I have to patch out to even make a story possible?

I'll have to re-read the books first, so don't expect results too soon.

Edit: This is a somewhat-minor spoiler, but

[about magic](#s "Magic actually depends on your thoughts, not the spoken words. This is why saying 'Fire' can set an arrow on fire, or create a ball of fire, or whatever. The reason mages use the ancient language is that you can't lie in it, so what you're saying has to match your thoughts. This makes it much easier to properly focus on the effect you're trying to achieve.")

[More of the same](#s "Magic was originally ONLY used via thought, but some ancient race called the Grey People realized the danger of this (you want to set fire to a door that's in your way, but think of your ally and accidentally set them on fire instead) and cast some enormous spell to make their language, the Ancient Language, impossible to lie in, allowing it to be used for focusing one's thoughts when performing magic.")

  Do you mean the Eragon books? Because if so, I was literally about to post a rationalist discussion of that series. Crazy.

  In the event that you were, I think something important to note is that the magic is cast by speaking exactly what you want to happen, and once a command is begun it cannot be cancelled. In this way, it seems that the source of magic is very similar to a computer executing commands, albeit through a natural language interface. Also of note is that it is stated that intent can bend the meaning of a word but cannot overrule it. For example, saying "fire" might produce anything from a fireball to a firebolt to a wave of flame, but saying the word "fire" and meaning "lightning" will produce fire instead of lightning.

  Also, it's stated that one can imbue objects with magical energy to be drawn out later, creating a sort of battery. A rational character would not only store as much as he could into a repository like this each night (as magic power regenerates naturally) but could also use other people's energy, such as downed enemies or (as eragon actually did) slaughtered animals.

  Edit: Also, a rationalist would probably try to find some use for the fact that the Ancient Language (that is, the language of Magic) is impossible to lie in. However, omissions, implications, and clever wording are permitted by the magic. Also, if memory serves, it was possible to say something like "I love you" to your worst enemy and be thinking of your wife, thus *technically* telling the "truth" in a twisted sort of way.

    Yes, I do mean the Eragon books. The series' proper name is "The Inheritance Cycle", so I used that name.

    Regarding how magic is cast, see the spoiler I added to the OP.

    I seem to recall Eragon filling up the ruby in his sword's pommel (or possibly the jewels in his belt) every night before bed over some duration.

    Also, Brom does just that with the jewel in Aren during his time in Carvahall, as per the [wiki](http://inheritance.wikia.com/wiki/Aren)

    It should be noted that (IIRC) you can only take energy from organisms that are actually still *alive*. This passage:

    > *[Saphira:]* You can draw energy from your surroundings if you have to.

    > *[Eragon:]* I won’t, not unless I kill another of Galbatorix’s magicians and can take it from the soldiers. Otherwise, I’ll just be hurting the rest of the Varden, since there are no plants or animals here I can use to support us.

    suggests that Eragon can in fact steal energy from people, but that doesn't work if they have defenses.

      I haven't read it in a while, but I think gems could be permanently charged, so you only needed to do it once (at least until you use the magic up)
      ```

      - u/Solonarv:
        ```
        According to my hazy memories, energy stored in a gem *does* decay, at a rate that depends on the kind of gem and its cut. This is why you can't just pick up a random rock and start using it as a battery. The jewel in Aren was filled up over *years*, so they can definitely keep their charge for quite a while.
        ```

          Responding to this entire comment chain, as I was a big fan of the books as a kid and the information regarding it's cockamanie magic system is still fresh in my mind.

          1) There is no "magic" energy. Instead, living organisms produce a sort of "energy of life", which is used in daily living, and is used to fuel magic. This energy is replenished by resting, eating, and drinking. You can kill yourself through energy exhaustion from overcasting magic. The characters in-verse describe the "energy" thing as "it taking as much energy as it would take to do it by hand". Inherently magical creatures and creatures touched by magic in some way (Dragons and Elves for the former, Dragon Riders for the latter) tend to have a much larger "energy" storage capacity, which is reflected in their biology by reduced need to sleep and increase physical strength, speed, and longevity. This energy can be stolen by a powerful mage, but the technique is not taught until the magician's passive telepathic ability has expanded to the level of being able to sense the meager life energy of plants and insects, which tends to allow the development of a powerful empathy with living creatures.

          2) "Energy" can be stored in gems. The finer the cut and more precious the gem, the more energy it can store. Gems are ranked in value by how much "energy" they can store by magical races, and non-magical races are basically copying them. No good explanation is given as to HOW the gems store energy. Energy in gems deteriorates at a rate dependent on the quality of cut, magical conductivity of the gem, and amount of "energy" already in the gem. Paradoxically, the more energy there is in a gem, the more slowly it discharges. This may be explainable by "energy" having attractive properties to other "energy", which might explain how a telepathic "energetic" link to something would enable you to steal "energy" from another living thing.

          3) There is a LOT of leeway in word association. As insane as it may sound, apparently a mage can say "Water" and create a gemstone, because they see enough connection between water and a gem. Apparently, as long as it's sort of related, it can apparently be handwaved to function. So, yeah, it's actually possible to say "fire" and get lightning (because skyfire, or something, I dunno.)

      Yes, it depends on how you word the spell. If someone throws a huge rock at you, casting *stenr letta* (rock, stop!) could suck you dry instantly, whereas a spell that gradually slows the rock could be interrupted before killing you.
      ```

- u/Igigigif:
  ```
  Really, Galbatorix was being an idiot. If someone can make a precog accidentally, then it should be possible to do so intentionally, especially when energy requirements aren't an issue. Anyway, why should he go for the evil despot route. Better to pacify a population through prosperity.
  ```

  - u/Solonarv:
    ```
    Could you refresh my memory of who the precog was? I don't remember there being one.
    ```

    - u/Igigigif:
      ```
      The girl Eragon "blessed" to feel others pain. She also felt near future pains
      ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Are you talking about Elva? She wasn't a precog so much as a particularly powerful empath, who had to act to protect people. And even then, she needed dragon magic.
    ```

    - u/Igigigif:
      ```
      An empath who predict future pain/injury is a (limited) precog in my book
      ```

  - u/whywhisperwhy:
    ```
    Like the others, I think Elva was more of an empath with a danger sense... but I think you're on to something in a more general sense because the "blessing" system in Inheritance is ridiculous. Both the magic that Eragon cast to alter Elva and also dragon enhancement. The tricky bit for the latter being that dragons can cast this magic only when they're in the mood, so if you could manipulate their emotions to consistently inspire this type of magic... you win.

  Elves are not scary enough.

  Galbatorix needs to be sane.
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Elves are plenty scary, and galbatorix is plenty sane (albiet not quite). The elves are just bound by their own code of ethics, and galbatorix is trying to effectively become a god via enslaving dragons and learning the name of the ancient language, he doesn't have the time to run a country. And he almost succeeded, too. The only reason he didn't is that dragon magic > regular magic, and he had royally pissed off literally hundreds of them enough to make them off him.

    And a little bit of insanity is fine on galbatorix's part- his entire character backstory all relates to how losing his dragon really fucked him up.
    ```

- u/GaBeRockKing:
  ```
  The ancient language is pretty well balanced, all told. All the obvious ways to munchkin would be immediatelly warded against by enemy mages, just look at how often Eragon's cheap, easy instant-death spells are succesful. The "nuclear catastrophe" spell is the biggest deal, and even it seems to require that you cast it only using your own body.
  ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  Set up a ward system over your army which essentially causes all of their physical energy to be bundled together in a single pool for defense. If an arrow is loosed at one of your soldiers, the ward draws power from the target and a few nearby soldiers (spreading out the effects of energy drain and minimizing distance, as distance from the source affects energy usage) to change its path enough that it misses everyone. Lethal sword thrusts get similarly redirected. If a single attack would draw too much energy from its local soldiers to defend, the ward draws all of its energy from the soldier at the epicenter of the strike, likely killing him while leaving the rest unharmed. Arrows and swords become useless against your army, and exploding ballista bolts will kill one soldier each. Your ideal battle strategy becomes "sprint forward while unarmored and carrying heavy maces, crushing everything and everyone in your path while your people are invincible."
  ```

- u/blazinghand:
  ```
  I'm not familiar with the system. What are the basics of it? This [wiki](http://inheritance.wikia.com/wiki/Magic) article says that energy used has to come from somewhere, but it can come from surroundings. It also talks about knowledge of a language. It sounds like you form a command in the ancient language and have to have a balanced energy equation to make it happen. Is that it, or is there more to it?
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Energy is, 90 times out of 100, converted from the person's own energy stocks- fat, ATP, all that good stuff. Note that that energy use is not perfect (there's always a loss involved just for casting magic, which increases with the overall energy cost of the spell and decreases with the experience of the caster. Additionally, you seem to be (not explicitly stated, but I inferred it) limited by your bodies ordinary rate of converting foodstuff into energy, or thereabouts. You can't just use all of your 100,000 kcal of energy at once, and if you cast a spell costing energy at a higher rate than you can provide, you die of exhaustion (like someone who overexerted yourself.) That being said, the spell can still go off, provided that you die *after* having spent enough energy for the spell to complete.

    9 times out of 100, you'll be using magic stored in a crystal, either by you or another mage. More precious crystals have a higher total storage capacity. Since diamond is listed as the most useful, I'd guess that more regular crystals let you store more energy, and they're therefore more valuable.

    .9 times out of 100, you'll be casting that spell with another mage, with tour minds connected. Mages are capable of giving their energy to other mages, which is why Dragons are so useful- Dragons cause people to become mages by hatching for them, and end up serving as massive batteries for spells.

    .1 times out of 100, you draw energy from your surroundings. Very, very few people know they can do this, and fewer are capable. It requires interfacing, mind to mind, with what you want to draw energy from, and taking it. It doesn't work on those that can shield their minds, and you feel everything that organism feels, so people tend to avoid doing this to avoid feeling themselves dying, over and over and over again.

    Using the ancient language is less like using a programming language, and more like writing a law. When casting a spell, it binds magic to do no more than what you say, but you can do anything within those constraints. Concentration is still needed for a specific effect, but not as much, and the consequences of failure are less dire. When conversing in it, your underlying meaning must still be in those words, but you can still mislead people listening to you. If you, of your own volition, swear an oath in the ancient language, you can't willingly break it without an escape clause (barring a very specific extenuating circumstance), but you can re-interpret your oath however you wish, provided you maintain the letter of the "law" so to speak.

    When spelling the ancient language (that is, it was just a normal language before they cast the largest spell ever to bind magic to it, killing themselves off from overexertion), the Precursors (grey folk) set it up so that everything can understand the meaning behind words spoken in the ancient language, although nuance is lost. Each sapient has a "True name" in the language, composed of words that describe them on a fundamental level. While elves know their true name instinctively, every other species needs to determine their own name by intensive soul-searching. It's possible to discover someone else's true name by reading their minds, and figuring it out by how they think, but it's very difficult. Knowledge of your own true name allows for better self control. Knowledge of someone else's true name allows you to control them, and force them to swear oaths of their own volition. It's very rare for someone's true name to change, but if it happens that person is no longer bound by any of their previous oaths. Additionally, the ancient language has it's own name, which allows for anyone that knows it to modify the language, which effectively gives them total control over everyone, since they can choose a word to represent an individual as their true name, or change any word to any other word, allowing for the creation of any spell. This is especially important since mages tend to horde their knowledge of the ancient language, so that an uneducated mage may be forced to use suboptimal phrases for their spells, or be completely unable to cast certain spells entirely. The elves evidently know enough of the language to converse exclusively in it, but their knowledge isn't total, and they're unwilling to share with outsiders. The name for the ancient language has long since been lost, but the big bad's reason for ignoring the rebels on a personal level is that he's been trying to discover the Name for the past century (as well as enslaving dragon souls to serve as an energy source.)

    Mindreading is an ability available to every mage, as well as some people who can't do magic. It basically does exactly what it sounds like. There's also a telepathy aspect, where mages send data to individual minds or everyone in range. The defense against mindreading is to concentrate on something, so that the mindreader can't access a person's memories. Everyone can block a mindreading attempt, and everyone can detect a mindreading attempt, but both require training. With enough focus, it's even possible to set up a facade for a mindreader to see that gives false data. To subvert an attempt to block mindreading, a mindreader needs to distract whomever is defending their mind, whether in meatspace or by using telepathic "attacks." mindreading can read both surface thoughts and memories, the the former takes less concentration. Doing anything that requires concentration (casting a spell, telepathy, trying to mindread someone else yourself) makes it easier for others to read your mind. It is possible to defend someone else's mind for them, but more difficult that defending your own.

    Most magicians upkeep a variety of wards, which are defensive spells that activate under certain preconditions, then have a predetermined effect. Wards can either be fueled with energy stored into them, energy stored in a crystal, or the caster's current energy store when they go off. Wards are tricky to make, because you don't accidentally want a ward that kills you. For example, the protaganist made a ward for total defense against all magical spells, and ended up almost dying of magical exhaustion when his compatriots couldn't transfer energy to him, and a ward that stops all projectiles will freeze you in space, as you can't move through the air. This leads to every ward having some sort of loophole, which enemy mages will do the best to try and exploit or bypass. And of course, should a ward run out of energy, it stops working. Wards take instructions a bit more literally than a mage might, so mages also need to know as many words in the ancient language as possible to make effective wards.

    Magic is instantaneous with relation to distance, but there is a delay after casting for the magic to take hold. Magic itself is unblockable (without use of the Name of the ancient language), but it's possible to counteract the effects of a spell. Thus, along with wards, leads to wizard-on-wizard combat resolving with, usually, very few spells being cast. Instead, because wizards aren't sure they can bypass their enemy's wards, and aren't sure their enemy's last ditch attack won't do something they didn't think to ward against and then kill them, they instead spend most of the battle trying to get into their opponent's mind. Once there, they have the ability to counteract any of their enemy's spells, and even influence them so they can't cast spells, as well as bypass their wards, basically guaranteeing a kill on the enemy mage without dying themselves. If a mage tries to cast a spell without first breaking into an enemy's mind, that enemy mage will just cast their best death spell, effectively guaranteeing M.A.D. This leads to a lot of sword carrying mages, because sharp, pointy objects are a great way to save energy, distract enemy mages, and kill things without engendering MAD.

    Now, wordless magic can be cast, but aside from being obscenely dangerous, very few people even know it's possible (most think the ancient language causes magic to happen) so the only things to get any real mileage out of the ability are dragons, spirits, and werecats.

    Finally, the energy cost for a spell increases significantly as the distance from the spellcaster to the spell target increases. There are exceptions made to circumvent this rule (the teleportation spell only cares about object mass, the primary scrying spell has a fixed cost per second, but only allows you to see things you've seen before, and things in the dark will be similarly dark, so you can't just instantly access any book.)

    edit: holy shit, nearly 1500 words, typed out on a phone screen. In retrospect, despite his other failings, Paolini is actually pretty good about making a well defined magic system, even if he copied some elements from other peoples' works.
    ```

  - u/Igigigif:
    ```
    In short, what you say, happens, but it costs "life force." Casting doesn't actually use up your lifespan, but exhausting your reserves is lethal. There is some indication that the more explicit your statements are, the more efficient your spell. Also, [](#s "there is a technique that lets you drain life force from surrounding fauna (including microbes)")
    ```

  - u/Solonarv:
    ```
    You have some sort of mana pool, which happens to also be your life energy (so running yourself dry does kill you). Spell draw energy form that pool, and the amount is equivalent to how much you'd need to do the task normally.

    It's not very clear what is meant by this (the author *was* 15 when he started writing it), and I don't remember the book going into it in much more detail. The gist of it is that it's easy to lift a pebble, but if you want a nuke-level explosion you need to convert your entire body mass to energy (which is off by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, but not too inaccurate otherwise).

    Also, check the spoiler(s) I added to the OP for just what role the ancient language plays in spellcasting.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      IIRC, life energy is just regular bodily energy, and if you take too much too fast, you die of exhaustion regardless of how much total energy you can produce.
      ```

- u/MugaSofer:
  ```
  What *is* this lifeforce stuff magic runs off? How does it replenish? What, if any, are the effects of running low (beyond the risk of instant death if you run out)? And, perhaps most importantly, what *determines* how much lifeforce an organism has?

  Also, there's some definite transhumanism stuff there with the elves and such.
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Lifeforce is just you normal energy, as in, ATP. If you lose too much energy, too fast, your body dies of exhaustion just like if you tried to replicate the action in real life. You can convert that lifeforce energy into purely magic energy, but it's restored by eating and digesting like regular.
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      Huh. Any way to suck the ATP out of, say, meat, I wonder? That would be extremely useful. (Or simply to take energy from people/animals *without* taking it all and killing them.)
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        You don't have to kill them, that's just the best way to get energy. Sure, you could nab only a portion of that energy, but you'd need to concentrate more to do so, meaning it's slower and you leave yourself open to mental attacks.

        As for meat, it's explicitly stated it only works for alive things. It's not necessarily impossible, but in the hundreds of years they've used magic the elves haven't figured it out yet. Keep in mind that the concept of atoms has only been invented by the very last book, and even then only by a centuries old dragon who does nothing but think.
        ```
