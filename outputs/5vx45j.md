  Huh. I definitely wouldn't want to *personally* live on that ship, I think - I'm too attatched to my chosen gender - but it doesn't seem like a bad or particularly unhappy place, actually.

  A+ weirdtopia.

  - u/DRMacIver:

    I'm glad to hear you say this, because it's more or less the intended reaction to the ship society. :-)

    In general the ship is supposed to be neither dystopia nor utopia, but instead optimised for certain things that aren't necessarily well correlated with what we'd want. I think on balance it ends up being a significantly better place to live than early 21st century earth, but there are some significant downsides and enough that is different that it'd be really hard for most people to adapt to.

      That is absolutely not how I feel about this story. It's clearly not a paradise, and a lot of it is the main character but:

        - Protag has the same introvert/antisocial tendencies that I have, along with the same genuine enjoyment of the small amount of interaction they can stomach. 
        - Protag sees software deployments as complex ecosystems, requiring management and biodiversity on top of hard boundaries. Again like I do. 
        - There's a similar level of non-concern with gender that I feel, even with our social expectations. 
        -  I absolutely love being the person that is constantly running around making sure an organization works, even if it's not really noticeable how much smoothing and optimization I do in the background.
        - The political structure of the ship parallels a lot of my favourite ideas on governance. Though I'd probably have a vaguely quadratic vote buying scheme on top of the system of voting.
        -  I suspect I would love living in space if my biology doesn't disagree.
        - Good lord, the idea that people treat build artifacts are saleable things annoys the fuck out of me, but I didn't ever have a pithy way to express that before. 

      It's likely just a very lucky match between my personality and the particular choices of ship, protag, and setting, but this is very much the sort of world I want to live in. It's not so well developed that I can fantasize about it, but there's a large space of worlds consistent with your portrayal I would love being a part of.

        That's OK too. :-) The social norms of the society in question will definitely fit *some* people (including a lot of my friends TBH).

        > Though I'd probably have a vaguely quadratic vote buying scheme on top of the system of voting.

        Heh. My notes on this explicitly say "I don't actually know the details of the voting schemes because I hope they've progressed a lot further in voting system design than we have, but it's probably actually a quadratic voting scheme or something similar".

  >Err. Wait. No. The other thing. New chapter out today but I forgot about the new "Only post your stuff once a week" rule, so somebody else will have to post it for me (hint hint).

  I think that rule needs to be amended to include an exception for new chapters in established works that have historically done well here.
  ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    Thanks for posting it for me!
    ```

    - u/traverseda:

      This is also a good example for allowing moderator discretion, and not trying to get definitive rules in place. Hard rules can be bypassed pretty easily.

      Ideally we'd include some kind court system. But that's probably going too far.
      ```

      - u/DRMacIver:
        ```
        I think getting someone else to post for you is the rule working as intended, based on the discussion from the thread where it was introduced.

        It normally doesn't cause me problems TBH (my schedule is every other week), I just happened to run into it this week because I decided to finish off my ancient unfinished fanfic. At the same time, I'm not really clear what the problem it was designed to solve was.
        ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:

        Working as intended!
        ```

      - u/Norseman2:
        ```
        In general, the amount of labor-hours involved in making a decision should be proportional to the importance of the decision. A court system makes perfect sense when significant and potentially life-altering decisions are going to be made, but not so much when it comes to posting weekly mini-fiction on a subreddit. For our purposes, less than sixty seconds of a mod's time to make a decision should be sufficient.
        ```

        - u/traverseda:
          ```
          For a first judgment, sure. But there should be more transparency and the ability to escalate.

          It's not a problem *here* in particular, but it ends up being a problem in pretty much every community past a certain size.
          ```

          - u/Norseman2:
            ```
            Absolutely. Transparency can be achieved with almost no effort and does a good job of helping to eliminate abuse/incompetence. Escalation does take some effort, but it helps to reduce the incidence of incidental bad decisions, so it's generally worth it.

  Armsmaster *wishes* he had that social software.

  - u/nerdguy1138:
    ```
    Hell, *I* want that social software!

    That would make whoever writes it instantly god-level wealthy! So many stupid things happen due to miscommunication and misunderstandings.
    ```

    - u/DRMacIver:
      ```
      > Hell, I want that social software!

      Yeah, the social software stuff is the bit that everyone (including me) is jealous of.

      It's also just... not actually very technically hard? Or, it's technically hard, but mostly in ways we're already good at. Most of the moving parts have pretty good prototypes in the labs today, and computers are well on their way to being better at reading facial expressions than the median human (and certainly better than me). 

      This isn't an expertise area for me, so I may have been taken in by some good marketing, but I'd be very surprised if we didn't start seeing things like this in common use in the next 10-20 years tops.
