  Okay, I'm calling this one out. Why haven't Daimen, a highly experienced and competent treasure hunter, even thought about the underground before, until Zach of all people pointed it out? It would be one thing if the jungle didn't have a known and extensive underground system, but he doesn't have even that excuse - from the wording of the exposition it seems that the Dungeon-like underground of the jungle is uncharted, but hardly unknown.
  ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    Agreed. It's a total Idiot Ball and makes him look absurdly incompetent.
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      He *does* call himself an idiot about it, but I don't think that quite makes up for it given that the Dungeon exists across the entire world and is well known for having many valuables within its depths.  I would accept an 'it's just impractical to search the entire dungeon as well as the entire surface' but he's already narrowed the location down to a relatively small space.
      ```

    - u/Laser68:
      ```
      To be fair. This is more of a they tracked it by tracking the movements of the last people to have it, who died in the jungle. I think they assumed it would be above ground because there was no real reason for it to be underground. When someone mentioned underground he scolded himself for not thinking too hard on it, but even in the end its not really deep underground, it is in a place they already checked. Assuming treasure = underground simply because it is a more attractive option as a hiding place is really stupid, and probably not very realistic.
      ```

      - u/vallar57:
        ```
        That explains why they bother searching aboveground at all despite Awan-Temti's little crusade being an old history, but doesn't explain why they don't even think about the underground. Stuff he carried could end up underground for a large variety of reasons, like the emperor carrying it there himself in a vain attempt to hide from the dangers of the jungle, or even simply being washed underground by rainwater during a rain season (it is, after all, a jungle). And these reasons should be even more apparent to a qualified treasure hunter.
        ```

        - u/Ozimandius:
          ```
          And with all these clearly intelligent beasts of various sorts around, many of which appear to be based in or around caves, why wouldn't one of them perhaps grabbed interesting artifacts and tucked them in their lair?  Did he really think he just hadn't looked through enough piles of leaves or what?
          ```

          - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
            ```
            In order of the chapter’s progression, my three guesses were actually that: 

            1) either the drakes kept relocating the orb when they saw yet another human party approaching; 

            2) stored and protected it in their nest because it gave some magical bonus (increase monster production by x%, for instance);

            3) or was swallowed by the hydra, making it bigger and stronger than normal.

            Also, I too agree on the Idiot Ball.
            ```

      - u/Ozimandius:
        ```
        Assuming treasure = 'definitely above ground, I didn't even THINK about underground' seems much more stupid.  No one is suggesting that it should have been obvious it was underground, but it certainly should have been one of the possibilities.
        ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      Him and his whole team of fifteen people, some of whom are probably even more experienced, if less prodigious.
      ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      Yes, I read his response to the suggestion as withering sarcasm, and was dumbfounded to see that it wasn't.
      ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Fair point.

    Hmmmm....

    > "It's here," Zorian said excitedly.

    > "What? What's here?" Daimen asked in confusion.

    > "The orb, of course," Zorian said. Was he intentionally being stupid? "It's here, I can sense it."

    Isn't this suspicious?
    ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      Well, this is probably just Zorian being overexcited and projecting his state of mind onto others. They are not looking for a lost item in a room, when the meaning of "it's here" phrase is obvious, they are on a long and difficult expedition, and a sudden "it's here" can mean just about anything.
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        On its own, its a reasonable explanation. In conjunction with Daimen acting stupid about the orb twice in this chapter it's suspicious. Could be a foreshadowing.
        ```

        - u/vallar57:
          ```
          ... It's so crazy you might actually be onto something!
          ```

          - u/Xtraordinaire:
            ```
            It's actually 3rd or 4th indication that something's fishy about Daimen's situation, starting with the chapter named Marred Perfection where it is stated that Daimen finds his bride to be perfect. (Also a pun?)

            But so far Orissa has been nothing but perfect. This whole situation has been too smooth despite significant exposition, and some ominous hints. 

            Let's just say my Chekhov gun sense is tingling.
            ```

            - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
              ```
              Man, I would hate to see Daimen heartbroken. He seems to genuinely like her (if it’s not some bee serum effect).
              ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              Yeah I also definitely smell something fishy.
              ```

        - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
          ```
          What exactly has damien done to make people everywhere think he's so amazing? Is it possible he is just of above average skill/intelligence that has been blown out of proportion by those he interacts with due to his empathetic manipulation? He's certainly not exhibited any profound skill or intelligence in the last couple of chapters.
          ```

    - u/GoXDS:
      ```
      I think it's simply that Zorian made no visible attempts to scan for the orb. To everyone else, Zorian was simply walking along doing nothing until Zorian suddenly says it's here. They could've thought he meant a creature was present and he detected their mind
      ```

      - u/MoralRelativity:
        ```
        A much more likely explanation IMO.
        ```

  - u/somerandomguy2008:
    ```
    Yeah, I feel like this would be worth fixing for the author if/when he gets around to editing the story. It doesn't have to be a major overhaul of anything. He could either scrap the ritual and say that the maps they have of the underground are from previous explorations of it or keep the ritual and claim that it's a new ritual that they've only developed sometime since their last attempt at exploring the underground. Daimen could still be annoyed that he hadn't thought of the underground - just make it clear that he's annoyed that he hadn't thought to re-explore the underground earlier *that day* rather than annoyed that he hadn't *ever* thought to explore the underground.
    ```

  - u/Memes_Of_Production:
    ```
    I agree with the statement, but it also seems like it isnt going to matter - the team has searched via divination in *exactly* the spot where the orb is located, but outside of the soul sense it appears to be shielded from all forms of detection. So it is a bit of an idiot-ball, but its not actually the resolution of any relevant plot detail - a very minor sin all said and done.
    ```

  - u/LeifCarrotson:
    ```
    Also, the story later said that they'd searched the cenote already and not found it.
    ```

  - u/sephirothrr:
    ```
    Like the other person said, they were looking for it by tracking the previous owner, who they suspected died aboveground. There's no reason for the orb to be underground unless someone moved it there postmortem.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      What like rain or the movement of jungle creatures
      ```

    - u/bludvein:
      ```
      100s of years in the jungle would cause it to sink pretty far underground even if it wasn't picked up or eaten by a jungle creature. It's not like it would just stay there where it fell.

      Looking underground absolutely shouldn't be something he just thought of in his situation.
      ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      Nah. No-one would ever re-enact *that* old cliched and hackneyed trope that appears in every fantasy world ever.
      ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    Because he was using logic. It was highly unlikely that  Awan-Temti got separated from his retinue. He was not stupid enough to do it on his own, and it would be too strange coincidence if some powerful creature carried away specifically him. And for all his train to go underground for some strange reason?
    You see, Daimen is not genre savvy. He don't know he is in the book. If he would know he is in the book it would make underground pretty obvious. However he erroneously thought he is in the real life, and in the real life archaeologists usually base their plans on evidences and logic. Unlike conspiracy theorists If archaeologists can't find their target in the reasonable locations they assume it's not there, not that it is in the most difficult to reach place.
    ```

  - u/DerSaidin:
    ```
    Because he was searching for an orb. He doesn't know where it is. It could be on the surface.

    The thing that changed now is he has Zorian, who can detect it from a distance. With Zorian they can travel underground and detect the orb on the surface (this was my understanding of what they where about to start doing).
    ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      It *could* be on the surface, yes, but Daimen thought it *should* be on the surface before Zach pointed out that it could also be underground.
      ```

      - u/DerSaidin:
        ```
        "It could be on the surface" is a reason why his party couldn't have just been moving around in the relative safety (I assume) of underground for their whole expedition. It is not a reason to *only* look on the surface. My previous post was unclear there, sorry.

        Previously they needed to search underground and on the surface. This time they have Zorian's detection ability, so now they don't need to go on the surface at all, they can detect the orb on the surface from just below the surface.

        Re-reading that bit again, it does sound more like Daimen just didn't think to look underground :/
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          I really don't think that underground will be safer than aboveground. Remember, this section of the Dungeon is untamed.

          I also think it's natural enough that Daimen forgot to check underground - though he was right that it was a significant mistake. If I were trying to find where someone deliberately hid a treasure in their house, I would look for trapdoors and basements, but if I were hunting all over the house for my keys, I would just focus on working out where I'd been. Daimen has spent his efforts narrowing down where the emperor fell, and it didn't previously occur to him that the orb might actually be hidden from view rather than just lost.
          ```

  - u/Terkala:
    ```
    I disagree. Daimien was looking for a king that was fleeing an opposing army through the jungle. One populated by monsters that don't value loot. So it would be illogical to assume that the king tried to hide in a more dangerous area than the jungle itself. 

    Then go from that assumption to months of searching a jungle when you've already discounted the underground as an option, and it's not unreasonable.

  ```
  Here is hoping the Hydra ate the orb, and that is why the group did not find it the last time they checked the area
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Quite possible, though I suppose it ate the emperor.
    ```

  - u/spanj:
    ```
    I hate to dash your hopes but Zorian stated that the orb was in a cave along the walls surrounding the cenote. The hydra came up from the cenote itself.
    ```

    - u/Laser68:
      ```
      It is not like it is impossible. The hydra was underwater, there could have been an underwater cave that went below the cave he pointed out. The hydra swam out to the cenote from below the cave
      ```

      - u/spanj:
        ```
        It's not impossible but less likely. If the hydra was in the smaller cave which connected to the cenote on another side, I'd assume that Zorian would have been able to detect it.

        What seems more likely to have happened is that the wailing of the chameleon drakes travels further than divinations and mind sense distance limits with the help of magical prosthetics. This would mean the hydra was significantly further away.
        ```

        - u/Laser68:
          ```
          I assumed zorian did not detect it because it was asleep, the cenote is warded (which would be really odd) or the hydra moved in from a distance, which might work for my cave theory, depending on whether his mind magic range is larger or smaller than the marker range.
          ```

          - u/spanj:
            ```
            The last case seems like the best defense. I am very skeptical that being asleep takes one off the "Great Web". Your mind is always doing something, whether or not you are conscious.
            ```

            - u/Laser68:
              ```
              Sure, but its thinking less than if you are awake, and a hydra is not a person. The less intelligent something is I think the harder time he has noticing it (or at least of it standing out from all the things he can notice) and if an animal is asleep it is probably almost invisible
              ```

            - u/DerSaidin:
              ```
              Yeah, more likely its minds just looked like a bunch of dragons.
              ```

  - u/Overmind_Slab:
    ```
    I hope so too. Zach's reaction to this thing makes me view it as less of a threat. He may just do that because he's been killed so many times by giant monsters that he's used to punching above his weight but he may also just be confident of killing it. If the hydra has access to a powerful magic artifact or has been exposed to the thing for its entire life then maybe it'll be an especially troublesome fight. There needs to be a reason Zach doesn't just dice the thing to pieces with whatever spell he used on the drakes.
    ```

  ```
  Damien and Zorian, maybe making up! <3

  Also when Damien is like:

  >"A lot of bloodlines aren't guaranteed for children to inherit in their raw state," Daimen said. "There are often artificial methods of ensuring inheritance involved, such as specialized potions and rituals. I doubt the Taramatula will care much."

  ...love can really blind a man!

  Also, Zach laughs in the face of danger. Classic Zach.
  ```

  - u/gbear605:
    ```
    I interpreted it as "I doubt the Taramatula will care much that they will have to use those artificial methods"
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Same here. 

      Although I suspect Daimen is so wrong here.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Yes, I think Zorian's suspicion that Orissa and the Tarmatula are maybe going after him for sheer opportunism instead of actual love,  can prove to be true. Possible betrayal in future?
        ```

        - u/blazinghand:
          ```
          Why would they betray him? Keeping him around to sire children and then raise them and teach them how to use their powers is in their interest. They want him happy and helpful and invested in his kids' future. There are some reasons to betray him, but there are plenty of reasons to not do so as well, so I wouldn't expect betrayal unless there's something else going on. After all, we learned this chapter that they have to communicate with the bees in physical ways or with unstructured magic. Being able to do so via mind magic by breeding a natural mind mage into their line would be super useful. If Damien loves Orissa and wants to get married, have kids, and teach those kids how to use their powers, everyone involved is a reasonably happy camper.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Yes I am not saying they will, but if it's true what Zorian implied, in a life and death situation(which would probably occur  somewhere in future amidst these perils), Orissa won't hesitate to leave him stranded in the battlefield. "I will just get another mind mage, it's not that I liked you anyway".

            Also I thought about this when girl tried to probe into Zorian's mind a few chapters ago
            ```

            - u/Xtraordinaire:
              ```
              Well, there's definitely a life and death situation happening right about now. We'll see on May 7th.
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                Yeah it's not the first time we are talking abt betrayals actually, the matriarch had also planned it. Will be interesting anyway
                ```

        - u/spanj:
          ```
          If offspring was all they wanted, they could have gotten rid of Daimen ages ago. They've probably had sex often enough where pregnancy would not be an issue.

  ```
  I'm excited to see Zach throw down! What stopped the eyes-through-walls guy from seeing the hydra?
  ```

  - u/DerSaidin:
    ```
    It was submerged deep down the cenote.
    ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Its dwelling might be too deep for the eye to penetrate, remember they never actually go deep before. Also, it might be sleeping so it almost indistinguishable for its surrounding. Large lizard often depicted as heavy sleeper.

- u/melmonella:
  ```
  Surprisingly little of importance happened. But it seems like Z&Z will get their hands on the orb in this restart at least, so that's good. And compared to the other pieces of the key, orb seems relatively lightly defended.
  ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    God knows they needed a break on at least one of these things. Quatach Ichl, then the royal treasury being way too well defended... They don't have a lot of time to perfect getting all of them in the same restart.

  ```
  I wonder if the Hydra has one mind, or 8? Can Zorian dominate one head and attack the others? How sentient is this thing?
  ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    Magic resistance might be an issue, sentient or not.  Zorian figured he could dominate one Chameleon Drake but not two because they have natural resistance to mind magic, and something as imposing as a hydra might have more.

    I do want to see Zorian use his standard, totally unfair, fighting style against something like this, though.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      >Zorian figured he could dominate one Chameleon Drake but not two

      *Two* Zorians could totally pull it off though.
      ```

      - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
        ```
        He’s routinely making multiple simulacrums by now. Imagine the drakes’ surprise in one of the next restarts when the Hydra comes out to help them just to be mind-dominated by a sync-casting force of 8 Zorians.

            Even then it wouldn’t be the best strategy, unless the hydra revelas that they’ll have to fight under specific restrictions, like with the grey spider. 

            I was imagining it more like an omake — would’ve been a funny scene.

          8 seems a bit excessive. 3 was the most he could handle without his nama regen going negative, and none of them were doing any heavy casting.

          I concur, though it would be pretty funny to see Zachs reaction. I wonder how much time there is until the raid, Zach or Zorian could be injured significantly like with their early grey hunter attempts and won't have enough time to recover; fighting a hydra is kinda risky at the moment.

    - u/winz3r:
      ```
      I can't understand how all this magic resistance stuff works. Apparently the magic resistance of magic animals is a significant obstacle to Zorian, while Human mind shields can be taken on almost on a whim.

      Wouldn't it make sense to find out why magical creatures have such high magic resistance and how to copy it? Although granted, Zorian and Zachs probably don't need any immediate mind magic protection.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Magical creatures are magical. People are not magical, but learn to use magic.

        Very simple.
        ```

        - u/GoXDS:
          ```
          /u/winz3r people still have magic resistance as well. Remember Zach bypassing Zorian's to give him mana sight or the constant mentions of people immediately noticing if they were being mind attacked (even normal people, due to resistance). Plenty more examples throughout 

          It's probably just a matter of constitution. It's not a characteristic we have in real life so explaining it using real world examples probably wouldn't go too well but... think of it maybe as skin of a human vs the much thicker skin of an elephant?

          The problem isn't really the difficulty necessarily but the time it's take to dominate? Unless ofc you're talking about something on the level of a freakin grey hunter resistance.
          ```

          - u/Menolith:
            ```
            Isn't that life force's doing?

            IIRC it's "native" mana which resists being changed. Some creatures are so magical that they can only live in high-mana environments, so it would add up if that same mana requirement resulted in much higher life force reservoir and thus resistance to magical shenanigans.
            ```

            - u/GoXDS:
              ```
              off the top of my head, I don't remember "life force" being brought up as being a thing (outside of life mana). I was thinking of that, too (being in mana rish environments leads to high resistance), but that could go either way. it might be a requirement to have some resistance to even be living in such an environment. 

              if simply living in mana rich environments led to higher resistance, then living in Cyoria would be perfect (but this is not the case). plus ambient mana is mostly poisonous anyways so we can assume (and I think already confirmed?) that all things with souls have resistance

              though I guess the core question is where this resistance stems from. it might as well be because of life force. I should check again the worldbuilding pages to see if this was mentioned specifically
              ```

              - u/Menolith:
                ```
                Chapter 51:

                >If he remembered correctly, life force was simply a special type of personal mana that wasn't part of a mage's mana pool and was used exclusively by the body to keep itself living and resist foreign magics. Since the amount of life force rarely varied much between humans, and couldn't be used to power spells, the academy instructors hadn't spoken much about it.

                The high mana density which comes from the Hole is the reason why Cyoria is a thing. It _is_ the perfect place for beings who either require or make use of vast amounts of mana. However, I don't think that strictly speaking leads to a higher resistance. Evolutionary factors aside, high mana density doesn't give you higher amount of life force, just enables it. Highly magical creatures need to hide in the depths of the Dungeon or they will wither away, and as Zorian conveniently mentioned in that paragraph, human life force levels are mostly the same.

                Also, ambient mana is toxic only if used as-is to cast spells. Mages are constantly assimilating it into their own reserves to boost their regen.

    TBH, the most rational thing to do would have been to gate in Xvim, Alanic, and his group of battle mages even before the assault on the chameleon drakes occured.

    Completely decimating the population before they can summon the hydra would be optimal. If the hydra ever does get to be summoned, the living metal round would probably help a lot, assuming Zach isn't personally powerful enough to *easily* incapacitate the hydra. If you're on a time crunch, pull out all that you've got.
    ```

    - u/Vakuza:
      ```
      Xvim and Alanic are busy preparing for the invasion of the Ibasan base. Bringing them would take too much time to organise, and could jeopardise that plan. Not a particularly thought out decision frankly.
      ```

      - u/spanj:
        ```
        The assault would probably take a maximum of 2-3 hours. I'm sure if you gave them an early shout out, they could set some time aside. It's not as if they're assaulting Iasku Mansion, which is operated by a fully sapient being with a small army of magical capable units. They're only dealing with 100 odd barely sapient lizards that are incapable of using magic. A small elite task force is easy to organize, especially because Alanic is in charge of said elite task force (battle priests). You can leave out Xvim, his defense capability seems to be more valuable than his assault. Also, I'm pretty sure artifact retrieval trumps Ibasan gate research on the priority list.
        ```

        - u/Vakuza:
          ```
          Again though, you have a fairly capable group already so there's not much point wasting valuable time to make it stronger. They didn't know the hydra was there and dealt with the lizards fairly well, not to mention Zach alone can fight a mage dragon. If things go south Zorian will probably summon his golem army, but I don't think they will need it.

  I found this interesting, I mean we already got the wind of it when that girl tried a few chapters earlier to probe into Zorian's mind. Possible foreshadowing for future betrayals?

  Also nice to see how Daimen reacted when Zorian asked to take it upon himself.

  We learned this chapter that Zorian is a little vain. He wasn't really pleased his chance to shock and awe gone away due Daimen telling his team member about his improbable skill level.

    - u/sambelulek:

      Now that you mentioned Zorian never met these people before and they will not remember seeing him, I recalled Zorian having fun exceeding Ilsa expectation whenever he tried to solicit a spell or two from her. There's also "Mr Junior Necromancer" thing that he said gleefully to Kael in one instance. Yeah, he did like a self gratifying action.
      ```

  - u/DerSaidin:

    I think he has changed a lot in this regard, probably since interacting more with Alanic and Xvim and getting to see how he compares. It isn't a sudden change this chapter. This is character progression - very natural and well done imo.

    Plus it is fun reading of Zorian messing with people's expectations, of course he would enjoy doing it :D
    ```

  - u/AKAAkira:
    ```
    Zorian can be vain, if he feels like blowing off steam. (Back in Chpt. ~10, he was using a rain barrier liberally and amusing himself watching the water on the road part before him after being trounced by the invaders in the previous loop.)

    That said, in this case I'm pretty sure Zorian was just irritated his power level was revealed so openly. Dialogue suggests he knew it was inevitable it would come out eventually, but wanted to keep it on the low as much as he could before Daimen ruined that plan.
    ```

Would Zorian be tempted to build a special magical tool out of them if he can get his hand on them?

  Zorian should have taken a page from Xvim's book: creating a microscopic dimensional gate or throwing a magical item into the cave to facilitate teleportation (Chapter 56 and the teleportation suppressing ward exercise). They clearly were close enough to throw in the irritants.

  If facilitated teleportation isn't possible, he could have used a simulacrum. Have his simulacrum shapeshift into some small robust creature, and throw the shapeshifted simulacrum into the cave. Shift back into human form, collapse or bar the cave entrance, and gate in the rest of the team.

  This could have been done during the battle so when the chameleon drakes returned, they would have been none the wiser.
  ```

  - u/MistahTimn:
    ```
    A persistent problem I see with Zorian is that he tends to forget solutions that he has either seen earlier (like the example you used of Xvim throwing things through small gates to suppress wards) or even solutions to problems he has thought of earlier (like suffocating the Grey Hunter by closing off the cave and letting it respirate to death). It's a little disappointing, but also perfectly understandable considering the amount that he sees and does over the span of the series so far.
    ```

  - u/AKAAkira:
    ```
    Zorian's lack of frequency in recycling strategies aside, the chameleons weren't living in a cave. They made their nest on a cenote, which I had to look up but is essentially a hole in the ground, with *multiple* caves dug into the walls.

    Edit: also, isn't the point of battle to take as little risk as possible? Basically trapping themselves in the same area as the chameleons seems unnecessarily risky.

        The Taramatula are certainly interested in mind magic, and take a pragmatic approach to marriages into the family.

    While it possible the drakes are soul-bonded, the word bonded alone usually meant paired, sexually bonded, or blood relative. But yeah, interesting course of thought there. If we take Briam's word, soul-bonding gives better efficiency for some spell, outright cheat for summoning, and it feel a little bit weird. But Briam also told that bonding required a ritual. Can Zorian subdue the creatures so they can do ritual voluntarily?

- u/ansible:
  ```
  There was a bit of odd word-choice I noticed.  At one point, Zorian says that he's been "spamming" the Key detection request to his soul marker.

  But "spam" and "spamming" are very Internet related terms, referring to the Monty Python skit about spam, and the annoying advertising on Usenet.

  And since the Ikosians don't have an Internet, I found it a little jarring to use Zorian use that term.
  ```

  - u/ben_oni:
    ```
    To be fair, a lot of words are like that, but they now have independent and useful meanings. Especially words derived from mythological/historical names and places. "Spam" may be of newer vintage, making it more jarring, but it's no worse in principal than something like "titanic" or "mercurial".
    ```

  - u/AKAAkira:
    ```
    Not the first time it's happened. I'm pretty sure Zorian mentioned "tanking" in terms of having a shield withstand an attack, and I don't think this world has tanks yet. (Golems, yes, but not tanks.)

    Considering they technically don't even speak English (and their verbal and academic languages are apparently completely different without the readers being aware for 60+ chapters), just take the dialogue as how they would have sounded in modern English. Interpreted through Zorian's mind, since word choice is kinda similar between individual characters.
