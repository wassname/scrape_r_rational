  Seeing this here kind of made me excited!  


  The only problem is this is a really bad go game; it would be a lot cooler if you could somehow encode text into a go kifu that actually made sense.

    ```
    If any encoding of the Torah that's not so ad-hoc it basically has nothing to do with the original information turned out to be a sensible Go kifu, I'd start reconsidering my views on the principles governing the Universe...

      Nothing is a coincidence =)

    ```
    Given an alphabet of N characters, you could take the top-N AlphaGo plays at every turn, and choose which one to take based on the next character you see.
    ```

  I don't really have an opinion either way, but I would expect this kind of post on a friday thread rather than as a main post. What do you guys reckon? \[Just want to open a discussion\]

  ```
  just a weird xpost from /r/baduk, but it reminded me of kabbalah and Unsong. thought others might find it interesting.
