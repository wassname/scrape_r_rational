  Excellent. It may have served to also tag this as sci-fi ([HSF]).

  The only part that confused me was this:

  > Years pass.

  > Two dominant models have survived, in academia, in the scrutiny of the public eye, and in the scrutiny of those scientists who once did Einstein-like work.  There is a theory that the grid is a projection from objects in a 5-dimensional space, with an asymmetry between 3 and 2 of the spatial dimensions.  There is also a theory that the grid is meant to encode a cellular automatonâ€”arguably, the grid has several fortunate properties for such.  Codes have been devised that give interesting behaviors; but so far, running the corresponding automata on the largest available computers, has failed to produce any decodable result.  The run continues.

  Can anyone here make that a little more intuitive to understand?

  Edit: Now that I'm looking at with with the intent to comprehend I feel like the implication is that you have an ordinary 3D space with another "module" attached to it (like a secondary coding language) with the distinction that the distances don't translate between them on a 1:1 basis. So if 1 unit of movement on the *x*, *y*, or *z*-axes might actually be 1.1 units on *v* or *w* axes. I think.

    I think this refers to the fact that the frames are a movie. The creatures depicted are five dimensional, but like our own films represent three-dimensional life in two dimensions, these images are similarly limited. Not understanding this, overestimating the complexity of what is being communicated, Earth's theorists have interpreted the lost data in the "depth" dimensions of the resulting data as a physics asymmetry.

  No, Eliezer, you are the zombies.

  And then Eliezer was a paper-clipper.
