  I like lampshading of tropes, and I'm seeing the start of a plot beyond "let's poke fun at tropes."

  The description of the story seems to focus on Ashur, but the first chapter focuses on the Draig scion; maybe you want to label your perspective characters?

    ```
    no see, that's the "reading about the person you thought the story was about" trope

    very very prolific, essentially in every story, no surprise they'd want to subvert that one out of the gate
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I don't know, reading from the perspective of someone who isn't the main character? Such a cliche, not very subversive.
      ```

- u/SkyTroupe:
  ```
  So how often is this going to be updating? I like it so far but it felt like each chapter just didnt have a lot in it if that makes any sense.

  If the updates are going to be quick and of similar length I'll just leave reading it til I can binge several chapters at once.
