  Hey, that's me. Murder mystery with healthy portion of chunni horseshit on top is my jam. One hundred percent down for this.

  Well, I suppose I'll be following this one. First chapter passed the bar for technical quality, and the premise is (so far) interesting enough to hold me while I wait for more details and/or challenges and/or plot.

  Good start, seems interesting and characters so far are entertaining. One-outfit rule seems weird, hygiene-wise, so I assume there’s something plotty going on there. Noticed ‘would might be weary’ needs to be corrected, but no other errors I could spot.

  Holding out for Liar Game-esque backstabbery and intrigue (and penguin factoids)!
