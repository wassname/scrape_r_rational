## [BST] Superman

### Post:

So I have been writing a Superman fanfic that's mostly told from the viewpoints of Lex Luthor and Lois Lane. It's set in the 1930's, with the second World War looming large, and the single supernatural or otherworldly thing is Superman himself. Superman is of roughly average human intelligence, while Luthor (the villain protagonist) is a genius. The story starts with Superman arriving at the city.

I've been working on rewriting it for awhile now, and sort of need a sanity check on what the best course of action to take would be if you wanted to kill or otherwise neutralize Superman. The story takes Superman more or less at the upper end of his power level - capable of destroying Metropolis in the space of minutes if he so chose.

So let's say that you're Lex Luthor. Superman just shows up one day and starts rescuing people from danger and stopping crimes. He says he's the last son of a dead planet called Krypton, and displays a lot of powers that are clearly far beyond anything known to the science of the 1930s. You don't know about Kryptonite, and you don't know about Clark Kent.

Where do you start with trying to kill a god? (I obviously have my own ideas, but don't want to pollute the waters.)

  In DC 'verse, you need to figure out if Lex will stoop to using magic. Because that isn't something a lone Sups can deal with. Like. At all. Lots of good '20s era mystic stuff that would be period, too, and could be explained as more advanced alien science with a bit of twisting.

  And that is only if you don't want some wild South American or Egyptian pith helmet action to have Lex procure his own honest, controllable, *Earth* god to fight the alien menace. Maybe they are aliens, too, or of alien manufacture originally, but they are part of our cultural melting pot now. And are easy to control with the right systems administrator physical key and password- I mean, golden star head piece and mystic words of power. Ancient gods were all designed with two factor authentication, of course.

  In my book, scientific magic is the easiest answer. It is a force multiplier. If one alien is on Earth, then why not more? And what is magic, but...

  If not that, radiation and gravity are good plot keywords, even without the special sauce. How much hard radiation can the alien take? Can I get x-ray images of his internal structure? If so, then why can't I do more, and kill him with them? If not, guess what? I've got a van and a portable machine, and all week to hunt hidden aliens on the busy streets of the city. Now, is the Man of Steel immune to being trapped in a super-strong artificial gravity well, or looped higher space constructs? That might work if you have access to mad-level science.

  Figuring out he's weirdly solar powered might be a straight shot from working on his crime fighting schedule, especially compared to other, *darker* crime fighters just starting up in other crime riddled cities. Coughbatmancough.

  If all else fails, thematically, use mind control. Not fantasy shit, but directly attacking Superman's ability to think clearly through plots that induce sleep dep, horrible scarring emotional shocks, and paranoia inducing double crosses that drive him into depression and isolation. That should buy some time, at least. Attack the mind, not the absurd, illogical body.
  ```

    > Attack the mind, not the absurd, illogical body.

    I'm going to call this a high risk plan. The absurd, illogical body can head out into space and toss a dwarf planet at you, and the only thing stopping that is a moral code instilled by some farmers in the middle of nowhere, Kansas. If that code is removed, if the mind controlling the body is damaged, it's all over.
    ```

    - u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer:
      ```
      Yeah, can't argue with that. But I'm suggesting focusing on disabling attacks, not making him doubt his moral basis or go insane. Show that his actions have consequences, that humans are fragile and he is reckless. This should be easy, as it is true. Also point out that people are flawed, and don't always line up with his moral code. And there is nothing he can do about that.

      So keep him busy with minor muggings, all day every day, to the point where he can't get anything else done. When he fights a giant robot in the middle of the city (and he will), make sure the Daily Planet has a story the next day about that little kid who was crushed by rubble he didn't even notice. Bank robbery foiled? Great, but a housewife a half a block away was hit by a bullet that bounced off Supe's chest from that Tommy gun fire. She's not expected to make it, leaving behind three kids and a husband.

      Also attack people he's seen with on a regular basis. Maybe Supe's best bud he's always saving, the one from the Daily Planet, is actually secretly a (gasp) socialist! And that *female* reporter who keeps base jumping without proper safety gear? She's having premarital sex *all the time*, undermining basic American values. And instead of simply reporting the truth as it is, Supe's number one fan at the Daily Planet (the paper of note in the city) takes bribes to suppress certain stories (of course he does, you're the one paying him off). That he's also Kent's boss is an added bonus that you won't be aware of.

      Make Supe's back off the big organized crime and tire him of fighting endless petty crimes. If the Earth is actually in danger, sure. Let him save it. If someone threatens the city, point the big blue Boy Scout at it and let him work off some frustration. Maybe suggest the League of Nations use him for some diplomatic missions (read, spying). I hear the new Chancellor of Germany is a bit worrying in some of his politics.

      While Supe's busy in Europe, well, that death ray isn't going to build itself. Unless you make those self-constructing spider bots first. Hmm.

  If I was in this Lex's place, the big issue isn't the how, but the why. There doesn't seem to be much motivation for Lex to kill superman, and all the motivation for Lex to become the poster-child for an ethical industrialization movement, like a Polymathic Henry Ford. If Superman came into the picture, recruiting him would be infinitely more preferable. I'm rather averse to the Superman generator idea, but one high-profit possibility would be keeping my own hands as ethically clean as possible, while teaching Superman how a single white-collar crime hurts thousands more than a single blue-collar crime, and encouraging him to deal with the competition.

    Superman is a potential K-T extinction event waiting to happen. If he didn't have human morality and a drive to fight crime, for some reason, the Earth as we know it would be doomed. He'd be a [Keter class in SCP](http://www.scp-wiki.net/), no question.

    I see Lex as a proponent of the precautionary principle when it comes to aliens and other *unnatural* externalities. Unless you can *prove* they are safe, they should be controlled and contained. Lex understand his superscience inventions, so those are *obviously* safe in this sort of analysis.

    Being Superman's PR campaign manager while he fights muggers on the streets isn't actually control or containment. Wouldn't even be considered past initial analysis.

    In any case, you're Lex Fucking Luthor. With your mind, you would have been ruling the entire country already, if it wasn't for the distraction of Superman. You didn't originally plan to use Superman. You don't *need* him to meet your goals.

    The world would be a far simpler place without Superman. A more controllable and *optimal* place to plot and plan against those pitiful, stupid people who might oppose your long-term goals. Goals that do not include having a super powered nanny who wears his underwear on the outside of his clothes.

    As for exploiting his strange powers, now that you know Superman-type things are *possible*, you can reproduce them later.

    Safely.

    With *science.*

    Good, rational, controllable Earth science.

        Lex Luthor wouldn't be looking to *undo* the effects of Superman. He'd be looking to a post-Superman world, where everything has changed. And certain freedoms need to be limited, for the greater good.
        ```

- u/8gigcheckbook:
  ```
  Depending on Luthor's motivations, I see three avenues:

  * Take out Superman on a social level. Genius-level smear campaign. This may or may not work depending on whether or not Superman gives a shit. However, turning the population against him, despite him doing good things, is probably not too hard. He is an all-powerful unknown, and people can very easily resort to fear. Staged atrocities attributed to him could help this along. Government involvement might as well, either directly through Luthor's contacts or swept along in the general sentiment.
  * Investigate the source of Superman's powers. This will lead to two potential roads of dealing with him. Either a) an understanding of how he got his powers will provide a way to disable them (i.e. kryptonite) or b) will potentially allow them to be replicated. One way to take down a god is through another god. I don't recall whether b is possible in canon, but it seems like a path Luthor might take.

  I would think that Luthor would be doing all of these, along with everything else he can think of. Dude is super smart and rich, so he has the resources to devote to the cause.

      The hardest one. Lose. Turn the city over to the protection of Superman, become his supporter, agent, public face, whatever the last son of Krypton might need a genius level intellect for. Learn all that can be learned of him. Gain his trust. Then, when the chance arrives, remove him, and his potential threat.

          Low-risk? You underestimate Superman. He can hear your pulse race when you lie to him. He can smell your sweat. Be glad his intelligence is limited in this story.

          - u/Chosen_Pun:
            ```
            No, no, this makes a lot of sense. If Lex is so smart, why would he choose to directly oppose Superman? He should *capitalize* on the Man of Steel. Rather than getting his own god to fight, as above, he should get *this* one in his corner to start with.
            ```

  - u/trifith:
    ```
    >Take out Superman on a social level. Genius-level smear campaign.

    Superman comes to the conclusion that humanity is not worth protecting, and throws Ceres at the Earth. Game over.

    >disable them (i.e. kryptonite)

    Probably the best bet. How are you going to get it close to him though?

    >will potentially allow them to be replicated

    Because one extinction level event wandering around is not enough?
    ```

    - u/duffmancd:
      ```
      If you're very clever then the smear campaign can be combined with the psychological attack mentioned elsewhere. Don't just let Metropolis fear Superman, make Superman think it's justified. He retreats to space or a normal life and you're free.

      Lex is plenty happy for another extinction level event to be walking around so long as it's under his control (either it is him, or someone he has absolute control over)
      ```

- u/AmeteurOpinions:
  ```
  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STxCxxWFpG8)'s a scene from Justice League Unlimited (good show) wherein Superman is tricked into destroying an entire housing complex built by LexCorp. The quality stinks, but Lex basically baited Supes into believing there was a kryptonite weapon underneath it when it was only a benign power generator.

  Millions and millions of property damage completely at the fault of Supes for no good reason at all, and the *entire world* knows it. *That* is the sort of anti-Superman ploy Lex can pull off with ease.
  ```

- u/clawclawbite:
  ```
  Gather evidence and wait. Arrange different types of attacks against him (guns, fire, acid, etc.). Get him talking as much as possinle, ideally to scientists. Try to get his actions on film for quantitative analysts.

  And whatever you do, don't make him angry. Out of control, he would destroy the city...

  Go make friends with him if you can. Become his pal. Be someone he can confide in and ask for advice.

  You will only have one chance, know it will work.
  ```

- u/trifith:
  ```
  >capable of destroying Metropolis in the space of minutes if he so chose.

  At minimum. A Superman who turns his mind to it is an extinction level event. A genius like Luthor would realize the risks. He's overpowered on any merely physical level. Genius level intellect is an edge, but a very narrow one. Without Kryptonite, Luthor is almost certainly outmatched. 

  You've given Superman a giant edge here. The world does not know about his weakness, and it isn't available to every wannabe super-villain at the local evil-R'-us. What edge are you giving Luthor to keep the story interesting, rather than the tale of a super powered alien beating up some schmuck who happens to be intelligent?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Lex's greatest advantage is that Superman doesn't know about him. Luthor starts the story as a business tycoon who came up from the gutters of Suicide Slums and has enough money that he's mostly legit. He's involved in some white collar crime of course, because only an idiot plays by the rules, but that's never been Superman's area of attention.

    So the story is mostly about Luthor uncovering information about Superman while being as stealthy as possible, taking into account that Superman can see through walls and eavesdrop from half a city away. As soon as Superman knows that Luthor is after him, the game is pretty much up. (Although Superman is traditionally constrained by his own moral system, Luthor certainly doesn't trust in that, and would like to avoid jail all the same.)

    So in other words, I'm try to write it a bit like the opening parts of Death Note, but from only one perspective. You have the guy who is completely outclassed and has incredibly little information, and eventually he opens up a few cracks that give him leverage.
    ```

  ```
  Superman is obligated to help people, right? Like, he'll exert himself without question to save people in distress. Usually this is presented as him rescuing people in crisis, but it would also seem that Superman should be obligated to help those in need if he has a clear way to do so. Like, if Superman finds a box of polio vaccines, he should really go inoculate some at-risk an at-risk population, or at the very least deliver the box to someone else who can do that.

  So: Lex needs to focus his genius on coming up with intentionally convoluted humanitarian schemes, and then openly broadcasting those schemes as widely as possible. Lex designs, say, a machine that purifies well water, but then chops up the blueprints and scatters them around the world in lead boxes, the locations of which are known only to isolated individuals, who in turn have various problems that only Superman can solve, etc. Send Superman off on overcomplicated fetch quests to keep him distracted. By broadcasting the plans widely, Lex ensures that if Superman doesn't follow the plan, the people will turn against him for not helping them out. 

  Now Superman is at least off of his back for a while. The next step is to expose Superman to as much high-intensity radiation as possible. (This won't be easy in the 1930s, before the advent of nuclear reactors, which is why Lex needs to buy as much time as he can.) If Lex can somehow trick Superman into ingesting a large amount of uranium over time, Superman's body becomes dangerously radioactive. Now he's poisonous, and he can't approach humans without hurting them. He's isolated. (In the comics, can Superman sense radiation? If so, I'm not sure how this'll work.)

  As for how to actually murder Superman once and for all, well, I'm sure the comics contain hundreds of crazy schemes to deprive him of sunlight or throw him into a black hole or something. Coming up with something original will be hard. From a storytelling perspective, I'd say the most *interesting* thing to do would be to have Lex investigate the mechanics of Superman's powers, especially flight, which to my knowledge have never really been explained well. A good rational fic wouldn't have Superman's powers just exist as an inexplicable black box. A good fic would actually dare to come up with a self-consistent system that allows Superman to fly. When EY was writing HPMOR, he didn't just have to imagine smarter versions of the characters, he also had to come up with his own underlying system of magic that goes beyond anything shown in canon, and your story will probably have to do something similar. 

  Good luck with the writing, this sounds like a story I'd love to read.

  I would attack his major weakness, his morality.
  Every week or so have a nice clever scheme were a group of people will be killed in either place a or place b he can only get to one but not both in time.

  Let him know this will continue until he leaves.

  You don't attack the invulnerable man.  You attack what he values, his self image, his morality etc and let his own guilt beat him down.

  Superman may be invulnerable physically be he has shown himself to be, emotionally, as vulnerable as any human.  Exploit it.

  The upper end of his power level is sneezing out galaxies in Silver Age Superman. Current edition he's bench-pressing the Earth (in a meaningful way, not just pushups).

  You'll also want to nerf his superspeed because I think he can fly to the sun and back in a heartbeat.

  Luthor is one of my favorite characters. I'd read this.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    You can read the start of it [here](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man), currently in its third chapter, updates at least once a week. He's very powerful, but I've made an attempt to keep physics more or less intact outside of Superman himself, meaning that if he tried to move through Metropolis faster than the speed of sound he'd be shattering windows along his way - something that Superman would never do. He's also shy a couple of Silver Age powers like ... well, the story is told from Luthor's viewpoint, and Luthor is acting on incomplete information.
    ```
