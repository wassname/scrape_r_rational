## [Discussion] What would be the rational strategy in a RPG apocalypse (Modern Earth switches to RPG rules overnight, monsters spawn everywhere)

### Post:

Assume that the RPG system works similar to Dungeons and Dragons or an MMO inspired by it. So you get the usual tanks, DPS, healers, etc.

Everyone starts at level one, with stats that accurately reflect their capabilities, can choose their class (though some classes may have restrictions; Elizabeth II can pick Queen, most people cannot), and you can't luck into rare and powerful advantages. If you start with advantages they'll have an obvious source based on your background (E.G. Elizabeth II).

  An open-ended question like this might be more fitting for the open friday thread. 

  And my answer to your extremely open ended question is: *obviously* that depends on the specifics. I can't optimize a non-defined ruleset. Summons might be good, might be bad etc pp.
  ```

  - u/bitter_cynical_angry:
    ```
    I feel like the general answer is: min-max and rules-lawyer.  It's not everyone's idea of fun, but I believe it's usually the most effective in any given system.
    ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      Yeah, obviously, but min maxing and rules lawyering in real life just translates to making well thought out decisions, that's very generic advice.
      ```

      - u/bitter_cynical_angry:
        ```
        I'm not sure I agree.  Real life is much more complicated than RPG rules, and I think being more of a generalist in real life is probably better, unless you can be *extremely* specialized, which is relatively rare and difficult.  But with RPG rules, specialization is usually easier, and is highly rewarded, and being a generalist means grossly underperforming your character level, so if you're encountering enemies that are determined by your level and not your actual stats, that's a major problem.

        A determined nerd can probably also memorize the DnD ruleset in a couple weeks (maybe less?  or a bit more?  I've never actually played paper DnD), whereas I think it's probably physically impossible to memorize real life laws.  DnD rules, and RPG rules in general, are also more internally consistent.  I think all that makes rules-lawyering much more practical in RPGs than in real life.  In addition, RPG rules implies a DM or enforcement mechanism that's much more omniscient, powerful, and consistent than any real life law enforcement (mostly fortunately, in both directions), so rules-lawyering is less likely to be overridden by simple violence.

        Thermodynamics would seem like an absurdly bad exploit in an RPG.  Just imagine what you could do with just a second useful system like that.
        ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Well yeah. There's also the point to be made about softcore vs hardcore - you really have to play differently if theres no respawn. Grinding levels and using consumables at 50% HP treshold etc pp
      ```

    - u/Endovior:
      ```
      Rules-lawyering doesn't seem like a practical answer to a LitRPG situation. If some particular set of RPG rules have become the new laws of physics, then you probably don't have access to the exact wording of those rules, and don't have anyone to complain *to* about those rules.

      In fact, barring the existence of an unusually helpful AI-type "System" behind the RPG mechanics that not only gives you all the details of the new rules in a humanly-interpretable format, but is additionally willing to listen to your complaints about said system and make adjustments on-the-fly in response to those complaints, rules-lawyering seems more or less impossible.

  I'm not a particularly notable individual, so my main goal would be to survive over adventuring or the like. To that end, I'd think that the average person would want to aim for what's effectively a production class, or a support one. It's a far safer job to stay home making magic items than it is to go and joust with a beholder.

  As a group, I think you'd want to establish community interactions very quickly to gain group access to niche abilities. You can change the dynamic of a community very quickly by trying to push magic users to high levels quickly, granting access to things like creating food and water or resurrection.

  If we're working off *very* D&D rules, I'd think that a good goal would be to train up a large variety of magic users and a large variety of artificers, hence allowing you to mass-produce magic items and enact the RPG-apocalypse version of the dawning of firearms. Producing magic items en-masse would increase survivability among the low-levelled, young, or weak to a massive degree.
  ```

  - u/GWJYonder:
    ```
    Yeah, you absolutely hit it on the head. The specifics of builds are impossible to determine, we don't have a system described so we can't say things like "go Summoner/whatever". What is universal in such settings and rulesets is the concept of specific builds having counters and weaknesses, and the importance in most cases of building at LEAST a small team to balance out those weaknesses.

    Sure you may luck into an OP build (which OP is specifically trying to head off) or circumstances (maybe you happen to be in an area that doesn't offer a diverse array of threats, so a single builds weaknesses aren't very important as long as those aren't the things you'll run into. For example if you live in a swamp and pick some feature with poison immunity you may be OP in your very local area and not have to worry about things so much), but in most circumstances you need a minimum level of diversity.

    At a bare minimum you'll want a couple different damage types, healing, and some crowd control. Depending on the details you'll want more variety. In 95% of systems the monsters are largely melee, or there are video game style damage-sharing or super gamey threat-generation mechanics, so you need Tanks and a front line. Sometimes that's not as true and everyone needs to be able to take at least some hits because you can't count on aggro. Another possibility are stamina issues (like with Delve, or touched on in City and the Dungeon) where you may have to choose in your builds between really going strong in one encounter, or being able to keep going through multiple encounters.

    The last thing is crafting. If it's something like most MMOs or Culling of Man and everyone gets combat classes and then can pick up a few crafting skills on the side, then great (Or if it's a system where pre-system equipment matters, great, but I don't think I've ever read a Litrpg where the rusty daggers level 5 characters pull out of a rat's anus can't slice through a Main Battle Tank). If it's something like System Apocalypse where people only excel at crafting with specific non-combat classes then the minimal community size for fielding effective people with level-appropriate gear grows a lot larger.

      You don't even need actual healing. I've thought a lot about how the Cleanse aura in Delve would stop Covid in it's tracks. Best skill ever indeed. Our ability to rehabilitate people with damaged (cellular or large damage) bodies is already great. Being able to walk into a building, destroy all the Covid in the air, destroy all the Covid in everyone's bodies, and then walk away to the next building would be wonderful even if you couldn't also magically repair the damage already done to sick people along with the rest of the magic.

        - u/GWJYonder:
          ```
          Yeah the math of what exactly you'd need is interesting, both for cleanup and for prevention. Like, how many cleansers would you have needed in December or January? If standard program is that a Cleanser is waiting on the walkway, the airplane door opens to them cleansing, and then they walk through the plane once to get everybody before they deboard..

          Doing that on every international flight means the disease never left Asia, but how many Planes can one Cleanser do a day? How many would you need at each airport? Is that reasonable?
          ```

          - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
            ```
            And of course, are airports designed with bottlenecks for cleansers? I could see this as something where you get a 100 year cycle: Pandemic, design transport hubs around cleanse bottlenecks, no pandemic -> remove bottlenecks for efficiency -> pandemic.
            ```

            - u/GWJYonder:
              ```
              Only if Cleansers are somewhat rare. Like, if only 1% of the population is awakened then you'd need to do something like this, cleansers would be like public health resources. If the majority of people are awakened then huge numbers of people would have cleanse, the fraction of people with cleanse would be at least similar to the fraction of our current society that are maids/janitors/garbage men/plumbers. In a world like that cleanse auras would be so ubiquitous that basically all diseases would be eradicated.
              ```

  - u/Omoikane13:
    ```
    To summarise a strategy, we'd need some basic axioms. Everyone starts at Level 1, roughly normal stats (a D&D average of 10~11), and can choose a class. We'll assume a rough D&D-like system, with things like fireballs, levels, resurrection, healing, and magic items. No version specifics like BAB or proficiency.

    Firstly, I'd hold off on picking a class. I'd contact as many people that I'm friendly with as I can. For those who are familiar with RPGs, I'd have them as what's effectively colleagues. For those who aren't, I'd write or prepare a quick explanation of my plans and what they should do. If possible, I'd get most of these people to be near me. If not, long-range communication will do until then.

    Once I have a group to work with, I'd see what kind of range of stats and class choices I'm working with. I'd aim for, at minimum, one of a few key class types in my group. I'd want a healer of some kind for certain, be that an Alchemist, Cleric, Priest, whatever. I'd want some sort of mage-type, preferably more along the lines of a D&D Wizard who can share or invent spells rather than a Sorcerer. I'd explain and justify myself to the group as to why we should have our particular class makeup. As for myself, I would likely be something along the lines of a Wizard or Artificer, preferably the latter.

    With a group and classes established, I'd then aim for a safe base of operations. Pick someone's house or something, and focus my early efforts on fortifying it to be a safehouse. Ideally, there'd be no monsters in my city, but it pays to be safe.

    With a safehouse established, I'd go through the usual apocalypse routines, gathering food, water, and supplies. I'd figure out which of my Level 1 friends could have any method of producing such supplies; D&D typically has *create food and water* or similar, which can be invaluable. If the system has resetting traps, we're laughing and I'll just go through the Tippyverse motions as supplies become a dime a billion.

    Once things are established, I'd work from there. Provide magic items to the vulnerable if able, thus adding them to our community; tabulating as much information about the new system as possible and providing this to whoever asks; finding out how to level up and develop class abilities.

    Essentially, I'd try to get a safe basis to work from, and then would try and develop the new world into a stable, functional life, ideally enhanced by magic. Magic items would make this notably, notably easier in every aspect. Food and water could be solved by magic items. Defense against monsters could be solved by magic items. Get high enough levels and even death is immaterial.

    Just gotta be safe and able to survive, then you can start exploiting the system.
    ```

- u/Silver_Swift:
  ```
  Real world people in a D&D like setting doesn't get you squads of 4-6 people going into level appropriate dungeons to fight dragons and what not. Such settings are inherently going to devolve into a Tippyverse-like world sooner or later (sooner being a lot more likely), which means massive professional scry and die squadrons and warfare that is inherently going to be brutal and focused on hard to defend (ie. non-military) targets.

  I would try gather a small (<100) group of people I can mostly trust and get as far away from anything that people might consider valuable. Then go through a lot of effort not to ever appear as a threat and stay off of everyone's radar.
  ```

  - u/EsquilaxM:
    ```
    What makes you day nonmilitary would be targeted more in a dnd world?
    ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      Because your military targets are too mobile to target and completely self sufficient. 

      A high level spellcaster doesn't require industry to build and maintain, doesn't need an air strip to take off from, doesn't need support lines and (assuming a certain level of teleport magic is available) can effectively be anywhere at any time.

      If you want to strike at an enemy country in such a world you can target their leadership (if those aren't high level spellcasters themselves) or civilian targets because there just isn't much else to target.
      ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Related question: *what* set of incentives and rules makes it so that instead you do get squads of 4-6 people fighting dragons in dungeons? Even if we just focus on party size, why would that be the optimal number? Why not less is obvious, why not more less so.
    ```

    - u/IllusoryIntelligence:
      ```
      Depending on the experience system you might get a situation where 4-6 person parties give the best risk/reward. You might for example have a world where experience is split between all participants on the winning side of a conflict, in which case you'd want to find a sweet spot where you are working with the smallest effective group for a given task.

      You might also have a system where monsters specifically feed on Exp. and so seek out adventurers of roughly comparable strength. In this case you'd want to keep your party small for fear that if a large band of adventurers is defeated you now have a serious threat on your hands and no one left to deal with it.

  The answer is that pretty much everyone dies.

  The answer is almost always that pretty much everyone dies, in these kinds of scenario.

  We, and by we I mean the vast teeming masses of humanity in our billions, rely upon a Just-In-Time delivery system of food and supplies in order to live. Every city, every town in the world does. You have to go down to the level of villages and rural census tracts to get anywhere in the vague vicinity of self-sufficiency, and even then the self-sufficiency is predicated (in the first world, certainly; and often even in developing nations) on access to parts and tools which aren't produced locally.

  We all starve to death. The electrical infrastructure can't handle a blackstart. The transportation infrastructure has absolutely no slack in it. All of our clever tricks and systems which were designed to allow very precise carvings away of every bit of resiliency and buffer in the name of quarterly profits wind up becoming our undoing, and we die.

  You say that Elizabeth II can pick Queen? Who gives a shit! Britain imports *EIGHTY PERCENT* of its food. Much of the food it grows relies on imported tools. Elizabeth II will be a carrion queen for long enough for the destabilization and turmoil to set in, and then she will die, along with most of Britain and probably seven billion people along with them.

  What's the rational strategy? Take your family and head to a Costco store, where the people who beat you there will shoot you on sight, because their only chance of living long enough for the situation to stabilize is to turn a day's worth of groceries for a thousand people into a year's worth of groceries for a family.

  What's the rational strategy? Steal a boat, head to the water, and get killed by monsters while trying to get fish out of an ocean that we have near-completely denuded.

  What's the rational strategy? Disappear into the forest, only to find that sustainable forest living is impossible without a long list of skills that you don't have or a support network that doesn't exist anymore.

  There is no rational strategy. You just fucking die.

  - u/Valdrax:
    ```
    > We, and by we I mean the vast teeming masses of humanity in our billions, rely upon a Just-In-Time delivery system of food and supplies in order to live.

    Well, there's at least three assumptions in this that may not be true:

    1.  Previous physics and our logistical support networks all break down.  We're not necessarily all dropped into medieval hamlets being ravaged by dragon gods, though at least *some* disruption of society is implied by the presence of monsters.
    2.  Said monsters don't have drops, like food and water. 
    Adventuring might be how people stay fed now.  There might be foraging skills and classes that provide limitless food from thin air.  Random chests might contain 1000 year old tomb apples & cheese.   
    3.  People still have normal biological needs instead of only needing food & rest for regaining HP lost in combat.  You might be able to get by fine for eternity greeting adventures at the town entrance and telling them how much you like pickles as an eccentric NPC with only one line of dialogue.

    Heck, even if we *specifically* use 5e D&D rules, any first level character with Goodberry can feed ten people every day with a single spell slot.  Create Food & Water is a 3rd level spell that creates abundant food & water for 15 people for a day, without rationing.  

    That doesn't even count that Survival skills can produce 1d6+Wis *pounds* of food and gallons of water on a successful check, every day while traveling.  Under those rules (which are inconsistent with the previous spell), all a 5e character needs is 1 lbs of food and 1 gallon of water each day to survive.  Completely untrained, average people have a 50-50 shot of finding enough food for several days, and the main effects of not being able to eat in D&D is exhaustion, and it takes six levels of that to kill you.

    If we go with an MMO or other video game system, the odds are good that you can expect food to just be an HP recovery system, because almost no one enjoys actual starvation mechanics.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      We're all starting at 0th level, though. No Goodberry for us! Though I guess whoever first hits 1st level can become Literally Immortan Joe, that would be pretty funny. (By the time enough people hit level 5 to cast Create Food & Water, 7 billion people are dead.)

      Anyway, I'll grant that there are plenty of waves to handwave the system handing us a post-scarcity society for the basics of living. I don't know why I got so pissed off and ranty. Probably because everyone is so blithe about what would almost certainly be apocalyptic, but I dunno, I shouldn't be so pissy about peoples' escapism, absent gods know I could use some escapism myself nowadays.

          Same here, although there's an argument to be made about intelligent design of said system and safeguards being in place to ensure that the number of people doesn't go down.

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Yeah, if the scenario was a subtle change, like "everyone gets RPG stats and spells HUDs overnight they can call forth with a word, also caves and dungeons spawn in remote, uninhabited areas, and monsters slowly start coming out," then things could initially go on exactly as they always did, and THEN start going really off the rails.
      ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    You're neglecting that we now have magic. Obviously tons and tons of people are still going to die, but someone (likely a lot of people) are going to notice that the world is now running on D&D rules and starts making self resetting Create Food and Water traps or whatever.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      "is now running on D&D rules" maps how exactly to "3rd level spells are now candy"?

      I guess if whatever entity foments this apocalypse decides, in its munificent wisdom, to structure magic such that the basic staples of life are now available to everyone without scarcity, because the alternative is that everyone just dies, uh. At that point, well, we get whatever scenario and society the magical space whales wanted and we have no actual ability to predict what would be optimal, but hey, post-scarcity society on food staples, and the collapse of industrialized civilization means no more global warming! I'll take it!
      ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    So... why exactly are the current food-production systems suddenly shutting down?

    I mean, the world would still *have* farms, farmers, trucks to carry food, and all of that stuff. Why do you think all of that would collapse?
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Because all of this stuff is incredibly fragile.

      In the developed world, it's fragile beyond belief. Farming is an industrial process where hydrocarbons (petroleum for transit, natural gas for fertilizer; a lot of farmland would be worthless for a couple growing seasons without fertilizer) and the end-products of a vast array of production lines (various types of machinery, roads, all of the vast dizzying array of transit infrastructure) are turned into crops. The whole system is JIT (Just-In-Time) on many, many levels; the labor is only present when it's needed, the tools likewise, seeds likewise (and hey, why not throw in some no-self-germinating/terminator genes in there), everything only shows up when it's needed because storage space is expensive and these are massive, massive businesses where any cost savings is a large amount of dollar profit. (This also means they mostly ship out what they grow as soon as they harvest it. See also, storing less is more profit.)

      These food production chains are vulnerable at every stage to any unpredicted disruption, and nothing says unpredicted disruption like monsters spawning everywhere, widespread economic turmoil, and a sudden decrease in imported (or in the US, often effectively slave) labor (because of the monsters, because of the new opportunities, because of a lot of things).

      Farms that are worthless without two seasons of fallow, normally farmed by seasonal day laborers who have better things to do than get eaten by monsters, transported by trucks that no longer have petrol and whose truckers are getting eaten by monsters, you'd need to have a godlike AI constructing your new paradigm in order to have the food-production systems keep working, at which point prediction is useless.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        If it's that fragile, then why don't we have massive food shortages every time that a major highway needs repairing?

        --------------

        Here's what I think will happen. There will be panic at first. But despite the fact that storage is expensive, some food is stored (how do you think you get some fruits massively out of season?) and every step along that pipeline *has* stuff in it at the start.

        So yes, there might be a warehouse somewhere from which food is sent out to a city's worth of shops. Maybe there's some problem with some of the trucks - so they send out the trucks that *don't* have a problem. Maybe there's monsters on some of the roads - so they find *other* routes. (Monsters on the roads are either able to survive being hit by a car, or won't last long). There will be bottlenexks and shortages for a while, yes; and maybe some of the drivers will go off to find sudden new opportunities. But I think that the only reason why we're likely to see food shortages in the first week is because of people panicing and buying out *all the food they can*. (Which means that those panic buyers won't starve).

        Now, international transport will be a bit more of a pain - *particularly* over the sea, as sea monsters are likely to be *big*. England, in particular, will have a problem, and a massive one (with little more than a week or two to figure out a solution). Other countries will have more minor problems. But humanity will survive in all the countries that have a net *export* of food; which implies that the first step in a rational strategy is to get into one of them.

          > If it's that fragile, then why don't we have massive food shortages every time that a major highway needs repairing?

          Because we have lots of inter-connected systems of transit, and highway repairs don't take very long. If you're living in, say, the rural mountain areas in Colorado, though? You *do* get massive food shortages every time the only highway that you can be accessed by is shut down, unless it's repaired real fast.

  This might be an odd answer, but I think I'd deliberately go for something weird.

  Like, the way that I see it is that with a system like this, your first though is gonna be munchkinry. You pick wizard or whatever, because you want the wish spell so you can commence world-optimization. Blah blah blah.

  But there are people more suited to that than me. Most people will probably go with either intelligence based shit so they can abuse the system, or combat stuff so they can survive. 

  But my logic is that if a class exists, it's probably balanced against the other classes, right? Especially in a real-life world altering system. Presumably there wouldn't be anything like "oh this class wasn't popular so we didn't put much effort into it". So therefore, any choice is theoretically valid, and I should just pick something that basically nobody else will, on the off chance it offers something unique. I mean, I know that you said I "can't luck into rare and powerful advantages", but if I'm purposefully going for something odd, I can presumably at least bring *something* unique to the table. 

  This of course could make survival early on pretty hard, but again assuming it's at least sort of balanced, I'll probably have SOME way to fight. And I live with my family, and in an area with a decent population, so I see no reason I couldn't rely on others to keep me alive as I figure out whatever weird shit I picked. 

  (Unless I'm just immediately attacked and don't have time to go over my list of available classes. In that case survival takes priority, and I'd just pick whatever the easiest melee combat class I can get seems to be.)

    People forget how ridiculously strong an average US soldier is. Except for magical threats that are intangible or use extensive mind-magic, there is almost no D&D creature that would survive a standard fully equipped modern military squad. 

    Primarily, a normal engagement range for a solider is between four to five hundred meters. Non-sapient monsters wouldn't even know what's happening as they're dying, as the riflemen mow them down from relative safety. 

    For harder targets (eg a dragon) the squad also has enough firepower. Even if the grenadiers can't get through the armor, the AT troopers are carrying guided anti-tank armaments that can't be blocked or dodged and blow holes through basically anything.

    It wouldn't be very fair

  It depends on how much infrastructure works.

  If we still have viable internet, get the Wikipedia pages for The System up and populated. People need build and monster information. Also, crowd source maps.

  Construction equipment is good for both terrain and as something to hit big and slow things in. Depending on leveling, stick medical behind the wheel as it is important to power level healers.

  Get ranged casters/snipers/archers into buildings and try to lure monsters there. Take advantage of the fortification of what is already built. Even roofs of houses.

    I'd consider this an extremely high risk move. Given that RPGs are party based games even a ranger in the ideal environment will be a lot less powerful than a synergistic party.

      i get where you are coming from but that assumes a willingness to engage in conflict. the core premise of most of these games assumes a continued drive to conquer or grow with a distinct focus on always going after the next guest line.  
      however we are assuming that while the universe now runs on rpg logic its still fundamentally the same world we currently live in, so while its true that in direct conflict a low level druid or the like is at a disadvantage but even at level 1 most nature classes are second to only a rogue or assassin in terms of being hard to find if they dont want to be found with the addition of class abilities that make living off the land nearly trivial. as long as my number one goal is the avoidance of people as a whole, i dont think there is a more effective long term strategy

  I'm thinking that a tamer or summoner class might be a particularly useful one. Most people will not have fighting experience, but if you're a summoner then even if you panic and freeze you still have your pets to defend you. 

  They also have a nice advantage in that they specialise in Charisma. That's an overwhelming advantage because it lets you attract allies, find peaceful resolutions to conflicts with other humans, and spot false friends. If you've heard there's really good loot in a fire themed dungeon, having a network you can ping to put together a team of water specialists is worth more than a bit more DPS. Even if organising raids falls to specialists with classes like guild master, I'd say being on good terms with the boss would be valuable. Plus, if you go for a magic type summoner there's a good chance it uses Intelligence too, it need not be said why that's an advantage.

  Focus on Charisma and charm/manipulation/social skills. Our world runs primarily on social capital; and so being able to quantize, accurately measure, and deliberately increase such skills in a linear manner will enable you to make deals, trade, and forge alliances to a degree of predictability never before seen. 

  Just imagine quantizing social relationships to the point that you know you have exactly a 40% chance of "beguiling or seducing" someone. You could walk into every major bank in a city and ask for the biggest loan possible, knowing full well that you're likely to walk out of at least one of them with millions of dollars. Then you create a business or shop and price items perfectly knowing exactly how likely it is for you to make a sale with a given customer at a given price.

  Basically, what I'm getting at, is that you could reduce nearly everything to math, and give yourself a safe and predictable path towards riches beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Of course, you would have to move fast as others would be doing the same thing, but if you got in before the masses figured out what was happening, were able to get in on the ground level while the new socio-economic landscape was being reinvented, you would be a king.

  Then, just use your massive wealth to hire protection (possibly in exchange for epic loot) from the best dungeon crawlers in the world. Basically, you'd become a financial NPC, the type of shop keeper/banker that is essential in RPGs, is mostly overlooked, and as a result almost never dies or comes into direct contact with danger.

    Ah, but the loan officers have *rules* with regard to what conditions people must fulfill in order to obtain a loan. If you beguile the loan officer, then all that you will get is an itemised list of *exactly* what you need in terms of documentation in order to obtain the loan you want at the best interest rate. (Which you *will* need to repay, because there are other people checking on that, and some of those other people are lawyers whom you have not yet met).

    Mind you, you can still make incredible profits (by creating a shop, pricing items at "only beguiled people would pay this" levels, and then *persuading* people to spend money in your shop). But you just might have a bit of a slower start...

  For those with a bit of Charisma, Bard would be an easy choice. Musical instruments and learning resources are relatively cheap and easy to access.

  For IT people, academics and office workers, Wizard would be a good option, assuming that they have high Intelligence.

  Blue collar workers would most likely become Fighters

    Yay! Wizard!

    > assuming that they have high Intelligence.

    Whelp. Found the huge gaping hole in that plan. Currently a computer science student, who just took a test. Now considering a much more appropriate career in finger painting. I’ll be damned if those classes don’t make you a lot more humble. Or at least me a lot more humble.
