## Any rational stories/lit rpgs where people change physically according to power growth?

### Post:

The wandering inn is an example, such as warriors getting physically larger according to level ups but it doesn't have to have classes

    Disagree with it being important.

    The game powers makes it completely seamless and the MC is indifferent.

    MC basically forgets about it, occasionally mentioning: 

    "Oh, I'm pretty tall now. Weird."

    "Why is she flirting with me? Oh yeah, I'm attractive now."

    It has little plot relevance, and doesn't impact his decisions in any way.

      Or are you just referring to the fact that WTC rocks? I agree with that.

      I think the "one very case" is the level-up thing.

  [He Who Fights With Monsters](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters) your body literally turns into magic as you level up. In addition to the obvious becoming physically stronger and more resistant to damage, you get more attractive and depend more on magic and less on physical things. You don't need to eat, or even breath.

  But it is more a side effect rather than the direct method of getting more powerful.

  [Homicidal Aliens are Invading...](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24203/homicidal-aliens-are-invading-and-all-i-got-is) has this happen quite egregiously in the first couple of chapters.

    ...it never becomes relevant again

      =( I read up until the pangolin showed up and then realized it was going to be "rule of cool" throughout and walked away.

  "I Am Going To Die In This Game-Like Dimension" is litrpg and has characters become progressively more weird looking as their stats go up. For example, one character start growing horns as a result of developing their affinity for a particular energy type.

  [Creep](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29145/creep) has body evolution to an extreme degree, although it isn't LitRPG. It's more of a superhero drama a bit like Worm with transhumanist themes (his powers are like Darwin from X-Men).

  Some of the cultivation litrpg type fics have it, but tends to be subtle. For example, [Everybody Here is a Cultivation Idiot](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31837/everybody-here-is-a-cultivation-idiot) has some aspects of body evolution related to power levels. Written as more of a comedy (although with some dark themes). Gender-bender.

  [Defiance of the Fall](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24709/defiance-of-the-fall) also a combination of cultivation and LitRPG kind of fits. More serious and better written than EHIACI. The hero seems overly lucky at times, and bodily changes involved in power growth are mostly relatively subtle.

  [The Dao of Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic) is another cultivation world example, with some of the bodily changes being not-so-subtle. More on the well written side IMO, with more comedy than drama. No specific system, but more organically defined.

  The Erogamer gets sexier the more stat points she gets, starting at seriously overweight with associated psychological issues and quickly reaching "median 19 year old girl" level of attractiveness before things in general start getting crazier. It's a weird mix of erotica, heartwarming character development, and existential horror that wouldn't be out of place in a Lovecraft or Greg Egan novel.

  ```
  Itâ€™s not rational, but it is weirdly wholesome for a story largely about monsters eating each other:

  https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis

  Plenty of body upgrades

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  The New World has the main character become taller and denser and less biological as he levels up. By the latest chapters he weighs like 500 tons and is about 10 feet tall. It starts off strong imo but slowly tapers off into something barely passable. I'd recommend just reading until you don't enjoy it anymore.

  Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends has this. Cultivators get True Bodies, which change their body fundamentally, such as one of the main character's bodies becoming less affected by physics. Other characters become taller and stronger, get tougher skin, more organs, etc. It's very consistent and has proper character development so far.
  ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  The Cradle series basically has this- there are a bunch of tiers of power (Copper, iron, jade, gold, etc.), and a sacred artist's physical abilities generally improve with each jump to a new level.
