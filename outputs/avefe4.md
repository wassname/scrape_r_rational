## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Humans all have a subsconcious psychic power that allows them to manipulate reality in a way that corresponds to the memetic strength of an belief. Any single human only have so much power but power can be consolidated by multiple people believing in similar ideas. As you can imagine that led to all sorts of chaos so you and a few other brave souls took up the mantle and formed a hidden conspiracy, largely successfully. You have put limiters on people’s power, leaving them with only a small part of their usual power. Not enough that any individual could pose a threat but enough that you can harvest that power through memetic engineering. 

  Now a new wave of big baddies are threatening Earth and you can’t handle it without removing many of the limiters put in place. History shows that it’s a very bad idea just to remove the limiters without shaping the beliefs about what the unlimited can do with their power. All sorts of nasty surprises unfold - just have a look at ‘mythology’. So your merry cabal comes up with the brilliant idea to put people into superadvanced VR simulations(TM), with the goal of eventually removing the limiters and allow your subjects to use their class levels from the game in the real world.

  The biggest challenge is to make people strongly believe subconsciously that the VR world is real and make the abilities from their class levels second nature. You also want to train them to complete the ‘quests’ that you give them to in a roundabout way make them subservient to you. What systems would you implement to reach those goals? How would you shape the VR world to make it easier to accept it as real?

    This is a brilliant justifcation for a lit RPG.

    How are the limiters put in place? Dose our cabal train people to believe that the limit exist, is there a magic switch that we flip or something else?

    I think kidnaping people who have never even heard of VR and have lower levels of educaion would be the best bet, as it reduses the risk it might occure to them the things they see aren't real.

    Create a very simple game world to reduse the worldbuilding mistakes that can be noticed. Or at the very least make it so the players don't interact will anything two complex for long. I would do this by haveing them teliported to locations with a quest to do and then warping back to a hub world the moment they are done. 

    Spread clues in quest locations, that tell a narative about why they are there, so the curious will accept the fake story as real and be more firm about believing it thanks to the effore they put in to uncover it.

      Glad that you like it. If I have the time I'll try a stab at making a story for it. It was something I used for rpg's two times but they never lasted long.

      The limiters are live invisible non-material magical constructs that sustain themselves on the psychic energy of their host. A player learning how to see invisible creatures will be able to see them once they return to the real world. They can be destroyed and the cabal have limited ability to manipulate them but not a good way of doing it largescale.

      I agree that making people unaware that they entered a VR would make it more real and perhaps removing the memory of entering a VR would be a good idea. I dislike that from a narrative perspective though and I wonder if we could make a tweak to the world that would change that?

      I actually disagree on your point about people who have lower levels of educations. Higher levels of education allows people to perform more abstract thinking and to accept weirder premises. 

      I'm not sure that I am following the point about a simple in game world. Would you be interested in elaborating on that?

        Haveing the players be aware of VR and questioning if what they are seeing is real would problely make for a more interesting story. I was imagining that the Cabal would have a huge amount of resorses so could kidnap people who were unfamiler with VR from less developed countries but If they are on a budget or have a tight deadline then it would explain why they had to chose people who were familer with the tech.

        I was thinking that a lack of education would lead to people to not question their perception of the world. If you have never heard of [Platos Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave) or anything that explorses similar themes then you would have to come up with that idea on your own. Now I think about it [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise\)) explorse those theams and is quite wide spread in pop culture so idk.

        For the simple game world I was thinking makeing world less like skyrim and more like [MANDAGON](https://store.steampowered.com/app/461560/MANDAGON/). I don't know how much game design has improved along side the VR tech, but asumeing it is still slightly comparble to today, makeing a truely believable gameworld with lots of NPC's and complex moveing parts would be almost imposible. So remove the NPC's and the complex moveing parts. Make it so the players spend their most of their time in a very simple eviroment that can be made as realistice as posible. Like the [Hyperbolic Time Chamber](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/0/0c/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber_DBS_Ep_32_001.png/revision/latest?cb=20171106012206) or [house on a tiny planet](https://previews.123rf.com/images/mikekiev/mikekiev1204/mikekiev120400014/13293901-private-house-on-green-planet.jpg). If they can simulate a perfectly realistic world then this would proberbly not be needed.

    > The biggest challenge is to make people strongly believe subconsciously that the VR world is real and make the abilities from their class levels second nature.

    In the VR world, every menu from your character options to your level-up bonuses to your quests are accessed through a cellphone app, which then has VR-world implications.

    While your victims are in VR, you sneakily install the real version of the same app on their phones. Instead of letting them think the VR world is real, you're letting them think that their VR-world powers somehow escaped to the real world with them. (Also, you can manipulate the app to give them quests).

    > The biggest challenge is to make people strongly believe subconsciously that the VR world is real and make the abilities from their class levels second nature.

    This would best be done by having the abilities incorporate a significant muscle-memory component, so that training the players to activate those powers in-game also trains them to activate those powers out of game, because the motions are the same

    Alternately, mnemonics.

    > You also want to train them to complete the ‘quests’ that you give them to in a roundabout way make them subservient to you. What systems would you implement to reach those goals?

    Gamification, that's it. I'd incorporate an AR side game like Ingress or Pokémon Go that ties into the main game, where by completing various checklists in the side game they can get power-ups in the main game.

    > How would you shape the VR world to make it easier to accept it as real?

    The game map is geographically constrained to the location that the player is playing from, give or take in-game travel time.

  I’ve been woolgathering on a story where the oceans turned suddenly intangible *only to humans* (which is, admittedly, almost verbatim from an entry over on r/WritingPrompts). 

  To paint a picture: You can see the oceans only by what is in them, not the water, so all the creatures of the sea are 'airborne' when you’re 'under water'. Fishes swim past you and you only feel their movements as if they were 'swimming' through air. But grab one and suddenly its buoyancy in water is cancelled and it behaves as if it was in air at that atmospheric depth, which mostly translates to sudden cases asphyxiation and decompression injuries. 

  On the other side of the spectrum, swimming in the oceans is suddenly impossible, because they’re intangible to you. Furthermore if you were at sea when the switch happened, the boat you might have been on also suddenly gained (temporary!) intangibility and the drop from sea surface to seabed injured or killed you. Everything else, like weather patterns, is unaffected by that intangibility, by the way, unless a result of human-ocean interaction impacted it (that means: the ships and stuff falling from the surface to the bottom would impact like they were falling through air until their human passengers were dead, then the water is suddenly tangible again to them; the effects of oil spill on wildlife would be there).

  In the immediate aftermath of the switch there’s wide scale destruction and upheaval on account of all manned swimming sea platforms (like oil rigs) dropping from great height to their destruction, with subsequent ongoing huge oil spills. All the oil tankers and cargo ships that were in any ocean at the time experience the same fate. About half of all sea men / women on ships died. So… yeah. 

  The why and how this happened are mostly fleshed out (but irrelevant for this story), the source of conflict is clear, the location is 'under the sea'. 

  The story takes place decades after that switch, I am still undecided on whether the main characters lived through it or had only heard stories, but disregarding that, **I fear I am missing some of the less obvious effects an intangible ocean would have on people living there.** I mean, I figured that undersea dwellers would wear breathing masks when venturing outside that filtered all the detritus, sand, microbes, etc in the 'air' that would otherwise clog up their lungs of might infect them, buildings would be constantly inhabited by someone all the time (sudden compression of your habitat just because no one’s in the house would screw everyone over) or be built to withstand the pressures, vehicles would be bigger wheeled and all terrain, and some of the smarter shallow water predators (sharks?) might take bites out of people if they can survive the sudden decompression-recompression of a successful attack.

    It becomes impossible to drown in the ocean.

    How does this idea handle brackish water? At what point does the Chesapeake Bay 
    or Potomac River become tangible?

    Does the intangible water still block light in the same way as before? You may experience light-related illnesses on the sea bottom, which would lead to increased light usage on the sea bottom, which would lead to light pollution in the depths.

    It is now monstrously cheaper to lay transoceanic cables for power and data transmission.

    Some specialized jobs such as underwater welding become less specialized.

    A perfectly spherical, highly buoyant vessel is docked at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. All humans within it exit the vehicle. The vehicle is now no longer occupied. How fast does it ascend to the surface, and how can that be used as a weapon?

    The counter-operation is obvious: Float a massive object over someone's seafloor military base, then drop a human onto it from a helicopter to cause the vessel to smash into the seafloor base. The person riding the impactor pops a parachute, flies away, lands on the seafloor, and walks away, but the post-human-departure impactor is still traveling very quickly, and will likely hit the base with some force. It'll also just settle onto the base, as an area denial weapon until someone can get it buoyant enough to be floated off its target.

    You'd also be violating the Benthic Treaties.

      > Are humans breathing the intangible water? (I'm curious).

      Yes. H2O, (and a set of therein dissolved minerals like Na, Cl, Au, …) are replaced by an atmospheric mixture comparable to air. The hard delineation of replacement for breathing purposes is outside one’s reach. The *other* stuff floating in sea water, be that sand, microbes, fish, etc *aren’t* replaced, which is why the breathing masks would be necessary.

      > The rock and sand at the bottom of the ocean is under immense pressure. I imagine a human walking along is going to struggle with the ground beneath their feet exploding constantly... but I'm not confident that would be the result. My reasoning is that even though the rock won't deform a lot, a small deformation causes it to violently shatter. Also, any dissolved gasses that are escaping will definitely explode. Watch out for porous things.

      Hm… reminds me of the Walking on Pluto scenario. My initial idea was that you’d sink into 'mud' if you just walked on the sea floor, since the sand is mixed with sea water, but you interacting with it replaces the sea water with air, which makes it lose it’s cohesion. Basically like these [liquid sand / fluidised air things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My4RA5I0FKs). I’ll definitely have to think on that. Explosions under your feet would be fun, but might detract.

      > You can generate power by filling a room with a compressible gas and leaving it. The gas is crushed into a tank at the top of the room after you leave. Close the tank remotely, return to the room: instant ultra-pressurized gas, which can be fed to generators.

      Hm… wouldn’t work as simply as you describe here, but might be doable. One major drawback would be building everything so it could withstand the instantaneous pressure change as you leave the premises. 

      > Bonus: expect explosive surprises when you visit any structure that has been abandoned. Air pockets will abound.

      A post-switch abandoned structure wouldn’t have air pockets, unless they were generated after abandonment.  

      > What happens to water that humans take with them? Does it turn intangible immediately, or only when it leaves their presence? The ocean area is a giant desert that gets no rain, from the human perspective.

      If you’re talking fresh water, that turns intangible if you pour it out and leave the premises. You can have a (fresh) water tank in the inhabited facility w/o worrying about it turning suddenly intangible, at least until you leave the premises. If you replace the opening space of the emptying water tank in use with a distinctly not air gas mixture (pure N2 for instance) that would be able to withstand the sudden pressure change of abandoning the facilities, then you can leave your home and come back and still have fresh water. 

      Your carpets might be ruined though.

      > Imagine leaving a glass of water alone outside. It would start flowing up out of the cup (it's buoyant in sea water) and vanishing as it mixed into the ocean.

      Fascinating scenario! Also: true.

      > Maybe you can install a semipermeable membrane in your power generation structure to have it double as a water generation structure. Free pressure is useful.

      Wouldn’t work with how I think of the underlying mechanism. I think.

      > Human-made sounds don't travel very far. Radio also doesn't work. That might be a problem, considering the land area on earth just quadrupled and people are going to want to start claiming it. How do you send commands to your armies? Communication cables and sonar stations, perhaps? What's the bandwidth and range on sonar?

      Bandwidth and range on sonar depend on a lot of things (you can have layers in the oceans where sonar can reach thousands of kilometres, see how submarine sonar screw with whales at that distance), and near shoreline seasteads would probably have had cables laid to them, but deep ocean seasteads would use buoys, anchored to the seabed outside their premises, that would trail cables down. The 'last mile' (might be more like a couple dozen metres in practice) would be sonar or radio, I think.

      > Nuclear bunkers at the sea bottom will be popular; only manned missiles can get to you, and if they miss by a few feet the immense ambient pressure will protect the bunker. Also, missiles will be hard to aim, because...

      I wouldn’t say popular, but ICBMs lose a lot of viability as a means of attack for seasteads.

      > Planes will work in this place, but they'd be terrifying to fly in. No light, no sound, no comms, no way of gauging distance to the 'ground'. Maybe sonar on a stick is an option, but good luck dragging it through the water while flying. Maybe you'd need single-use sonar bundles attached to wires.

      You’re right. In particular the upper couple hundred meters will be terrifying to cross, since that’s where the lion’s share of bigger aquatic life takes place, and if you go deeper the sun will notable dim (not because of the water, but because of all the detritus in the 'air' above); you’ll fly either in darkness or a very dimm place with no shadows. I suspect there will be planes flying sub-oceanic, but these will be limited to research (and military) applications, and they’ll fly much slower to deal with the bad conditions. As a rough approximation it will be like flying through ash-laden air (I’ll have to look up numbers how ash-laden).

      > The former ocean is going to be a dangerous place.

      Indeed :)

  I'm thinking about The Hunger Games after mentioning a (non-rational) fanfic of it in the Monday thread. 

  So, the hunger games: discuss?

  The premise, for those that don't know, is that we're in a dystopian future where every year 24 children (1 boy and 1 girl from ages 12 to 18 chosen via lottery from the 12 districts) compete in a fight to the death, only one survives. There's 12 districts who live in relative poverty (the main character comes from a district where people regularly starve to death) and a Capitol full of people living their best post-scarcity utopia life (including things like surgically transforming themselves into cat people) - it's these people that watch the Games each year like their favourite reality show.

  The Games happen as "penance" for the districts previously rising up against the Capitol, it's apparently used to "keep them down" and to make them mad at each other instead of at the Capitol which gives them all the problems. (Because if the little girl that used to sell lemonade in District 5 is killed by a teenage girl from District 8, this wouldn't make District 8 popular for District 5. Multiply that by two children every year for 75 years...). 

  I've glossed over a BUNCH, it's obviously a very detailed world. One other thing I should mention is that in exchange for more entries in the lottery, a child can get a supply of bread and oil (about one year supply for one person per entry). As well as that, some districts "train" most of their children for the Games, and then those Careers will actually compete for the "honour" of competing - which means that everyone can get the extra bread and oil with impunity. 

  Anyway, I guess my thoughts are:

  - How rational is this system? It is pretty well thought out as dystopian futures go, and the events of the books cause the dystopia to fail after 75 years, which seems like a bit too long to me?

  - Presumably in this dystopian future there are unwanted pregnancies. Why not raise these children in dorms, brainwash them as best you can to think dying in the Games are an honour, and then everyone can get the bread and oil and not starve? Basically a more extreme version of the Careers. I mean, yeah, it's unconscionable, but so is everything about the system. (Actually that would be an interesting fanfic, to write about the point of view of one of the Careers, but the situation is more like this than the outward perception of what a Career district is...)
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    To start with, you need more diversity to the districts, which is pretty easily done by saying "no, districts aren't entirely themed along a single career/resource, but that *is* a method of culturally segregating them, in the way that people from Wisconsin take pride in their cheese, and Appalachia takes pride in their coal miners, despite the number of jobs that are actually in those industries being not actually that high". Simple enough.

    The real question is how this all works (or fails to work) on a sociological level, which is probably a question of 1) demographics and 2) technology. The hunger games are put on because the Capitol are exercising control over the less technologically sophisticated districts, and whether this works or not doesn't actually matter, so long as people have cause to *think* that it does.

    (There's actually an interesting theory/headcanon that the hunger games are more about keeping the Capitol in line than the districts themselves, which I think is a better explanation, given that routinely killing children in a highly publicized way is *probably* only going to inspire immediate and violent revolt, especially when those children are picked/groomed to be exemplars of that culture.)

      I'd be very interested in subscribing to this newsletter. Can you point me in a direction to find more? Or elaborate in excruciating detail?
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        I don't think that there's a proper thesis for it, but the premise is essentially that the Capitol will have better internal cohesion if they have a hated enemy, and given their utter dominance, they need to create their own enemy. The Hunger Games then aren't *really* about suppressing revolt within the Districts or punishing them, they're the Capitol's yearly [Two Minutes Hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate). Of course, the people in the Capitol don't really seem to "hate" the people from the Districts, instead seeing them more as caste inferiors or something, but the Hunger Games could still be a deliberate way of reinforcing the ingroup/outgroup pressures that would already be in place in order to ensure homogeneity.

        (Whether this would actually *work* is beside the point, so long as someone in power thinks that it does, or possibly just through inertia from the original creator(s) of the games.)
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          Why does the Capitol need cohesion? I suppose they're united under President Snow who for all intents and purposes is an evil dictator, right? That'd do it...

          It'd be interesting to see what other stuff happens in the Capitol to help keep the class divide: they obviously have fashion norms (green skin is in, for example...), so there's probably at least quarterly fashion shows so that way people have to spend a lot of time and energy changing their appearance / wardrobes to keep up.
          ```

  - u/Palmolive3x90g:
    ```
    I would think that you would get a lot more volunteers in the districts. Young people are young and foolish, and winning the hunger games provide enormous benefits both to you personally and your district as a whole.

    Also since the Capitol that's really good medical technology you would think the people with terminal illnesses would want to volunteer to get cured. A tiny chance at life is better than none at all right.
