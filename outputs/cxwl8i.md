## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You possess a magical orb the size of a basketball, which can be switched on or off. While on, the orb subtly influences the Brownian motions of all fluids within a 100 meter radius of itself, such that over the course of a few hours, these fluids will be unmixed.

  For example, if you shut the magical orb inside a room for a few hours, there will be a large bubble of pure oxygen, tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases, and the rest of the room will be filled with pure nitrogen.

  However, since the magical orb functions by manipulating Brownian motions, it can be overpowered easily. For example, if there's a fan in the room, the air molecules blown about by the fan will easily mix different molecules together faster than the orb can separate them.

  Other than slightly delaying the heat death of the universe, is there anything that can be done with this magical orb?

    Isotopic enrichment. That is a lot of free SWU you got there. Also nuclear waste treatment, since you can clean contaminated fluids. Uhm. This in fact mostly eliminates nuclear waste as a thing, as you can just melt nuclear fuel rods, and the orb will separate out the fission products.  I think those two uses dominate every other possibility, economically speaking. It is fast enough you might have spare timeslots for other uses though, so I will note that very high-purity metals can also be produced by just having melting pots within the field of effect.

    Note that it *will* get shipped off to a nuclear facility, because nobody is going to permit this thing to be out in the world. If you have it, you can buy a couple of tonnes of "depleted" uranium and really trivially walk away with bomb grade uranium later that day.. Although if you load too much DU into your melting pots, the room will turn into a reactor (It will assemble a just-barely-critical mass, the mass will heat up, disperse, the orb will re-assemble a critical mass.. )

      Hmm. I was deliberately trying to define the orb in a way such that it wouldn't kill humans in its radius. The way I'm thinking of it is, the orb is some kind of supercomputer that can track the position of every molecule within 100 meters, and calculate the future trajectories of each molecule as long as (a) it doesn't leave the 100 meter radius, and (b) it isn't moved by any unexpected forces. It then applies the minimal amount of very tiny nudges to some of the molecules such that all molecules of the same type will group up in a few hours. After that it applies more nudges to make sure the grouped up molecules don't dissolve again.

      In this sense, a human jumping up and down within the orb's sphere of influence should be able to throw off the trajectories of his internal molecules enough to throw off the orb's calculations, and so hopefully will not be affected to the same extent as Heavy Water would.

    Is there a distance limit? What is the precision of this ability?

    Could you concentrate heat from a large source to a small source?

    Consider for example, transferring 1 degree Celsius of heat from your entire body to a 1mm\^3 volume. Even if the transfer fails, 1 degree of heat to or from your body is nothing, fevers do far worse than that. On the other hand, 1 degree Celsius of heat from a large body (this power works better the bigger you are) concentrated into a tiny volume would probably be enough to burn/melt it.

    By using your ability in this manner, you could cause all kinds of destruction without worrying about the 2% failure rate. You can transfer 1 degree Celsius of heat from your entire body to a small patch of a person's heart to kill them, without anyone noticing you did it. Similarly, you can destroy core components of any machine, melt transistors to ruin computer systems, slowly destroy the foundations of buildings by melting tiny holes in the pillars, etc.

      Note that you're talking heating that 1mm³ to 10,000,000 degrees, which is completely excessive. Note also that you can immediately steal that heat back, so you can do this repeatedly.

      If you can go as thin as 0.1mm², my idea of using this to cut things (rather than just melt points) would allow you to cut about 40cm by 40cm cross sections at a time out of anything.

      (Also, if you're not going to be ‘nice’ and murder someone's brain directly to save them the suffering, at least be efficient and burn their spinal cord. Or cut their head off or something.)

    There aren't all that many things this seems useful for on first glance because the human body doesn't take well to large changes in heat. However, with a little thought...

    You could kill basically anybody by heating/cooling their brain several times, using any heat source. Even if 2% comes from your body, this is much less and much more spread out.

    You could perfectly thermoregulate. This is more a comfort thing than otherwise, though.

    You could be incredibly helpful in low-temperature experiments, since being able to cool large bodies of objects down to nearly 0K is unprecedented. Starting from a sufficiently low baseline, and acting incrementally, this can be done safely without any real difficulty.

    Depending on fidelity, you could cut through pretty much anything. Tens of thousands of degrees might be a lot, but if you only affect very tiny slivers of material, and partition it over a few invocations, the risk isn't all that much. This would let you make clean cuts anywhere, anytime, into anything.

    Unsafe options are more powerful, but it's hard to think of something effective. Sure, you can move all the energy of the sun into Earth, but short of preventing a worst-case AI apocalypse, why bother?

      The last case should only have a chance of working if you keep the power a secret and the universe is otherwise devoid of magic.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        The ability to move all the heat of the Sun to Earth makes your ability a doomsday device that unfortunately requires your conscious input to activate. So if it is known, everyone would have an incentive to murder you in your sleep to prevent that doomsday device from ever activating.
        ```

  - u/Hoophy97:
    ```
    How fast is this heat transferal? Can it be sustained passively or is does it involve discreet instances?

    If it can be used passively, is the 2% ‘failure’ rate only applied at the start?
    ```

  - u/CrystalValues:
    ```
    I never have to worry about my burrito being too hot to touch on the outside and frozen on the inside, at the very least.

    What also comes to mind is supercooling. The heat could technically be transferred to the moon (" Distance limit: line of sight provided there is air between you and the thing. "), which is so large the heat transfer would be negligible. Of course, the 2% chance means that you should be limiting yourself to fairly small objects, (1/200 of your body mass if I'm doing my math, right.)

    Edit: I remembered that a Kelvin degree doesn't match a Fahrenheit degree. 1/400 of your mass would be about the largest you should risk supercooling
    ```
