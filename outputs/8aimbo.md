## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  A mad scientist has designed and spread an airborne virus that gradually overwrites an infected person's DNA. After infection, a person's physical appearance will slowly change to look more and more like an androgynous average human. Within a few years, everyone over 20 will look like the same person. Everyone under 20 will look like younger versions of the same person.

  Effectively, people will no longer be able to recognize each other based on physical appearance: you could wear some distinct clothes/masks/etc and claim that it is you, but anyone else could wear the same clothes/mask/etc and pretend to be you. You could use passwords to identify yourself using cryptographic hijinks, but anyone who steals your passwords can pretend to be you.

  What issues would humanity face as a result, and how could we overcome them?

    Tats. You get a huge culture of tatoos. And temporary ink marks you as "Almost certainly a con-artist". Might in fact just be flat out illegal, outside very restricted situations, like "in a tatoo parlor, seeing what a design would look like".

    .. Also, unless this virus resets peoples body image, a very huge problem with body dysmorphia. Sex assignment surgery gets put on assembly line basis.

      Permanent tattoos would be a good way to prevent constant identity changes, but how would we prevent identity impersonation? If you get a fancy tattoo, anyone else can also get the same tattoo and pretend to be you. 

      > .. Also, unless this virus resets peoples body image, a very huge problem with body dysmorphia. Sex assignment surgery gets put on assembly line basis.

      I didn't think of that. Let's assume that it does, or at the very least, the social aspects of body dysmorphia are minimized by the fact that everyone now has the same body.

        Why do you lock your car doors? Do you lock your car doors because they will surely keep someone willing to dedicate time and effort breaking into your car out, or do you lock your car door so that somone looking for a quick grab n' dash from stealing your CD's? 

        The tattoo's solve probably 70% of Identity issues if they are managed well. 25% would then rest on the Tattoos simply being so similiar that it takes a bit of time to fully regster the person. Think about talking to identcal twins or dopplegangers. If you know the person well enough you could figure it out quickly, otherwise it may take some time. The remaining 5% comes down to people who would get permanent tattoos to impersonate somone else permanently. Assuming that the andogynous form has both the same fingerprints for everyone and also the same eye markings and DNA inprint, getting the tattoo makes you almost a perfect double. The issue comes up mainly for famous people at that point. Every government would likely have a tattoo body double for every high ranking officer in every foreiegn government as a saftetynet/espionage set up. I imagine anyone who is famous would probably get some micro surgery done on their eyes and keep it extremremely safegaurded so that no one knows what it looks like to duplicate. Basically the Tattoo works as a deterant, extrasecurity measures would be required for true security to be held.

        The fact that doing that is an incredibly bad idea? Whatever con you are running, you would now have a permanent record of having done it on your face. Excellent way to wind up behind bars, that. 

        This does assume that there is a register of taken tatoos, to prevent accidental duplication, so that having someone elses replicated is proof of ill intent.. but that is a given. 

        That then leaves you with the issue of making pleasing tatoos that are unique in vast numbers, but this is something computer aided design and lookup would help with a great deal. And of course some people will just want to not be mistaken for anyone else, and go with an entirely algorithmicly generated wreath of flowers (99 billion possible color combos, almost all of them look nice, and easily identifiable) while others drop major-art-purchase money on having someone try to put their soul into ink.

    I have prosopagnosia (a mild form), and in short, I can't recognise people based on the way their face looks. I've had it all my life and people like me manage to function seamlessly in society (to the point where people just go through life thinking they're "bad with faces" rather than realising they have a qualitative difference in ability). 

    So for me, this homogenisation would pretty much put everyone on the level I'm at, and I think commenters are *probably* overestimating this.

    For starters: I can recognise people fine. I can recognise people across a football field by the way they dress, style their hair, and most importantly their gait. I think there is zero chance of someone impersonating, say, my husband well enough to fool me. A photograph, sure. But not a conversation. And they could certainly shave my husband's head and put him in an outfit he wouldn't normally wear and it'd take me a good 20-30 seconds to believe it was him, and every time I caught a glimpse of him in the corner of my eye for a day or so I'd have to consciously remember it's him and that I shouldn't cry out in surprise at this strange man with me. 

    People are talking about con artists getting tattoos to impersonate people and all that, but come on - do con artists learn how to perfectly imitate Melania Trump's voice and mannerisms so they can hire a model in a wig and makeup to waltz into her penthouse and steal shit? Like, if you've seen RuPaul's Drag Race, you can use makeup to make you look like pretty much anyone. (Again I have prosopagnosia but I get the impression the likenesses are very good). Sure, people impersonate  celebrities all the time and get good restaurant tables or something - but nothing on the order of what you're implying might be possible here.

    The issues would be on the order of stuff like sports, modelling, acting. If the DNA was all the same we'd have easy organ transplantation, which'd be nice.
