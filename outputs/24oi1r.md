## Rational Writing Competition #1 (May 2014)

### Post:

Following a [thread suggesting regular writing competitions](http://en.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/24gaex/q_should_we_have_writing_competitions_here/), and [one seeking input](http://en.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/24hzu7/inaugural_rrational_writing_competition_thread/)... welcome to the first /r/rational writing competition.  

There is no concrete plan, so the winning conditions are *very flexible*:  the winner is whoever is commonly judged to be the winner; disputes will be arbitrated by the Defense Professor.  There are two divisions:  one for original work, and another for finding an existing work (fanfiction will be allowed in both).  Entries can be of any length.  For original writing, consider [these tips](http://www.terrybisson.com/page2/page2.html).  

The challenge will run until the end of May.  Prizes may or may not exist; they'll probably be special flair and come in four flavors - for winning and participation in each division.  Participation prizes will remain open indefinitely.  

**Prompt:**  *A plan is fixed at the last minute, someone explains a problem, and important information goes unrecognised.*  

To enter:  (added to clarify, thanks /u/Drexer and /u/Calamitizer)

1. Post a comment in this thread

2. Specifying whether it's [entry:original] or [entry:found], with those tags

3. With either a link to the text of your entry, or for very short entries the whole thing in the comment

  [Entry: Original] Alright, [here's an attempt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mVL90CJgMMgc6As-Jtq6EhjBx5aq-VBRaR7yYTFEr7Y/edit?usp=sharing) since we have no entries at the time of this posting. I reserve the right to edit based on feedback (or when I reread it later and realize what all the problems are).

    **Winner: original entry.**

    I'll try to get flair done in a week or two when I'm done with exams.

  If possible, enable contest mode for this thread so that you don't run into the common problem of "first person to post gets upvotes and has their post be more visible".
  ```

    Done ... and now that May is over, undone.

  [Entry: Original] Here's a fanfic for The Originals. It has spoilers up to episode 17. It's about Marcel trying to figure out a way to defeat Klaus, a vampire who's very hard to kill. Not sure whether it's good enough to be considered rational, but I'm open to suggestions for improvement:

  I'm not sure it quite fits the parameters of the contest, but in case it does, I just finished Book One of S.I., an original bit of fiction, at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU8o3wSAiufh-Eg1FtL-6656dNvbCFILCi2GbeESsb4/edit?usp=sharing .
