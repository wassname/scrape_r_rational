  > Can you imagine a story where a man lies in wait to assassinate the five masters of the American Board of Ritual Magic even as they are plotting to kill him, confounds their ritual, bursts out of the trap-door to their wine cellar at the most theatrical possible moment, raises his staff made of a rare and exotic wood that grows only his far-off homeland – and then dies ignominiously, shot by a security guard before he even can even get a word in edgewise? No? You can’t imagine the story ending that way? Neither can Reality. That was Dylan Alvarez’s secret. He always tried to be the protagonist of whatever story he was in, and the protagonist never dies.

  For the record, I can *absolutely* imagine a story like that, because from the security guard's point of view it's an archetypal Call to Adventure where the Naive Newcomer is thrust into a World He Does Not Understand.

  Can you imagine a story where a security guard is sitting around on a sleepy night with a vague sense of foreboding about the strange people in grey cloaks, then hears some shots fired and goes to investigate? Him shooting a man who leads a terrorist organization sounds exactly like it's the start of a traditional monomyth adventure (to me, anyway).

      Dylan isn't the BBEG, he's the [Predecessor Villain](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain). Dylan has a whole team of people (a [Ragtag Bunch of Misfits](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits), no doubt) who are presumably ready to take up his mantle and become the BBEG.

      Alternately, he's not the villain at all, just a [Well-Intentioned Extremist](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist), which would leave the American Board of Ritual Magic as the villains and set up Mark McCarthy as the [Evil Mentor](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor) with a betrayal at the end of either the first or second act.

        This reminds me of all the trope-based shenanigans in The Practical Guide to Evil.

    Yeah you can imagine that story. You wrote that story.

    See, that's the problem, though - it's the *start* of a story, it doesn't have the *momentum*.

      It's like Pilot Season, where no matter how many new and inventive things get thrown at the wall to try and get your attention, everybody just wants to watch what they are already familiar with.

  This is beginning to feel a bit like a light-hearted version of Pact.

    Very strong Pratchett vibes.

    Come to think, Pact is basically Discworld done seriously.

  Dylan's efforts to ensure his victory by casting himself as hero remind me a lot of Lily Weatherwax in Pratchett's Witches Abroad, but actually better done.

  I really like this chapter a lot,

  I'm not sure if this is the intended reading, but it said:  "one invoking the demon Amdusias, the other the demon Crhvano. Both produced the same couple centimeters of rainfall, even though Amdusias was a Great King of Hell who had been known to occultism for hundreds of years."
  Does this mean that they are right, or does it mean that there are so many demons in hell it doesn't matter what name you say? Because if its the second one, they really, really didn't check hard enough.
  ```

  - u/thecommexokid:
    ```
    You have to finish reading the whole sentence.

    >Both produced the same couple centimeters of rainfall, even though Amdusias was a Great King of Hell who had been known to occultism for hundreds of years, ***and Crhvano was a set of seven letters pulled out at random from a bag of Scrabble tiles.***

    The point is that whether you say the name of a powerful demon or a totally made-up word, you get the same amount of rainfall.

    Which makes it seem as though the theatricality of the invocation matters more than whether the name you invoke actually refers to anything.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      It might be that the letters randomly drawn from the Scrabble bag corresponded to an unknown demon through sheer coincidence. I'd assume that they did better falsification tests though.
      ```

      - u/thecommexokid:
        ```
        Did you just unironically use the phrase "through sheer coincidence" in reference to this story?

        If we're positing alternative explanations as to why the two invocations produced the same effect, then — given the Agloe anecdote with which the chapter began — far more likely is that the invocation of 'Crhvano' in some sense caused the existence of a real demon Crhvano. Though now that I write it out, I'm not actually sure that qualifies as an *alternative* explanation.
        ```

        - u/Gurkenglas:
          ```
          The conclusion I drew from your exchange is that Crhvano did some ritual magic to have his name become known in the world, and so it came out of the Scrabble bag.
          ```

          - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
            ```
            Plausible. Also plausible is that Crhvano was a nameless demon who named himself after the false invocation.
            ```

        ```
        Reminds me of Bell's Inequality Experiment. 

        (quote from the "Simplest proof of Bell’s inequality" by Lorenzo Maccone)

        > If we want to be extremely pedantic in enumerating the hypothesis at the basis of Bell’s theorem, we must also request

        > 1. that our choice of which experiment to perform is independent of the properties of the object to be measured (technically, “freedom of choice” or “no super-determinism”): e.g., if we decided to measure the color of red objects only, we would falsely conclude that all objects are red;

        > 2. that future outcomes of the experiment do not influence which apparatus settings were previously chosen (whereas clearly the apparatus settings will influence the outcomes): a trivial causality requirement (technically, “measurement independence”).

        > These two hypothesis are usually left implicit because science would be impossible without them.

        This line of reasoning makes me doubt that the science is possible in the world of Unsong.
        ```
