## [BST] Magic through understanding and usage of phrases

### Post:

Hopefully, it makes sense. I am open to suggestions as to what I should add and subtract from this since I'm confident that it makes a little sense, I guess.

The broadest category of magic would be the following.

Elemental magic. 

Turns mana into different classical elements: Fire, water, earth, air. Each element has a phrase of activation.

Fire - Brj (bri)

Water - Va

Earth - Jrd (yee-urd)

Air - Ha

Magic exits through hands because that's where our magic veins end. They also start at our brain and there's like a sac thing in the middle of the torso, next to the stomach organ. Golf-ball sized, but a lot of mana can be condensed into such a small sack.

In the end, our mana vein would look like this. A straight line that goes down to the mana sack in our torso and two veins that exit out of the sack and stretch all the way to each palm.

Three steps to magical spell casting. 

1. Incantation
2. Call
3. Intent

Incantation involves mentioning the entire litany of phrases required in order to make a fireball into a fireball. These phrases are called magigamma. Several hundred magigamma have been discovered, but there are still more to discover. 

They are a remnant of an ancient language that died out several centuries ago after God decided that too much power had been given to humanity for their own good, triggering an entire civilization's store of knowledge on magic's obliteration. The minds of those from the civilization were also wiped of magical knowledge, though some powerful individuals managed to avoid the mindwipe in order to be able to pass on their knowledge.

Magigamma can't be inscribed on anything but satanata rock because God's immediate magigamma-erasal algorithm will obliterate any writing on anything but rock cursed by Satan, God's antithesis. Physical contact with satanata rock is also deadly, so mages tend to coat the rock with enchantments in order to curb the curse that the rock will inflict.

Once God realized that people were circumventing his will, he sent out an army of angels to destroy every trace of satanata rock and personally mindwipe every mage with knowledge of the forbidden scripture.

The angels couldn't find all the magigamma inscriptions on every single satanata rock (legacy-crazed mages are good at hiding things), so a number of it survives til this day. God could also not continue his crusade, or otherwise risk infringing on mankind's right to exercise freedom which was agreed upon at their conception by the Council of Creation (a council that decides whether God should create something). 

His crusade had already taken enough lives as it was (which was not his intention, but it tends to happen when you kick the magical leg off a civilization which has been depending on that leg for quite a while), so God withheld his wrath and consoled himself that the current humanity would never discover all the magigamma phrases that he had deemed forbidden due to their epic nature.

But back to incantations.

What is that string of phrases, specifically?

In order to pool enough mana in our hands in order to cast the spell, you concentrate and chant col. Depending on how good you are at manapulation, you will always collect enough mana for the spell. An inefficient amount will lead to a smaller spell-output. 

Yelling helps, which is why hoarse throats are such a common malady and the potion industry is booming to treat the self-inflicted injuries that these merlins sustain (they make treatments, not cures, because treatments make more money, big potion is evil).

Determine whether your spell will require a continuous flow of mana or will be a sort of one-shot deal. Think a flamethrower vs a pistol. Press aa for flamethrower, and ap for pistol. Aa leaves an open door for more mana to pour out in order to strengthen the spell while ap puts a seal on your spell hands so only a set amount of mana will be used for the spell and that would be it (sorta like a river flowing that's a sustained stream, and a bottle of water that's finite).

Alright, once you've said ap, you gotta transform the mana into another form, and one that falls within the four elements. Since we're making a fireball, we gotta say Brj. The louder you say Brj, the more intense the flames. This also depends on your understanding of Brj and the element that it stands for. Lotsa research required to further understand an element in order to maximise the efficiency of your Brj.

Now you've got fire mana as a projection on the top of your palm. It still hasn't been toggled to corporeal yet (that comes later) so it can't hurt anybody just yet. So you've got fire magic.

Now, we've gotta get the shape, you know? A fireball. A ball. In order to get it to become a ball, you'll need to fix the mana structurally, and that's much harder than simply mentioning a single syllable. The shape is spherical, and it will have to stay spherical until it hits its mark. A compact spherical blob of fire mana.

While understanding this, utter the phrase Sfo. Now you've got an ethereal fireball ontop of your hand, the size depending on the strength of your col and the shape depending on how you fathomed sfo.

What else would be required of you at this point? Why, you're trying to destroy something, right? You still need to determine the velocity of your fireball. 

Now, just like col, you'll have to utter voo at the top of your lungs to get it to become as fast as possible. While shooting voo, however, you'll have to determine your target and stare at it intently because if you know your target while shouting voo, it gets much easier with the next step.

Fixing your fireball to a target would require extreme concentration as you not only stare at the direction, but at the very pour of the person you're attempting to set aflame (or a single fiber of the practice dummy). While in this state of concentration, you say sil. Your accuracy will not be affected by how loudly you shout (in fact, you should probably whisper this if you want to maintain your unflinching focus).

Once you've completed the entire litany of syllables, you point your palm at your target (and make sure to look at it while you're doing so) while finally shouting (or say, if you want. Won't really matter since it does nothing but release the spell) rakk.

Now say it with me: COL! Ap BRJ! Sfo VOO! Sil RAKK!

If you're a level one spellcaster, you will have to say this every time you want to make a fireball. Make sure that you've got your aegis and some steelflesh potions with you while on the battlefield because chances are that you will not be able to say all that without getting killed at least twice (hence both the aegis and the steelflesh potion).

And NEVER forget your voicefix potion. Unless you want some permanent deformation to your voicebox (that will, in the end make you sound like Bane after a few years of continued abuse of larynx [cool deal, but yeah]) and inability to cast temporarily, do not forget it. Yes, I know it's an expensive treatment that doesn't even cure the affliction, but if you want to try your hand at making a true cure-potion, enjoy the lawsuits that all the big potion companies are gonna have a field day filing.

Yes, I know there's a voiceheal potion that cures hoarse throats, Mr. Moneybags, but not everyone can afford that.

Level two spellcasters are on the level of 'Call'. Where level one newbie had to go COL! Ap BRJ! Sfo VOO! sil RAKK!, a level two just has to shout 'Fireball!'. 

In order to reach that level, you need to have a near complete understanding of the spell being cast. You need to become one with the mana and feel every ebb and flow of it and how it becomes fire and how it becomes spherical, and how it becomes fast.

Then shout 'FIREBALL!' at the top of your lungs. It will be hard at first. It's more convenient, but will be taxing. Repeated reminder: Carry your voicefixes (or voiceheals, Mr. Moneybags). The general output of the spell will be weaker than a complete incantation, but convenience is also important in a fight. Don't forget that.

Now, level three is the cream of the crop (or it would be, if it truly was all that). An early level three user will be lucky to have their magic even work. Level three involves going completely manual and directing the flow of your mana without the crutches that these mages call incantations. The spit on them and anyone who may even suggest that they are better.

Late level three spellcasters are able to create spells at a decent output, but will never truly reach maximum efficiency without the help of forgotten artifacts, lost items and other gizmos that practically don't even exist in today's societies.

This is the reason why many level three-ers will be seen using calls when in battle because they can afford the one second required to shout 'Fireball!'. Most of the time it doesn't even take a full second.

Also, when a late-stage level three spellcaster uses a full incantation, run for cover, hit the deck, just get your magical hide out of the way because whatever remains has been destroyed.

Depending on talent, reaching level three late-stage can take from a hundred to even three hundred years. The oldest mages tend to be the strongest. The reason age is important is simply because with age comes a better familiarization with the mana in ones body.

Of course, experimental beings such as homunculi can have a much shorter time in order to master magic. The creation of such a being, however, has been prohibited by the government for quite a few centuries now (ever since the whole 'Tattoo' incident).

Of course, there are other ways to be battle-effective than to focus wholly on elemental magic (though in the long-run it is the most destructive form of magic that there is). 

Enchantment is the ability to affix certain magical effects to a physical object. If you want to give your morningstar a little more speed, you can affix it with an air mana enchantment focusing on velocity. Be creative with the combinations.

Other than basic elemental spells, there's a thing known as cross-streaming.

A cross-stream of fire and earth in its proper proportions can create metal. 

Streams have to cross on one casting hand. You can't say either Brj or Jrd (which are the magigamma for fire and earth) but you'll have to imagine them while chanting the magigamma for metal, which happens to be Clank. If you want to conjure, say, a sword which is an irregular shape, you'll have to use the all-purpose irregular shape chant while imagining the shape of your object. After all that is done, shout Rakk, and you've got yourself a mana construct. Be careful not to ever make a mana construct made of gold. It has been banned by the government, and you will be caught very quickly if you ever attempt so because mana constructs will carry your residual mana signature which will be tracked to you. It takes years for the residue to die down, therefore and it is also why people don't like leaving their constructs in a battlefield because it can be used for various different curses and hexes.

But I digress.

Thus, in order to cross streams, you will have to imagine each ingredient that you're crossing while chanting the combination magigamma. Another combination magigamma for fire and earth is Vrj (ver-yee) which produces magma. Imagine the proportions and what kind of earth you want to summon (calcium carbonate, soil, granite etc) and the intensity of your flame.

While pure elements can sometimes yield a more destructive result, cross-streaming is much more versatile. Cross-streaming mages generally never feel the need to step beyond level two. Even level one is sufficient for most practitioners as cross-streaming bears plenty of non-battle uses.

Other kinds of magic that use magigamma are hexes, enchantments and pure arcanum.

Others that don't are runic magic and alchemical magic.

That's basically it. If you had the patience to read through all that, and you have a comment or two, please enlighten me.
