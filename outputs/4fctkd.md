## Is there any Toaru Majutsu no Index rational fic? [Q]

### Post:

A Certain Magical Index and A Certain Scientific Railgun are both *almost* rational as they are.  I wonder if anyone has taken the final steps?

  There was an attempt at a more rational rewrite of Index ([In Memorium](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442823/1/In-Memoriam)), but it died of neglect.

  What's there is a good read, though.

  Raildex "scientists" are, regrettably, beyond salvasion. They don't follow any kind of scientific method other than "prod it with a stick". Mages are a lot more scientific, ffs. And it kinda makes sence, since Academy City is ultimately ruled by one of the strongest mages in the world. 

  I think it'll take a full rewrite on the science side to turn Raildex into rational fic. The characters are good, at least, and magic too.
