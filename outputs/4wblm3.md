  If I'm understanding the end correctly, did Warlock just hijack a way through Arcadia to "teleport" to Marchford? Stabbing some poor fae sod along the way?

  Damn man. Warlock is a badass.

  Although that hesitation in answering about his son's condition makes me a tad worried...

    That's my take on the portal too.

    Yep, I wonder if his son is infected and he thinks it can be fixed.

  If you enjoy it as I do, the author has a patreon https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3523924
  It's near the first goal that would get us an additional chapter a month :-).

  ```
  A shame Squire doesn't have any of that painless poison she used on the traitors left.
