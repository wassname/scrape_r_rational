  One of the funniest updates so far. I was surprised by how long it was and how much happened. Straight up fights between canon and OC characters is the holy grail of naruto questing.

  Also, Hazou needs to organize his feelings as well as his ideas. Although, being 13yo really hinders meaningful relationships in the quest.

    On the other hand, it allows adorableness and drama, so it's not all bad.

    This particular facet of his subconscious continues to support either Inazou or ace!Hazou.

    The players may vote to ask Inoue-sensei for training in how to flirt. I am SO hoping they do that.
