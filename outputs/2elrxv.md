  [Branches on the Tree of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time) is a completed, comparitively short Terminator fic that I enjoyed immensely.

    Thanks for the recommendation, glad you liked it.

      I recommend literally everything by this guy right here ^

    I'll second that. The author takes the Terminatorverse form of time travel up to eleven, and then resets the scale and does it again. And again. And again. It's glorious.

      In fact id just read everything under that author.
      ```

  ```
  [Luminosity](http://luminous.elcenia.com/). It's a twilight fanfic, but that shouldn't deterre anyone. I'm pretty sure it has been posted on this sub already.

  So... we've got what, a few months to think of some recommendations?

      About three times as long as the entire LOTR trilogy.
      ```

    - u/noggin-scratcher:
      ```
      By my count, 297 chapters. None of them are particularly short, and as it goes on they get noticeably longer than in the opening arcs.

      I can't remember the wordcount offhand, but I remember it being on the scale of approximately 1 to 1.5 million.

      It's pretty long. I'm not a slow reader; I would also probably expect a re-read of HPMoR to take me on the order of a week, but not Worm.
      ```

      - u/Escapement:
        ```
        Worm is closer to 2 million words than 1; so at a rate of 500 kilowords/week, it's about a month of reading.
        ```

          ```
          I think "kilowords" is my new favorite unit of measurement. Thank you for that!

          you can read it in a week if you only pretend to work at work
          ```

    - u/tinkady:
      ```
      Scrub, I've done that in less than 3 days. Twice. Plus other times in more than 3 days
      ```

- u/CopperZirconium:
  ```
  I liked [Embers](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers). It's an Avatar the Last Airbender fanfic. The characters aren't rationalist, but the world is more rational, consistent, and "realistic" than canon and the "bad guys" have logical reasons to be what they are.
  ```

- u/TimTravel:
  ```
  Worm! I loved it. Definitely recommend.
  ```

  - u/Riddle-Tom_Riddle:
    ```
    There's a song that fits *really* well with the end of Worm.

    OP, write a note for yourself or something.

    Edit:

    I can't find the original version I used to listen to on YouTube, so that sucks.

    [Song info](#s "The song is *A View From The End Of The World* by Machinae Supremacy, on their album, A View From The End Of The World. I can't find the HQ YouTube version I listened to before I bought it, just covers and a live performance :( .")

    (Something interesting, tangentially related: I had purchased their album after listening to this song a bunch of times on YouTube - if not for the HQ version being on YT, I'd have likely not even considered it)

    Thanks to u/TimTravel for help with the spoiler.

      Huh, cool.

      I'd also recommend [Alive by Daft Punk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zZD_ItaEuU) for the many intense scenes. There's this great, layered beat and it has this awe-inspiring quality that I associate with particular setups in Worm. And it keeps on building and building and changing...

  You might like Greg Egan's fiction if you're okay with lots of science-wanking (I like it myself, but I calls 'em like I sees 'em). Incandescence probably being the most munchkiney.

  You've read Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson, right? His other stuff is also excellent.

  The Discworld books by Terry Pratchett. I predict you'd enjoy starting with one or two of the following: Going Postal, Jingo, the Wee Free Men, Thief of Time. You can worry about going back and reading the longer storylines once hooked :P

  Things alexanderwales has written on fanfiction.net.

  Veritas, a superman fic by ShaneT.
  ```

- u/Oraanu:
  ```
  [The Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) - Superman. Lex Luthor is the protagonist. No other knowledge of DC superheroes required.

  [Inviolate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate) Also Lex Luthor protagonist, many more characters from the DCU (so some googling may be required unless you read a lot of comics). Honestly one of my favorite fanfiction stories I've found to date.

  [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) - Groundhog's Day style time loop in the Naruto verse. More munchkin-y than rationalist. Contains sexual themes.

  (also Luminosity is **excellent**, but is already mentioned in another comment).
  ```

- u/Magodo:
  ```
  Please start on Worm asap, you'll be hooked within the close of the first chapter.

  There is also Dune by Frank Herbert a soft sci-fi epic.

  If you're in the mood for medieval fiction I highly recommend Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet. While it isn't exactly rational, it definitely has some very smart characters.
  ```

  - u/TimTravel:
    ```
    Does Dune get better? I didn't like the first one. Too much Gandalf syndrome (when one of the good guys is too powerful).
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      In my opinion, Dune gets worse at it goes.
      ```

      You need to read the books in the right order.  Some series, you want to read them in published order (i.e. read the first, the second, the third...) and some you want to read in in-universe chronological order (e.g. read the third, the fifth, the first...)

      The correct order for Dune is:  read the first.

      If you didn't like the first one, stop.
      ```

    - u/noggin-scratcher:
      ```
      I liked the fourth book a fair bit, not sure about *more than the original*, but more than the second and third. But if your objection to the first one is "That one guy is too powerful" then *oh holy hell* would you ever not like number four. "God Emperor" was not a title that was applied ironically.
      ```

    I honestly hated worm. I read the first three chapters, and it really put me off from reading anything beyond. It felt like it was the universe itself that was holding the idiot ball. Most of the villains are villians because they're evil, and little else (rather counter to the claim that it's rational at all), and the main character's personality is completely inconsistent and all over the place. She does these enormously stupid things, but the universe itself caters to her, preventing any real harm. Plus, she (and several other characters) do some of the most immoral things without thinking twice. If I was in her situation, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night over the guilt.
    ```

    - u/thakil:
      ```
      Yeaaaah. I read the whole thing and wasn't sure I could recommend it to people. It's fun in places, but there are problems. I really wasn't a fan of the very squicky and visceral violence that crops up, especially when a certain gang arrives in town. I also think the plot meanders a lot and could stand to be a lot shorter. Even by the later chapters there are some remarkably inconsequential fights that could be excised at absolutely no story cost.
      ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Yeesh. It shows that you only read the first 3 chapters. There is only 1 villain who is shown as Evil (with capital E and little by the way of justifications, believes or motives) till the end. The character seemed pretty focused and understandable (if not always rational, but what normal human is?). And the part about real harm made me laugh out so loud I almost woke up the people around me.

      But seeing how you were already put off by immoral things in the first 3 chapters I wouldn't recommend you to read on. The first 3 chapters are so tame compared to some of the later parts that I can't quite put it into words.

      It obviously wasn't rationalist, and it wasn't even terribly rational.  It was fairly munckinly, although the protagonist was the only one who was allowed to munchkin her powers.  Doormaker alone should have been able to be hugely more powerful than he was.  Don't even get me started on the tinkers, or on Dragon.  And, as soobtoob says, there was no reason for most of the villains to be evil -- they could have just [marketed their powers legally](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck), made WAY more money than crime at lower risk, and called it a day.

      All that aside, I enjoyed the beginning quite a bit.  At some point (*when* is arguable) it ramped the power level of the villains too high and just became bloody annoying.  Fights against demigods are only interesting for so long, at least when the demigods are onstage.  IMO you can get away with more when they are the (Wo)man Behind The Curtain, but these were straight up brawls.
      ```

      - u/notentirelyrandom:
        ```
        Spoilers!
        [Yup, lots of spoilers.] (#s "Doormaker is brain-dead, Cauldron can't market their stuff because not enough people would try the dangerous experimental formulas (and those are the important ones), and the tinkers, like all parahumans, are driven to conflict by their passengers and the Endbringers. A lot of bad decisions can be justified by alien mind control. I agree with you about Scion being too powerful of a villain, but not any of the earlier fights.")
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          Yeah, I knew those things but was trying to keep it simple and avoid spoilers. 

          I knew that about Doormaker but the people he worked for could still have used his powers to make a mint, control huge amounts of political and economic power, eliminated transportation costs for anyone they wanted something from...instead they used him to visit their vacation homes, basically. (They had wealth and power, true, but that seemed to derive from their business, not from use of Doormaker et al.)

          And yes, the "whole driver for conflict" thing, but that's a complete f'ing copout. Really? If that's the only way the story you want to write can be justified, you need to back up and try something else, because that is a literary cheat of the highest order. Basically that's saying "all conflict in the story, and the fact that literally everyone except the protagonist is either using their powers non-optimally or outright carrying the idiot ball is because plot."

          I also include the Endbringers in the "demigod" category. And no, that's not a spoiler. They get mentioned as "thing that periodically destroys cities" within a chapter or two, and it is instantly obvious that there is, at some point, going to be a fight with them.

  There was a manga... Liar Game I think. It was good. I don't know if it's completed or not though. The girl is just a placeholder protagonist but the guy is pretty smart.
