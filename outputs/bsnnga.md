  I love this series so much.

  from the last chapter:

  >"That is literally the worst idea I have ever heard," said the third boy with forehead goggles. "It violates ethics, morality, common sense, personal autonomy, the Geneva Convention, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Fourth Amendment, the Ten Commandments, the First Law of Robotics, the Code of Hammurabi, the Treaty of Ghent, the Wizard's Oath, the laws of physics, and my little sister."

  >"You're exaggerating," said the lab-coat wearer.

  >"I'm INaggerating."

  >"How would it violate the Treaty of Ghent?" said, apparently, Doctor Salamando.

  >"It could be viewed as an unprovoked attack out of American territory on Great Britain."

  Even  when the whole world is descending into the madness of video game logic, side characters still get snappy lines

  Given the manga style of Joel's interlude, it might be worth adding a preface note that it's to be read left-to-right, to save some confusion.

  I have no idea what I have stumbled upon but it certainly looks interesting.

  Edit: Holy cows. That's a real good read.

  Edit: I think the chapter about conceptual hair just broke the mary-sound barrier. It's awesome. This story is awesome.

  I said it in the thread, but I'll say it again, your a fucking genius Groon, and this work is so good it boggles my mind.
