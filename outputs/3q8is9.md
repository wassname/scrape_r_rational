  Sorry that this is not rational fiction, but holidays can be considered a form of shared fiction and it's a rational holiday to boot!

  I'll be attending. Is anyone else going? You don't have to share any personal information beyond that if you're concerned about Internet strangers. I'll just be thinking positive thoughts at you while I'm there. ;)

    Are you going to the New York one?  I think I'd rather attend that than hang out with moar of my own area's LW folks at MIT.  Nothing too much against them, they're just kinda... cultish.  I'm just not comfortable around them much of the time.

    Lemme ask my IRL "rationalist" friend.
