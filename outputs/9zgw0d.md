## I've noticed a lot of writing that involves relationships/sex has the uncomfortable reek of the author's personal masturbatory fantasy. What are good rules of thumb for an aspiring writer to avoid this?

### Post:

This post is borderline ranty, so my apologies for that.

Sex and relationships play a huge role in the lives of people, and I think it's great to bring in those elements to flesh out characters and the world they live in.

However, I can't help but notice a tendency for writers to write that stuff in a such a way that breaks suspension of disbelief... that I've gone from the intriguing world I was exploring to someone's personal sex fantasy.

If every named female character is sexy (and half of them end up getting involved with your protagonist)?  Masturbatory fantasy.

If the MC has an uncommon sexuality, and yet has no shortage of viable partners whatsoever?  Probably a masturbatory fantasy.



Now, masturbatory fantasy is fine and all, but if I'm not on /r/rational rather than literotica, it's not what I'm looking for.



So, writers, what do you do to keep your writing from devolving into masturbatory fantasy?

  IMO a couple of things can help avoid this:

  1. Avoid making the MC a thinly-veiled Self-Insert of yourself. Either make them an actual self-insert or make them their own character. Give them a disposition, upbringing, and backstory different from your own which results in them naturally reacting differently than you would to many given situations.

  2. Don't have 90% of the opposite gender characters in the story be attracted to your protagonist. This is unrealistic not only for the obvious reasons but also because in real life more than half of the people I know are already in relationships. When the group consists of the main character, one token male character who acts as comic relief, and multiple women who are both single and attracted to the main character I just roll my eyes.

  3. Have characters other than the MC be in relationships. "Beta couples" can help you avoid number 2.

  I've repeatedly observed this same phenomenon even from professional writers, from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time in which women are constantly getting stripped naked and birched, paddled, spanked with a hair brush, and whipped, or threatened with same; to A Song of Fire and Ice, in which (in my opinion) George R. R. Martin has a bit of a fixation on castration; a fixation shared by Iain Banks who always seems to include at least one sexual organ removal scene in each of his books, and had one book (The Wasp Factory) in which that was a primary plot point rather than just being a mandatory scene; to Jack L. Chalker whose books always include multiple transgender transformations and scenes of identity death.

  It appears that many authors need to include their personal fetish in their writing in order to keep their interest up enough to write a book.

          >Victor Gonser, Ph. D. is a middle-aged college professor backpacking in Alaska when he finds his consciousness inexplicably transferred into the body of a 13 year old Tlingit Indian girl. Later he swaps bodies with a stunningly beautiful Canadian college student named Dorian "Dory" Tomlinson. Taken into custody by a secret U.S. government agency, Victor learns that the Earth has become the battlefield in a skirmish between two highly advanced and implacably opposed interstellar cultures who view human beings as little more than animals and use body-swapping as an infiltration tactic. Worse, the aliens had killed his old body. There could be no going back.

          >Permanently cut off from their old lives, Victor and Dory have little choice but to volunteer as both researchers and test subjects at the Identity Matrix Center, a secret underground facility outside Las Vegas where a secret government task force is engaged in desperate efforts to unravel the aliens' body-swapping technology and determine which of the two alien sides offers the best chance for humanity's survival, all while "Vickie" learns the ins and outs of being a woman. But when Dory stumbles across evidence that IMC may be playing a deeper game things suddenly take a more sinister turn, because while IMC's understanding of Identity Matrices may not yet be advanced enough to transfer minds between bodies it's certainly advanced enough to make two troublesome girls disappear. One false move later and Dory and Victor's memories and personalities are replaced by those of Delores Eagle Feather (a Navajo orphan) and Misty Ann Carpenter, an extraordinarily enthusiastic (and extraordinarily well-endowed) stripper and prostitute.

    I haven't read _The Wasp Factory_ but the only sexual organ removal scenario I can recall in Banks work I have read is in Player of Games where it's not actually a 'scene', it happens off camera, and it's kind of lost in all the torture and rape (which is the point).

  I don't understand. Someone is writing a thing. You're asking for advice on how not to write the thing?
  Write...something else you enjoy?

  Seriously you're not going to escape the accusation of self-indulgence no matter what. Peoples turn-offs are arbitrary and so specific that anything you make will set off someone's warning bells about how you're crafting a contrived scenario to satisfy your preconceptions about reality. They'll probably be right about that. 

  You can write things to be maximally painful for the audience in which case I will just accuse you of being a try hard instead.

      Again not sure if that's really possible to do consistently. I mean it's one thing to try to dodge the bullet entirely and avoid the topic but it's not really a question of execution. There isn't anything more absurd happening than say a genius detective getting stranded in an isolated location where a murder happens. It's just that sex and romance are divisive.

      You can put a lot of effort into making your vampire romance novel show realistic human depth but people are still going to call you out on writing vampire romance because it's seen as sleazy and what makes it sleazy seems more about fashion than anything. So for example the most vanilla of vanilla romcoms "Love Actually" gets a similarly bad rap these days for all the unremarkable tropes that have  become hot button social issues since it was first released. 
      I also remember when harem anime first became a thing it was mostly slapstick comedy: love interest #1 walks in on love interest #2 and the protagonist in a compromising position -> protagonist gets slapped into the next room where love interest #3 is undressing-> continue until commercial break. Not exactly high brow but it seems to have become viewed as even less savory somehow.

      So even if your careful to try to avoid cringe as much as possible by navigating all the pitfalls of what your audience considers over the line there not much you can do in terms of future proofing. (I'm oh so eagerly anticipating the day when the Attack on Titan fanbase realises that the giant naked women crushing tiny people in their beloved series are not entirely...I want to say innocent but then again murder).

      So the only real option seems to bite the bullet and actually present what you think ought to happen in the story you're writing and accept you won't please everybody.

    People are oddly entitled these days and quite performative about it on social media.

    In our western societies even the poor have access to a dizzying amount of instant gratification. I think it fosters narcissism and the expectation that everything consumable is created just for them. 

    People would probably be a lot better off if they followed the advice of Epictetus, *"Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them."*

  Well, depends...? Which part is the issue that you have? Is it the masturbatory feel? Cuz if it's that, just make sure both people are, well... people. Write from both perspectives, and make sure they're not identical (people will like different things). 

  IANAW, but, seems to me like it'd be just like with writing anything else; make sure your characters are fully fledged from the big-picture goals alll the way down to the little quirks, and make those come across.

  Make sure that it's a fantasy from *all* perspectives, not just the protagonists'.

  Sounds like wish-fulfillment stories. Or Xianxia/Wuxia, where rape is a legitimate battle tactic: https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/317/233/d41.png

    It's very fitting that the captions under "Chad Chinaman" don't even mention women or relationships, only rape. The best a woman in a  xianxia/wuxia novel can aspire to is as a peripheral status symbol, on par with a decent sword (as opposed to centerpiece status symbols in japanese light novels).

      What do you mean by no mention of women?

      >could have literally any woman in the world, turns them down due to high standards

      >either gets one brilliant waifu he never leaves, or all of them

      >rape is a battle tactic


      One thing I do note from what stories I have read: In some Japanese stories the women are more fleshed out and interesting than the MC. In the Chinese works I have read, the male main character is always the most fleshed out and interesting being, with the women being typically relegated to being trophies or goals they have to work for.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        Jeez, you're right. I did catch the rape one, but not the other ones. 

        Regardless, the point stands. In xianxia women are almost never fleshed out characters with any significant degree of agency. In wuxia it might be more common, I haven't tried many.
        ```

        - u/Maxrewind99:
          ```
          Most Xianxia don't have any fleshed out characters, female or otherwise.

           In a bad xianxia every antagonist is a comically evil sociopath while every female character might as well be a very nice painting.
          ```

      Which is interesting as women are arguably viewed and treated more positively in more professional settings in China.

    Is this an exaggeration, perhaps? I havenâ€™t met any xianxia so far in which rape wouldâ€™ve been a *battle tactic*. Granted, there are several hentai anime series that have this trope, and I try to screen the xianxia titles before reading them, but still.

      I believe itâ€™s a direct reference to martial god asura, which I havenâ€™t read.

      That said thereâ€™s some cases where cultivation methods depend on dual cultivation (sex). Itâ€™s not too far of a stretch to imagine how one might utilize this if your opponent has a special quality body or bloodline that helps. 

      Regardless everyone in these stories would probably be considered psychopaths or sociopaths by modern standards so it probably doesnâ€™t matter.

        The bird wasnâ€™t the protagonist though.

        Also, since no women were targeted by that plot device, Iâ€™d argue that it wasnâ€™t about sex or relationships, or what OP was talking about in general.

  I think it's something that's easy to avoid if you make yourself aware of it. Just know what elements you would include were you one of your characters... and then don't do that. Have them be found unattractive, and/or sexually unsatisfied, don't have sex be an important part of the story, etc.

  Problem with masturbatory fantasies is lack of psychological and social realism. If all characters involved have lives and roles in the story outside of their relationship, then their interactions become more meaningful and less cringey. That being said, one should not describe the act itself in any more detail than is warranted by plot and chatacter development. Otherwise it's just gratuitous and grafted on.

  Characters should be their own people with roles in the plot outside of their relationships to other characters.

  My general rule of thumb is that no relationship can last forever. Even the strongest most loving relationships will probably start to fade after a few thousand years, if given the chance to play out for that long. If you plan for your lead character's romantic interest to break up with them eventually it is easier to flesh them out.

    ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      No. My response is "rigorously applied common sense" and "human nature". Basically, if you spend enough time doing the same activities or hanging around the same people, eventually your brain will become habituated to them and you will get bored and want to try something new and meet new people.

      Also, people change over time. There's value drift, people's interests change, and what they need from relationships changes over time too. Fall in love with someone at year 1, year 5000 they're a totally different person and you're a totally different person, and the feelings have faded away. Experience brings people together and it can also bring them apart. Almost no one stays with their highschool sweetheart for very long at all after getting out of high school.

      Probably the reason most people don't understand all this is because they can't imagine life trajectories that last thousands or millions of years or more, nor can they imagine how the dating/relationship markets will be impacted by astronomically large transhumanist population size.

      Thing is, humans are more compatible with more people than they typically realize. Statistically speaking, if the chances of finding a compatible romantic partner were 1/(Total Human Population), then there would be basically zero chance of anyone ever finding a compatible romantic partner. It would be like looking for a yellow needle in a haystack. Maybe worse. So barring divine intervention, people have to have a lot more than just one potential partner out there.

      In the distant post-scarcity transhumanist future, the human population would be a LOT bigger, which means there would be LOT more available romantic partners. One would probably have compatibility with many more potential partners than one could have romantic relationships with at a time.

      Bottom line is, forever is a REALLY long time, and a lot can change in a billion years. You might think you've found your one true love that will last for all time. More than likely you will break up after your first millenium, and possibly even sooner than that. I'm quite certain that's what all the sensible dating experts will say within a few million years if humanity survives this century. And then I am going to tell everyone "I told you so."
