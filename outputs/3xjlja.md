  There's a very interesting fanfiction out there (found the [link](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma) ), in which the world is besieged by a zombie virus spawned by dementor reproduction. It's an interesting read. Never thought I'd see HP mixed with zombie apocalype.

  I never thought such two could be crossed together so well. I was very fortunately wrong.

  Hmm. They should be unable to breed further, no? With no humans left on Earth to feed them. Perhaps the Sol system could be warded...
