    You don't really need a miracle metal either... You could just make a world without universal gravitation. Make it follow Minecraft rules for instance.

      I really don't like the idea of a world that just completely throws out our physics. There's a reason that Aeria operates on all the same physics as our world. As strange as it may seem, this world is meant to connect causally back to our own, though how it does that I won't be sharing just yet.

      But that raises more questions than a miracle metal. A world that runs on Minecraft rules might be interesting - would trees evolve differently if they can have part of their trunks removed and just float in the air? - but it would be hard to work with. Particularly if you just want to tell a story about floating islands.
