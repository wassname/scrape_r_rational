  It seems like everyone forgot about the recommendation thread yesterday, so here it is a day late. Oops!

  I personally can't easily think of much to recommend, so I'm going to try something new.

  Anyone can make a request for certain requirements for stories and I will try to find something that fulfills the criteria. However, don't ask for similar stories to what has already been requested multiple times on this subreddit. I mean there's already numerous threads on time-travel stories, Naruto fanfiction, or Harry Potter fanfiction.

  Anyway, here's my few recommendations of worth:

  [Slip Hero](https://royalroadl.com/fiction/1931) - Involves a doctor reincarnated into a medieval world with magic. Points for subverting the usual reincarnation dreck by having the protagonist not remember very much about his past life (he's not aware that he reincarnated), and involves him actually using what little he remembers of the modern technology as novel ideas invented by him in a slow technological uplift. Unfortunately, while the story's definitely not dead, the author updates excruciatingly slowly on the order of 2 or 3 times a year.

  [Iron Teeth](http://www.ironteethserial.com/) - What's a goblin gots to do to get ahead in this world? Follow this poor sucker as he attempts to get a life better than being a slave and hopefully evolve into something better. Consistent update rate by the author.
  ```

    >Anyone can make a request for certain requirements for stories and I will try to find something that fulfills the criteria.

    * Stories in which common premises, usually handwaved, are used as the main conflict fuel.

     That is, a human displaced into another world tries to find out who is responsible for this and hurt them, instead of following typical [Portal Fantasy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld) storyline. Or the protagonist notices that the world around him starts to look too much like harem anime, and tries to figure out what reality-warping device or mastermind is responsible for this. Or... you probably get the idea.

     In other words, stories with low-key [Rage Against the Author](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheAuthor) plots.

    * Stories where [omnicidal maniacs](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac) are *right*: that is, where the world is such that destroying it is the right thing to do.

    * Stories with the plot centered around antimemetics. (Well, *except* **qntm**'s [There Is No Antimemetics Division](http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five).)

    Whichever you would prefer. Fanfiction is allowed.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      From what was posted in the sub

      1. Sleeping With Girls (subverting harem trope)  and somewhat The Two Year Emperor (eventual rage against people who summoned him,  but for another reason) 

      3\. Other than other qntm's stories on SCP (there are 4 or 5 of them),  *I can't remember* anything else
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Regarding antimemetics, I've remembered (ha) another one: *[Lost City](http://alexanderwales.com/lost-city/)* by Alexander Wales.

        On SCP wiki, there's a few [antimemetic objects](http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/antimemetic#pages), and [tales](http://www.scp-wiki.net/matterminded) connected to Counterconceptual Department, another part of the Foundation dealing with antimemetics which existed *in parallel* with qntm's Antimemetics Division, with neither of them knowing about the other one.

        But they don't have the same continuous narrative that *There's No Antimemetics Division* has, as far as I can tell.
        ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I spent a while thinking of anything that would fulfill your requirements, but there were only a few I found that meets them:

      * Anything by [Lawrence Watt-Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Watt-Evans). The stories he write often involves realistic people in slightly cliche situations. While it's not to the point of the protagonists being Genre Savy and taking advantage of story telling conventions; instead they simply act in novel ways that are different from what should be expected. [Here's](https://www.amazon.com/Lawrence-Watt-Evans-Fantasy-MEGAPACK-ebook/dp/B06XVFLTBW) a collection of his short stories for only a dollar, although I've only read his Ethshar series.

      * [Something Very Special](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10909255/1/Something-Very-Special) is the only story I have ever heard of where the villain has an actually good reason for killing off an significant number of the human population. I don't want to say anything else about the story to avoid spoilers. Unfortunately the author has stopped updating last year and doesn't seem to be continuing the story, but it's so good that I wanted to recommend it anyway. The link I gave leads to the 7 chapter version on fanfiction.net. [Here's](https://sites.google.com/site/shermansplanet/storage/Something%20Very%20Special.pdf?attredirects=1) the 9 chapter direct download version. Check out his [website](http://www.shermansplanet.com/) too!

    >Anyone can make a request 

    Does anyone know any stories in which the main character tries using rationality (or however it is labeled by the author) for ordering and improving their life, but the whole thing turns into struggle against the “defects” of the human mind instead? E.g. someone with addiction tries to give up but just telling to themselves *“[insert substance here] is bad for you because [insert rational reasoning]”* doesn’t work because it’s not the rational part of the brain that is addicted to the drug. Other possible examples: anxiety, apathy, depression, learned helplessness, paranoia, [violence,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman) etc.

    Preferably as realistic and with as little artistic license for wishful thinking as possible. 

    I’d actually even be fine with [those books that practitioners like writing about their patients](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63697.The_Man_Who_Mistook_His_Wife_for_a_Hat_and_Other_Clinical_Tales) (that’s a good book, by the way), but only if they aren’t ~5% verbatim notes from the patient and ~95% guesswork from the therapist.

    >Iron Teeth 

    I second this. Wouldn’t call it a rat!story, but the forest-related bits were rather neatly done.

  # Fanfiction

  These descriptions are what I found enjoyable about the stories. For more fleshed out teasers check out the stories themselves.

  [Stargate Reopened](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471700/1/Stargate-Reopened) - A more realistic take on Stargate written as infrastructure fiction. Manages to function as a reconstruction - as opposed to a deconstruction - as the authors fix issues in the canon while keeping the source material's spirit intact.

  [In Memoriam](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442823/1/In-Memoriam) - [Toaru Majutsu no Index](https://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index). Another more realistic imagining of the source material. Doesn't require an understanding of the source material to enjoy.

  [Stark Transcendent](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/stark-transcendent-iron-man-marvel-quest.3513/) - Marvel Comics forum quest. Apparently handing SufficientVelocity control over Tony Stark results in a more kick ass story -- who would have guessed?

  [Officer of the Republic](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/officer-of-the-republic-a-sw-si.478840/) - Star Wars SI story. A fleshed out and realistic portrayal of the jedi.

  [Shadowrun Imugi](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/shadowrun-imugi.27168/) - [Shadowrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun) forum quest. Great storytelling, cute fox. **Note:** I'm biased to like this story for personal reasons that we probably don't share.

  [Just Another Genius](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/just-another-genius-starcraft-au-quest.514957/) - Starcraft forum quest. Used techno-babble which actually allows for advanced predictions about it's subject. **Note:** This quest is new so it might go downhill soon.

  # Youtube Channels

  [Innuendo Studios](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5fdssPqmmGhkhsJi4VcckA) - In depth video essays on video games as an art form. **Note:** The name is misleading, it has nothing to do with innuendos. 

  [Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFqcJQXGZ6T6sxyFB-5i6A) - In depth video essays on film form from a professional editor. Each video feels like a piece of art all on it's own.

  [Real Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1IuLEqb6UEA_zQ81kwXfg) - Variety of videos on topics relating to engineering from a former engineer.

  # Webcomics

  [Wilde Life](http://www.wildelifecomic.com/) - It's pretty.

  I don't think I've heard of [The Arithmancer](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer) and the sequel [Lady Archimedes](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes) and being mentioned here before. Its a Harry Potter fanfic with Hermione being the (super smart) MC. It is very well written. I like it because it goes in depth on the muggle vs wizard dispute and the maths used is easy to understand.

    I found those stories here, and have enjoyed them. I second this recommendation.
    ```

  - u/Zephyr1011:
    ```
    I second this as an enjoyable story. That said, I have become increasingly annoyed lately with every good aligned character's reluctance to kill their enemies,when they have no real means to keep prisoners and their enemies show them no such courtesy. 

    Having a moral system which forbids killing if you can incapacitate is hardly irrational though, merely irritating.
    ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    Personally, I've lost interest in *The Arithmancer* since its plot seemed determined to go through virtually every [Station of the Canon](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon).

        Can't recall anything like that? At least not recently. Possibly there was someone like that a lot earlier in the story

        Hmm. From what I've read, Professor Vector was quite helpful, but not implausibly so. Though if she continues being this helpful throughout the story, then yes, I suppose it has.
        ```

  - u/gbear605:
    ```
    I wouldn't say that they're rational, though I can't remember why at the moment (I've made this decision in the past and I'm relying on my memory of that decision). They're still a very good story though, so I strongly suggest reading them.

  I've been following the [Paths of Civilization](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/) quest lately, and it's been fun. It starts with a hunter-gatherer community and follows them over the generations as they transition over to agriculture, and recently metalworking. The writer seems to have a good grasp on how prehistoric societies function which makes it an interesting read. The voters may not be the most rational of people, however... who would've known that trying to power through a radical and untested tax reform in the middle of a war would blow up on their faces?

  The last chapter was the result of the voting over how to deal with a cholera epidemic, and all of the rolls were spot-on. The shamans of the community marched out like Spartans in 300 and punted the epidemic back to the lowlands whence it came.  
  Well, that might be a slight exaggeration, but damn did they get work done. Even invented rudimentary sanitation theory while they were at it.

  (Also, on a tangentially related note TIL that "whence" does not need the "from" preposition)
  ```

  - u/vallar57:
    ```
    Wow, more than a thouthand pages of discussion in merely two months, that's one active quest.
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      Yeah, it is one of the most popular ones on the site. The author also updates pretty much daily, which means that people are constantly voting and yelling at others for voting wrong.
      ```

  - u/Krozart:
    ```
    Haha my brother has been trying to get me to participate in that quest. Man was he peeved about the voters pushing through that tax reform. He really wanted to make that Heroic General King instead.

  Democracy 3 is a pretty fun game and the only good government policy simulator I've seen. I'm working on a mod to make some things more realistic (i.e. money supply, all taxes and spending affecting GDP, inflation, etc.) as well as adding some new policies like a sovereign wealth fund and universal basic income. There's something satisfying about seeing a fiscally sustainable policy that spends 1.5 trillion dollars per quarter.

    The parent mentioned [**Sovereign Wealth Fund**](http://legaliq.com/Definition/Sovereign_Wealth_Fund). Many people, including non-native speakers, may be unfamiliar with this word. **Here is the definition:**^\(In ^beta, ^be ^kind)
    ****
    A sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is a state-owned investment fund investing in real and financial assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, or in alternative investments such as private equity fund or hedge funds. Sovereign wealth funds invest globally. Most SWFs are funded by revenues from commodity exports or from foreign-exchange reserves held by the central bank. By historic convention, the United States' Social Security Trust Fund, with $2.8 trillion of assets in 2014, is not considered a sovereign wealth fund.

    It's a really fun game. How do you plan to determine the effects of UBI?
    ```

    - u/Timewinders:
      ```
      I've already added that part but still need to tweak it. IMO it should reduce poverty, increase unemployment and equality and GDP and poor earnings, and piss off capitalists and the wealthy. Later I'm planning to have it increase inflation also. There's actually already a mod for UBI but IMO it has the costs be unrealistically low.

  New season of sense8 just came out. It's probably my favourite thing on netflix. It's by the wachowskis and the guy from babylon 5. It's an extremely good show, though it takes about 4 episodes for the first season really to get into gear. 

  Everyone seems pretty dang competent, though I'm not sure I'd call it rational fiction. Better than most, though. (That said: not terribly scientifically accurate).

  The best way to describe it: 8 soap operas happening simultaneously with lots and lots of badass action scenes. People being good at things and stepping back when they're not. 

  And, uh, one of the first scenes is a lesbian sex scene complete with a rainbow strap on being thrown to the side afterwards, so you might not want to watch it with your family in the room with you because it does have some sexually graphic scenes.

  [The Bridge by Leonard Petracci](https://leonardpetracci.com/the-bridge/)

  It's about a population struggling to survive on a damaged space ship. There aren't many "bottled population" stories I can think of (think a story set in a Fallout Shelter), and this one is particularly strong. There are more than a few less than rational characters, but even that's explained eventually.
