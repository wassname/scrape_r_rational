## The Rationality of Absolute Equality

  This really sounds like a dystopia. Like, it's not even subtle.

  Not being able to reproduce sexually? Many people believe there's a special bond between a parent and their biological child and wouldn't like not being able to experience that. Also, how does this remove nepotism? Unless you're having the kids raised by faceless robot entities -- I shouldn't have to explain why this is a terrible idea -- then *someone* has to be raising them, and they might give their children unfair advantages.

  No education is equal. Teachers are of varying level of skill and temperament, and some students will react better to different styles of teaching than others. If you have two students of equal intelligence, one a visual learner and one not, then the visual one will do better if the class has a teacher that likes teaching that way.

  Constant surveillance by robotic entities? That's some 1984 shit.

  As for 'equal contribution'â€¦ why? Literally, what's the point of this? Any of it? To say that a person should have to pay a price to feel comfortable in their own skin, to receive an education, to *be born* is wrong and stupid at best, possibly outright offensive.

  That's not even getting into the fact that you apparently have AI complex enough to be judge, jury, and executioner; why would anyone work, when machines could clearly do it much faster, easier, and better? At this point, just institute basic universal income -- if someone wants more than enough money to live comfortably, then they can get a job doing something not easily done by machines, like acting.

  The reasoning behind this form of 'equality' -- speaking of, how on earth would it bring any sort of actual equality? -- also feels a lot like this society is trying to brainwash its citizens into feeling indebted to it so they won't dissent. "You owe us for making you. You owe us for giving you basic rights. You should be grateful. If you aren't, you're a bad person. You don't want to be a bad person, do you?"

  Newsflash -- the earlier law about free education? It's not free if you have to pay for it.

  Yikes, I would not want to live in this kind of society, and in no way do I see this a rational one. 

  A rational Actor and or Modus operandi is to persue one's objectives in the most efficient manner possible while adhering to a given set of internal rules. 

  The goal here appears to be an equal basis to start life from before striking out, by some technicalities this objective is being met with the proposed solution but the more efficient method would be to simply copy brain states / souls / AI patterns for a given specimen raised in this, horrid, manner. Using a master copy create as many of these, equal entities as are needed for the society. 

  This Society, would be bland tasteless, emotionless, stagnant entity. Diversity breeds strength, and Unity lets it endure. 

  True Equality enforced on every individual is a dystopia nightmare. For a society to flourish, Equality of opportunity should be available.

    Yah, this is exactly what I thought as well. true equality isn't even a goal that should be strived for.

  Equal at birth doesn't work in general. If all humans were exactly identical, and especially if we had no genetic diversity, we would have no will to do anything. If I were born with no desires, no specific genetic traits then I would want for nothing, never make any choices because of an inability to make a choice, and pass the rest of my life without doing anything. If we *had* specific drives, then all the clones would end up identical. Realistically, if they are all given the same education, and grew up with the same traits and drives, they would make the same choices, which technically fulfills equality of choice but makes it useless. 

  The problem with equality is that it boils down to people ending up the exact same. This is a classic equity vs. equality situation. We need equity, because the differences between people are important and a key part of humanity.

    My version of an equitable society would be UBI for everyone, law that is administered by an FAI(Friendly Artificial Intelligence) (probably in terms of utility), access to a universal curriculum that lays a foundation for individuals(which can be adapted to different learning styles), opportunities for pursuing dreams but which require extensive time commitment(if you want to travel to Mars, study for 20 years), an end to aging and all genetic and external defects and diseases, the choice to self-modify after 100 years and a certain quantity of specific experiences and the choice to reproduce after 100 years and a certain quantity of specific experiences. That's all I can think of for now.

  [I think you mean true justice.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c6/21/3b/c6213b948855090b15d63627e9e0918f.png)

  True or absolute equality does not exist. Except maybe on the Platonic plane or at the heat death of the universe. You can only approach justice, but never reach it. The closer you get, the more things have to regress because our spacetime doesn't allow absolute equality of results and opportunities in an organic way.

  Nothing about this is rational. It is irrational to remove our genetic diversity. It is irrational to try to perpetuate the notion that everyone must contribute to society when we should push for things like Universal Basic Income. AGI controlling law enforcement? Likely going to require a lot of privacy violations, not to mention the security risks. 

  Your only half-reasonable proposals are equity in education and a deathless society, except of course, what do you even mean to balance age related inequality?

  Unlike the other commenter /u/JullianWyvern, I think this is much closer to the eventual outcome of true equality than he thinks, but I would say that actually, **true equality is evil.** 

  I still think you aren't looking broadly enough though; the only way you can achieve "true equality" is by each person having **no** differences what-so-ever. e.g. you said that at age of maturity, they can "choose" what they want to do. Ok, so what if someone "chooses" something more profitable/fulfilling than another person? -> How did that person come to a different choice than the most optimum one? -> Their upbringing must have been different, hence inequality. 

  You cannot have anyone's life experience being ANY different than another person's for true equality. Choice does not exist in a truly equal society. 

  So IMO, true equality is completely unfeasible, and undesirable even in a post-scarcity civilization. 

  Since you mentioned them though, I wanted to comment on the two last points: First, Equity before the law; I agree this would be the only way to attempt to enforce "true equality", but I would also say that if actual true equality is achieved as mentioned above, there should be NO law. Anyone treated (let alone punished) differently than others is inequality. 

  If we look at it in a more realistic perspective: the problem with one entity having all the power is that if that entity somehow does the "wrong" thing, there is nothing that can be done. The only solution to this, is you have to have power be spread as much as possible. The issue with that is that as long as one entity with power wants more than their fair share (or just **perceives** another entity being unfair) you have conflict, and unfortunately you cannot solve this by centralizing power because of the above point. 

  I would also want to mention about the deathless society point; the old people don't need protecting. They would have the most power in a deathless society, think of an MMO, the weakest players are the new ones not old ones. If you are interested in equalizing this you would need to give the young something and take form the old. In our society that's Taxes and public education (plus parental obligation), and in a post-scarcity society I would actually solve this by countering your "equal contribution" point; Everyone should start (and be forced to keep) a minimum amount of "resources" which are enough for comfortable subsistence. The rest they can do whatever they want with. 

  &#x200B;

  I think what you are looking for is actually: how to achieve true "equal **opportunity**", and I think you will find it looks very similar to many developed countries in modern society with a few tweaks.
