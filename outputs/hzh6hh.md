## I'd like some help with giving constructive criticism of a 'Like SAO, but it makes sense!' fanfiction I'm a reader of...

### Post:

So one of the authors I follow is making a 'It's Sword Art Online, but it makes sense!' Quest (think slightly interactive fiction) that I'm enjoying reading.  However, for the last several pages of the thread, there's been a bit of back-and-forth about, uhm, what 'makes sense'.  I'm not really the most articulate at getting my point across, nor am I the best at understanding some of the issues of human psychology under stress that have come up recently between me and some of the readers and the author.  Could I get some help? I think the rules say I'm not supposed to link, as this isn't explicitly rational fiction, but it's the 'Swordland Revisited' quest by Birdsie in the Quests section of the Sufficient Velocity forums.  The only relevant bits to the discussion I've been in are on pages 89-94 of the threads so far.  Thanks!

Edit: In one of the bottom replies, I posted some of the things that the author said as far as themes, many of which I had a problem with.

  I feel like SAO Abridged did all the stuff I would ever want out of an SAO ratfic.

    Esp that glorious ending with heathcliff explaining the bugs. That was amazing. I was always wondering how they were going to explain that away.

    It's funny; SAO Abridged made it way harder for me to enjoy SAO fanfic.  I keep finding myself expecting Kirito to act like abridged Kirito, and even though I know academically that abridged Kirito wasn't the original version, it still feels off to me.  The same goes for the other characters, to a lesser extent.

      Source!Kirito never seemed to me to make much sense - he is constantly surprised and unaware of his harem (as is required by the author to prevent any romance from getting anywhere) while still being extremely competent socially, gaining multiple close friends. He's not a misanthrope like 8man from Oregairu, so why would he not notice the multiple women crushing on him? SAOAbridged at least puts that misanthropy in the context of Sachi, which Source!Kirito seems to forget 5 minutes down the line.

    [Fairy Dance of Death](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death) is pretty good, too. It's got some interesting plotlines and game mechanics, and it has a wide set of characters dealing with different aspects of the game.

  Never made sense to me that the VR gear could kill you, if you tried to remove it.

  Like..... short of a small explosive, I wouldn't see how that would work.

  And it was disappointing that we never saw people just disconnect/shatter when someone from the outside world called that bluff. Abridged addressed some of that, with the girl having a bad internet connection living in permanent fear of a disconnect.In Abridged this was due "to an unforeseen bug", though. But you can't just cause a mortal fit of epilepsy in just anyone with perfect reliability. (at least, so far noone has managed that, afaik)And since it wasn't intentional, it seems that frying the circuitry with an EMP should do the trick at least in the Abridged-universe.

  In SOA they show the next generation being much less bulky. So the whole helmet form factor was apparently just there to trap you?

  I just don't see how anyone would fall for that. There must be some of the headsets that were bought, but the buyer didn't have time for the launch date.  
  And for any electronics device you can find a teardown video that would have revealed the explosives.

    Microwave ovens work by vibrating water molecules to heat things. It seems obvious to me that applying the same principle to water molecules in the brain at a certain intensity would result in catastrophic damage. No explosives needed.

    > And it was disappointing that we never saw people just disconnect/shatter when someone from the outside world called that bluff.

    That would have only happened in the first few hours before Kayaba's "tutorial" when the knowledge of its lethality wasn't widespread yet. And if anything like that was shown on-screen before the "tutorial", the narrative couldn't have pulled off the twist so nicely.

    >In SOA they show the next generation being much less bulky. So the whole helmet form factor was apparently just there to trap you?

    >I just don't see how anyone would fall for that.

    Since the SAO world version of VR is wireless interception and interface of nerve signals sent from the brain, it wouldn't be out of the question for the helmet form to be thought as a way to secure the interface from being misaligned and/or intercepted. Whether it's true or not, it was pretty new technology, so probably very few people knew for sure. (They do mention in the novels that the NerveGear's successors tend to be less satisfying to the senses, though that might be more due to the signal being weakened for (perception of) safety rather than because of loss of the full-head coverage.)

  I've read a lot of stuff on SV, including the quest you're talking about. I assume that you, like me,  have the same username here and there. 

  I haven't read all the discussion pages referenced, but I did skim a few. I think I got the gist of it though. 

  Essentially, you see the opportunity to make an early intervention and set up a long term plan which will further the goals of the MC and make the quest more enjoyable for you personally.

  You are right that you are having trouble communicating. But it seems like part of that at least is not really understanding or at least not addressing the fairly diverse objections you are getting. They include things like:

  -There are low hanging fruit that we should get now
  -All easy options for influencing psychology have already been taken
  -General distaste because people keep using the word cult
  -Belief that the guild is a better option than starting something new.
  -Belief that the existing psychological services are better than starting something new.

  Your best bet is to come up with specific actions and rituals that the guild can do on its own to reaffirm it's belief in and desire for the outside world. And abandon any hope of getting the rest of the quest interested in turning the game into a paradise post escape. SV doesn't do that sort of long term goal making, they fight enemies, grab shinies, and Make Hard Decisions.

  The AI rights situation will start getting actions once the QM writes a scene with a sufficiently sympathetic and in depth NPC. And not before.

  Some of the best advice I received: if you want to criticize something, have you considered just not doing it? Why do you feel the need to do it? Will it help anything?

  - u/Gavinfoxx:
    ```
    Well, since it is a Quest, and the whole idea is specifically audience participation and interaction, I feel feedback on things like themes, and ways to encourage certain types of themes in a way that respects the setting, is warranted.
    ```

    - u/Amargosamountain:
      ```
      I guess I don't know what a Quest is. What is a Quest?
      ```

      - u/masterax2000:
        ```
        Basically, it's a sort of collaborative writing thing based partially off of tabletop role-playing games, and partially off of old text-based adventure games. 

        The QM (quest master) makes a post on a forum or whatever, detailing a scenario. For example:

        >You awaken in a jail cell. You are on a bed. You don't know why you are here. What do you do?

        The players then respond with commands, like:

        >Try to break through the wall!

        >Do we have a cellmate? Try and talk to them, if so.

        >Examine the cell, looking for anything we can use. 

        The QM then picks whatever was most voted for/whatever they like the most/whatever meets their criteria, and then writes the next post using it/them.

        >You try and strike up a conversation with your cellmate. He says to leave him alone. However, after you spend the next few minutes checking every nook and cranny of the cell for useful items, he seems to be curious enough  to talk to you. "What are you doing?" he asks. How do you respond?

        And then this goes back and forth over and over until the quest ends, be it because the players won, lost, or the QM got bored. 

        A few I would recommend if you want to try reading one:

        [Problem Sleuth](https://www.homestuck.com/problem-sleuth/1)

        The early portions of [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/story) (The author stopped taking commands at about act 5, I think)

        [Marked for Death: A Rational Naruto Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/)

        [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/) (NSFW)

        And many, many more. But these are probably some of the best/most popular.

    The people around you have failed you deeply on many levels if "being critical of things is dumb and lame, just consume unthinkingly" is some of the *best advice you ever received*.
    ```

    - u/Amargosamountain:
      ```
      Best *for this specific topic of criticizing other people's writing*, genius.

      I notice you ignored the question I asked: why? What do you gain from criticizing a stranger's work? Do they gain anything from hearing your unsolicited, probably bad ideas?
      ```

      - u/onemerrylilac:
        ```
        Not that I'm in any way trying to speak for u/Detsuahxe, but generally author's that post their work online, especially authors of serial fiction who post their work piece by piece, value their readers' criticism to improve their writing. Sometimes readers will find mistakes that they could not.

        However, the way you phrase your question (i.e. "Do they gain anything from hearing your unsolicited, probably bad ideas?") makes me think you're referring to a specific form of criticism which while, granted, is often unhelpful, is not the form most criticism takes.

        Criticism is about the critic sharing their opinions about the piece, not their ideas. Someone suggesting alternative forms the story could/should have taken is generally bad criticism. It looks past what the work is and only focuses on what it could/should be.

        Maybe that's not what you meant, and if so, my apologies. But, if that is the kind of criticism you were referring to, hopefully I could clear up any confusion or frustration about this.
        ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        Just a direct benefit would people who see your criticism and then change because of that, author or not, will then produce more content you want. That's the intended benefit

        I think more people criticise for the emotional catharsis

        Then for some authors any communication is good communication

        Also surely such logic applies to your comment too and mine and all of us here
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        You notice nothing, because no, I didn't. What do I gain from engaging with a work, thinking about it critically, and discussing those criticisms with others? I dunno, pleasure? Engagement? Social interaction with my peers? A possible future world where the work is improved as a result of critical discussion about it?

        Hell, let me turn this one around on you. What do people who want to actually engage with work and discuss it critically gain from you saying "no, criticism is bad. Your ideas are bad. Don't think about or discuss a work. Just consume in silence."? Where do you get off shutting down conversations you don't like? Do you think authors will repay your hard work defending their fragile egos on the internet?

        They will not.
        ```
