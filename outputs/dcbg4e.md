## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

    Even if you're exceptionally strong, you'll need leverage to use that strength, and as the hammer is half your mass you won't be able to provide that much of a counterweight.

    The first image that comes to mind is a caber toss: if the ready position for your hammer is vertical, you'll have gravity on your side and can focus on using your strength to guide its descent onto the monsters. A lunge would require more a shot put motion to push the base of the handle up as it falls. Of course, this will be predictable and leave you vulnerable after dropping the hammer, but you may be able to use your comparative intelligence to control the engagement.

    With two hammers, each twice your weight, I'd imagine this approach is used instead of a heavier single hammer for two reasons: crushing monsters between the two hammers rather than knocking them away with one, and having two counterweights to use to change your position. In this case I'd expect a shift towards having both hammers swinging horizontally instead, although maybe you could use the single hammer technique on alternating sides if you can lift the hammers back into position quickly enough?

    I'd also suggest having a look for games or series that depict similarly absurd weapons, but at the moment the only one that comes to mind is Guts from Berserk and I haven't found a good clip.

    It might also be worth thinking about why hammers are the best weapon to use against the monsters. Maybe they have carapaces that act like plate armour, so slashing and piercing attacks are less effective if you can't aim for the weak points?

        Now I'm thinking about [Super Mario](https://www.mariowiki.com/Hammer) vs Koopa Troopas. :)

    I'm imagining a 6'2" 140 kg bodybuilder, something like Arnold Schwarzenegger with 25% more body mass as pure muscle. With a 70 kg hammer, it's basically the equivalent of swinging an average-weight adult male around, except that all of the weight is on the end of a lever.

    For the sake of being able to maneuver it and actually do damage with it, I hope the hammer is made of some extremely hard and dense metal, like an [osmiridium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmiridium) alloy. That would likely be about twice as dense as lead, and [close to the bulk modulus of diamond](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02417.pdf), so very, very rigid on impact. With something between the density of irridium and osmium, you'd get the required 70 kg mass in a cylinder which is about 11.28 cm in diameter and 31 cm long (shape shown in [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=cylinder+5.64+cm+radius%2C+31+cm+long)), or about 4.4 inches in diameter and almost exactly a foot long.

    I imagine Super Arnold could pick up the 70 kg hammer and lift it above his head without too much difficulty, as even regular Arnold was able to do a [clean and jerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_and_jerk) with 135 kg, and I imagine Super Arnold might be about 35% stronger. Ideally, Super Arnold would probably want to work with a long-handled hammer, likely similar to a [spike maul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_maul). When lifting the hammer from below his waist, he could have his grip in close with his right hand just below the hammer head. Once he reaches eye level, he could orient the hammer vertically, with the hammer head going upward, and then use his left arm to slide the shaft up through his right hand until he reaches about 18 inches of spacing between his hands, with the right hand at eye level. With the hammer raised, he could do a slight tilt backward and then slam it forward with his arms and torso, or possibly lever it over his shoulder for a faster but less powerful swing.

    Against very large monsters, I think the trick would be to try to get a one-shot kill, preferably with a solid blow between the eyes or a sideways impact with the temple. The hammer is likely heavy and rigid enough that a single, swift blow to the head of most creatures, probably even up to the size of elephants, would likely cause enough trauma to result in immediate death from the concussion, or at least loss of consciousness and severe brain damage.

    Two hammers is silly. It would reduce your impact force to potentially less-than-lethal levels, reduce your accuracy with each blow, and force you to use a shorter grip which would significantly reduce your ability to reach the vulnerable points on very tall monsters. You'd be left with a Super Arnold pitifully bashing away at the legs of an elephant before it takes a step forward and tramples him.

    If I have enough strength to still be effective, I wear heavy armour so that I have leverage with which to swing my hammers. My fighting style is probably relatively basic -limited by physics as it is- but I try my best to get the most out of my body and my tools. Think something similar to the idea of baji quan.

  Totally not sure if this is the right thread for this but I have read quite a few well written web serials recently and got inspired to write a few chapters/outlines for a some of my own. Don’t know if I will ever fully write one, as while I have written quite a bit of fan fiction, I’m really not that great of a writer nor can I write fast enough for it to really be worthwhile. But I am practicing and it was surprisingly fun.

  The story is inspired by Yu-gi-oh, Metalocalypse, and Penny Arcade’s paint the line. Where death, intricate conspiracies, destruction, social upheaval, rebellions, and more occur around simple games. All while the games master tries to do everything he can to ensure the games finish with minimal death and destruction.

  But I’m having some trouble with some game strategies and the interplay with the rules. As truthfully, I have an average intelligence and it’s really hard to write a believably intelligent character. In the story there are numerous organizations, people, and governments that do everything they can to win. Some ideas for strategies/games, ways to circumvent the rules, and just general feedback would be appreciated.

  Storyline Outline so far:

  The story takes place in a world similar to our own except for the existence of a very small number of people born with powers that often have strange conditions that can causes its strength to vary wildly. In the past before guns and science, they were the premier players of the world. But in modern times they are seen as little more than occasional scientific curiosities. Most governments give very generous incentives for people to register their powers and beyond a powered person using their power for occasional pranks or the odd crime every few years, they are pretty much ignored. At least until the main character accidently becomes a Super Villain with his power causing worldwide chaos and disruption.

  The main character is a man named Louis (goes by Lou) who is currently suffering from crippling depression and anxiety. He has recently lost his job when his company moved overseas, just lost his beloved niece to cancer, and has a major physical handicap due to an issue with his lungs. Everything changes for him when he discovers he has a superpower.

  Super Power- Bilateral Contract

  Louis can create a projection of himself and anything he is wearing within line of sight. This projection forcibly creates a telepathic link of the people that are directly around it. This link makes it impossible to lie or tell half-truths as people can see each other’s thoughts and feelings. He can only keep the link active for about ten minutes before he gets a massive headache and he will eventually fall unconscious if he keeps pushing things.

  Anyone in this link can come to an agreement or mental contract with each other, which forms a geas on the brains of the participants to give them incentive to follow the contract. It also allows Louis to mentally communicate with and look out the senses of anyone currently under the geas if they are within his line of sight. If a person believes they have broken the contract, everyone under the geas instantly knows about it and they have to suffer a random mental penalty. But to compensate, there is also a random mental benefit you gain as soon as you are put under a geas to encourage the participants to follow the contract. This geas cannot be put on someone who is unwilling to have it. It must be voluntary.

  The punishments are temporary and can include things like blindness, increased sensitivity to pain, severe and uncontrollable muscle tremors, the inability to recognize faces, unusual delusions, and visual/auditory hallucinations. Rewards can include things like enhanced senses, being able to temporarily use bullet time, increased memory recall to the point of mental time travel, a cure for mental disorders, improved learning capabilities, etc. If a person actively hates and fights the geas it only lasts a few weeks but otherwise it can actually last for months and potentially even longer if the person under the geas desires the benefits from staying under it.

  Despite how powerful his ability is and how easily it would make him wealthy, Louis chooses not to register himself as a powered person. He does not like or trust his government and considers them idiots beholden to the rich and immoral corporations. Instead he decides to use his power to try and make himself happy and get over his depression by pushing people into playing games with him. As Louis is a former game designer who used to design board games and he has always been a huge fan of media involving mental battles, unorthodox strategies, and heavily studies game theory.

  He has some fun running a few games but his mental issues make it really hard for him to get out of bed and push himself. So he gets the idea to put a geas on himself. Unbeknownst to him, it greatly ups his power gaining the ability to have anyone who sees his projection come into his telepathic link and the rewards/consequences of the geas are greatly increased including brain damage/death. All of the winners of his games will now gain the ability to put a temporary geas on everyone around them in a very large radius and they can force everyone to follow one rule as long as they themselves follow the same rule. So if they tell someone no running the subject is literally unable to run as long as they do the same thing.

  In the story, one of the winners goes to Washington and forces the rule of always telling the truth, before giving a tip to reporters. A presidential candidate and several senators openly admit to crimes and holding nasty views. The Winner goes online and comes clean about why they did it and surrenders. The media determines with testing that this geas works on a several mile radius and Louis becomes known internationally.

  Shocked, Louis tries to fight the geas he has but fearing it could kill him or worse, decides to keep holding games. He sets up the next game location in a isolated location and hopes that the authorities will stop anyone from going to the game but is utterly shocked when over 40, 000 people show up early to camp out and play from all over the world.

  Louis now realizes he has to hold at least a dozen more games within the year before the geas he has wears off. With what seems like the entire world watching and all kinds of shadowy groups, organizations, and people wanting to play, looking for loopholes, and doing whatever it takes to win.

  Hilarity ensues.

    This sounds brilliant honestly, I could totally see this as an anime.
