    I'm glad to hear the someone does, I was considering asking if I should stop posting them, but instead I shall continue.

      Then, let me add my vote of confidence. As someone who [did it myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/698h61/rt_the_promised_neverland_037/) one week when nobody else did, this story is both entertaining and well within the bounds of rationalesque fiction.

      Edit, except in a new comment to make sure there's a notification:

      Can I humbly request these chapters use the spoiler tag feature, just to hide the thumbnail? Seeing an ultra-low resolution version of the first page is... not a spoiler exactly, but it feels like an annoying head start.

        I'll try to remember to add the spoiler tag in the future. Thanks for the request!

      I wouldn't even know how to find it if you didn't

        You can just look at the website that this is posted from. They have an RSS feed of manga chapters being posted.

  Good heavens, this killer guide dynamic is entertaining to watch. Not just a former villain who is begrudgingly going along with their antics, but who is actively conspiring at all times.

  Other than that, it's interesting to finally see someone with an outside, but in-story perspective confirm that these kids are unnaturally, or at least unnervingly, clever.

  Edit: Actually, I wonder if at some point Emma will be about to die to some danger, the guide refusing to save her, and Ray threatening to shoot himself if Emma dies, forcing him to save her lest he be forced to return without either.
