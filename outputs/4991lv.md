## [RT] [HF] [D] Mother of Learning : Unresolved plot points

### Post:

No, this isn't a new chapter a week earlier than expected. Sorry...

I wanted to discuss what plot points haven't yet been resolved in the book-often when a new chapter comes out it becomes apparent that an innocuous phrase 20 months ago was actually foreshadowing and everyone is like "Of course! How didn't we catch that?". Starting a centralised discussion about this stuff seems like a smart idea.

So, here is what I remember:

* Familiar bonds were mentioned, but Zorian still has no familiar

* Grey hunter was never killed

* Grey hunter eggs were never stolen and nothing was done with them(Silverlake/familiar bond/something else)

* Potion that gives soulsight was not discovered/made/used

* Zorian didn't contact the healer-empath

* Zorian didn't sign an apprenticeship contract with any battlemage

* Time research facility wasn't assaulted yet

* Zorian's brother never made an appearance(the powerful one)

* 3-eyed white wolf hasn't been killed yet

* Zorian still doesn't use firearms(except for that one time he shot RR), even though they were mentioned a bunch of times as a good anti-mage weapon and he even bought a rifle that one time

* Aranea treasury still hasn't been opened

* It was mentioned that Zorian doesn't wake up at the exact start of the time loop, and nothing came of it.

* Obvious stuff that will probably be adressed in the next update:Xvim, memory packet, Mansion and soul vacuum thingy, etc.

Thoughts?

    Unless I've missed something the only Bakora gate under Cyoria is the one the invaders are using, the deep-dungeon facility is entirely separate.

    EDIT: Also, Tinami may have been researching a way to make herself psychic but unless Zorian specifically sets up those conditions again that's been stopped by the loop.

    I think "silent doorway" implies they have a NOT working (i.e. silent) Bakora gate that they revere religiously or have studied a lot or something.

  From the beginning it was made clear that the **planar alignment** is important - the Benisek speech, university got a makeover, the associated party with so many important people present, the mention of mages teleporting a city during previous planar alignment. 

  **The Sovereign Gate** - mentioned by Vani, presumably a metaphor for a previous time loop. Could it be a real physical gate activated at some point by Zach?
  ```

  - u/Ozimandius:
    ```
    Oh the planar alignment I had totally forgotten about. This is especially important when crossed with what Xvim was just talking about last chapter.  He suspects there is an illusion cast on the sky, because a time resetting spell could not possibly include all the stars etc.  But clearly the planar alignment is still happening so the spell should at least include those celestial bodies I imagine.
    ```

    - u/elevul:
      ```
      It probably has a certain degree of flexibility, since if the time loop loops the whole solar system the rest of the stuff remains fairly static since the distances are so big.
      ```

  - u/literal-hitler:
    ```
    It was my understanding that the planar alignment was probably the power source. I mean it could be something else *too,* that sounds like something /u/nobody103 would do.
    ```

    - u/whywhisperwhy:
      ```
      It's mentioned that planar alignments made powerful feats of magic possible (one example was a group of mages who relocated their entire city via teleportation)... I'm with you, I think it's just related to how the time loop got cast, probably not more exciting than that.
      ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  Without re-read I'm going to mention these as well: 

  * Mysterious girl that was in Zach's group with Neolu in restart zero was never mentioned. She may or may be not important... because Zach is a bit of man-whore. But then, restart 0, important.

  * Bully expelled from Zorian's class is never mentioned again. He was from a Noble house and holds a grudge against academy. May be or may be not important.

  * Mystery not resolved: why do certain Ironbeaks hate invaders? This one could be an important clue.

  Of those you mentioned: Damien is an obvious Chekhov's gun. Important. (Or the biggest. Distraction. EVER!). Grey hunter and Siverlake obviously important, doable now, as Zorian has a golem army. Maybe Silverlake will help with soul well thingy. 

  Winter wolf Alpha could lead to winter shifter tribe side quest: shifters don't like winter wolves.

  And I need a re-read to confirm that Zorian checked each and every of his 19 classmates.

    O, right. I would have still expected him to at least give his golems machine guns or something similar.

      Rifle tech is certainly not at this point in MoL. Guns were not actively considered by most military forces until their recent civil war. They have rifles, revolvers and crude cannons and that's it.
      ```

      - u/Jon_Freebird:
        ```
        I don't think that the gun tech level is all that crude, we never get a great description of the rifles but the fact that revolvers exist tells us that they've moved past the point of muzzle loading guns. When considering how to take out the Grey Hunter he thinks about firearms but mentions that the calibre of weapon he'd need is only to be found in military bases and those aren't worth the risk. Whether that means larger calibre weapons or machineguns isn't made clear.
        ```

        - u/MaxMahem:
          ```
          Not that your necessarily wrong, but I'd point out that an intermediate period did exist where we had "muzzle loading" aka "cap and ball" percussion lock revolvers. The earliest Colt revolvers were all of this type and they saw extensive use in the US Civil War. So the existence of revolvers doesn't necessarily have to imply cartridges. That said I do seem to recall the description being cartridge based? I dunno is been a while since I've read that part.

          Edit: Spelling
          ```

          - u/TheAtomicOption:
            ```
            Good point. Another thing to note is that we had cartriges for half a century before we had anything like assault rifles. The first lever actions were in the 1860s and saw some early use in the civil war. Then there were gatling guns that had to be towed around like cannon, the tommy gun was invented after WWI in 1928, but it wasn't until WWII with the StG44 and that we really saw full auto assault rifles. 

            I was kind of imagining The Mother Of Learning to be (stuck?) around 1870-something for mundane military tech, but it's also totally plausible that with magic around they might not follow the exact same order-of-inventions either.

  >Familiar bonds were mentioned, but Zorian still has no familiar

  I don't think Zorian will get a familiar, become a shifter, or undergo any other such process that would mess with his soul. Who knows how soul bonding would affect the marker or the time travel mechanism? It's too much of a risk to take for the benefits of a familiar.
  ```

- u/WarningInsanityBelow:
  ```
  Also how did Zach get his freakish mana reserves and does it relate Zorian's own growth beyond his theoretical maximum? (Zorian thinks its due to him obsessively practising magic missile, but he doesn't have to be right)
  ```

  - u/stalris:
    ```
    To be honest we don't know for certain whether Zach does have such an enormous well of mana, only that Zach can cast magic missiles, flame throwers, etc many times without tiring himself. 

    His ability to repeatedly cast those spells without running dry can be explained by practicing with them so much that they're incredibly mana efficient by now. Zach has spent a ton of time fighting against the invaders and thus has had a lot of practice with those spells. 

    The same thing is happening with Zorian. He's become so proficient with magic missile that he can ["cast around 35 of them in quick succession"](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/46/Mother-of-Learning).

    We also know, at least according to Taiven, that the larger your reserves the less proficient you are with your shaping skills. We could assume that Zach is a freak of nature but it would make more sense if he was just an expert at casting magic missile that it barely consumes any mana for him.

    Sort of explains why Taiven was adamant that no one could cost 200+ magic missiles without losing their ability to shape magic, when Zorian mentioned it in one of the earlier chapters. Apparently no one practices magic missile enough to be able to do such a thing while Zach has had all the time in the world to do so.
    ```

    - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
      ```
      I don't think that Zach's magic missile mastery in chapter 8 is better than Zorian's in chapter 49 since there is no mention of his missiles being nearly invisible (like Zorian can make them). So assuming that by now Zorian is at half his max mana capacity, that would mean that he can cast magic missiles at half the cost he used to. If Zach has the same level of mastery, has twice the natural mana reserves of Zorian and has reached his max mana capacity he should be at about 160 missiles. Quite a bit short of 232, so I think there has to be more going on with his mana reserves.

      The fact that two loopers have been mentioned as having higher than expected mana reserves (and the third is unknown) is really suspicious to me. Maybe the time loop also resets whatever eventually halts natural mana growth, or Zach has some special bloodline/and Zorian inherited a minor version of that.

      Also, Taiven mentions that natural mana capacity growth does not interfere with control.
      ```

      - u/stalris:
        ```
        I think 232 is around the ballpark that you would expect Zach to be able to cast. Kyron's booklet mentioned that most people's maximum is 4 times the amount they started with. Unfortunately we don't know how much more efficient Zorian's magic missile is compared to when he started(since it would be a product of his skill and natural mana growth) but if we assume it's 4 times as efficient then normal people would be able to cast 16 times as many magic missiles than they could initially. 

        For Zach to accomplish 232 and if we assume the above is correct then Zach would have to start with the ability to cast 14 magic missiles in one sitting. If he was truly gifted and could cast 20-30 magic missiles then he wouldn't need as much proficiency as Zorian to achieve the same result.

        The only problem I see with this explanation is that Taiven, who is apparently skilled in combat magic, is shocked at the suggestion that someone could cast 200 of them. Either no one in the entire kingdom has thought to practice magic missile as much as Zorian has(which I find unlikely since someone in the military would have wondered what the limit of magic missile in the hands of an average soldier would be or even a random person's curiosity) or Zorian has an unprecendented amount of control over his mana which I find just as unlikely.

        After all if the average person's magic missile magnitude is ~40 (after maturing) then someone who has practiced with it as much as Zorian would be capable of throwing at least 100 of them, and I wouldn't be surprised if 160 was possible with someone who bothered to practice it just as much as Kyron did. After all Kyron's missile was good enough to be invisible implying that he wasn't wasting any mana to turn it visible instead.
        ```

        - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
          ```
          We can estimate how much more efficient Zorian got at magic missiles: Zorian has been in the loop for a couple of years now, so I assumed that by now he had managed to double his mana capacity (I think I recall him have a capacity of 12 in one of the earlier chapters before he started grinding magic missile, up from 8). So since he can cast 35 magic missiles now, that means he would be casting at about half cost. So if Zach is similarly efficient and has hit his 4 times max mana capacity, that means his starting reserves were (232/2)/4=29. Which seems implausibly high (interpreting 8-12 is usually mana capacity to mean that average is 10 and sigma is 2 would mean that Zach is at 9-10 sigma)
          ```

        - u/Ozimandius:
          ```
          My understanding was that fine control is much more difficult/impossible if you start with more mana reserves.  So since Zach started with more reserves, he cannot gain as much efficiency by fine tuning.
          ```

      - u/Jon_Freebird:
        ```
        I've been wondering for a while whether mana growth might be linked to physical growth, if we assume that physical maturity happens around the early 20's might that be when mana reserve growth stops? If that's the case then Zach and Zorian are both simply growing for much longer. 

        Especially Zach who's been aged 15 for well over a decade and has presumably been using lots of mana on a frequent basis (something that's mentioned as increasing mana growth) the growth would probably be both quick and continuing indefinitely so long as they stay in the loop and stay young.
        ```

    Resource leak maybe?

    Let's say at end of every iteration unused mana reserves are deallocated, and at every restart full mana reserves are allocated.

- u/FiveColorGoodStuff:
  ```
  There's one small thing from the first act that hasn't been resolved.

  In Chapter 13, Zorian tries to levitate Kirielle, but fails. When he discusses this with Ilsa, she tells him that channeling mana through his hands all the time is limiting his shaping abilities, and demonstrates levitation without hands.

  Did Zorian figure out how to shape mana without hands? (EDIT: Apparently so, see below) More importantly, did he ever levitate Kirielle?
  ```

  - u/Putnam3145:
    ```
    > Did Zorian figure out how to shape mana without hands?

    Yes. Chapter 39:

    >Zorian concentrated for a second and pulled at the heavy, metal lined book on the shelf next to him with his magic, not bothering to make a single gesture or hand motion. The book smoothly slid out of its shelf and floated in front of Ilsa, startling her. Before she could say anything, the book opened itself and started turning its pages, slowly at first but then speeding up until the last half of it passed in a blur and the book slammed itself shut. His point made, Zorian smoothly slotted the book back to its previous place on the shelf.
    ```

    - u/FiveColorGoodStuff:
      ```
      Ah, thanks. Must have missed that detail. I guess that he just got too busy to bother pranking Kirielle. I hope he goes through with it at some point!
      ```

      - u/Jon_Freebird:
        ```
        He still might not be capable, Kirielle is going to be considerably heavier than any book and it was specifically mentioned that living things are more difficult to lift.
        Zorian was struggling with a snail when he had no problem with pens or marbles and I imagine they're similar in weight.
        ```

        - u/FiveColorGoodStuff:
          ```
          Yeah, every creature has some "magic resistance" that makes it hard to shape mana on them. But he had trouble with the snail *two to three years ago*, after extensive practice with shaping. He may be able to do it.
          ```

          - u/Jon_Freebird:
            ```
            Right but my point was that just because he's capable of lifting a heavy, inanimate weight doesn't mean he can lift a person of the same weight.

      You're right and so am I. There is a central secure area which has not been opened successfully. This is bound to have something very interesting inside. While the majority of the treasury, including a lot of cash and spell books has been opened and recovered successfully.

  >Grey hunter was never killed

  >Grey hunter eggs were never stolen and nothing was done with them(Silverlake/familiar bond/something else)

  >Potion that gives soulsight was not discovered/made/used

  My suspicion is that Silverlake figured out that Zorian is a time traveller (via casting some sort of powerful divination magic on him when she realized that he knew where her house was). Kael mentioned that there may be alternative ways to gain soul sight, and Silverlake is probably one of the best candidates in the story so far for knowing one of these (along with the lich and the mayor, neither seems hugely likely to talk).

  Some things that point towards Silverlake knowing about the loop: She comments on how long it took Zorian to finds her ingredients (She was expecting him to find them very quickly since she expected him to have done the task before), she was paying attention to whether he possessed skills she would not expect him to have (traditional potion making as opposed to alchemy), and her having an immediate answer to the question of how to convince her the he is a time traveller.

  As to why she wants him to get Grey hunter eggs: I suspect its an ingredient in the alternative soul sight potion. The fact that it would require Grey hunter eggs would explain why Kael wouldn't know about this method (since it is so hopelessly impractical that hardly anyone bothers teaching it).
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    The truth is probably simpler, Silverlake is a bitch. This is kinda confirmed by Lukav (or Alanic?) when Zorian tells him Kael recommended her as well, reaction was "Kael recommended *her*? LOLWTF good luck with that, boy"

    This is further confirmed by the fact that if Silverlake knows about time loop then she has zero motivation to ask Zorian anything, as all his gifts will be rendered useless by the loop. Unless she is a looper, she knows Zorian milks her for knowledge and then never shows at her doorstep again, at least while the loop exists. 

    Preemptively going for something that will help Zorian makes her an altruist... An altruist that is quite abrasive at the same time. My judgement: she is just a bitch.
    ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    I think that "Silverlake is kind of a cunt" is a better fit for the observable evidence so far, but it's an intriguing idea.

    - u/WarningInsanityBelow:

      That is definitely also true.

- u/hoja_nasredin:
  ```
  I'm waiting for the chapter where they will talk to the lich and find an agreement with him.


  How come no ne mentioned the idea that the time loop is started by hidden research facility that plays with time?

  They are the most likely candidates.

  * Will Zorian's ability to cast invisible magic missiles come in handy at a crucial time?
  * Will Zorian pick up Estin's ability to move earth?
  ```

  - u/Jon_Freebird:

    I don't think Zorian is able to replicate Estins ability as it's an inborn trait just like Zorians mind magic.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Nah; he could replicate it with extensive shaping exercises. I think he mentioned that. It probably won't be as controlled or detailed as Estin's, but it is possible. Similar to how Xvim can get a watered down version of Zorian's mind magic with enough practice.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        Actually, Xvim just might have the shaping exercises for that.
        ```

      - u/Jon_Freebird:
        ```
        Oh, sure it's possible to replicate with shaping exercises but I suspect it'd cost much more mana for Zorian than it does for Estin.
        ```

- u/LesserWrong:
  ```
  I don't remember Zorian ever stating that he's asexual, but he's spent a long number of years without a girlfriend or romantic relationship.

  *edit*
  Oh yeah, he used to be into Tavian! Why isn't he putting effort into that?
