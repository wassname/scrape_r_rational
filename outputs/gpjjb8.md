  I suppose Turry made sure Russel and Pops would be there to explain to her, as soon as she is ready. But still, it seems like we missed a conversation leading up to this event.

  Turry, you're being mean. Just what game are you playing with that girl?

  Hoping for some big reveal from Pops.

    I don't think it's playing a game; I think the grandfather has set up a dead zone around his house.
    ```

      That would imply a pretty impressive amount of control over Turry. But in that case I think Turry would have warned her before.
