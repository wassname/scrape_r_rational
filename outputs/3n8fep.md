## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Man, I know it's totally within the scope of this subreddit, but I've been feeling a bit grumpy about the uptick of brainstorming threads or question threads. We have tons of space since this is a small subreddit so I don't really mind, BUT STILL. Don't expect downvotes from me for this kind of thread, but don't expect upvotes either. As a general rule, I upvote almost all fiction linked/posted here in order to encourage authors.

    I'm mostly upset by the *lazy* brainstorming/question threads. If you want to *actually* brainstorm, I think there's some onus on you to do the legwork first and give something for people to bouncing ideas off of. If it's just "Rational _____?", I tend to downvote those threads for their laziness. But if it's something like ... I don't know, getting someone to double-check your logic, point out something obvious you might have missed, get advice on storytelling, then I tend to think that's a lot better.

    (Obviously I would prefer for the story to be fully written and the advice to be given after the fact, but getting advice after the fact increases the total workload because it involves both writing and editing instead of just writing correctly the first time.)

      I have enjoyed BST threads where there's a decent amount of legwork by the author or it's about a specific enough topic. Lazy BST or question threads are the worst though. I like to be entertained or to have a lively discussion here.

        I regard most low-effort posts as clutter, and as a class I'd like to see less of them. So while I'll upvote a link to a story that's even mildly good and rarely downvote one, I'll downvote basically any "Rational X" posts or similar whose premise and comments I don't immediately find interesting.

  I recently read Scott Hawkins' first novel, the Library At Mount Char. It's the best SF&F first novel I can remember since Clarke's Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. Thanks to Nostalgebraist on tumblr for the rec.

  The story is about a library that contains all the secrets and knowledge of the world, and a power struggle over it. The head of the library is ancient and seems immortal, but has now disappeared. This immortal raised a dozen orphan children and trained them all in the various arts the library contains such as medicine that allows true resurrection and languages of all of mankind as well as things like animals; and these characters, now in their thirties, are having to cope with leaving the library.

  The novel is really exceptionally written and paced, and contains a lot of great humor. Also, very well written character interactions. Not for the faint of heart, though - it gets quite dark and disturbing a number of times.

  Just a really wonderfully written novel, a strong recommendation. Not really rationalist in any way, so I waited to this off-topic thread to recommend it here.

  Hawkins' description of the evolution of the title is amazing:

  > I've found that a good way to get myself moving is to take the most ridiculous phrase I can come up with and try to write a book around that. For comparison, the working title of The Library at Mount Char was The Library at Mt. Sammich. In case you're wondering, the 'Library' part of the story came easily enough, but I had to really work to get the 'Mt. Sammich' part to fit. Ultimately the good folks at Crown decided "Sammich" had a misleading ring, so it got changed. For the record, I'm amazed that title made it as far as it did.

    I put the likelihood as "high", assuming that society continues to function more or less the same.

    Colonization killed a lot of languages. Globalization is killing a lot more. The reason we had so many languages in the past is that people were spread far apart and couldn't communicate with each other, which meant that language drift happened. Now, with the internet in play and increased connectivity, it seems like the pressures are all in place for languages to compete with each other until only one is left.

    Language seems to me to be a sort of natural monopoly; it's more efficient if everyone is speaking the same one. Languages can only really specialize with regards to *culture* now that geography is largely not an issue, because languages are too mutable to be missing vital features for long. There will still be *dialects*, *shifts*, and *jargon* but a single common standard is so beneficial that we're naturally going to shift to a single one, even without government intervention.

    In my opinion, never. I live in India where speaking superior English gets me called a 'Britisher'(angrezi) and a betrayer of our glorious culture.  

    Simultaneously there's an entire industry which thrives on this insecurity that most people here feel towards their inferior English. I can walk across the street and see at least two English coaching centers, these are the places that source your typical Indian call center support.  

    There's a few fringe elements that exploit people's pride in their local languages
    [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h5KzWac0_E). To say that these people reject English would be an understatement. But, and this is my personal observation, unless you know English in India, your career is fucked.  

    Personally, I wish I knew no other language than English. Because knowing local languages (I know 3 others) has messed up my accent and changes the way [I think](http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/papers/mandarin.pdf). Indian languages are usually a mish-mash of the actual language and English itself and most have maybe 400-500 words in their spoken form.

    > What does anyone think of the likelihood of there one day being a global language? 

    Roughly equal to the likelihood of the internet staying intact.  I think the internet and other global communications being destroyed would be the only thing that could really stop the possibility of a global language.  I guess one other scenario that could happen would be if permanent space colonies were developed prior to the full emergence of a global language.  Then the lightspeed delay might create enough separation in communication to allow new dialects and words to develop faster than they can spread.
    ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    I sincerely doubt that we'll ever have a single language. The reason is because languages are kinda like animal species in the sense that it's subject to evolution. Languages are constantly changing, growing, and shrinking all the time. The massive die-out of languages today is due to how globalization has forced the multiple languages to "compete" for speakers (think of languages as competing memes where there's not enough space for them all). Just like how when humans first traveled to new places on the globe and caused massive extinctions, so did English kill off foreign languages when it first spread to new places.

    I predict that we'll reach some equilibrium in the number of languages present, and then new languages will start appearing again (probably some Internet-based languages or people will start emphasizing corporate loyalty and everyone will be speaking Pepsinese, Coca-colian, or McDonaldian).

      *HAHAHAHAHA!*

      I'm not laughing at you but rather how I used to think the same thing.

      So far machine translation is at the stage where computers are really good at translating words and phrases, but they can't really do a very good job with longer sentences or idioms. The best I have seen in machine translation so far is in Google who has so much data to throw at the problem that it works but it's not feasible for translating between two languages that aren't already extensively recorded online.

      Granted there are amazing things happening in the field as we get better and better at handling large amounts of data and working with neural networks, but there's a reason why some people (nowadays? or used to?) think machine translation is equivalent to true AI.

        The question is not whether "true" machine translation is AI-complete.  *Perfect* machine translation is probably superintelligence-complete, because *translations are innately imperfect*, so you'd need something with extremely thorough knowledge of multiple languages and cultures to do perfect, professional-quality translation that lets consumers of the translated product really experience all the depth and nuance that went into the original piece.

        The question is *how good* you can make your machine translation *without* superhumanly well-cultured AI.  It's entirely possible that we can get "90% effective" machine translation with 30% the statistical/cognitive machinery of a real brain.

    ```
    White bisexual trans female, apparent male. Arizona. I was raised as a nondenominational Protestant. I was also raised as a science-lover, my biggest influence being Douglas Hofstadter.

    Previously I saw Christianity as having a God-directed mission, and I was wondering why Christians didn't act consistently with moral duties laid out in the bible. At the same time, I was learning more and more science, and some moral philosophy. Evolution was never discouraged in our household, though I opposed it in middle school because it threatened my worldview. With some help from atheist writings, including Common Sense Atheism, I eventually learned what evolution was, learned what the problem of evil was, and the entire secular, empirical side of my life clicked into place and simply squashed my religious upbringing.

    I have always been interested in AI research, and motivated thinking prevented me from really seeing AI safety as a problem. I dismissed the question of malice naturally, and at the same time I did not think value alignment was a problem, because AIs could approximate human value systems, and people have never tried or wanted to take over the world or anything. Continued exposure to MIRI's research, the Sequences, and Eliezer's deprecated publications (General Intelligence and Seed AI, Creating Friendly AI, Coherent Extrapolated Volition), convinced me that AI safety *was* a serious problem, and that I had been wanting all along to build a gun without a handle.

    My primary goal is to live as long as I like in a body I enjoy. This is contingent on safe AI. I was previously somewhat scornful of MIRI's research, even (especially) after I became convinced that AI safety was a problem, because all of their publications focus on incomputable agents. Then a friend reminded me that publishing research on bounded agents destroys the world. This makes me wonder if MIRI has a section of unpublished research purely for internal use. This makes me want to join MIRI.

    I don't think I can join MIRI.

    I am nearly twenty, and I feel old. Time is speeding up, and I can't keep the pace. I find it extremely hard to hold focus on one project for over two weeks, and my interests constantly cycle without ever progressing. Writing, AI, games, writing, AI, games. There are programmers I follow who are more capable than me, and I think one might be younger. I see the kind of people who *do* join MIRI, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and I wonder why I ever thought I could slack off in high school. I am constantly masculinizing, and I hate the shape of my body. I have no job. I can't drive. I'm going to community college, taking more classes than I think I can handle in order to avoid being forced to *get* a job, and I'm wasting time not studying math and computer science this semester. I'm isolated from people I know offline, and I don't have the social skills to make new friends even if I managed to find people I thought could stand me. I'm worried that all of the tests I've taken since kindergarten were wrong, and that I can't hack it in STEM. I have had these thoughts and problems continuously, even when I was on antidepressants, and I'm worried that they're right despite my depression, and that I will never get past them. I don't want to die, but I would sacrifice my life as it is to improve the chances of eutopia for the rest of the world. I just want to be told what to do. I can't handle this social, emotional bullshit.

          You can outsource part of PtV. Having depressed thoughts even on antidepressants is pretty normal; you not only need to stop abnormal brain chemistry, you also need to stop engrained neuronal connections. 

          For this reason I'd recommend seeing a therapist, or read a few self-help books... Have a look at http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/

      > I'm isolated from people I know offline, and I don't have the social skills to make new friends even if I managed to find people I thought could stand me.

      I can't help with the rest but this bit here at least is something you can mostly solve with [properly applied learning.](http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/best-social-skills-books) Social skills are called skills because they can be learned and practised. In fact, I would call it a rather important thing to do because social skills improve ones life in multiple non-obvious ways.

    I was introduced to rationality by HPMOR, and it hooked me. Having new and better ways to communicate and debate are absolutely some of the most useful things I've ever learned. However, I live in a rural community, so I haven't ever actually had another person to discuss things rationally with.

      I have had a few thoughts about this lately, actually. I think the reason so many good scientists are Jewish is because of the way Judaism works, specifically due to the fact that Talmudic interpretation is a process that nearly everyone is at least a little involved in and requires one to read a source, coherently understand it, and extrapolate from that. Essentially, for hundreds of years, being a "good jew" required being able to think about rules and figuring out ways to accomplish what you want without breaking them, which is exactly what science does.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It's probably also a historical coincidence that Jews were feeling a scrappy need to move up in the world at just about the time when being a scientist was a good way to do so.  Now that American Jews are more assimilated (which, admittedly, would affect both cultural hypotheses and material-conditions hypotheses), they're going into science less often.  Secular Israeli society still produces disproportionately many scientists, though.

    I'm a 25 year old male software engineer living in Silicon Valley. Except for my ethnicity (Korean / Iranian) I'm pretty close to the typical rationalist demographically speaking. I grew up in an upper-middle-class household in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. I'm college-educated.

    My parents are electrical engineers and one is a tech entrepreneur. They are atheists from religious backgrounds. I was raised without any particular religious tradition. Though we celebrated the usual Christian things-- Christmas, Easter, etc-- I was never told God was real. It wasn't until I was 10 that I realized my peers and extended family thought of God as a thing that actually exists. My parents vote for Democrats for a variety of pragmatic reasons. My religious and political beliefs are suspiciously similar to my parents', though I think these beliefs are correct anyways.

    I was introduced to rationality many years ago while reading the blog at [Marginal Revolution](http://marginalrevolution.com/). Tyler Cowen would occasionally link to or debate with another blogger, his coworker Robin Hanson at [Overcoming Bias](http://www.overcomingbias.com/). I read a few other blogs and found the movement generally interesting, though outside of a few places (like here, at r/rational) I haven't felt any desire to engage with people at length.

    White heterosexual male. 28, Small town in Southern Indiana. Extended family is Christian while I'm agnostic in theology and Secular Humanism in a more practical sense.

    I've got about 6 years of college in my past though no degree. Did three years of random courses to no actual degree before a bunch of life stuff came up.

    Did another 3 years towards Sociology with a focus on the statistics side of things before a bunch of real life stuff came up.

    From working odd and end jobs over the years and having little in the way of actual wants I've got a low five figure amount of money saved up and live in a family members antique.

    I have a brain state that I find odd in that I have little in the way of wants or desires. I believe, despite having a reasonably large spending pool and very little in the way of life expenses due to my situation, that I've spent less than $300 on anything that wasn't a need in the past year. Similarly, I have no need for external human contact and spend most of my time reading fiction, non-fiction, or learning whatever random subject interests me.

    I wager my life expectancy is dependent on how long I have a family member willing / able to shelter me from the requirement to pay to live.

      It's easily one of the most advantageous career choices to go for, if you don't happen to have career goals beyond, "It's indoor work with no heavy lifting, they'll pay nicely for it, and people will consider me a Respectable Member of Society."  It also fits *very* nicely with certain incentives people deal with these days, such as more traditional Respectable Professions like law or medicine carrying heavy burdens of student debt; finance, consulting, and management being founded around elite cliques; and Generic White Collar Employees slowly ceasing to exist.

      If you have an analytical turn of mind, don't want to spend more than 3-4 years in school, don't want to take on slave-labor or heavy debts at the beginning of your career (or want to be able to pay them off reasonably), and want to make a living with your analytical turn of mind, software engineering is a good choice.

        Eaturbrainz is correct. I think if you're able to be an engineer of any sort, that's often a safe, solid choice for a career and does not require an expensive graduate degree. Being a software engineer has lower entry requirements than other forms of engineering, like electrical engineering. 

        I wonder if it's something where being a rationalist helps one make this sort of decision, or if being the sort of person who makes this kind of decision makes one likely to seek out rationalism. I imagine it's more of the latter and less of the former.

          Remember when you were choosing a course? Everyone seemed to be picking things based on what sounded cool and you were just sitting there thinking 'you're going to work at tescos scanning baked beans, none of these courses lead to actual jobs'. Everyone else was deciding based on thing that didn't feel like logic, but you couldn't tell them otherwise because it felt like you were insulting their free spirit or whatever.

  So. [Undertale](http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/). It's pretty much my favorite game ever, beyond any shadow of a doubt.

  It's a deconstruction of traditional RPGs and video games in general. While you're given the option to fight monsters, the game tacitly encourages you to use MERCY -- talking things out with monsters in order to avoid killing them. Whether you choose MERCY or to FIGHT everything you come across vastly affects whether the game is a lighthearted, heartwarming (and heartbreaking) adventure or whether the game will treat you like the genocidal scum you play at being. 

  It is entirely possible to get through the entire game without killing a single monster.

  The humor, to me at least, was top notch -- though YMMV on that -- if you enjoy either Earthbound or Homestuck humor, you'll probably enjoy this. And on the topic of Homestuck, the creator, Toby Fox, is one of the musicians for it, and it shows in this game; the music is exceptional, and so is the story. Most of the soundtrack is available at his [bandcamp](https://tobyfox.bandcamp.com/), excepting a few more spoilery songs.

  I really enjoyed Undertale and it's left me a tearful mess the last few weeks.

  Let's say you meet a real-life Scooby-Doo (not the character, but a talking Great Dane) and the dog then leads you into witnessing a nasty real-life supernatural event such as watching a ghost-like figure made of ectoplasm possessing a man and attempting to kill the man through suicide as revenge. How would you react?

  Assume you were convinced of the supernatural, what would you do?

  EDIT: For anyone who's curious why I'm doing this, I'm thinking of writing some rationalist Scooby-Doo fanfiction for RaNaNoRiMo and I wanted the instinctive reactions of bystanders when they meet Scooby-Doo and see the (seemingly) supernatural events all of a sudden.

      Actually, I want as little restriction on my creativity as possible when it comes to the world-building so all I'm going to be using is the characters of Shaggy, Scooby, Velma, Daphne, and Fred. Otherwise, I'll be coming up with the setting all by myself.

      I'm veering towards having the supernatural be a real thing, but where the Mystery gang are dealing mostly with normal people in a monster get-up. It would partially explain why there's never any actual authorities to investigate. They're too scared or incapable of handling the supernatural and whenever there's a possibility of the supernatural, everyone steers clear. The Masquerade is partially maintained through willful ignorance and it's more common than not for people to have had a supernatural encounter or to know someone who has 'disappeared'. Therefore, the Mystery gang are often the only ones actually willing investigate and stop people using the possibility of the supernatural as a threat. Of course, it helps that they are better prepared than the average individual if it turns out to be a genuine supernatural event...

      Scooby-Doo talks because....well....I'm actually spoiled for choice on what to go with. Telepathy with only the group, failed possession by ghost granting speech, a friend cursed into the form of a dog, spiritual connection granting the ability to communicate with any living creature, or even a dog-shaped eldritch abomination who was the first supernatural encounter/monster who they beat and bound into servitude. The last one is really tempting and I think I might have him only speak in words starting with the letter R as part of the **Rules** he follows as part of his unnatural nature.

      Also, cursed monster costumes would explain why so many weekly-villains will be such perfect actors. Seriously, they will act so much like an actual animal/beast/monster that one would swear that they were really monsters.

    >  I wanted the instinctive reactions of bystanders when they meet Scooby-Doo and see the (seemingly) supernatural events all of a sudden.

    So first just addressing meeting a talking dog, before I run into any supernatural stuff.  Hmm... is this set in the modern day?  I would google for talking dog if I didn't already know about talking dogs... actually how would the existence of talking dogs play out?

    Possibility 1) In this universe, maybe talking dogs are actually a rare, but scientifically known thing?  I mean Scooby has relatives that can talk, right?  Maybe in-universe a breed of dogs was breed to be sapient.  In this counter-factual universe, I would be a vegetarian if there wasn't know to be massive neuro-anatomical or neuro-biological differences between this talking dog breed and other dogs (I would interpret it as evidence that dogs, and animals in general are much closer to human level of sapience).  I would excited to meet a talking dog in person, but I would try not to be too awkward or weird about it.  My googling (or maybe asking reddit for advice if I have time) would let me know how to interact in a polite way with a non-human sapient.

    Possibility 2) Talking dogs aren't known in universe.  I would be expecting it to be a prank or surrealist art or something weird like that.  If I can rule out these possibilities, then I get suspicious of some weird possibilities.  I would google search for Scooby... if I found evidence that Scooby and his talking relatives were scientifically known, I would be highly puzzled why they aren't famous... I might expect some kind of conspiracy or mass mind manipulation.  If Scooby is entirely unknown to the internet and society, then I really expect some form of mind-manipulation.  Once I see other supernatural stuff, I am going to be almost sure of some kind of [masquerade](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade).  I would be expecting the Scooby gang or government agents to try to wipe my memory when this was done.  They are probably used to people trying to resist, so I will only put up a believable token resistance, and then leave myself hidden messages according to plans I have worked out ahead of time.

    If I can make it through everything without getting my mind wiped or any other thing to make me ignore it, either Randi (assuming he is not in on the conspiracy/masquerade  also), or I am probably going to heavily pursue occult knowledge/power.  Depending on what type of time commitment and skill set developing magical knowledge/skill requires.  I might give up working on my PhD and try to find a job that will pay enough to get by and have flexible enough hours so I can work on studying magic more.

      Thanks! In the Scooby-Dooverse I'm imagining, strange things are extremely common and the people in the know attempt to disguise it by manufacturing entirely different, yet also weird events to minimize accurate knowledge spreading.

      So many people would be aware that something weird is happening but it's dangerous to get involved, and they all live in a culture where it's normal to ignore it (like how Japanese society will ignore people not acting appropriately (not sure how accurate this is, but something similar is what I'm going for)).

      So your reaction from possibility #1 is very helpful.

        More brainstorming on the talking dog thing: I would imagine there would be subreddit or two devoted to talking dogs.  Maybe some tumblr hashtags for talking dog rights?  It would be kind of a fringe social issue.  Religious nuts would deny talking dogs' rights, while more liberal religions would treat them as a target for evangelism.  

        > So many people would be aware that something weird is happening but it's dangerous to get involved, and they all live in a culture where it's normal to ignore it 

        I can imagine getting excited about witnessing the supernatural, then going on reddit and finding a subreddit where people are discussing similar things, only to find that there experiences are ignored by most people around them and that I am now statistically at risk for dying in a supernatural event.

        >  strange things are extremely common and the people in the know attempt to disguise it by manufacturing entirely different, yet also weird events to minimize accurate knowledge spreading.

        I think that will be a really clever and original take on the whole masquerade thing.

          > I think that will be a really clever and original take on the whole masquerade thing.

          Thanks I'm really proud of it. I just asked myself, "If in that movie, it's really obvious that magic exists with the wizards flinging spells in broad daylight and yet people are still ignorant, what could explain this effect without using any magic?"

          From there I came up with either fear/caution of getting involved with high dangerous activities, knowledge it exists but there's no reliable information, or some souped-up Bystander Effect ingrained into the culture itself. Of course, why use only one method to maintain the masquerade when you can use them all!

          > I would imagine there would be subreddit or two devoted to talking dogs.

          There's a lot of causes/subreddits for the more benign and minor supernatural stuff, but they rarely get anywhere since a lot of people are just running some sort of financial scams, deliberate misleading groups by those in the know, and monsters deliberately tend to prey on groups like that. Of course when the Internet went down permanently, such groups dissolved.

          However, while they lasted there was a large number of groups where one could learn the right things quickly enough (and caused the monsters to focus attacks on the communications systems) and that's how I imagine Velma getting a lot of her encyclopedic knowledge from and giving the gang a nice initial boost in experience to survive the initial unlucky occurrences.

    *This is advice from a real female* 

    People are varied and there is a wide spread of personalities across both genders. Treat all your characters as if they are supposed to be people, not stereotypes. Write your female characters the same as you would your male characters.

    Speaking as a women pursuing a degree in computer engineering, I don't really feel the gender disparity. I *notice* stereotypes and social conventions but then I choose to do my own thing. I notice that there are five other girls in a class of thirty (the only reason I notice is because everyone makes a big stink over women in STEM), and then I move on. I don't behave differently in classes with different gender ratios. Most of the differences I see between me and my classmates I chalk up to personality differences, not gender differences. People are People.

  Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson -- who did a better Joker?

  (Definition of "better" deliberately left vague.)

  I'll start:

  Jack, all the way. First, his makeup was more true to the character. Second, he had the whole "psychotic clown" thing down, whereas Heath did "psychotic" but not "clown."  Look at the art museum scene with Jack, his mooks, and Kim as an example of why I think Jack was better at "psychotic clown."

  People always hype the Wheel of Time series, so I thought I'd give it a try. Got 3/4 into the first book and just gave up. It's just so... stereotypical? Obvious? Tropey? Was all this stuff fresh and new when it first came out?

  The characters annoy me. Small Town McDestiny is incapable of following basic instructions (What's that? You're in a ruined haunted city and the wizard lady has told you not to go wander? Better go wandering!). Wizard Lady is incapable of giving proper instructions and basic pattern recognition (What's that? You want McDestiny to stay close? Better give some vague and cryptic warning instead of actually telling him any actionable facts. Like, said, you could mention that you've warded the room and smoke demons will try to eat him if he leaves it. Seems like the kind of thing you'd want to know.). Missy Manhater I assume is supposed to be a strong female character, but her defining traits seem to be bigotry with a side of sexism rounded off with a dollop of stubbornness. 

  Now, I wouldn't care about this. I'd just brush it off as and move on. I read worse things often enough and they don't bug me at all, but everyone keeps talking like this book is some fantastic classic on the level of aSoIaF and such and I just don't get it. What am I missing here. Does it suddenly improve?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I had more or less the same experience with *Wheel of Time* and was similarly puzzled. The books came out in 1990, so it can't really be that they were doing anything *new*, since so many series predate it.

    Here are my twin explanations:

    1. While it wasn't doing anything too terribly new, it caught a generation of fantasy readers at just the right time. Let's say that you're born in 1975. The first book comes out when you're 15. It's entirely possible that this is among the first fantasy books that you read. So you don't really know the cliches, you don't really care about the places where it's uneven, it fires your imagination.
    2. The series is long, so people have buy-in. I have long had the theory that even if quality is low (something I'm not really ready to say about *Wheel of Time*, even if the first book didn't do it for me) you can make up for it with length. There's some sort of literary Stockholm Syndrome thing that goes on if someone is a million words in. So *Wheel of Time* is long and builds up credit by being long.
