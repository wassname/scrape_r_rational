## Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary is a masterpiece.

### Post:

I loved The Martian and thought Artemis was...okay.

Project Hail Mary is excellent. Much more similar to The Martian, but with some fantastic differences. It's some of the best, hardest sci-fi I've read in a long time. I haven't finished it just yet but...do yourself a favor and pick it up if that's your kind of thing.

Edit: I finished it. Fantastic. Definitely stand by my recommendation.

If you do like The Martian, (and/or Project Hail Mary) may I also recommend Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke and Seveneves by Neil Stephenson. One thing I like about all of these books is that the antagonist isn't some inexplicably evil person or entity, it's just the universe. The drama derives far less from people being bitchy and far more from situational problems that the protagonists have to solve with science, creativity, trust and teamwork.

(There is a fair bit of human-derived drama in Seveneves, but it's still secondary to the actual problem around which the book centers.)

    >!I liked it, read it too instead of sleeping. The solution is easily guessable, natural predators are a very common solution to runaway replication. I wonder if with the same infrastructure used for Hail Mary! they could just get artifical suns online? Astrophage makes for bright lamps.  Interestingly enough just recently  I read this  podcast transcipt https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/david-denkenberger-allfed-and-feeding-everyone-no-matter-what about feeding the world in case of nuclear winter. Oddly applicable here.!<

      ```
      >!I don't think artificial suns would work to solve the global cooling problem. The way they enrich their astrophage is by having it absorb sunlight. Having it release that energy later is a net zero. You could use astrophage as a grow lamp in a greenhouse or something like that, but it's not clear that this is easier than getting the energy from solar panels.!<

      >!If you set up infrastructure to collect the astrophage migrating towards Venus and return it to Earth on a massive scale, that could solve global cooling but would be far beyond the tech used in the book.!<

  Yes! I just finished it myself, and I loved the martian too, but my favorite thing about PHM is its basically and galactic buddy cop movie with a bunch of science thrown in.

  Serious spoilers below, do not read if you haven't finished

  >!Rocky and Grace's banter while they investigate astrophage, tau ceti, adrian, and taumeoba felt like a super fresh take on the classic buddy cop plot. Ryland is such an endearing character, and Rocky is the most lovable blind musical spider thing ever. I also really love that for a "first contact" story, it didn't both doing all the usual first contact bullshit... they both decided to trust each other from the get go, and it made for a much more enjoyable story. I think there's actually a framework to develop subsequent books off this foundation too. Using astrophage for interstellar travel, Ryland communicating with earth the let them know he survived and lives on an alien planet, Rocky and Ryland searching for life around other stars around the tau cluster, or even just "fixing" the other infected stars with more taumoeba, watching the Eridian society develop as they master electronics and computers. There is so much potential here.!<

  I hope Weir gets another movie deal out of this because I think if done well it could be an incredible story on the big screen; actually, a 6 or 8 part mini series might be better so they don't have to trim stuff out
  ```

  - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
    ```
    >!I was thinking the same thing. This could potentially make a better movie than The Martian, I think, since it's really hard to film a solitary character on their own in an interesting way--but two? Way easier. Plus, there's more visually exotic stuff going on with Rocky and his tech to work with.!<

    >!Not only that, but I love the idea of an interstellar species that just got lucky with an incredible materials technology and consequently never had to work very hard on science in other areas--"Quantum what? Nah, man, we just strapped some Astrophage tanks to the back of our unobtanium party barge, hauled it up the space elevator and flew it to another star. Hey, have you noticed that there's something fucky about the speed of light?"!<

    >!I would love to see more in this universe. I don't think it makes sense for Ryland's story to continue; perhaps a brief cameo at most. He's kinda old for space travel by the end (53) and fragile due to high gravity. His character arc was given a proper end. Exploring Eridian society from a human's point of view would also be problematic since everything is in complete darkness and in a hot crushing atmosphere.😬!<

    >!I am super curious about the Eridians but also about what exactly happened on Earth. Though I'm also afraid that what happened on Earth was ugly despite humanity surviving and recovering in the end.!<

    Funny, the banter was my last favorite part, to put it mildly. When Rocky is suddenly talking  just like a typical marvel bro at the end... it made me physically cringe. 

    I feel the current state of dialogue is similar to the '90s and early 2000s where everybody was copying Tarantino's style, only with marvel/whedon-esque banter instead. Most books or movies nowadays have this tonal disconnect where people are flippantly humorous in the middle of tense and dramatic situations.

    "Uh, did you just shoot me in the spleen? I was using that!" Kill me, please. 

    It feels like our civilization was stealthily taken over by a cabal of hack writers and they've been slowly erasing the very concept of "cliche" and "hack line" from the collective consciousness.

  Whaaat I had no idea he put out a new book!

  I love the Martian but my favorite story of his is a short story called  The Egg

  http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html

  It takes like two minutes to read - you could describe it as a ~~rationalist~~ cool take on Hinduism. Its a really fascinating premise that has gone a long way towards making me even more empathetic.

    I honestly can't remember if I read this before, and it bothers me a bit because I had a similar idea before, except for the "becoming a god" thing, and now I'm not sure if it was original or came from this. Not to say that I believe this is reality, but this was my favorite answer to theodicy after reading unsong, partly inspired by that "one-electron universe" idea. It answered two of my core issues with the world cleanly: the limitation on experience people have due to mortality, and the amount of evil perpetrated by other people, as a single-soul universe has exactly balanced karma.

  I picked it up on your recommendation, and enjoyed it very much! Thanks for posting about it! I started reading it around 10pm, had to force myself to go to sleep at 2:30, and finished it the next day.

  I'll throw my hat on the 'hard recommend' side for anyone on the fence. (Enjoyed The Martian, never tried Artemis due to reviews.)
  ```

- u/Cool-Eh:
  ```
  Yes, yes, yes! I came here to find people who love this book and I am not disappointed!

  I loved The Martian (Like, literally my favourite book I have ever read) thought Artemis was good. I decided when I first heard about Project Hail Mary I would want it so when the release day cam I bought an ebook without reading the back flap or anything. I basically just knew it was a space book, "the fate of humanity rests on a lone astronaut" or whatever.

  This book was amazing! I have been recommending it constantly to all my friends for the last week and I barely slept one night I was so engrossed reading it.

  - u/Aretii:

    Just finished. Relevant data: I really liked the Martian and also could not get more than a few chapters into Artemis. I quite liked this one, though. Very reminiscent of the Martian in its basic loop (problem -> do mad science to it -> new problem caused by mad science), but with unique wrinkles of its own.

    It’s better than Artemis

  The biggest disappointment in Artemis was the lack of discussion of the effect that gravity has on prayer. Are prayers conical, or is it a ray? These are the questions left unanswered.
  ```

  - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
    ```
    Given that terrestrial Muslims don't pray on inclined planes facing varying degrees of down, we can infer that prayer particles ("orations") can't penetrate the Earth's crust but *can* undergo atmospheric reflection similar to certain radio frequencies. This makes Lunar Salaat problematic since A) the earth will be blocking line-of-sight to Mecca about 50% of the time and B) the very ionosphere which helps propogate the signal on earth could interfere with it from space, even when you *can* see the Arabian Penensula.

  One question I had 

  >!Surely the astrophage only takes over a star if there is a nearby planet with a CO2 atmosphere, otherwise they cannot breed. Does this imply that \*all\* nearby stars have such a planet? Seems quite unlikely.!<

  >!Also why he didn't send back at least one Beatle when they first achieved Venus-friendly astrophage makes zero sense to me. They do not have spare time, and frankly something could have gone wrong at any point!!<
  ```

  - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
    ```
    >!I don't know how unlikely it is that planets with CO₂ would exist in most solar systems, but it does occur to me that in order for a Dyson swarm of single-celled organisms to absorb even 1% of a stars output, their combined mass must be enormous. How much carbon are they taking from Venus? Seems like it'd run out rather quickly...!<

    >!As for why he didn't send a Beatle back immediately, I can kind of see it. packaging the Taumoeba was ultimately pretty difficult, and if you were a relatively short time from having an even more resistant strain I probably would've waited, too.!<
    ```

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    Grace explains it: he wanted to wait before sending the Beetles as long as possible, because they kinda suck at space travel, and the later they are sent (and thus, shorter their trip) the greater their chances.
    ```

  - u/RonnieSchnell:
    ```
    >!It also annoyed me that he didn't send some back right away (When he got to 2% N2).  I mean, he had already been okay with a suicide mission, so the prime directive should have been to get some back.  But later I decided it was a good thing he didn't because it might have already been able to get through xenonite by then, and he wouldn't have known.!<

  Seconding Rendezvous with Rama. There’s a few weak points, if I remember correctly, but overall very good. Apparently the sequels are terrible though - written by a different author, too.
  ```

- u/Juul:
  ```
  It is very similar in style to The Martian but because it concerns itself quite a bit with things that are more just fiction than actual science-based fiction it's not as interesting. The Martian was an interesting story where you learned a lot about Mars and what it would take for humans to exist there. This story is like that but with a fraction of the learning about anything real.
  ```

  - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
    ```
    I see where you're coming from, but I think I disagree. Yes, the premise of PHM is a lot further outside the bounds of known science--it's a lot more speculative--but I think it depends on what you're looking for. Science isn't a collection of facts, nor is it technology. It's a process, and I think PHM does a great job of demonstrating science and rationality as processes even if they aren't being applied to real-world situations.

    Also, The Martian stretched things a bit, too--"hab canvas" was basically unobtanium, and the inciting incident--the Martian storm--was not realistic at all. The movie did an even worse job of Martian wind.

    In PHM, the only errors I caught (>!outside the "we don't know how this could work" alien technology!<) were that

    A) >!the atmospheric comparison between the Hail Mary and the Blip A was...odd. Why would Rocky assess the Hail Mary's atmosphere as primarily O₂ rather than N₂? Were they really pressurizing the Hail Mary with pure O₂? If so, that would make the Blip A's atmosphere only 7-10atm, not 30.!<

    B) 3D printers absolutely work in zero G, assuming they were using an FDM process--which you obviously would, *because they work in zero G.*
    ```

    - u/ahecht:
      ```
      Near the end of the book they said that Hail Mary's atmosphere was only 5psi. Running a pure oxygen atmosphere at 5psi, just like the early Apollo missions did, makes sense. It only becomes dangerous when pressuring it to 20psi on the ground for testing, which is what caused the Apollo 1 fire, but that shouldn't be a problem for a spacecraft that is assembled on orbit. 

      I did find several other "errors", however, >!including Grace sending a wax model to a ship he knew was hot, Grace being excited when he thought Rocky's biology didn't use water but showing no disappointment when he found out it did, Stratt assigning Grace the task of putting together a list of replacement science officers but Grace later having to ask Stratt for the list when they meet to choose a replacement, Grace trying to figure out whether 20,000kgs of methane was enough to get home while completely ignoring that he'd need 80,000kgs of oxygen to burn it (which he wouldn't have on his 120,000kg ship), Grace's shoddily repaired chair somehow surviving the second bought of high gravity (and Grace positioning himself in the worst possible way, head down, instead of lying on the ceiling), etc.!<

        Good catches. >!I was also dismayed by his modeling materials choices, though I later forgot--even the solder might melt in the Blip A!!<

        While low-pressure O₂ isn't as dangerous as high-pressure O₂, Cody's Lab made [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d30n-ZlFVY) demonstrating that there's no survivable pressure at which pure O₂ isn't a horrific fire hazard.

      >It's a process, and I think PHM does a great job of demonstrating  science and rationality as processes even if they aren't being applied  to real-world situations.

      Yeah I guess it has some not completely bogus representations of the kind of work that scientists do and how to think through problems but so did the Martian and for me personally none of that was new information. I was disappointed that I didn't come away learning more about actual exoplanet and astrobiology research and instead just got a bunch of >!hand-wavy made up stuff!<.

      &#x200B;

      >Also, The Martian stretched things a bit, too--"hab canvas" was  basically unobtanium, and the inciting incident--the Martian storm--was  not realistic at all.

      Sure sure, but that was fairly minor in comparison to the completely made up >!new physics that forms the basis of the entire story !<in this book.

      &#x200B;

      >>!the  atmospheric comparison between the Hail Mary and the Blip A was...odd.  Why would Rocky assess the Hail Mary's atmosphere as primarily O₂ rather  than N₂? Were they really pressurizing the Hail Mary with pure O₂? If  so, that would make the Blip A's atmosphere only 7-10atm, not 30.!<

      >!The Hail Mary was using a low pressure high oxygen atmosphere. This is normal for space travel. Apparently the challenges of a high oxygen atmosphere are seen as lesser than than the challenges of higher pressure, maybe due to the extra material and thus extra weight required? I can't remember the details but I think it was specified at some point at least exactly what pressure the atmosphere was at.!<

      &#x200B;

      >3D printers absolutely work in zero G, assuming they were using an FDM process--which you obviously would, *because they work in zero G.*

      Well you could maybe defend optimizing for something other than "works in zero G" if you want as much versatility as possible but yeah it seems odd. If it's a metal 3D printer (I can't remember) it's less odd, as they were doing the whole >!"only using proven off-the-shelf technologies"!< and I don't think there are any non-powder off-the-shelf metal 3D printers except for WAAM which requires some non-trivial post-processing for fine detail that isn't generally compatible with spaceships.

  Can anyone explain to me what appears to be a gigantic, glaring problem that Weir sets up a little more than halfway through the book?

  The Eridians as represented by Rocky apparently come from a planet of such massive mass, magnetic fields and atmospheric cover that their species never evolved to deal with radiation nor even discovered it before developing space travel. They evolved as totally “blind” sonar-based beings incapable of seeing stars or any light/colors at all. 

  Ryland even has to explain to poor Rocky that he was the only survivor of his mission because cosmic radiation killed off the others, by means of explaining basically cancer/cellular/chromosomal destruction by high-frequency radiation passing through their unshielded ship while Rocky the engineer was safe down in the fuel reserves where all the Astrophage were stored and absorbed the deadly radiation.

  Rocky’s species doesn’t know what cells, or radiation, or light, are.

  But they are on a similar sun-saving mission as Hail Mary, to figure out how to stop the microscopic, cellular life form Astrophage from eating up all the radiation coming off their sun. A life form they also figured out how to use as a highly efficient fuel source same as Earth did.

  …

  Am I missing something here?

  How can your entire race know absolutely nothing about cells, microscopic life, or radiation…but figure out that you’re all gonna die in 75 years or so because the radiation from your nearest star is being consumed by trillions of space floating microscopic life forms? How can you even detect it if you don’t know about radiation? The only reason WE initially find it is from a limited IR radiation quirk—the Petrova line—because we had radioastronomy that looks out across the whole electromagnetic spectrum.

  Now at one point soon after, Rocky constructs a handheld—clawheld—tool that he says is a ‘camera’ that translates the range we call visible light into ‘textures’ his sonar can then read. Much like how we can’t see IR but we can use sensors to pick it up then translate it to visible light for us to interpret. Rocky even remarks this isn’t clever on his part, he just ‘adapted a tool that was part of his ship into a portable version.’

  So…did the Eridians know about visible light or not? They already had sonic cameras according to Rocky…and they discovered the Astrophage and reverse engineered it enough to exploit its energy abilities as fuel.

  THIS MAKES ZERO SENSE AND I DON’T SEE WEIR ADDRESSING IT AT ALL IN-STORY.

  Did I miss something? Please if anyone read it and sees something I missed please tell me because without it this whole book became total crap for me. It wasn’t simply a little suspension of disbelief failure on my part—it wants me to accept literally two massive contradictions based on the same principles that are absolutely the entire foundation of the book.

  Not knowing about radiation or cells but being able to work out there’s a microscopic antiradioactive life form sucking up your sun…it’s like saying your race never discovered the wheel but you perfected watchgears..?!

  If you know about visible light, or at least a range of light within wavelengths that includes IR…and they also clearly know about magnetism, electricity and heat…? Then you know about the electromagnetic spectrum. You can’t even know about these things without knowing they’re connected—magnets and electricity alone will interact enough in early experimentation that you will have to figure out quickly that energy operates at all kinds of frequencies.

  Even if you don’t discover the bizarre qualities of a photon as a unique thing of visible light, you would HAVE to know about radiation if you know about IR and the rest. Their own engines are literally based on high-frequency electromagnetic RADIATION.
  ```

  - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
    ```
    The iridians know plenty about cells and electromagnetic radiation in general--Rocky describes his crewmate's radiation poisoning as inexplicable "cell death" and knows how to make a "camera" that translates light intensity into relief and texture. The thing they didn't understand was *ionizing* radiation, and/or its effect on biology.

  Let me be up front that in accordance with the standards of this sub I do not wish to cast judgment either way or discuss politics, *but*: Offhand, how woke would you say it is? Does it go out of its way to portray women acting like psychological males with no one seeming to notice how odd that is? Did you get the sense that the author was working his way down a diversity and inclusion checklist?

    I can't say I noticed anything like that. On the other hand, I kind of reject the premise; what would "psychologically male" look like? There are women in the book who are far more pragmatic than sentimental, but then again...women are more pragmatic than sentimental at a rate roughly commensurate with men, in my experience.

    If you could stomach The Martian, Project Hail Mary isn't going to challenge your worldview too much.

      Thank you for your response. As I said, I do wish to avoid getting into a thorny discussion here. To answer, though, I'd say: like a woman whose behavior makes a lot more sense if she's regularly getting high doses of exogenous testosterone. Describing what that particularly *means* is probably beyond the purview of this place, but I expect you can fill in the blanks.

      And no, I had no issues with *The Martian*. I expect women who become astronauts to be brilliant, fearsomely competent, and have the hearts of lions, not to mention already having been selected for unusually-high risk tolerance.

              The GP comment reads like a caricature, but if I had to bet on whether an unknown person was male or female and I was given their percentile big-5 agreeableness (a psychological trait) I would do a lot better than chance.

    Zero on a scale of 1 to 10, thankfully.

    I think you will not like Stratt then. But then she's not likeable, she's "merely" ruthless in achieving her goals.

      Yeah? I feel like that's pretty basic decency. Not sure how it relates here; not wanting to waste time on something I know will irritate me isn't the same as being pitted against my darkest demons by surprise when someone might have just mentioned that, hey, you know, this work contains rape.

    Give it a try. It's not like Artemis which did have this problem with the main character's sex and religion. It's a pretty entertaining book.

    What book would you recommend that isn't woke and/or doesn't discuss politics? If it's rational , even better.

      Highly, highly, highly recommend Neal Stephenson's *The Diamond Age*. One of the premises of the world is that the blank slate hypothesis is fundamentally true, which frees up the author to isolate and explore all kinds of cool stuff regarding culture and education. There are two major female characters, one of whom is a brilliant, ambitious, *psychologically normal* woman that I like a lot, while the other is... well, psychologically exceptional, but for good reason, and the world and other characters *notice* this about her, which makes it all work for me.

      Probably my favorite book of all time. 

      If you do try it out, I'll issue a standard warning: It's one of those written from multiple character POVs, one per chapter, and relatively early on in the book one of the POV characters dies and is replaced by another. I've seen this throw off any number of people trying to get into the book, since it's sci-fi and losing a solid foothold like that can be challenging for the reader. OTOH, everyone I've warned has gotten through it just fine and loved the book. So, hopefully forewarned is forearmed! And do let me know how you like it.

      Despite accepting for the sake of the argument what is perhaps the core of leftism -- that is, blank-slatism -- it is decidedly non-woke, and its politics are (mostly) solidly fictional enough to not be obnoxious.
