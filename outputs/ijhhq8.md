  I got the entire Pokemon: Origin of Species story up until the current chapter printed as 5 500-ish page books. 

  I'm really pleased with how they came out and wanted to show them off here. I hope that's ok, I know it's a little different from the usual content on this subreddit.

    Splitting by size to even them out makes sense, though I'm curious to know what chapter that leaves each ending on? :)
    ```

      It comes out to chapters 25, 42, 55, 71 and then 83 of course. I wanted to split them by story arc first, but I was kind of forced into this split by the page limit on the books. Splitting them any other way would have resulted in 6 books. 

      It doesn't work out too badly, it helps that basically all your chapters are fairly self contained and end on a meaningfull-ish final line/cliffhanger to set you up for the next book.

        Nice, I just wanted to check the ending lines/paragraphs for each of those chapters and I think most of them work well!

  Woah, these look awesome :) I'm glad you've enjoyed the story enough to get these made!

  Just to check, I know you're not commercially spreading these around, but did you get the artist's permission to use their images? (I'm imagining no, but it would be pretty cool if you did and they said yes).

    I did not :)

      Gotcha, maybe I'll reach out to them someday and use this picture as an example of why a collaborative work would be cool :)

        Ooh, that would be really cool!

    The images are from [here](https://www.deviantart.com/arvalis/gallery/39915677/realistic-pokemon), the rest of the cover I put together myself.

  Would like to see a cover matching Darwin's

  this is cool but my inner 12 year old feels the need to point out that mewtwo looks like it has a giant cock

  (although i think that's actually supposed to be what was originally its stomach but in this depiction is some sort of attached placental feature?)

  Eldritch Pokemon. So creepy!  
  This looks really cool, but that's not how I would picture real-life Pokemon.  
  Though they're definitely more creative than the "fur puppets" you'd otherwise see, when you google "real life pokemon".

  Wow!! They're incredible.

  Have you considered posting the pdf files somewhere? Possibly on git if you use that? I know that some people on r/hpmor do that and there are others who then use those files to print out their own versions even years later.

    Pdf/epubs are for the authorâ€™s patrons.
    ```

  - u/cimbalino:
    ```
    You can use websites like [this](http://www.ff2ebook.com/) to download epubs (or pdf's) from the FanFiction website.
    ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    Aside from the fact that pdfs/epubs are apparently made available to patreon subscribers, which I wasn't aware of (and which incidentally could have saved me a bunch of effort), I wouldn't want to distribute these in the shape they are in now anyway.  I was under a bit of time pressure when making these, so they're pretty rough (eg. all the chapters still end on the 
    '_If you have found a spelling error, please notify me..._' message).

    Also, if I did that, I would first want to get permission from the artist that made the art for the cover as well as Daystar, because making this stuff for myself is one thing, distributing it like that is quite another.

      Thanks for responding and good point about the artist.
