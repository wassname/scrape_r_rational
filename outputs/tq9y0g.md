Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  * [Transmigrating into the Main Character's Political Rival](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50194/transmigrating-into-the-main-characters-political): if you like stories like Hamefura or Tori Transmigrated but wish the MC faced actual conflict, this one is great; the MC is transmigrated into the body of a minor first arc antagonist, about a month before the main character of the story has him brutally murdered, and has to flail around to keep from dying. The MC doesn't really have any relevant special powers the original character didn't have (she apparently picked up nullification magic, but it hasn't been relevant yet), so it's pretty much 100% political maneuvering using spoilers from the book so far. TW, though: the MC was female but has transmigrated into a male body, and isn't exactly in a position to just cast a henge and tell the world to deal with it. She's constantly misgendered and nobody uses her name, if that's something that would bother you (though it doesn't bother her).
  * [The True Confessions of a Nine-Tailed Fox](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46500/the-true-confessions-of-a-nine-tailed-fox): Piri the Nine Tailed Fox parties a bit _too_ hard and essentially causes the Fall of Rome. For this crime she's sentenced back into the wheel of reincarnation. The story's about Piri trying to figure out how to finagle her way through the Celestial Bureaucracy and her lives in between in order to become a fox again. It's part political shenanigans, part "what are the rules of karma and how do I exploit them to get more", though it's a bit lighter on the latter side than I'd like.
  * [The Icon of the Sword](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51550/the-icon-of-the-sword): this is "trauma narrative, cultivator edition". If you've ever wondered why cultivators who undergo ridiculously harsh childhood training don't need therapists, well... they kinda do. The first few chapters show the MC lying to his father about being able to touch the Icon of the Sword (aka sword dao), and the next ten or so chapters are about why and how he's been trained to get to this point. It's brutal and harsh and also, somehow, set on a cultivator-tech ringworld. TW: child abuse, since the harsh training is not just glossed over (it's also not celebrated)

    > Transmigrating into the Main Character's Political Rival

    I came across this series and binged through 26 chapters in a day. It's really good. It's a "reincarnated as a villain" story, but on hard mode. Danger is ramped up to 10, insta-death is on, and the MC is severely handicapped.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Yeah it's probably one of my favorite "reincarnated as a villain" stories right now; all the other ones have their characters become basically Mary Sues way too fast. Like, I like Tori Transmigrated, but at this point the original MC of the story is only relevant because Tori is actively protecting her.
      ```

      - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
        ```
        Yeah, I like *Tori Transmigrated*, but isues with Alessia aside, it's weird how the MC recognizes that the story is actively trying to screw her over and that's just kinda ignored. There's this whole "are these people with free will or NPCs following a script" question that got brought up then just faded into the background.

        It reminds me of [*Beware the Villainess!*](https://mangadex.org/title/85b51b37-0ce6-4144-a19b-6b064bc2c2ae/beware-the-villainess), which I think addressed the issue a lot better.
        ```

    - u/Ricardias:
      ```
      Yeah, also really enjoyed it. The set up was ham fisted but once you move past that, it was really fun.
      ```

  - u/Nnaelo:
    ```
    I'm at chapter twelve of *Transmigrating into the Main Character's Political Rival*, and so far I'm really bemused. It's weird, but the story hooked me with the main character's silly decision of playing sick in the beginning. It makes sense for her in contexte, what's with her being ripped out off everything she ever knew and thrown into the deep end. Acting erratically instead of being instantly competent was a breath of fresh air. It would also provide an easy motive for why she'd side against her grandfather, outside of meta reasons. 

    I'm still waiting/hoping for it to take off, though. For now it's been mostly her going from one event to the next, answering stimuli but not really doing anything proactive to better her situation and/or deal with the root causes of her problems, instead of the symptoms. Hopefully, this is still her being a bit dizzy after being gender swapped into fantasy china.

    Unfortunately, the story suffers for the same issue *Tori Transmigrated* does where most of the cast are NPCs instead of players with their own motivations, although to a lesser degree. 

    All in all, if you like the particular brand of wish fulfillment the reincarnated into the villain/villainess genre offers, you might like it. I hasn't been particularly rational, nor rational adjacent so far though. 

    While I'm at it, I'll throw a recommendation for *Agenda of the Villainess*. It's the story of this genre that I've enjoyed the most, so far.

      > Unfortunately, the story suffers for the same issue Tori Transmigrated does where most of the cast are NPCs instead of players with their own motivations, although to a lesser degree.

      Actually I'd say that it inverts this somewhat, in that the NPCs all turn out to have reasons for their actions that weren't necessarily clear in the source material, whereas Tori Transmigrated seems to just declare that railroading is in effect and Tori can't do anything about it.
      ```

  - u/WEEBSKILLEDANIME:
    ```
    Regarding icon of the sword, I hate that the prologue is when the MC was 16 years old and then every other chapter is about their childhood until they lead up to that point. Prologue is just one massive spoiler and all the available chapters only lead to when he was 14. I guess these types of prologues is meant to hook the reader in but usually the content of the novel picks up really fast to get to the point of the prologue.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    *The True Confessions of a Nine-Tailed Fox* is the kind of story where there's no clear incentives, no clear driving force for for any of the character's motivations. Not for the main character, who's only goal is to farm karma because reasons. Not for the clerks of the celestial bureaucracy, who are apparently born out of the aether, work for wages in a job they don't particularly like, and are forced to work unpaid overtime because reasons. Not for the almost uniformly corrupt or apathetic officials in said bureacracy, who are corrupt because reasons. 

    If you're the kind of reader who cares about what the stakes are for the characters, prepare to be disappointed. If you care about worldbuilding and questions like "why is this world broken and corrupt?", prepare to be extra disappointed. 

    It's not a story without some redeeming qualities — the writing is better than average, I suppose, and some might find the antics of the MC amusing — but the sheer inanity of the setting is a huge turn-off for me. It doesn't help that little happens within the first 25 chapters, after which there's signs of a plot thread starting to emerge oh-so-slowly.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      That's true, it's a relatively low-stakes story at this point; after all, the worst thing that can happen is that Piri might die, and she's already gone through it. IMO the main attraction is the characters; Piri is the right sort of manipulative, arrogant oddball to bounce nicely off of the rest of the cast.

    - Transmigrating into the Main Character's Political Rival

    I couldn't get past the first chapters where the MC decided that playing sick was a good idea. Is none else bothered by that? Or is the MC not an idiot in later chapters.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      I also agree that the main character's personality was off-putting in the first chapter. She doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities that would make me root for her.
      ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Weird unrelated nitpick but is anyone else bothered by the word transmigrated? Migrate means to move to another place and trans usually refers from to some kind of change but there's already change in migrate so what's the point of adding it? At this point I get it, the transmigrated has connotations of portal and asia, but I can't help but think that some original translator thought 'hmm, migrate? too bland... dimensional migration? too specific.. transmigrate, yes this sounds sufficiently vague and strange'

    Edit: To clarify, I'm not criticizing the translators or the authors. I'm criticizing the etymology of the word. Soulmigration, bodymigration, realmmigration (or whatever the greek equivalent would be) would all have been more precise. Transmigration sounds like someone migrates by using a transatlantic vessel, or migrates across transylvania, or some such.
    ```

      "Transmigration of the soul" is a synonym for reincarnation
      ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      It's being used correctly. Transmigration is the movement of a soul into another body after death. It's also not just an Asian word, the concept of a souls passing from one "vessel" to another has been around for awhile

      >Metempsychosis (Greek: μετεμψύχωσις), in philosophy, refers to transmigration of the soul, especially its reincarnation after death. The term is derived from ancient Greek philosophy, and has been recontextualised by modern philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer[2] and Kurt Gödel;[3] otherwise, the term "transmigration" is more appropriate. The word plays a prominent role in James Joyce's Ulysses and is also associated with Nietzsche.[4] Another term sometimes used synonymously is palingenesis.

  I really like stories where a character who is out of their depth attempts to bluff in a situation, and the people around them read way too much into their actions and statements, assuming that they are playing 5D chess.

  The start of **Chronicles of Amber** did a great job of this, and **Paranoid Mage** and **Orochimama** also help scratch a similar itch.

  Are there any more recommendations? Rational stories preferred, but not necessary.

    [A Practical Guide to Sorcery](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34009/a-practical-guide-to-sorcery) \[RST\] hits all those boxes. Siobhan doesn't like it, but she has proven herself to be very good at bluffing. 

    There's a social-media BNHA fic [Q.A.B.](https://archiveofourown.org/series/2429515) that doesn't have bluffing, but just has people reading way too much into the statements of a middle-schooler's blog. It does pretty cool things with formatting too.

    I see nobody else recommended it yet, so: Youjo Senki and some of its fanfics. There's an anime, but also manga and LN. The tl;dr is salaryman pisses off God, gets reincarnated into AU Germany during world war 1.5 with magic, has a bloodthirsty career in the military while trying to live a quiet peaceful life, in a comedy-of-errors way. The tone / themes / level of realism might be different than you'd expect from that description.

    As for fanfics, I enjoyed [A Young Woman's Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/reader/) (postwar politics, complete) and [We Are Each Our Own Devil](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/we-are-each-our-own-devil-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.815438/reader/) (very long at 330k words, ongoing, 10/10, arguably romance??). I don't know to what degree you want specifically "out of their depth", "bluffing" and "5D chess", but the misinterpretation-of-character's-actions/motivations elements are there big time.

    [The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/) has a lot of bluffing as a strategic tactic, though the MC does it intentionally. It is a Naruto fanfiction which gets recommended on here a lot. The only fic of these three that meets the themes of r/rational, the others are just funny parody fics.

    If you have read Worm, the worm fanfic [Denial](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/denial-worm-alt-power-comedy.679429/) is basically this as a superpower. It is a dead fic but I thought it was pretty funny.

    For Xianxia Fans there is the parody [Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4). All the MC's actions get viewed this way.

  Someone in one of the threads like a month or so ago recommended [RE: Monarch](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37951/re-monarch). I read the first book and overall I liked it, but man the "going back in time to when you are a tween" feels like such a bad trope to pin your story on. At one point the MC even says that he is a late bloomer, so it seems he's going to be like this for the majority of the story. This means that whenever there is a fight scene against a fully grown man or a scene where he's flirting with a female character who's older (but really younger?) than him, I need to remember that the character doing this has the body of a 12 year old boy who's 4'10" and has a squeaky voice, which totally takes me out of the experience. This could maybe be written to be  funny, but from what I've read of this story it just felt awkward to me and ruined the suspension of disbelief. I think at some point I'll pick it up again and see if anything changes in book two, but not for a while.

  A couple TV shows that I've been watching lately:

  *The Gilded Age* 
  >Beginning in 1882, the old money van Rhijn-Brook family and new money Russell family live across the street from one another in New York City. Marian Brook, a naïve young woman, enters the rigid social scene and learns about life's harsh realities. The series follows characters in the upper class and the servant class.

  Basically a slice-of-life show that follows 2-3 families living in 1880s America. I can't vouch for the historical accuracy, but from what I know/have looked up, it seems to be accurate. HBO really invested a ton into the show, and it shows. Social, economical and technological changes take a center point in the story.

  This [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4EC8TEGmKA) gives a good idea of the series.

  *From*
  >Unravel the mystery of a city in Central America that imprisons everyone who enters. As the residents struggle to maintain a sense of normalcy and seek a way out, they must also survive the threats of the surrounding forest.

  A horror/psychological/mystery show that, terrible name aside, is really interesting. People get stranded in a small town in the middle of nowhere, with no way out. Every night, monsters appear and try to kill them. It isn't just a physical struggle; they're under huge mental strain, with some not even being sure if they're still alive or trapped in purgatory.

  The show essentially built a small town as a set, with different buildings from different time periods, and is really great a playing up the whole "what the hell is going on here?!" angle.


  *Severance*
  >A sinister biotech corporation, Lumon Industries, uses a "severance" medical procedure to separate the non-work memories of some of their employees from their work memories. One severed employee, Mark, gradually uncovers the web of conspiracy from both sides of the division.

  More psychological/mystery show, the main character is essentially living two lives, with both unaware of what the other is doing. They know they exists, they just can't communicate, and the show is centered around bringing these two together. It's a slow-burn though, so you have to wait for payoffs to occur down the line instead of within the same episode.

  The opening credits are great too:

  I was bored this weekend, so I listened to the [Vigor Mortis Book 1](https://www.audible.com/pd/Vigor-Mortis-Volume-1-Audiobook/B09HL9HBB7?action_code=ASSGB149080119000H&share_location=pdp&shareTest=TestShare) as an audiobook. I read it a while ago and had a generally positive impression about it before my interest in it petered out. Here's a quick review (with spoilers):

  **The good:**

  Possibly my favorite thing about this story is how the author embraces the plot's insanity and how unique the worldbuilding is compared to standard fantasy-world fare. I mean, the world is literally made of floating islands above a planet-sized, godlike, lovecraftian monster that occasionally reaches up and slaps things with its tentacles. Weather and day-night cycles are determined by the orbits of other islands (like when one passes overhead and casts the local place in shadow or the permanently wet island passes overhead causing showers). It's fresh and unique. 

  The plot also goes from 0-100 very quickly. The protagonist, Vita, becomes ~~an adventurer~~ *a hunter* to support her family, and her first mission into the wildlands--instead of something lame like exterminating wolves--turns into a master-stranger-hell scenario with occasionally empathetic and nearly undetectable bioweapon-mind-control slimes that take control of people's minds, copy their memories, and impersonate them flawlessly. Shenanigans and horror ensue, Vita ends up befriending one of the mind-control slimes, people die, etc.

  The story also manages to hit emotional beats quite well--frequently through the reactions of other characters towards the protagonist--and after the climax-showdown with all the mind-control slimes wraps up, I felt emotionally conflicted, unsure about how I felt about the ending, and I consider this a big win for the story. It's something that makes/made me ask myself "how do I feel about this?" or "what do I think is right?" for a long time after I've finished reading/listening. Bravo, author. 

  **The bad:**

  It's a common complaint, but I didn't like the interludes. Yes, I get that from an author's perspective that they can be fun to write (guilty of this myself), but the two present in book one don't add anything to the story. One just provides unnecessary background info on Vita's "mother", Lyn, and the other rehashes the past couple chapters from a different perspective (one of the mind-control slimes). It's entirely unnecessary as the contents were nearly completely inferable--some of the dialogue is even directly copy-pasted. Later on, and this is where I eventually stopped reading, another character, Lark, is introduced and, well, they aren't *terrible*, it's just that as a reader I'm invested in the protagonist, not this shoe-horned side character. 

  Another problem surrounds one of Vita's core motivations: she wants to help her "parents" and the other orphans. In the beginning, this is presented as a money problem: they are simply to poor to feed the orphans. Vita must go out, earn money, and this will solve the problem. Simple. Then, it's revealed that there's some sort of debt involved that maintains the status quo, and eventually this is upgraded to the mob basically saying "if you don't work for us, the mob will kill all the orphans". The escalation makes sense, and the reasoning fits for the start of the story: Vita is weak and everything is a struggle. After book 1 however, it feels like the author contrives more and more reasons why Vita, Lyn, and co. can't simply go in and just, like, kill mob or at least solve the starving orphan problems somehow. Like, why are the orphans still starving when Lyn regularly heists the most valuable substance in existence and Vita becomes rich (by slums standards)? The antagonist power-creep is just very high, and the buildup just eventually passes what disbelief I can suspend. 

  **Overall:**

  As an open-and-shut experience, I'd recommend book 1 of *Vigor Mortis*. It is interesting, thought-provoking, and often times just plain fun to read (or listen to).
  ```

  - u/Watchful1:
    ```
    I honestly don't remember where book 1 cuts off, but both those complaints are addressed later on. The Lark chapters eventually turn into a somewhat compelling plot (though it does take a while). And both the feed the orphans and why can't you just kill the mob people are addressed.

    There is a timeskip later on, which I'm not a huge fan of in general, but it does shift a lot of the major plots around.
    ```

  - u/Sirra-:
    ```
    Lark Chapters: 

    Yeah, the early Lark chapters are a definite low point of the story. This is sad because I think the more recent Lark chapters are like, 90% as compelling as the Vita chapters, which, considering how much I like Vigor Mortis, is a lot. I think the problem is that the earlier chapters were doing a lot of necessary setup without being as fun to read as the rest of the story. Anyway, my advice would be skim the early Lark chapters (before around ch100) as you get bored. Just make sure you understand roughly where their character arc is at after each chapter.

    The part where Lark is introduced *sucks* to read, as someone who hates interludes. But from my experiences so far with book three, I can say it has fully paid off. Anyway, good and fair review.

  So I read the *Thermae Romae* manga because I saw the ONA listed on Netflix. It's a pretty good light-hearted comedy reverse isekai where a Roman engineer gets somehow gets isekai'd into Japanese bathhouses every chapter where he finds the exact solution to the problem he's facing. 

  It's a fun read and it's sort of interesting to try and predict what sort of modern features he'd end up borrowing to solve the problem that he's facing back in Rome. As with many good comedy pieces, the plot's surprisingly good with some stakes and romance, though don't expect anything too deep on those fronts. *Hinamatsuri* tier.

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  Are there any litrpg/xianxia/progression fantasy stories that seriously consider the scale of destruction that the most powerful people can put out? Something like the endbringer fights from worm, where destruction results in not just cleanup, but also the impacts to people's lives, infrastructure, local land use, etc. 

  Of course, you could sorta handwave it away by having people with creation powers that can easily repair the destruction, but that still doesn't take care of the other aspects. 

  One good example would be Ar'Kendrythist, where fights start and finish really fast but the recovery period takes long and has far reaching effects. Delve does that too to a similar degree but it has pacing problems.

    By the way, for anyone who is curious, the story was originally [posted on Space Battles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psi-effect-me-xcom-thread-2-rise-of-the-party-boat.307972/).

    The fic is written as 10 or so related substories each focused on a different character and/or plotline. The Space Battles thread separates these different storylines so you can follow each one chronologically, but the fanfiction.net version smashes them all together so that chapters switch unpredictably from storyline to storyline. Thus, the version on fanfiction.net is a bit disjointed and can be more difficult to follow.

    Thanks for the rec! I’ll have to check this out. My most favorite XCOM2 runs were with Mass Effect mods installed, and I always felt like those settings had potential to play together well.

  This is a recommendation not congruent with the normal stuff that gets posted here, but the thread instructions do say, “Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise?” And *[The Girl From the Sea](https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Sea-Molly-Knox-Ostertag/dp/1338540572)* really did hit the spot for me. It’s drawn and written by the artist of *Strong Female Protagonist*, Molly Ostertag, and I bought it on that basis while searching for simple, fun things to read while my toe heals. And while *The Girl From the Sea* is certainly quite different from *Strong Female Protagonist*, just seeing the art was a sort of soothing therapy in itself, since SFP sadly seems likely to never finish its final arc.

  (At least *Game of Thrones* fans got their season 8! The winds of winter will howl before Issue 8 of SFP ever comes out.)

  While hardly rational in the ordinary sense, one of the primary themes of *The Girl From the Sea* is reflecting on your thought processes and the kinds of things that happen when you don’t, letting scripts and social expectations dominate your life instead. I also like how it avoids evil characters, creating conflict on the basis of real challenges of empathy instead. In fact, I might go so far as to say it contains one of the most mundane, realistic depictions of a negative externality that I’ve ever seen in fiction.

  Even so, I doubt that it will appeal to the modal reader of this subreddit. However, I think it will make a fun and well-appreciated gift for any younger folks in your life who like to read—or who like to look at pretty pictures, because the art really is gorgeous.

  Anyone have a recommendation for a story about a world falling apart that the main character is trying to put back together?
  ```

    I think Sebastien De Castell's [Greatcoats](https://www.goodreads.com/series/121119-greatcoats) Series somewhat applies. It has to do about a group of "wandering magistrates" who are trying to keep themselves alive and bring order to their society, which is pretty much going to hell. Admittedly, the country is breaking down predominantly because of bad actors, but I feel like this might scratch some of that itch. It's also just extremely good writing.

    I recently finished reading "Portal to Nova Roma" by J. R. Matthews, which is getting a good start on being this. Protagonist portals to a medieval-ish world that has been largely wiped out by its system apocalypse and uses his unfair advantages and advanced knowledge to try to pull civilisation back together.

    Only the first book of three is out, and the pull civilisation back together bits don't really get going until the last quarter or so of the book, so this will become a better recommendation later, but I thought it was a pretty solid version of its genre (isekai-ish LitRPG) so can generally recommend it as well.

  I wanted to second the recommendation made a couple of weeks back for the book Dragon's Egg. It is a really original first contact novel with aliens living on the surface a neutron star who are incredibly small and think much faster than humans. Bonus points for the excellent hypothetical physics and attempted realism.

    > aliens...who are incredibly small and think much faster than humans.

    [Humans are Hiveminds](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gu98co/humans_are_a_hivemind/) is another take on that premise, though it's unfortunately unfinished.

  I was watching *Project Runway* and one of the contestants would occasionally speak in AAVE (African American Vernacular English),  and it made me reflect that I really love the way AAVE sounds and its grammatical quirks but I don't get to hear it very often. Especially because this contestant would only speak in AAVE very rarely due to code switching. 

  Does anyone have a movie or TV series I can watch that is (ideally) primarily in AAVE, or has several characters that speak AAVE? 

  Hopefully this goes without saying but I *do not* want a 90s buddy cop film where a black cop teaches a white cop how to dance or whatever.

    I only watch animation, so hopefully that's fine with you. *The Boondocks* is a satirical sitcom with all three main characters being black. It's not *primarily* in AAVE, but features quite a lot of it. It's also quite funny, but YMMV.

      Oh that's a good thought, I listen to *so many* though that I don't have the bandwidth. 

      I've heard a few advertised that might be in AAVE and they tend to be about "culture" or are comedy podcasts which I'm not super into. I mostly listen to science-adjacent podcasts, podcasts about Survivor, and true crime podcasts. I also listen to a couple of podcasts by Indigenous Australians which I've found really, really amazingly good.

      There was a really good one that is no longer being produced that Gimlet had, it was called *Uncivil* and it was about the American civil war. I believe it was in SAE not AAVE but it was absolutely fascinating. I'm not American so I didn't know much about the history beyond the very broad strokes and loved it.

  I'm looking for either fics like [Ryuugi's Devil's Advocate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6310457/1/Devil-s-Advocate) a digimon fic that I thought was really interesting in how it showed how someone who thought that they were only playing a video game might treat like what they considered enemy npcs. The outright disregard for lives and the way that from a "rational" view of gaining strength quickly it would like be the best for you to gain experience the fastest way possible. As an aside like I'd be totally down for like stories like [RavensDagger's Dead Tired](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dead-tired.894343/) where the Dungeon's and Dragon's thing about exp coming from combat implies the deaths of numerous thinking and feeling foes on the road more loot and levels.

  Or fics that use like the Final Fantasy class systems upfront. Preferably more like Final Fantasy Tactics-esque or Ogre Battles or a Fire Emblem story that actually had class changes as a thing. Like a story that just keeps characters to like a static progression of power like Banner Saga where there are classes, isn't really what I'm looking for. I'm really looking for something that uses more like Final Fantasy V's job system being used at all at his point, preferably intelligently used, but like I'll take what I can get.

    [Sword of the Bright Lady](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J1HDEH4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) is essentially about the moral and practical ramifications of a world in which killing sapients confers power, a la DnD. Quite well written, some people didn't like the last book, but I thought it was OK. The only isekai I've read where the MC actually works to get back to the real world.
