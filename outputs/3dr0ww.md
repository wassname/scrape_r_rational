  Lately, when I exercise in the mornings I put on an episode of SG-1, or two if I'm doing a long workout, because it makes the workout pass faster.  This one was so godawful I had to write it up before getting on with real work.

    Yeah, the team definitely made a lot of fumbles in this adventure.  I think the writers could have reached the same sort of ending - with the replicators, sacrificing the android girl, etc - but with more rational decisions made by the team
