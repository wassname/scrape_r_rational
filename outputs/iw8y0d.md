  This has particular nostalgia for me. I first read it as a preteen and it opened my eyes to the kinds of far reaching questions that literature can ask. I wished deeply there were 30 more stories just like each questioning another facet of normal life.

  This was pretty cool, I liked the video. 

  So, the dragon is death, and the dragon-feeding infrastructure is end-of-life care. What is represented by the last train that the clerk tried to stop? That would be, what, a guy who dies of cancer the day before the panacea pill is ready, but I don't really see how that bit ties into the moral (besides being stupefyingly obvious, like yeah we're not going to ruin all our chances just for one fuckin guy).

    I think it's just to emphasize the importance of curing death as fast as possible. We know, intellectually, that thousands of people will die for every day we waste not killing the dragon/curing death. By focusing on one man who lost their father, Bostrom turns this belief into an alief.

      > alief

      That was a new word for me, and a useful one. I looked it up at

      http://www.pgrim.org/philosophersannual/pa28articles/gendleraliefbelief.pdf

      And would define it as "a mental state where one's intellectual/intentional belief in a fact differs from one's default emotional/subconscious behavior."

      I believe the statistics and math that say that approximately 60 million people die each year, or about one man and one woman every second.  That's some literature and simple math, and obviously I would agree that's a bad thing. 

      But I *"alieve"* that the death of my father would be a terrible, tragic loss, my throat gets tight just thinking about it. 

      I feel more motivated to take actions that will lead eventually to the extinction of death by considering my own father's death than considering that hundreds of people lost their fathers while I read that article and posted this comment.

  This is already in the wiki

    Not everybody checks out the wiki. It's certainly difficult to find on mobile.
