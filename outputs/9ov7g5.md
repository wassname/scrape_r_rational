  I notice a Theme: Persistent conflict retards growth/progress.

  Praes and Callow, both backwaters, likely because of their nigh-eternal conflict.

  The Fae courts, at an absolute stand-still for millennia.

  The Drow, who tore *themselves* apart, tore themselves from greatness.

  The Principate, with constant internal political strife.

  The Gods themselves are twisted mockeries of liberty and cooperation.

    The word you’re looking for is “gnomes,” not “Persistant conflict.”
    ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  Well, **ALL ACCORDING TO PLAN SO FAR**, certainly nothing could possibly go wrong.
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Man, I'm glad we're finally done with this arc featuring an unstoppable young warlord tearing through a fallen civilization and using her powers to control an increasingly large number of superpowered individuals, so she can bring them back to her homeland and use them to prop up her reign of terror.

  No, wait, I'm thinking of *Ward*. My mistake.
  ```

  - u/night1172:
    ```
    Huh well I'm waiting till Ward finishes to start it, but I'm glad that's it's going well
    ```

  - u/zehguga:
    ```
    Shit, is that really the plot of Ward? I didn't get any further in after the first 3 or 4 chapters, so I don't know how it's developing, but I wanted to let it accumulate some before bingeing. Sounds pretty cool if the apparent MC in the beginning of Ward is doing that.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      No :P

      The joke is that Catherine is doing the same things as *Goddess*, one of the antagonists of Ward. The protagonist is more of a "social worker" type of character.
      ```

  ```
  hey, this guy is writing faster than I can read it!

  Not that I am complaining, ^(but I need a day off).
  ```

- u/TaltosDreamer:
  ```
  I am still worried that Cat is swearing all the Drow to her title and not herself. There is no way Akua isnt extremely interested in usurping that title.
  ```

  - u/haiku_fornification:
    ```
    Recall that when Akua took over, she summoned Cat back to her body by using Winter powers. So far there is no real distinction between Cat and her mantle so to become a Sovereign of Moonless Nights one would effectively have to become Catherine.

    Alternatively, Cat has already made oaths that bind Sovereign of Moonless Nights to protect Callow, etc. That way, even if Akua gained the title she would be forced to act in a way aligned with Callowan interests.
    ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    I think you have it backward; read [WOG's](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9o9d6p/rthf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_4_chapter_63/e7vop1k/) hint here
    ```

    - u/TaltosDreamer:
      ```
      The author saying the oath intentionally is made to the title rather than to Catherine doesnt result in it being wrong to worry the title can be changed/stolen. It validates it. Also, I was commenting on Cat making a mistake, where Errata was responding to someone critisizing the writing itself.

      It implies that either 

      1) Cat is aware and plans to step down from Winter somehow

      2) Akua created the wording in order to facilitate her move

      3) in a world where Cat proved pretty much anything can happen, there is something she believes is impossible

      Mostly I think putting the texts of oaths into the story is tough, because after years of running a Vampire LARP (the Invictus are a big one here) and various D&D campaigns, I do not think perfect oaths are even slightly easy to craft. The simpler the better and I have still seen extremely simple oaths violated in the worst ways due to incautious wording (incidently, demon summoning would be the worst idea ever). 

      **to be clear, I do not think our dear author made a mistake here. I think it is simply a point to ponder due it's ramifications, especially since it was apparently written that way on purpose.
      ```

      - u/werafdsaew:
        ```
        You need to step back and rethink your assumptions, the biggest being that the title SOMN is easier to steal than the name Catherine Foundling.  You've assuming that SOMN is just a title, when it is Winter itself.  A good interpretation is that SOMN is the *real* thing, and Catherine Foundling is just a role that SOMN puts on.  In retrospect there are 3 big hints supporting this interpretation:

        * In chapter 71 of the last Book Cat was terrified of turning into some creature wearing the face and identity of Catherine Foundling, and the author loves putting in foreshadowings like this
        * Your fae title is an identity not easily separated from yourself: Larat is still Nightfall even after resigning from his post as the Prince of Nightfall, and Cat didn't become the Duchess of Violent Squall after taking his place.
        * The biggest evidence is that Akua already usurped Catherine Foundling once before.  When she was controlling the construct, she was bound by all the oaths that Cat swore to.  Conversely, this means that as far as oaths are concerned, Akua counts as Cat when she is controlling the construct.
        ```

      - u/CFCrispyBacon:
        ```
        Or 4) Cat assumes that Akua or the "Backstabbing is a cultural virtue" drow will inevitably find a way to twist away from ANYTHING she has them swear willingly.  The contingency is knowing that and being prepared to trade resources gained now for resources spent later putting down the inevitable rebellion.  For bonus points, something nasty with Masego and a sympathetic link with the Fae magic in each of the oath-takers would be hilarious.

        "I know this will go wrong, and when it does, I/the Woe will solve it by stabbing it in the face" is a very Cat contingency.
        ```

        - u/TaltosDreamer:
          ```
          Also an option :)
          ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    This whole arc Cat has kinda been hinting at abdiction following the Liesse Accords.  I think she is seperating the drow loyalties from her personally to keep that option on the table.  This way she can pass them to a successor, whereas otherwise they'd make it impossible to abdicate.
    ```

    - u/TaltosDreamer:
      ```
      I like that idea. With the WoG comment especially it seems possible. Sad though. I was hoping for Goddess Cat to make a 3rd faction in the battles between the Gods.
      ```
