  Impressive, the descriptions of the interplanetary destruction is great as usual, I love reading every new chapter

  I'm definitely at a loss for how humanity is getting out of this one alive. The invaders are too big to fight, and there's nowhere safe to run. Unless their version of warp drive gives the spider birds a tactical advantage? Though I'm not sure how that might work.
