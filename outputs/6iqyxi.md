## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6fxuzy/biweekly_challenge_gods/) the prompt was "Gods", and our winner was /u/syncope_apocope, with [their story, "The Voices of the Gods"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6fxuzy/biweekly_challenge_gods/dipu19u/). Go read it now, and /u/syncope_apocope, congratulations on your win!

##### This Time

Next time, the challenge is **Barrier Maiden**. Your prompt is, "The girl is alone, holdling back the darkness. She's too young to die ..." Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, July 5th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)
