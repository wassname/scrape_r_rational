  >"Nargles are magical creatures associated with time," said Luna. "They're always making mischief in the future, which wreaks havoc on Seers trying to do their jobs, and they eat the past after it happens. They're why you can't turn time back more than six hours."

  Now we know, don't we? We know what happens to today when it becomes yesterday. It waits for them. It waits for them, the timekeepers of eternity. Always following them behind, cleaning up the mess in the most efficient way possible: by eating it!

  Interesting take, but I don't think it explains it. If nargles eat the past when it gets six hours old, then why wouldn't time turners be able to go back six hours indefinitely?

  Or... No, it actually makes sense. Every time you time-turn, you get closer to the nargles, and eventually you can't turn anymore. But then how does the reset work?

    ..or maybe Luna is just full of it.

      ```
      Nah, that can't be right. Everyone knows the seers that make no sense are the correct ones.
      ```

    ```
    I thought they were a reference to [The Langoliers by Stephen King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Langoliers).

      They are. He's quoting the miniseries.

  > "Well..." said Luna, dropping Ginny's hand. "It'd be easier to leave a part of yourself in the Chamber if you had a horcrux. But my dad says I can't learn how **he made that** until I'm seventeen, so it's probably very difficult."

  > "Well..." said Luna, dropping Ginny's hand. "It'd be easier to leave a part of yourself in the Chamber if you had a horcrux. But my dad says I can't learn how **[Xenophilius Lovegood] made [a horcrux]** until I'm seventeen, so it's probably very difficult."

  am I reading this wrong? why has no one caught this?

    Oh god her mother.

  I'm curious how you're going to handle the fact that Moody and Dumble (he's in the mirror, though) know Gilderoy is a fraud. Unless it turns out that Gilderoy *isn't* a fraud in the MOR-verse?
  ```

  - u/sephlington:
    ```
    He's clearly a fraud. The Quibbler headline says he's a mass illusion.
    ```

    - u/coredumperror:
      ```
      Ohhh, good point. "Gilderoy Lockheart Doesn't Exist" could be interpreted as "The person GH presents himself as is not real".
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        Maybe, but I hope he's secretly Voldemort again.
        ```

        - u/coredumperror:
          ```
          Again? "He" being "the defense professor", I assume? Lockheart was never secretly Voldemort.
          ```

  ```
  What...the actual...fuck. I can't even.

  Luna is a Seer. Xexophilius has a horcrux. 100% completion. Eye Fones. All ways of thinking reach correct conclusions *they reach MUTUALLY-EXCLUSIVE conclusions Luna you asdglbha;iushgpiahweaser5t8q7gf834*
