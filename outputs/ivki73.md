## Secret Krampus writing contest: Signups have ended, story submission guidelines within!

### Post:

Big thanks to everyone who signed up for the contest! I'm very happy with the turnout. Our 24 participants are: /u/TREB0R, /u/kurtofconspiracy, /u/TheShadowMuffin, /u/TheShadow777, 
/u/westward101, /u/Asviloka, /u/Eirathiudr, /u/blasted0glass, /u/honoredb, /u/dont_interru-, /u/eniteris, /u/crivtox, /u/PastafarianGames, /u/Anew_Returner, /u/PhillipGardener, /u/Ms_CIA, last year's contest runner /u/xamueljones, /u/ExiledQuixoticMage, /u/Kishoto, /u/Pandomy, /u/ElectorEios, /u/iamhappyinmyhouse, /u/conradin6622, and /u/JJReeve! (Sorry if I messed any of those up or missed anyone.)

Here are some guidelines for story submission: 

1. **The deadline for submissions is Sunday, October 18, 11:59PM EST.** Only participants who submit a story will have their prompt included in the prompt voting thread. If you get your story to me after the deadline but before voting is over, I'll still post it as well as your prompt, but they won't have as much time in which to accrue votes as the submissions that were turned in on time. 

2. To submit your story, please host it somewhere (e.g. Wattpad, a google doc, your personal website, etc) and PM me the link. Along with the link, please include in your PM the title of the story, the wordcount, any content warnings you think are appropriate, and any copyeditors or collaborators (see #7). 

3. Your story should be inspired by your prompt, but you are *not* required to adhere to every detail of it. Please feel comfortable exercising artistic license! For example, the prompt I received last year was about a city with four different specific guilds, but I ultimately felt my story worked better with only three of them. That sort of thing is completely fine.

4. There are no strict rules about topics you can write about, just nothing that's bigoted/hateful. Plagiarism is also out. If you're not sure if the topic you want to write about is okay, feel free to check with me. 

5. As mentioned in the previous post, stories should be at least 500 words, and they can be as long as you want. 

6. While you're writing and editing your story, feel free to get feedback from beta readers outside of r/rational. To avoid affecting the impartiality of the contest, please don't post the story publicly in r/rational spaces like the subreddit or Discord server prior to the voting, and please also don't ask anyone from outside the subreddit to come in and vote for you.

7. It is okay to write a story collaboratively with another person or have them assist you with editing, but please credit them. 

I think that's everything. I hope everyone has a good time writing their submissions! Don't stress too much about whether they're "good enough," the goal here is just for everyone to get a chance to share something creative and experience stories they wouldn't have otherwise. Good luck!
