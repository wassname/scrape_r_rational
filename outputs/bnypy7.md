  good shit

    I haven't sympathised that much with Catherine in a long time

  This AND a new MoL? What a night!

  Lots of stuff being set up here for later. Hopefully we get to see Tyrant vs Rogue Sorcerer next chapter.

  But by far one of the best things is the explicit return to Name-abilities.  This was one of my favorite parts of the earlier story, and I’m glad that Cat is returning to it!
  ```

  ```
  So how does Cat steal Name abilities again? She had *Take* when she was still the Squire, but it's been mentioned more than once that she no longer has a Name. Is she simulating it using the Night, seeing how they're both quite similar in nature? Or is it part of her overall legend considering how her cloak of souls is her most famous artifact.

  And is Thief of Star's missing aspect a clue or a red herring? Maybe the crowns are the obvious bait, and what the trap is the aspects that Cat is taking. From two Revanents, she only had the two choices from Thief of Stars, the escape one and the rarity one. The escape aspect seems like a trap, since it'll likely take her out of a jam straight into somewhere Plot relevant, because that's how stories work.

    I think Cat explained this last chapter. Not only has she been stealing powers from her enemies for a long time, both through **Take** as the Squire and later as the Sovereign of Moonless Nights, but she has also had Akua's tutelage (a Wasteland master of the profane arts), and now she is the High Priestess of a religion who's central tenets involve killing and stealing from enemies, not a mention a direct connection to the Goddesses of that religion who have been skilled in it for a millennium and set this whole thing up to begin with.

    So yeah, taking from your enemies is one of the core mechanics of the Night, so it's no big surprise Cat can do it as well.

    As for the Thief thing I've got no clue. Could very well be a trap, we'll see.

      ```
      If Nessie is correct, and Cat really does have a bad case of immortality, she might have gotten theft powers of her own independent of Night. Her associations and tutelage wouldn't hurt to make it easier/possible, though. It just all coalesces into whatever she is now.

       The old Goblin warcry of 'stab the kidney, loot the corpse' doesn't really lend itself to a Name, but it's pretty much been one of the central themes of her story. Some sort of mugging ability for Aspects or other's power (fae, god, whatever) might remain even if she were completely stripped of Night and connection to Sve Noc.
      ```

        ```
        The Irony of it all if her legend and Role coalesced into her being called Robber.
        ```

  - u/tantalum73:
    ```
    If I remember right, the Name artefact trick she has is something she worked out with help from heirophant and maybe larat. I don't think it's dependent on her having a Name
    ```
