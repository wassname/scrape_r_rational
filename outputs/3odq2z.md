## What To Do with Hard Light Constructs?

### Post:

Alright, imagine you have a cheap technology that allows you to form constructs out of light. These constructs can be as hard as steel or as soft as a pillow. They can have many different sorts of textures, be solid or liquid, can be massive or small, etc. Additionally, these constructs can be effortlessly moved around by the operating machine, which can give commands of some complexity (something like "create floating panel and use to move luggage,"  but not "create pen and write the next great American novel.")

So I'm wondering, what all do you think could be done with this tech?

  ... Everything? Built houses, cars (if the machine can use those panels to move itself), clothing, furniture, complex machinery... 

  This machine effectively solves a lot of material problems, only food is left. It also reduces the amount of labor needed like everywhere. 

  Why build a house out of matter if for a low energy cost you can have a new mansion every week or so? You'd get funny cleaning procedures: during a rainstorm, tell the machine to cocoon every real thing, then vanish the house; then re-appear it again. 

  We'd get a huge market of free, proprietary, and cracked blueprints.

  Well, that's like, half of what a goddamn power ring can do.

  So, anything a power ring can do?

  Basically anything.

  Can the hard light construct take the shape of a functional hard light construct generator?

  Do hard-light constructs have mass (if not, easy space tech)? Do they require some sort of continuous support (by that operating machine, or something else)? Depending on it's cost, it can substitute wide varieties of industry.

  Can it create molecular-sized constructs, and can those interact with matter on chemical level? If true, it can be extremely useful in pharmacy (or any synthesis) or even food industry (and eventually humans may change into light-constructed humans).

  Well first you do everything you can to hide this tech from anyone that has anything to do with any military.  If you fail this step, you won't be able to do anything with this tech, because you'll be dead...

  ```
  First, figure out how it changes the computational landscape. If something it does can be used to solve NP-hard problems, privately acquire omnipotence. If not, figure out how it changes the military landscape. If it is powerful enough to circumvent the MAD of nuclear weapons (which must be pretty damn powerful), choose the world power closest to your ideology and give it to them so they can quickly and painlessly take over the world. If not, patent it patent everywhere and use the gigantic revenue to fund value alignment research.

  How can it be used in the latter case? Most importantly, shorten the feedback loop to produce more hard light constructors. From what I'm reading, that just means circuit boards, i.e. mining, electricity and machinery. Can it command a generator to spin for a perpetuum mobile? How much power can it use in the commands? "Drill that mountain down and centrifuge it into its component atoms."

  Other than that, drive every menial laborer out of a job. (Maybe I can use some of my gigantic funds to provide global base income.)
