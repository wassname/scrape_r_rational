  Nice. I see you are writing about a chapter an hour, I did some quick math and [in a few days you will have a standard length novel ready!](https://xkcd.com/605/)

    Looking forward to reading a rational progression fic, I like the idea of the genre but everything I've read so far has been either passable (Cradle, Sufficiently advanced magic) or had absolutely atrocious writing quality (Everybody loves large chests, Savage Divinity, and (shudders) the Legend of Randidly Ghosthound.

  Any non-translations you'd recommend?

    What the fuck. Leave some writing for the rest of us mortals, buddy.

      I think they've already written it and are putting up their already written work.

    I only know of a few OEL Xianxia to recommend:

    [White Collar Cultivator](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/) was pretty good with an everyman character isekaied into a generic wuxia world and with him digging into the mental differences between mortals and cultivators. He's basically using common-sense and his mastery over bureaucracy to stay alive. Unfortunately, WCC is dead so you might not like the abrupt ending.

    [The Dao of Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic) is a fantastic story about a man from Earth who seeks out to scientifically investigate Qi and wants to completely rebuild cultivation society into one where everyone isn't back-stabbing each other all the time. Ends up spending a lot of time with him torturing....er....teaching his (involuntary) disciples.

  Some grammer errors I noticed:
  Needs a space between wore and he: "Myr recognised it as being identical to the one that Vell wore.He surmised she must be another of these “Five Spears of the School” Vell had mentioned." (Ch 6)
  Needs period: "He didn't like the comparison between him and a Lord either, the last thing he wanted was to have any common ground with the Serpent Lord"
  I'm enjoying the story so far!

      Also, while I really enjoyed it, I'm not sure it really fits into the "rational stories", at least in the sense of using science to discover new methods of doing something. Is there some of that coming in the future?

  Is there a scheduled or something ? How often are you posting chapters on average ? I've read the ones that are out, when can we expect more ?

  I'm really enjoying what you've posted so far. I like the little nods to the tropes; through moments where it's made clear that you know how these stories normally go, and that it's not going to go that way. I'm not sure it needs to stay so on the nose forever, but in the first few chapters it's good to see that it's not going to be that sort of story.

  I'm late to the party here but I thought I'd add my two cents for what it's worth.

  I've read through to chapter 5 and come away with a strong impression. I love the system but I'm disappointed at how rapid fire it was revealed.

  We cut from the protagonist's very short childhood to their already extreme competence inside of the first couple of paragraphs. I'm here for the growth, why did you cut it out? 

  I get that the big bad is meant to be much more powerful still, but without a concrete demonstration of HOW much more powerful I've only got the protagonist's word for it.

  On top of this the protagonist hasn't really got a character except for 'revenge'. Which was a little dull and unsympathetic even when the Count of Monte Cristo did it. It's certainly very passionate but I don't understand anything else about the character other than that he's very angry.

  Finally the dialogue. Everyone talks like they're writing a letter. 'Um' and 'ah' and 'er' are part of how people talk. I understand that the style of speech is meant to be old fashioned, but old fashioned speech still had slang and misunderstandings etc. It's jarring for a dirty child and a bodyguard in a poor district to engage in witty repartee.

  I'm sorry to be so negative about this. I find this story particularly frustrating because it's so close to being something I could fall in love with. The chi system is fun and has potential for lots of clever trickery. I wish you the best with your writing.
