## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I've always found clerics to be one of the more interesting of the stereotypical D&D classes, in part because so little is usually done with them. When people play or write clerics, they're usually not done with an accurate model of religion or the religious, and the whole question of faith is pretty moot when you have literal gods that produce miracles on demand.

  What I'm trying instead is a cleric who instead doesn't rely on faith or thought whatsoever, but instead is bound by actions, in a "by their fruits you will know them" kind of way. In other words, it doesn't matter what you believe, so long as you follow the path of your chosen god. Granted, this is easier when believe in your god, but it's entirely possible to be a cleric operating within the teachings of your god as set down in his holy book, while still thinking of this as merely a means to an end.

  From a making-this-into-rules perspective, each god has a set, defined model for how someone should act. The more in line you are with this model, the more power you have as a cleric, probably with some lag time and averaging of trailing behavior so that you don't become a megacleric for five minutes when you accidentally act in perfect accordance with the model. The gods don't care about intents or mens rea, just works and actions. Various actions have negative or positive weights, so e.g. killing someone is worse than stealing, and donating a loaf of bread is better than saying bless you when someone sneezes. Clerical powers are arranged in either tiers or gradients, with higher levels being accorded to those who act more in line with the model.

  From the perspective of the clerics though, all they have is a holy book, filled with fables, parables, histories, and fluff, and interpretations aren't always straightforward. You can look to other clerics for guidance, but *they* don't always know, and a lot of what you emulate might just be matters of personal preferences, superstition, or something else. If there are two big ideological camps within a clerical order devoted to the same god, and they're of equal power, what can you conclude? That both are half-right, or that whatever they're split over is irrelevant, or something else? Being a cleric comes down to collecting a bunch of evidence and then making judgment calls about what that evidence actually says, possibly with some A/B testing between clerics, if you can get past the noise involved.

  I'm pretty sure this concept works best with Blue/Orange Morality gods, ones whose paths are tough to follow, or whose ethos might initially seem nonsensical.

  (I've been pretty terribly sick the last few days, so have been focusing my attention on writing some trashy fantasy that doesn't require too much thinking on my part.)

    > If there are two big ideological camps within a clerical order devoted to the same god, and they're of equal power, what can you conclude?

    Possibility: The god likes it when his clerics vigorously debate with someone who disagrees with them, and thus *both* sides of the split are benefiting from the mere presence of the split.

    --------------

    Possibility: If there are two gods whose paths are largely compatible (example: one who doesn't care too much about what you do as long as you help the poor, and another who only cares that you don't accumulate material goods; if you're spending all your money helping the poor then they're both happy) then you can have a cleric gaining extra power from fulfilling more than one path simultaneously. Of course, this means he's a lot more restricted in his actions than a single-path Cleric.

    --------------

    Possibility: Some gods might have, as part of their Path, things that you can't easily change. So, for example, there might be a god who only accepts elves as clerics - sorry, humans and dwarves, you'll have no luck. Or one who only accepts firstborn children - sorry, everyone with older siblings. Figuring out those conditions might be particularly tough.

    --------------

    There might be virtually forgotten Blue/Orange morality type gods, whose names are only known to the most well-read scholars and whose holy books are completely lost to time. Every now and then, by complete coincidence, someone manages to stumble along their Path... he has *no* idea what he's doing that's right or wrong, but *somehow* he has clerical abilities. If it's a particularly unexpected Path (he might be gaining points from keeping his hair combed and losing points from sneezing on a Tuesday) he might *never* quite figure it out...

    Merge this last point with the two-god Cleric above, and you might have what appears to be a particularly powerful cleric of Bob who is *actually* a middling-average cleric of Bob and at the same time an accidental cleric of Fred the Forgotten. Any testing to try to figure out Bob's Path that involves this guy is going to work out badly.

    D&D clerics have always been a bit weird, since they're modeled after Christian priests, but are dedicated to individual gods out of a polytheistic pantheon. Usually one of those gods is the holy light / help the poor / heal the sick one that the Cleric was written with in mind, but we're expected to use the same basic chassis for war gods and death gods and fire gods. And it's also weird that people are dedicated to specific gods in a polytheistic world, instead of praying to the situationally appropriate ones and maybe having a personal favorite for general purposes.

    If the gods care about your behavior over a longer period of time, you get a situation where adherents look more like they're following modern religions, trying to uphold the code of right code of conduct for a Buddhist / Christian / Muslim / fire god worshiper. And those don't always agree, especially that last one, so you can't always use multiple sets of religion magic. On the other hand, if they're more like the ancient Greek gods, they don't care much about long term actions (so long as you haven't done anything to personally spite them), and they'll do their thing as long as you properly perform the ritual and sacrifice a goat. Which is barely different from a D&D Wizard, unless some of the gods hate each other, and then the overlap between who approves of who, especially if you have both code-of-conduct and sacrifice-a-goat gods, gets very interesting.

    People will try to AB test down the correct rituals and codes of conduct, but this sort of thing is something humans are terrible at. We tried it in a world without gods, and we ended up with religion, instead of nothing. So until the setting's equivalent of a Scientific Revolution, I'd expect every faith to be full of extraneous behaviors beyond what their gods actually care about, and wide variance in individual effectiveness based on personal habits that nobody identified as spiritually significant. After such, I'd expect the code of conduct style to still be poorly understood, since we're just not that good at composing that sort of test, and the ritual style to suddenly become vastly more powerful. This might be a problem if your religion magic already had a usable power level before the scientific revolution, and now it's suddenly more, unless the gods are rationing out fixed total amounts of power. If they are, the scientific revolution just makes religions harder to follow as the standards get more rigid, and any gods that get forgotten because they're too fiddly and hard to scientifically pin down suddenly start giving out way more power to the handful of people who put up with them.
    ```

    - u/TrebarTilonai:
      ```
      I think this would also work well within the context of a Discworld-esque pantheon where a God's individual power is directly drawn from their believers. Perhaps the rituals/codes of conduct do not just prove your own personal devotion to the faith but actually help to empower your diety.  


      Which could in turn cause some interesting interactions with a Scientific Revolution kind of setting. After all, if Gods are not just forces of nature or ritual vending machines that only respond to certain inputs, then there is room for their own decision making. If AB testing allows their followers to perfect the codes of conduct that empower them, then most Gods will get a massive power boost. They, in turn, could utilize that power in unexpected ways. And as a consequence, maybe the required rituals/conducts change as well. It's a lot harder to pin down the laws of natures when those laws might get impacted by the mood/actions of a third-party diety.
      ```

    - u/MutantMannequin:
      ```
      How would you go about testing which codes of conduct effectively court divine favor? Isolating groups of people with strict, spartan lifestyles, then introducing a new behavior to see if it has an impact?

      Wait. Isolated groups of people with strict, spartan lifestyles? [That sounds familiar.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monasticism)

    > The gods don't care about intents or mens rea, just works and actions

    I feel like you're leaving something interesting on the table here. If intent matters, it opens up interesting conundrums, for example the UNSONG paradox >!how does one commit evil acts to get into hell if doing so would be for the greater good and therefore not counted as evil?!<

    And in any case, even if intent doesn't matter ... how do people know that? Just as they can't know for sure what actions the gods like, they couldn't be sure intent doesn't matter (*especially* since it would be impossible to A/B for, by its nature, although you could do observational studies). So I imagine there would be lots of people going around believing that intent matters, and lots of people going around believing that it doesn't.
    ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    Considering that you'd have a polytheistic setting, as long as there's no exclusivity rules, I would expect that the optimal strategy for clerics would probably be to select a primary deity, possibly one or more compatible secondary deities, and then adopt a handful of practices from other tertiary deities that could provide some modicum of power with relatively minimal cost. Essentially, each person assembles their own mini-pantheon from the full set of gods.

    While individualized pantheons would reflect the things that people are comfortable with doing (or not doing), they would also probably be constructed at least in part to optimize the amount of power you get. Most people would probably accept some rather significant restrictions or requirements in their lives if they could get magical powers or substantial divine boons for doing so.

    With that in mind, if you want to ensure that you don't have a situation where pretty much everyone follows the same cookie-cutter paths-of-least-resistance, you'd need to ensure that the restrictions (or requirements) are generally substantial, and the comparatively meager benefits are only worthwhile to a small group of people, quite possibly people who coincidentally can't/won't do the restricted activity anyway.

    I assume you're aware of the difference between [orthodoxy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Orthodoxy) and [orthopraxy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Orthopraxy), but in case you aren't, this is actually in line with many older religions: the gods don't care what you believe, so long as you carry out the rituals correctly. 

    I'm very much in favor of clerics who work like this.

  I have to say: I love speedrunning. Outside of esports and really in-depth analysis videos, those guys are some of the highest experts in the games they play (well, a sizable aspect of it).

  It's an odd combination of mastering the game to the point where you can kill incredibly hard bosses in literal seconds, as well as finding out and exploiting glitches that let you skip half of the game while traversing at the speed of sound. 

  And I guess I wonder: how can one make a story containing those elements?  

  One of the bigger ideas I had is essentially a Sword Arts Online fanfic, except the protagonist is actually part of a speedrunner/explorer guild.  Instead of optimizing their build or going on raids, they focus solely on learning and exploiting game mechanics in order to skip this deadly game.  
  Imagine stuff like:  
  * Utilizing a weird combination of skills and equipment (stamina enchancers + a hilariously long range charge ability) in order to achieve flight, which allows to go out of bounds of the game. 
  * Building off of this, remember the fuckhuge flying castle that SAO is set in? How about climbing on the side of it, in order to skip the floors and go to the top? 
  * Trying all crafting combinations and seeing if there are any duplication glitches, in order to destroy grind-based economy. 
  * Finding out if you can cheese bosses, e.g. by entering the arena but then getting into an inaccessible spot, then peppering the monsters with whatever long-range abilities you have available. 

  Now, while it seems to side-step the danger of the setting itself, it introduces a whole new set of challenges. After all, if you break your way to the highest floor, you'll be facing the highest boss without necessary stats or equipment. That's ignoring the fact that... there is no manual for this, every glitch and skip is a discovery. On top of that, those who worked with computers in general know- the damned thing can break for no reason at all.  
  In this way, it becomes something of a rigorous scientific endeavor, and something of randomness and wonder of magic.

  This story has a second aspect of it: the homicidal developer himself. While mostly focused on being a normal player, I imagine he makes sure his game runs smoothly (since he's kinda the only guy left with admin privileges).  
  What would be his reaction to finding out his game is mastered, yet also broken, in such way? Would it be a ingenious solution to a puzzle he left, or a bunch of sore losers cheating their way out? How would he even find out, outside of truly game-breaking glitches? 

  And, in the end... I kind of don't know where I could take this concept further?  I mean, there are ton of themes/topics to pick up (relation of those speedrunners to other players or Kaiba himself, wonder of discovery and the grudging work of scientific method), but... I feel like there are whole levels worth of unexplored ideas here.

    I don't think you'll have any problems expanding on the concept or finding interesting ideas and themes to explore. The problem with stories involving speedrunning is that a big part of it is grinding, which in itself wouldn't be a problem, after all LitRPG is fairly successful genre despite its nicheness, but the grind involved in speedrunning isn't the sort where you can constantly watch numbers go up (or in this case, down), it's a skill that involves repeating the same specific set of actions over and over again and that isn't something that translates well to other forms of entertainment and media.

    Watching 200 or 300 hours of someone playing Ocarina of Time until they're good enough to hit world record pace is a very different experience than it would be to read about it.

    So, if you want to write something entertaining with speedrunning at the core, you'll likely want to approach it in a similar manner to what AGDQ/SGDQ and SummoningSalt do: presenting it as if it were a sport or competition where people are only exposed to the end result of the grinding.

    Your idea of the SAO fanfic is interesting, but it's also something that was already addressed in its story (more so in the Light Novels than the actual show itself), with beta testers like Kirito or Argo having an edge over the rest of the players, essentially playing a similar role to that of a speedrunner except without taking away any of the actual stakes involved (since they didn't get farther than the first 8 floors). Also, glitches were essentially patched out live through many of the AIs that the game had monitoring the players, with Yui being the only exception (and IIRC the game itself had entire systems dedicated to keeping the game's economy safe). Also, since Kayaba was a player himself (and a very important one at that) any glitches or exploits that reached his ears would likely have been patched out the next day.

    I think if you want to introduce the idea of speedrunning to SAO you would have to change things around so a healthy speedrunning community could form before the story's start. Maybe an AU where the game didn't trap its players until it's international release 6 or 7 months after the initial Japanese-only release. Also, maybe something along the lines of a 'hacker's guild' was part of Kayaba's plan or at least something he would tolerate and look the other way for, so long as it didn't disrupt or get in the way of his 'dream' (so no killing the final boss after only 2 weeks in). You could have a faction that directly opposes this Hacker's Guild and instead reports any glitches found to the GMs with a bounty system in place (so the bigger the glitch, the bigger the reward). And if you want something like that to be a bit more exclusive (after all, why wouldn't everyone just join the Hacker's Guild if it's such a convenient place?), have it so you can't be in more than one of those guilds/factions at a time (which I think the game already does?) and the requirements for joining are very steep (someone in the speedrunning community has to vouch for you, or you have to contribute a glitch of your own). The involvement of the AIs is something that could be written away, maybe for each floor cleared less of them are active in order to save resources, or maybe the thing with Yui happens earlier than it does in canon and her elimination leaves the game open for glitches. It could also be an AU where Kirito defeats Kayaba in the 75th floor but they still aren't able to leave until they finish the game, and without admin supervision (and the AIs being almost entirely deactivated) they are able to start running wild with any exploits they find. Maybe some of the players that made it that far don't want the game to end and start planning or looking for a way to use an exploit to keep everyone inside.

    So yeah, there are lots of directions you could take this in, even make it so it's a sort of cat and mouse kind of story between the factions and the GMs, with the endless cycle of: patch a exploit > players find a way to circumvent it > patch that too, as the main focus of the story, escalating until things reach the level of ridiculousness that speedrunning is known for. E.g. Players find a way to equip a few weapons with high requirements by leaving their menu open, materializing a stack of some rare monster drop, equipping and unequipping some rings given only in the tutorial city, all while looking up at the ceiling and at a specific time, like 3:18 a.m, etc. You could write a little arc about some players using those ridiculous methods to do some Arbitrary Code Execution (pretty much what Kirito does to save Yui) and using that to fuck with the game's code or even turning Kayaba and any of the other GMs (if there are any) into actual players. Maybe one of the players that does that is actually able to leave the game.

    As far as actually writing anything like this or any idea that you come up with (and tying back to what I wrote at the beginning), I believe it would probably be best if the protagonist was someone who is familiar with games, or pretty much a gamer, but not with speedrunning in specific. So maybe they luck out and find a glitch that allows them to join the Speedrunner/Hacker's guild, but they're pretty much a newbie at any of it, and a big time spent in the guild is about unlearning gaming habits and starting to think outside of the box, trying to outsmart and game the system (and other players), and trying out anything that comes to mind and would help. I think following the journey of someone like that would be more interesting than reading about some pro SAO speedrunner that turns any of the game's stakes into a joke as soon as they log in. Not that that wouldn't be an interesting thing to read in itself, but it probably would be better served as a secondary character POV that you only get once every few chapters, or maybe make it so the story's interludes are from the admins and speedrunners' POV. My point is that classic speedrunning wouldn't be the most engaging thing to read about, and an outsider's perspective (basically a fish out of water story) would be more interesting than following a perfect unkillable MC that is able to do everything right at the first try. So basically, avoid the biggest mistake that SAO made: a Gary Stu MC.

    Edit: I think a good take on this would be something along the lines of Empires of EVE. A book that narrates some of the most important events in EVE's history (online MMO if you aren't familiar with it) through the point of view of many different characters, following their stories in and out of the game and presenting everything in a way that is easy to follow, even to those that aren't familiar or haven't ever played EVE in their lives. I think EVE is the closest thing to SAO we have IRL for now, as far as the game's scope and real life stakes go (no, players haven't died irl because they died in the game, but there have been wars inside the game that costed millions in real life dollaridoos, so they got that going).

      Thank you for the thorough reply. This is exactly what I hoped for, posting here.

      I completely agree with making the speedrun closer to a sport, yet I think it's possible to just... make the grind part of background routine. "Today I woke up, ate breakfast, ran through Emerald Forest 10 times as usual, then..."

      I admit to not having *read* the novel itself, and I see that I have to either do that or write about an SAO inspired game. And yeah- AU is really the way to go, *especially* with bugfixing AIs, though I can't imagine those bots beating a proper programmer (like natural regeneration vs. a surgeon operating).

      I literally haven't considered anyone actually *opposing* them, so that's a whole new dimension of challenge to consider. And I can see that happening too- both from Kayaba's perspective (outsorcing work to the masses) and actual snitches (combination of greed, hopelessness and not wanting to piss of the big GM).

      Having a noob start the show is probably for the best, though I'll take your idea of multiple PoVs, since I want to show/see variety of ways the game can be broken- a crafter/explorer will have a different experience from a raid tank, after all.

      Though I disagree with a speedrunner being overpowered. While there are games that can be made into a joke by a pro, a death-game MMO is different enough that they could become... something like a mage- squishy overall (since they don't optimize for normal gameplay), but holding some amazing abilities in right circumstances.

      And IRL MMO cash money being the stakes of the game... I gotta tell you- played Entropia Universe (irl = digital money there as well) in way back when, and I can already *see* an alternative fic with speedrunners already, so thanks for the inspiration!

        >make the grind part of background routine

        Yeah, I considered that too while writing my reply, the whole comparison with LitRPGs was with that in mind. Developing a skill isn't as easy to portrait as just the numbers going up, and if you shove too much into the background you kind of run the risk of breaking your readers' suspension of disbelief, where they can't believe that is 'just' something the MC can do now, or the progression of power doesn't scale well with the perceived amount of training, and thus making it feel a bit asspull-ish. I think one example of that would be Worth The Candle, with the protagonist receiving sudden power spikes that instantly take away any kind of perceived stakes, compared to Mother of Learning where you can see the protag's power grow naturally and you're never quite sure if what he has available will be enough. It's a tricky thing, so yeah, you'd be writing as if it were a sport or some martial arts of sorts, rather than a videogame. You can do both of course, but rarely are stats relevant for speedrunning, and when they are it's very sporadically compared to what other stories involving videogames use.

        >I literally haven't considered anyone actually opposing them, so that's a whole new dimension of challenge to consider. And I can see that happening too- both from Kayaba's perspective (outsorcing work to the masses) and actual snitches (combination of greed, hopelessness and not wanting to piss of the big GM).

        Another fun angle could be the players finding a way to fix the bug themselves, or putting up some kind of community effort in order to 'patch' an exploit that could fuck over everyone, at least until a GM is notified, that is if your story has a more hands-off approach than SAO does.

        >though I can't imagine those bots beating a proper programmer

        I'm preeety sure Yui would be easily able to pass the turing test, the show (and the novel, to some extent) kind of glosses over it, but the implication is that in order for the Cardinal system to run properly (and independent of an actual group of programmers, thus letting Kayaba do his thing alone, as the sole programmer/GM) it has a bunch of AIs working as bots and taking care of any anomalies that take place. Mind you, as I said, it's kind of glossed over so we don't get many details, but this is the rational sub and that's what would make the most sense given what Kayaba wanted to accomplish (and only by himself).

        >Though I disagree with a speedrunner being overpowered. While there are games that can be made into a joke by a pro, a death-game MMO is different enough that they could become... something like a mage- squishy overall (since they don't optimize for normal gameplay), but holding some amazing abilities in right circumstances.

        I don't have much experience with MMOs, so I don't know how the idea of a 'speedrunner' translates into that, but I can see them becoming leaders whenever they have to take down bosses and taking on tactician/strategist roles as an alternative for those that wouldn't want to risk their lives by being on the front lines. Being trapped in a game that you speedrun and know like the back of your hand is gonna make you way more confident than a casual or even a normal-hardcore player, but being confident doesn't make you immune to fear of death ;) specially if the game is constantly evolving or the GMs straight up change or add/remove levels and other things, etc.

        Still, my point was more about how enjoyable that POV would be for a protagonist. The pro and confident speedrunner who knows the game inside out is fun and interesting, but maybe it's something that could work best if done sporadically. I can't think of many examples, but one that comes to mind is the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Jack Sparrow is a very fun character that makes any scene he's in better, but he works best when he isn't the hero-protagonist. Anyways, you could still make it work, provided your writing is good or consistent, it ultimately depends on what you're aiming for, if you're just writing for yourself then it doesn't matter much, but if you're writing so others can enjoy it too then you have to keep these kind of things in mind.

        >And IRL MMO cash money being the stakes of the game... I gotta tell you- played Entropia Universe (irl = digital money there as well) in way back when, and I can already see an alternative fic with speedrunners already, so thanks for the inspiration!

        Never heard of it, but that's on me, and am glad to be of help! I think anything MMO-related is still very unique, as far as writing goes, so there are many directions you can take this in while remaining wholly-original. Don't be afraid of ditching the SAO or Entropia Universe settings if they feel too cramped or limiting! Making your own world is fun too, but also don't lose yourself in the worldbuilding, that's an easy trap to fall into~

    You might want to take a look at [Isekai Speedrun](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun). It approaches the Isekai genre from exactly this angle, though the writing quality is mediocre and I ended up dropping it after it didn't get better. Still, it might have some things to offer for you, in terms of do's or dont's, if you know what you're looking for.

    I think the way I would approach a work about/featuring speedrunning in a work of prose fiction would probably be taking one of those in-depth analysis videos (e.g. tomatoanus) and making it really more about the interesting mini-stories.

    Actual speedrunners don't focus all that much on the game, because most things are automatic, and the things that aren't tend to be frame-perfect tricks or mechanically precise executions of glitches. There's a bunch of grind to speedrunning, and if you watch speedrunners on Twitch (or AGDQ), most of them aren't talking about the game, they're just chatting about other stuff, reading chat when they know they don't need to be looking at the screen, etc. Most of the drama comes from being on a hot run with multiple gold segments, or trying to nab a record using a newly discovered exploit, and it seems hard to do a prose version of that.

    A speedrunning fic borrowing from an analysis video would instead be a series of mini-stories, describing some funky mechanic that's got broken wide open more and more, paying some attention to the speedrunning history of the game, to how these exploits were found, etc. Watching someone do an accelerated back hop is ... well, fine, I guess, but less so the third or fourth, or eighteenth time. But what gets *me* is hearing the trick described and being told how some set of sensible instructions that were programmed into the game resulted in this weird and exploitable glitch, which is where a lot of the fun is.

    Per SAO, speedrunning an MMO is ... well, I'm not going to say that it's never done, because back when I was deep into WoW I would participate in "first to 60" races when a new server would open, and obviously there's stuff like twinking alts or running newbies through a dungeon, or soloing team content, which has some of the same flavor. But it's really different, because an MMO is living in a way that most speedrun games are not, and getting through content as fast as possible doesn't hold much of the same appeal, especially since the endgame is way different.
