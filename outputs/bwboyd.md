## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I watched Good Omens the six-part TV series that came out Friday. TL;DR review: Read the book if you haven't, miniseries is decent but not amazing.

  The novel Good Omens by Gaiman and Pratchett was one of my favourites of all time, and I've read and reread it kind of a lot. Strongly recommend the novel - it is excellent, and if not exactly 'rational' it has a strongly humanist message that is certainly rational-adjacent in theme. About the end of the world as foretold in Christian eschatology, it's a witty and humorous book that ultimately has a great fast-moving plot and basically no problems or defects of any sort.

  Overall, it felt like the TV series stuck to the novel very hard - possibly to the detriment of the series as a whole. They were dedicated to using most every joke and plot point from the novel, even when it didn't make sense necessarily with the medium or the updated setting. The miniseries was definitely set in the present day, i.e. ~2019ish, but the novel was grounded in the time and place of it's publication date, 1990, - so certain plot points like >!Crowley's tape ansaphone!< feel wildly out of setting / out of character for a 2019 Crowley archetypal character. I'd have prefered it if they either made it a period piece set in the early 90s, or updated the entire plot. The decision to make Anathema a well-off American heiress rather than the novel's coding of her as poor to middle class UK native was weird, and introduced a bunch of plot and character inconsistency for no perceptible gain. The narration of the story got quite heavy-handed at times, explaining things that were obvious to those paying attention, and basically ruining what could have been a couple of decent jokes by overexplaining and slowing them down too much - it was overused.

  A huge amount of Good Omens novel fanfic is/was dedicated to the Crowley/Aziraphale ship, which the TV series did not make explicit but definitely hinted more heavily than the novel did, and the series focused more on them as characters than anyone else. This is probably for the best because Tenant's Crowley and Sheen's Aziraphale are the best characters and actors in the whole thing, and focusing on their relationship was definitely fun. There's a lot of stuff with Adam that got cut and it hurt the plot a bit IMO but on the other hand the children actors gave reasonably good performances for child actors, and thus were mediocre at best by the more stringent standards we'd apply to adults, so it's probably overall for the best.

  There's also some weird editing. A couple of jokes still show up in the miniseries without the same setup/payoff that they had in the novel, so it feels weird and out of place to have them in there - for example, the Des Moines Elvis thing had no payoff but Elvis was still in the Des Moines scene.

  I liked a lot of it, but overall the book still remains a must-read while the miniseries is more of a 'if you're bored' recommendation.

    Did it? I can't think of anything right now, while on the other hand, considering Agnes Nutter's willingness to pass on excruciatingly precise prophecies for the benefit of her descendants, it'd have been weird if she didn't give them something to become filthy rich off.

    > There's also some weird editing.

    I felt that happened especially in episode 5. The direction was all over the place. Still, I enjoyed it as a whole, and as you said, Tennant and Sheen as Crowley and Aziraphale are a joy to watch. Really fun.

    On a related note, I guess this is as good a time as any to mention to anyone who's reading this that if they lived under a rock until now, like Pratchett-esque British humour and unusual takes on Biblical canon, well, then they really really really ought to check Scott Alexander's *Unsong*.

    One thing that was missing was the other four riders of the apocalypse, but other than that I think they hit almost every point.

  Does anyone have recommendations on how to find good content? Currently my methods are this thread, asking in subreddits like /r/books or /r/anime if I have something somewhat specific I'm looking for, and just browsing the front pages of YouTube and Netflix. I feel like I could be doing much better, there're enormous amounts of content in the world to read and watch, yet I somehow have difficulty identifying content I'd like to read and watch.

    Sorting by popular on novelupdates, royalroad, and the various writing forums (sufficient velocity, space battles, etc.).

    Sort by number of reviews on fanfiction.net / fictionpress. If you have authors you like on those sites, I've found some good stuff by going to their personal Favorites page. (This works well on Literotica if you read smut, too).

    Look at recommendation threads in r/hpfanfiction and r/narutofanfiction if you're into those fandoms at all.

    Examples on TV Tropes' pages.

    Find a work you like on Amazon and browse through the "other people bought" suggestions.

    For Netflix/Amazon, there's apps like Flickmetrix.

    It's been a while since I sought out anime, but I used to use Anirec.com which looks like it's now anime-planet and still has a recommendation system. People write out what they think is similar about the recommended series so you have an idea if it's what you're looking for.

    Like anime, I don't read much manga anymore but I've always found the ratings on Baka-Updates to be pretty good ([stats page](https://www.mangaupdates.com/stats.html?period=month12)). Lotta light novel crossovers get rated highly, though.

    People make some good lists on Goodreads, including top picks for genres you're fond of. The sidebar giving recommended "if you liked..." on that site has never been very good for me, though.

    Can be fun to browse r/booksuggestions.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Go to the fandoms of works you like Fanfiction.net and ao3. Then use these filter heuristics:

    Fanfiction.net

    * words - over 10k (to get ongoing stuff)  
    * updated in last six months OR complete to avoid deadfics. 
    * sort by follows (you want at least a hundred on any large to medium fandom, usually)  
    *without romance/with adventureb to get a story with a plot, the opposite to get fluff

    AO3

    * go to the "advanced search options" page. 
    * use your fandom name. 
    * greater than ten kudos. 
    * no explicit content (unless you want that)  
    * no crossovers (or you'll get stories with retarded amounts of tags that are just authors exploiting AO3 to get subscribers for their vast list of oneshots)
    ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

    For anime I feel like there's extensive recommendation threads on r/anime as well as [a famous "find your ideal anime" flowchart](https://imgur.com/gallery/yPVPj9Q). And if you care to share with me your MAL or just a list of shows you liked, I guess I can hazard some suggestions... 

    For books, maybe try to browse GoodReads? I'm not sure what's a good way, sifting through lots of crap is always almost inevitable before you find the good stuff. Usually having like-minded people to talk with about these things is your best bet, because what they liked, you will probably like too.

    Oh and if you like hard sci-fi and haven't read anything by Greg Egan, read Greg Egan. There, you may have solved your problems for a little while.

  Are there any good, well-written, non-cookie-cutter, not-full-of-unhappy novels on Kindle these days?  I was originally looking for English original light novels, but really I'll take anything that matches up to the best of SpaceBattles in enjoyability or the best of Questionable Questing in intelligence.  (No Earthfic please.)

  PS: I am genuinely scared of whatever is happening to the titles of the dungeon and harem books proliferating in Amazon's system.  It looks like someone achieved AI-equivalent humans.
  ```

  - u/foveros:
    ```
    Since you made the mention, what are the best of SpaceBattles in enjoyability or the best of Questionable Questing in intelligence? I recently started the Erogamer in QQ and was really impressed, but I haven't really explored these sites much.

    A short list of title drops will do, I can google.
    ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      Are you looking for porn, plot, or mix of both?

      QuestionableQuesting is always very YMMV. Other than Erogamer, another story that was mentioned around here before is [A Rousing Rebirth](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/a-rousing-rebirth-veilfall-original.5813/). Spoilery trigger warnings : >!incest, ephebophilia!<

        I'm enjoying the Erogamer despite the porn, not because of it. Still, the chapters where characters are thinking about cosmic implications are just so well written...

        On space battles the fics I have read and enjoyed are the games we play and purple days. Any as good there?

    I've recommended the [Masters and Mages](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30344847) series a few times here already, but that's because it really is good. The first part of the first book especially was a breath of fresh air for me, just a young guy with the world at his feet thinking about his situation and his prospects, working out his problems in his head. And it was interesting! 

    I wouldn't say it's rational(the magic system is a bit fuzzy, especially in the second book), but the author is a history buff--medieval scholar and HEMA practitioner-- and actually put some thought into the history of the world, into why politics are the way they are and how the conflicts that the story revolves around actually came about. Like I said, it's the first fantasy book in a while that felt like it broke the mold. 

    Another story in the vein of a [Bildungsroman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman) is [The First Step](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44327636-the-first-step), this time a competently written xianxia(what a rarity!). Another story of the guy with the world at his feet, on a journey of discovery. Pretty good, and unlike in Cradle, the setting feels very chinese.
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    * I liked Martha Wells' Murderbot series. Mostly, the main character spends its time being mad about how incompetent humans are at everything.
    * You might like The Engineer by Darren M. Handshaw. It's a kind of post apocalypse, but not the awful depressing kind. The main character also does realistic engineering (mostly stuff you could realistically achieve with medieval tech). I didn't finish it but I don't really remember why.
    * I quite liked pretty much all of Drew Hayes' novels, they're generally enjoyable and not about depressed or depressing people.
    * I also really liked Edward W. Robinson's Cycle of Arawn series - it's got a main character who grows powerful over time thanks to intelligently exploring and using his powers, and is generally an enjoyable swords and sorcery adventure.
    * Similarly, Mark Lawrence's Prince of Thorns series is also quite good - bad things happen to the main character, but he doesn't let that get him down. He turns in to the bad thing that happens to other people. The whole series is very Dying Earth, too, which is fun.

    Bujold, and Pratchett are the strongest recs I have for "Not Dark", "Original" and "Smart". But I would be quite surprised if you had not already read those. 

    Graydon Saunders is very much what you are looking for, I think, but has strong objections to amazon, so is not available there (Got his works via google play, which is convenient enough)

    Egan, Vinge are also good, but occasionally dark. Never oppressively  so, however.

    You may know most of these, and they're mostly from 2017 or earlier as I haven't really had time to look for recent gems, but I wonder if these match the non-cookie-cutter requirement:

    - [Craft sequence](https://www.goodreads.com/series/91029-craft-sequence) by Max Gladstone (book 1 2012 - book 6 2017)
    - [Wayfarers](https://www.goodreads.com/series/170872-wayfarers) by Becky Chambers (2014, 2016, 2018): 
    - Guy Gavriel Kay?
    - [Penric & Desdemona](https://www.goodreads.com/series/183152-penric-and-desdemona-publication-order) series by LM Bujold 


    I guess most of these contain some amount of unhappy, I'm not sure if you're looking for books that don't contain any suffering or just ones where it is not all there is to the book :P
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      All stories contain some people suffering some of the time, but there's some kind of modern plague of stories that are just Unhappy People Doing Unhappy Things.  It probably accounts for a lot of the popularity of isekai stories; in that people have nothing else to read that is not an endless desert of sadness.

    Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. You cant just say that it looks like someone achieved AI equivalent humans and leave it at that. It would be like saying "Aliens!" and leaving it at that.

    I'm glancing through the titles. Theres some pretty creative titles, but none of the titles look superhumanly creative. Did the titles suddenly and dramatically increase in creativity? But I dont know what the titles were like before, nor what the time frame for the change was, so I have no way to check this for myself. Could you please elaborate on why you think it looks like the more recent titles were generated by AI equivalent humans? (Assuming I am understanding what you said correctly). Why do you believe what you believe?
    ```

      - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
        ```
        I understand if you're really busy and don't feel like this question is worth answering, but when ELIEZER YUDKOWSKY says he's scared of possiblity of AI-Equivalent humans, that sounds like "I think a human may have gone FOOM" and that can raise some alarm. So I just want to double check to make sure I'm understanding correctly, that that isn't what you meant.

        Thanks!

          > AI-Equivalent humans, that sounds like "I think a human may have gone FOOM"

          That's not what he's saying. AI-Equivalent humans wouldn't be humans that have gone FOOM, because AI has not gone FOOM. Human-Equivalent AI would be an extraordinary claim; AI-Equivalent Humans are just humans that generate slightly different versions of the same repetitive content over and over again, like modern AIs do. The recent titles look like they were created by AI-like humans because they are boring and repetitive. In other words, Eliezer is being cute here, not serious.

  - u/CaseyAshford:
    ```
    I think that you might enjoy the work of Christopher Nuttall. He is not an explicitly "rational" author but many of the themes that he explores are closely related and his characters are generally well developed.

    Nuttall is a prolific writer, so I would recommend starting with the Ark Royal series as it exemplifies much of his writing style. It is relative cheap but if you are still uncertain than you can find a large sample of the text on his website.

    The anime Re:Zero has the protagonist return to certain “checkpoints” after dying, and the problem solving involves using multiple loops to get to a good resolution.

He do not keep unlocking similar skills, the story didn't work that way. Instead, before a reincarnation, he's offered, other than unlocking new skills, some experience to carry over. The new incarnation is not exactly similar either, there's always variation that's outside his control. Interesting world building, simplistic protagonist, increasingly challenging adversary it triggers survival motive.

  In my search for a work that has the same appeal as Worth the Candle, I came across [Isekai Speedrun](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun), a complete webnovel with 61 chapters. The premise is that the MC finds himself in a game; the twist is that the game is both grimdark and full of glitches which made it popular in the speedrunning community, of which the MC is a member.

  I enjoyed the MC's efforts to apply his speedrunning knowledge to his predicament, testing out which exploits still work and taking advantage of memorised secrets like it's a time loop story. The setting is fairly original and evocative, and I liked the discussion of the video game and anime, in particular their NGE-like production history. There seems to be an intentional contrast between the bleak backstory and the goofy attempts to use glitches, and between the grim amorality of everyone native to the world and the upbeat MC. This dissonance probably won't appeal to everyone, but I found it funny.

  However, it could use some editing, and the climax and revelations at the end fell flat. Partially that's due to the speedrunning conceit: it's hard to maintain tension when glitches and foreknowledge are the MC's main tools. I also found the character development to be weak; unlike WtC the effects of the MC on the other characters and vice-versa weren't explored very well.

  TL;DR: If you liked the first dozen chapters of Worth the Candle, you might have fun with the first dozen chapters of [Isekai Speedrun](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun). Beyond that, it probably depends on your tolerance for the writing and whether you enjoy the asides and dissonance.

    So, I gave Isskai Speedrun a shot. I like the premise and I've only read one or two other speedrunning isekais so that aspect was relatively fresh.

    But, man, I'm about 70% of the way through the story and I have to drop it. The MC is just too fragrantly annoying. I think his stream-of-conscioisness one-liners are supposed to be coming from a place of nervousness but after the first 10-15 chapters there's no accompanying sense of danger or feeling of exploration to really justify them. He's just going through the motions, making weebo jokes and acting random.

    Interpreting time loop on the more liberal side:

    Primer (movie): my favorite movie, some engineers develop boxes that can bring them back in time, but only as far back as the box was turned on. Gambit pileup ensues.

    Looper (movie): have not watched yet, but have heard it’s good.

    Re:Zero (anime): isekai guy returns to “checkpoints” of a sort whenever he dies, uses this power to try and achieve a good route through life.

    All You Need is Kill (light novel): soldier, basically same power, returning by death, fighting alien invasion. They also made a nice live action movie adaptation.

    Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (web novel): time turners get used, much more than in the Rowling novels.

    Puella Magi Madoka Magica: mega spoilers, and I’m on mobile so let me know if you want to know the spoilers. It has (spoilery) time loops.

    And also, here is a thread of more “classic” SF story recommendations, also asking for time loops: https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/1pa4w4/looking_for_time_loop_stories_any_good/

    Bonus anime rec: Mirai Nikki; there are not really time loops, but more seeing the future. It is not quite so “hard”, but I found it quite enjoyable.

      Seconding Dealing with Dragons and sequels. Not rational per se, but they're hilarious fantasy deconstruction.

      The "Defeat the dragon and win the princess" mechanic is developed into something like Tinder for royalty.

      I've got to ask why I keep seeing this recommended. I remember a few months back giving it a shot and it seemed almost anti-rational and mostly just a super angsty slice of life fic where everyone panders to the MC because she's cute and talented. I think I stopped reading because, aside from the above, she kept using her lethal poisons that kill in minutes instead of her non-lethal poisons that can incapacitate someone almost instantaneously, and the result was her nearly dying on multiple occasions.
      ```

      - u/iftttAcct2:
        ```
        It's actually been a while since I read it, but I remember the MC being an OP character who still has foibles and missteps which scratches a huge itch for me.

  I wondered why many ratfic protagonist motivation is about the greater good. Like minimizing suffering, eliminating work (pfft), societal revolution, or even put an end to death. I just read:

  \- [Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) \[8/10 match to my taste if I don't have personal dislike toward fanfic, I read it because I don't have original fic on reading backlog\], a fantastic good vs evil series that's not fun to read toward the end. 

  \- [Bluer Shade of White](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White) \[9/10, same\], a thought provoking gentle God concept that reeks of AI hard-on, and 

  \- [A Hero's War](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War) \[7/10\] A kingdom building with awful choice for POV characters.

  I'm seeking a fiction where the protagonist has more basic motive. Something like greed, lust, or revenge. Survival also works, but I'd rather not read it if character's adversary is artificially created (like dungeon where stronger and stronger adventurer keep coming). But definitely not the greater good motive (ew). Same criteria as [the last time I post a request](https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bqwp8b/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/eobhusd/). But this time, I'd like it if it's freely available. Thank you.

    Most ratfic inherently hews to the Effective Altruist party line of "a rational and moral agent should try to maximize their positive impact on the world," so it's no surprise this sub is full of such things.

    That said, the 3 protags of Pokemon: Origin of Species all have deeply personally-motivated goals, and while 2/3 have some sort of "greater good" in mind (ending death/general futurism and ending pokemon and human suffering respectively), they're not nearly as in-your-face about it as HJPEV. The third protag just wants to be a really good pokemon trainer.

    It's also extremely well-written and very fun.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Most protagonists, period, care about the greater good. Rational protagonists are just better at it, like they are at everything else. (Except social interaction.)
    ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      Wow, that sounds arrogant. Have you not think about villain protagonist?
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        They form a pretty small subset of protagonists. Just think of all the works in the public consciousness. Superhero movies, with rare exceptions like deadpool, typically feature people working for the greater good. Hell, marvel movies even have their villains (i.e., thanos) working for the greater good.
        ```

        - u/sambelulek:
          ```
          I suppose MCU Thanos must be written that way so that it appeals to general movie-goer. I heard, though, that Thanos actually do what he did because he's enamoured by an incarnation of Death, the sexy one. I admit I do not look deep into the lore, but whatever altruistic reason he get along the way, his root cause is courting that Death.

          But my point is we're not general public. We seek a rational protagonist who achieve his goal without abandoning his mindful rationality. Despite adversary that's more, or at least equally, competent. Despite the world that's already so established the free lunch is no longer exist. And I personally wish for a protagonist who's utterly selfish. I think, it's easier to understand that kind of character.
