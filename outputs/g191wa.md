  ```
  There's literally nothing that can possibly go wrong with Eugene knowing about Athos' skills. Nothing at all.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Gosh, people are so *suspicious*!  We've just seen what a nice guy he is -- he even regards Athos as his brother!  Why would you assume he'll do something bad?  Tsk, tsk.
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      On that note, Marcus' indignance about being asked about his stats (and Eugene hiding the evidence of their conversation) makes a great little piece of dramatic irony.
      ```

    - u/masterax2000:
      ```
      ...I LITERALLY thought that he wasn't so bad this chapter. I feel a little silly that I'm apparently the only one who fell for this. :/
      ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  The Skillweb finally makes an appearance.

  This was originally going to be the arrival in Hellsport, but I decided it was long enough and this was a good place to stop. Should be able to get there next chapter.
  ```

- u/CorneliusPhi:
  ```
  Edgar is definitely going to try to kill Athos at some point
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    *sigh*  Another suspicious person, thinking that Eugene is untrustworthy.  Tsk, tsk.
    ```

- u/sparr:
  ```
  So, it sounds like >!Rite of Departure is how a dying person... gives their skills away? Summons someone to receive them?!<
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    Maybe just a fancy name for a cup of hemlock surrounded by one's closest friends or family and far away from other people or animals?
    ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    It's when you >!want to die with dignity and pass your Skills on to friends/family.  First you unlock as many of the minor ones as possible and have the friends/family buy them and then you go somewhere private and commit suicide with all of he friends/family standing around you and maybe some mice to soak up any extra Skills that there aren't enough people to get.!<
    ```

    - u/CorneliusPhi:
      ```
      >!I'm assuming you'd want to burn the area around the rite in order to prevent skills from going to random wild animals?!<
      ```

      - u/gryfft:
        ```
        Or suddenly planeshifted household pets.
        ```

        - u/CorneliusPhi:
          ```
          yeah I mean there's probably no way to stop that
          ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  Athos is very trusting which is adorable to see, but I sooooo wish that he had kept that skill secret.......
  ```

- u/sparr:
  ```
  Anyone else weirded out at the "EDIT" in the skill description calling Athos out by name?
  ```

- u/sparr:
  ```
  > 14,763 Attunement ... the 1,296 ... after the prices reset.

  Unless it jumped from 1300 to 15000 in one step, which the earlier text suggests not, that means there was an in between step, which means he probably spent 2-5x the regular cost on some other skill. That's unfortunate; patience would pay off a lot here. I hope he figures[/d] that out.
