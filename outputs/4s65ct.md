  DC universe, but [this is always appropriate](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305)

    I agree most of the time Superman's time would be better spent pumping out that energy. But When Zod comes along, clean energy isn't exactly going to stop him.

    Though I suppose the implication is that widespread free clean energy would lead to the invention of other technologies which maybe could help us keep the peace with all the alien invasions and such.

    But given how frequently potentially city-wide or world destroying events occur in either universe, I think we're still going to need to fire up the coal plants while Superman punches some super-powered villains now and then.

  I don't have a problem with the realism of Marvel civilians or government, given the own way the real life US government and public reacted to 9/11, and the way the US government and average voter have handled stuff like the War on Drugs.

    Please stop reminding me that reality is actually a badly-written comic-book movie.

      Please stop breaking the fourth wall.

      And, like comics, it never ends.

      Thankfully we get relatively few reboots.

        Are you sure? Maybe that's what deja vu is.

      I would actually greatly prefer reality be a badly written comic book movie, because at least then I could randomly find a power ring for no reason.

  On the other side of things, you have to wonder how come those things keep happening without the world (well, USA and appropriate scenic shots of a few capitals to imply that shits also happens in other countries) changing as a result except becoming slightly more violent and racists.

  Like, hundreds of criminals can put a silly costume and start robbing banks, and the banks never change their money storage methods or buy silly-costume-proof protections. I remember watching a BtAS episode where the Creeper barges into a shop to steal a costume and thinking "Come on, this is Gotham City post ten years of the Joker. Shouldn't every shop have guards with machine guns by now?"

  The military never upgrades its weaponry or recruit mutants in bulk (except when they do it in the most unethical way conceivable), or improves in any way that would let it compete with the rampaging paramilitaries and supervillains, or the individual heroes that need to save them.

  When 9/11 happened, security everywhere was changed forever. Superhero universes never change, so it looks like the millions of people who died just disappeared in a vacuum.

  Worm is a bit more consistent than average, with the PRT being ubiquitous, shelters for Endbringer attacks, and few tidbits of worldbuilding, but it's still lightyears away from a realistic portrayal. Like, there's a band of serial killers that regularly go on very public rampages in the USA, they have been going at it for decades, and there's almost nothing done to stop them; no martial law, no task force dedicated to stopping them, no firing your way through PRT directors until you find one who can finally do the job. In comparison, the French military is still on high alert for last year's shootings, which are way less dramatic or deadly than a band of serial killers going on a rampage every few weeks.

  So, yeah. Turns out superheroes stories are irrational.

    Keep in mind that Contessa was actively working to keep them alive, and there is nothing that PtV can't do

  I just wanna say, this is a fucking fantastic crop.

    I feel pretty smug whenever the people at r/4chan profess amazement at the awesomeness of my crops. It really isn't that hard, though--you can make good crops even if you aren't willing to mess around with the page's code.

    Check out [this step-by-step demonstration of how I cropped a recent series of comments](http://imgur.com/a/V11LL/layout/horizontal)!

  These people need to read Worm.  

  Seriously, the third comment from the bottom is just... Worm.

  Oh wow. It's a 4chan screenshot that is both readable and not wider than my screen. How did *that* happen?
