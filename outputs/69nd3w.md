  Since the topic of Ender's Game (and its sequels) came up, I'm a bit surprised that the Ender's Shadow parallel series managed to avoid mention.  Ender's Shadow retells the events of Ender's Game from Bean's perspective (as well as providing a bit of backstory for Bean and what his life was like back on Earth).  There are many scenes in Ender's Shadow that are faithful recreations of scenes we read in Ender's Game in terms of the objective reality that they present (the sequence of events is identical and the dialog is reproduced verbatim), but the book is written in a way that completely recontextualizes many of these scenes, using Bean's perspective to reveal more about what is going on than we saw when reading the book from Ender's perspective.  In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I won't get into specific details or examples, but I highly recommend Ender's Shadow to those who have read and enjoyed Ender's Game.

    As a person who has Ender's Game basically memorized (proved it before on this subreddit), who has read every word in the Ender universe, and who has "What would Ender do?" tattooed on his handâ€”strong yes to the fact that Ender's Shadow is an enjoyable read, not quite to the claim that the overlapping scenes are faithful, and strong disapproval for how ES made Bean cool in a zero-sum sort of way by stealing a significant portion of the cool from Ender.

    I basically view all the other Ender stories as fanfic.  Ender In Exile has some transcendentally beautiful moments side-by-side with some crushingly awful "Does OSC not know who Ender *is*???" moments.

      Yeah, Bean made Ender look silly and borderline incompetent many times through the reframing of the story. I don't mind the idea of the alternate perspective revealing new information in concept, but it was handled with mixed success in that case, and it's why I like practically every Bean book better than the first one.

      > I basically view all the other Ender stories as fanfic. Ender In Exile has some transcendentally beautiful moments side-by-side with some crushingly awful "Does OSC not know who Ender is???" moments.

      Ugh, Ender in Exile was so frustrating to read for exactly this reason. OSC broke my heart enough with his political views and some poor writing in his more recent books, but seeing him go back and mess with Ender was hardest to bear.

      >and who has "What would Ender do?" tattooed on his hand

      As someone who has been asking himself "What would Andrew do?" since 6th grade, I think you've finally given me an answer to the question I often get asked and have no response for: "What would you get a tattoo of?"

    I actually hated those scenes in Ender's Shadow. It felt like they were painfully shoehorned. I seem to recall that after virtually every one of Bean's lines there would be a bit of internal monologue to justify the departure from what we would expect Bean to say.

    Something like (no spoilers, not even close to the actual dialogue):

    **Ender:** I hate all this responsibility, I wish somebody else could step up to the mantle.

    **Bean:** There is no one else.

    **Bean, to himself:** Except for me, for though I am even more intelligent than Ender and have surpassed him at every turn, I cannot be a leader.

    **Ender:** I know, I just hate it sometimes.

    By contrast, the scenes that weren't constrained by existing canon flowed much better.

      Agreed, I enjoyed Ender's Shadow and the alternate perspective it gave of the story, but the crossover scenes felt very stilted, primarily because the character was so different from how they existed in the original and because of the different narrative voice.

  Okay, I have thought for twenty minutes about the question of "loose" structure as suiting "loose" stories and "serious" structure for "serious" stories and I'm not sure I'm correct. Lots of comedies are strictly structured, but its as a way of moving from one scene to another and giving some bones for the meat to hang on - I probably should have thought about this right away, since a lot of the story structure stuff I most agree with was written by Dan Harmon, who is in the comedy business.

  It's a little harder for me to think about serious dramas that lack formal structure to them, in part because I don't tend to like serious dramas, and in part because I don't tend to like stories that lack structure. (Serious dramas that are developed from memoirs or which stick closely to true stories tend to be bereft of structure, because real life is not well-structured, which I think causes a lot of works adapted from real life to be less interesting and/or compelling.)
