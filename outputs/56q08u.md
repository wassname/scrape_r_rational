  Oh my god. I can't process this right now. 

  I have no idea what is going to happen and it's fantastic.

  Suddenly the whole game and premise of this story is flipped on its head. It's as if a whole new vista of possibilities for this universe has dramatically opened up.

  Okay, there's a lot to be said here, this chapter changes so much. Braindumping:

  * Meta-wise, this is a super bold move. Canon Animorphs kept the invasion secret until the yeerks had been defeated; even when they started their open invasion, they still ran magic cover-up operations that kept everyone in the dark, and we only saw the one governor and a few military leaders interact with the story. The reason is, of course, to keep things simple, easy to determine and easy to explain to the reader. You've basically let 7 billion players enter the game here; I'm impatient to see how you deal with that.

  * On the whole, I think this was Visser 3 making the best out of a very bad situation, and still kind of a bad decisions because of information he didn't have, for multiple reasons. And I know this is believer-thinking, but I do notice that the space-bridge kept Esplin distracted long enough to let the situation devolve into something he couldn't control.

  * The world is going to move like crazy for the next few weeks. Every single political and military force in the world is going to be on high alert for a while; which might have interesting effects on ongoing conflicts (how would El Assad react after learning about an alien invasion). I expect many instances of curfews, and many riots wherever there's political instability, as people wonder if their leaders might be compromised, or just easy to take out.

  * Speaking of which, I wonder how the international community will react to this. Most stories about alien invasions are focused on what happens in the Pentagon, and mostly paint world leaders as acting unanimously, or bickering themselves to a standstill. But in practice, even if we only consider people on the Security council, I'd expect Vladimir Putin and François Hollande to have wildly different reactions to this situation.

  * I wonder how justified Tobias' fears about Esplin handing out backdoored tech are. One the one hand, most militaries will think about the possibility, and try to reverse-engineer the tech before replicating it. On the other hand, this might be equivalent to teaching 
  indigenous people how to make computers, killer drones and laser-guided missiles, then attacking them after an EMP strike. You've basically tricked them into making you a free industry, and there's not much they could have done to anticipate your move. Not much to be done against this either (except planting bombs in every factory, which... has its own problems), since *not* upgrading is not an option, especially when other countries might not be so recalcitrant.

  * On a more personal level, Paul Evans (aka fake!President) is kind of screwed now. There's no way their entourage is going to leave them unattended long enough to morph-demorph without being seen. Even if the real president gets back extremely fast and they switch places again, they'll have to do so in front of *some* witnesses. Awkward explanations incoming.

  * The technology boost will be a political shitstorm, depending on what exactly Esplin is ready to share. Right now we're afraid of the political consequences of people getting access to *nukes*. Esplin demonstrated he had the technology to wipe the Earth, and might be ready to share it.

  * I don't think Esplin is going to come on top once the Animorphs start their post-preemptive counter-counter-insurgency. First, their access to morphing technology means they can prove their good faith to arbitrary people, at the cost of giving them immense powers. They know for a fact that some of Esplin's affirmations are a lie (him being about to starve, the meteor being a dead-man-switch), but most importantly they know that Esplin has access to a Leeran, with all that implies. Of course, they might pretend to believe him as some sort of I-know-you-know-I-know game, but they'll probably stick to first principles and just stonewall as much as they can.

  * I think Tobias is a bit optimistic/pessimistic about the speed at which Yeerk society will integrate on Earth. We already have a hard time integrating differently-coloured refugees who did *not* "accidentally" flatten a major population center as an act of spite. I'd expect it to take years before yeerks were allowed to infest humans anywhere, let alone in a military. By the time controllers were allowed any strategic post, memetic contamination would have started again, and the state of the war would probably have changed drastically.

  * Speaking of which, I think the most scary tactic Esplin could employ is use the human race as a living shield. If he can persuade even a few countries to host yeerk coalescions, as long as those countries are powerful/influential enough not to be strong-armed by the rest of the world, he can maintain a yeerk presence long enough to compromise the planet in the eyes of the Andalites. Of course it's a bit harder than that, since both the Andalites and the human world leaders will probably consider this scenario, but it might be the best way to get Earth into conflict with the Andalites.

  * Holy shit, this is a lot of text I'm writing. TK17Studios is probably having multiple writergasms by now.

  * I think that, among the multiple failure modes Esplin has just opened himself to, the biggest one is that he made himself potentially superfluous to Telor and the Yeerk guerilla empire (new headcanon name!). If Telor can open negotiations with human leaders, they might realize that they can broker some treaty where Earth accepts to build an armada powerful enough to defend the planet from Andalite cleansing, host an arbitrary number of yeerk coalescions (as long as they don't infest anyone), and serve as a hub for the yeerks to explore the galaxy while they keep getting engineered bodies from the Arn. Granted, such a solution would be hard to get to, but it would be mutually beneficial and give the yeerks everything they want without any other coalescion dying. Plus, Esplin is basically the perfect scapegoat right now.

  * I see several comments mentioning the possibility of delivering Aftran's last shards to Telor. I'm not sure they're going to do that. First, the shards might refuse out of self-preservation: even if they're delivered directly to Telor without interference from Esplin, Telor will probably dissolve them, and might even do so in a way that doesn't conserve their memories, to avoid memetic contamination. Second, even if Telor spits the shards back intact, the Animorphs won't be able to trust them, since they have no way to check the "identity" of a piece of yeerk matter. And even if the Animorphs are okay with letting the shards go, Temrash might want to stay with Marco's dad anyway. (that's a lot of "even"s :p)

  * I'm wondering if Esplin's plan might be on a shorter time period than it appears. First, his attempts at contacting the Animorphs are probably a play for the hypercube. I mean, uh, the blue cube. But beyond that, he might just be trying to get some key component of the game into whatever shape he needs, without consideration for how his actions affect the rest of the world, because he intends to go into the offensive before they can actually prepare their defences. I'm not sure that's the case, because it sounds like a plan the Joker would make in the Dark Knight that can't possibly work in real life because something unexpected happens along the way. Still, worth a thought.

  * Not sure how relevant the Animorphs are by now. Like Tobias said "gods, alien warlords, and USA presidents". The only way they can still influence the game might be communicating relevant intel to people willing to listen, and giving the morphing power to a lot of people.

  * More on this later, but I think Tobias speaking out was a minor tactical blunder. Esplin's speech was broadcast to the entire world, while Tobias' interruption only touched a few thousands people at most, and will be reported as "In the middle of the speech you just heard, a telepathic voice who's probably a secret guerilla teenager said some rude things".

  * By the way, I'm guessing that Esplin had most of his caches and sleeper agents evacuated before/while making his speech? If he did, people might notice the sudden disappearances (unless the sleeper agents were all low-profile people with few connections). If he didn't, the Animorphs could get militaries to quarantine the concerned cities (might be too hard to do, though), get the Chee to spot any incoming Bug fighters, and capture the sleeper agents.

  I think I'm done. No, wait, that was only the strategic implications.

    My thoughts on the writing and stuff:

    * "Don’t give up the gunfight without at least making him waste some bullets." I love that line :D Han Solo said something similar in *The Thrawn Trilogy*, to a concilman who refused to take any initiative because it might be playing into Thrawn's hands (though his concerns where a bit more legitimate there). I think Tobias is worrying a bit too much about not letting Esplin predict him, and should worry more about doing things that work even if your enemy anticipates them.

    * Tobias is getting seriously injured. At some point, he'll have to self-morph to backup!Tobias, but he has way too much critical intel to do that right now (plus it's kind of like suicide). Although he could let one of the Aftran shards infest him, collect all the relevant intel, then *git-checkout* himself. Then again, trust issues.

    * I like how everyone is completely shocked and excited and terrified by the alien invasion and completely on the ball and almost unsurprised by it. Everyone posts pictures on Twitter fast enough to make a cover-up impossible, the police cordons the area off immediately, the air force reacts to the spaceship as soon as they see it, etc. I'm not sure what gives me this impression; I think in most "aliens arrive" scenes, people usually just gawk at the spaceship until the alien inside says something or starts killing people.

    * I'm really glad the story name-dropped "Twitter, Reddit and Facebook". On one hand, this will probably make the fic very dated at some point, the same way *Star Trek* references make canon Animorphs super dated now. On the other hand, this grounds the story so much, makes it seem so realistic and close to reality, like a lot of other details in the story, that I don't think it could have been omitted, or replaced with a generic mention about "social networks". I mean, of course if a spaceship crashed in a population center, there would be pictures of it on Twitter within the next thirty seconds. Actually...

    * I'm really interested in what the media coverage for this event would look like. A very interesting part of Worm was how the public reacted to the protagonists' adventures. Some of it was poorly done (the PRT being about nothing but PR was a bit clumsy), but some of it made the story *awesome*. The first time Taylor took out a supervillain, there was an article about it on Superheroes!Wikipedia. When she took over the town, the police started hanging flyers warning against her, and people debated her choices in forums. I hope this story gets its own PHO interlude.

    * Speaking of which, I mentioned in the previous chapter that it might be interesting to get the r/rational hive-mind to pool suggestions for Telor's litteral hive-mind. But another, more direct idea could be to get reddit posters to play fictional reddit posters. The possibilities are limitless!

    * I wonder how the Chee think when they're talking to humans. Their interlude made it clear they had a very alien psyche, and yet they're completely relatable when talking to other characters, probably using social algorithms acquired through centuries of living among humans. Even taking that into account, the difference is still jarring: the Chee in the interlude seemed completely unaware of things like names, or human dignity.

    * The "I notice I am confused" comment was probably the most jarring part of the chapter to me. I feel this is something Marco *might* think, but I wouldn't expect Tobias to think that, much less interiorize it (as opposed to quoting it from someone else). I think that The Reckoning is a great rational fic because it avoids using obvious "flags" for LessWrong ideas. When Esplin said something about Alloran being confused, he said it in character, and in his own words. It felt like an idea that he had constructed himself, not something he was quoting from LW. 

    * I really like the first contact scene. I can imagine people, being there. You see a spaceship hovering in the sky, people are taking pictures, there are helicopters around, the cops are trying to evacuate the area... then a voice in your head says "Hey, just saying, the guy you're about to see might be like Hitler". Badass. Oh, and then Esplin starts talking about how he wanted to invade the entire planet and killed millions of people, and you think "Um, okay. Should I run away really fast?".

    * That dig at the canon appearance of Andalites is awesome. Aaaand kind of petty :p

    * Yes! Shoot him! Succumb to the Renegade Side, Tobias! Screw consequences! Screw long-term planning! Make the bullies' life hard! Spread anarchy for the Chaos Legion! (looking at the situation logically, I think it would have been beneficial to Tobias to shoot Esplin, if he'd actually been close enough to do so).

    * The scene where Esplin freezes the government official to continue his (unauthorized) speech is actually pretty funny. "And in our arrog... Hey! Stay back, pathetic human! I'm not done speaking. Where was I? Yes, we regret trying to enslave your species, in our unjustified arrogance, but now we've learned the errors of our way."

    * I wonder if this is a "evil can't understand good" situation? As in, Visser Three might have flaws in his plan to manipulate both the Earth leaders and the Animorphs, because he's too selfish and sociopathic to pass for a benevolent person or whatever.

    And... if think I'm done. For real, this time. Holy crap, this chapter was inspiring.

      after reading the brainstorming thread, I think Visser Three is vastly overestimating human ability to figure out the right response.  Like Visser Three can play international politics if he is given any exposure to other countries, but if the US government just throws him in a dark hole somewhere this angle is gone.  Visser Three wouldn't expect this because of course doing this would send international tensions to a dangerous boiling point, but the US government might not react 'correctly'.  Even worse for him, Fundamentalist Christians in congress might think he is a demon and demand his immediate execution.  This might have seemed too stupid, but there are congressmen on the science committee that deny evolution and global warming.  Visser Three is counting on us being stupid in a manipulable way, not on us being random stupid.

      TLDR; It's not evil can't comprehend good, but hyper competence can't comprehend the level and complexity of human stupidity.

        Nah, his real body can do that fairly easily. Just pose as superiors/allies of the "Esplin" who was disappeared by the US.

        >Fundamentalist Christians in congress might think he is a demon and demand his immediate execution.

        Exorcism, surely. You can't execute a demon.

        Of course, he *did* just explicitly admit to being a war criminal who tried to invade the United States, so...

    >*  I do notice that the space-bridge kept Esplin distracted long enough to let the situation devolve into something he couldn't control.

    I wonder if that could have been the entire reason for C/E to make and show him the bridge? Chaos God was on the Animorph side in the pool to keep the fight going, Order God pushes V3 towards an unveiling to try and neuter the Animorphs?

     **<Edit>** Looking at the Esplin chapter again, this seems more and more likely. He was distracted by the bridge for ages, then was right in the middle of negotiating a truce with Telor when word of the crash came in. 

    That may well have been what made him take the gamble of revealing himself to humanity: It makes him briefly indispensable to Telor, and I don't think Telor has the chutzpah to tell the actual truth and have him executed as a scapegoat, they need him to manage this diplomatic tangle he's created.**</Edit>**

    >most militaries will think about the possibility, and try to reverse-engineer the tech before replicating it

    What, you're just going to carefully *study* this while China/ Russia/ North Korea/ America is possibly building an invincible space fighter task force? This is a prisoner's dilemma with a bunch of players, at least *someone* is going to build it straight off the plans ASAP, so you'd better do the same to keep up.

    **<EDIT>** Depending how "LW Rationalist" /u/tk17studios wants to be, this is the *perfect* analogy for the AI safety research problem. You gotta go fast or someone else will do it first and own you, but if you go fast without worrying about understanding the risks of what you're doing you might end up being a slave to some alien intelligence.

      Conveniently, only the United States have a spaceship at this point. 

      Which is weirdly non-manipulative of the Yeerks, because as you point out, they could easily have given them to several countries and looked nice and humanitarian doing it.

    RE international relations: 

    * I expect the middle east conflicts to keep on going as normal for the immediate term. Either dismissing it as American/zionist propoganda, or treating it as irrelevant. 

    * The main powers will probably go on immediate high alert (if they bweren't already after the asteroid impact, many of them would have assumed it was a nuclear strike/accident, or at least taken the possibility seriously).  And mass mobilise everything, whether its aliens or America doing something sneaky they need to be on high alert. 

    * The next step will be trying to confirm what has actually happened. Either via diplomatic channels, spies in US services, satellite imagery, or all of the above. Noone in an intelligence agency on earth is sleeping any time soon. 

    * China and a bunch of other countries are going to shut down the internet until they figure out what the hell is going on, with associated repercussions for economy and  public mood. 

    * Once they have convinced themselves it is real every country is going to demand to be able to have their own people talk to the alien, or have them passed on to the UN, or whatever. They'll see this as a potential seed of a renewed US hegemony if they are the only ones with access to the new tech and info. Expect a struggle within the US government between teh military type "keep it all to oursleves" and the internationalist elements. The only countries who have the ability to serioiusly enforce that demand would be China, since they could cut off trade supplies to the US, and maybe a coalition of the other developed countries if they can coordinate properly.

      Oh, damn, this is exactly the sort of thing that would invite an immediate terrorist attack. "The Americans are about to become all-powerful using technology from these demonic aliens! They must be stopped!"

  ```
  Getting earth tech better makes it a much more valuable piece for everyone, but the only ones who can take advantage of that currently is either earth itself, or V3. 

  Since V3 is the one that has goals outside of earth, he's doing a good job at cementing his advantages.

  I wonder what the end game of this story will be. HPMOR had a pretty clear sort of end game it was working towards, but just what is it that the Animorphs want out of life? V3 has massively expanded the gamespace for humanity past 'keep earth free' into an invitation the wider universe. Canon Animorphs may have been dragged into wider fights for a book or two, but only really fought for earth.
  ```

- u/ZeroNihilist:
  ```
  Predictions:

  * V3 will make excellent use of his (ironically) captive audience. It's likely that interrogating him will become an international effort, meaning representatives from major nations (those on the UN Security Council at the least) will be involved. Naturally, that lets him play global politics without ever leaving his cell.
  * The Animorphs will send somebody to talk to V3. Probably Jake, despite Marco's protests. Alternatively, they may send one of the Chee and relay the dialogue with thought-speak.
  * There will be public pressure, ostensibly (and perhaps actually) not from V3, for the Animorphs to reveal themselves.
  * There will be a heated argument with the Chee over the truce. Marco will be dead against it. Jake will feel guilty for wanting to give in.
  * The surviving portion of Aftran will be livid at V3's propaganda. Since V3 does not know about them, this offers the potential for clever strategies (e.g. sending them to Telor to spread the memes that led V3 to attempt to kill Aftran, or using them as counter-propaganda).

  Also, I liked the description of V3's appearance as a canon Andalite. Pretty much designed to appear graceful and wise to humans is right.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Adding to the list of things Visser Three does not know about: let's not forget that his contact with Rachel's mind was *prior* to Rachel finding out about the retrieval of Ax.  He may or may not have registered that there was an Andalite distress signal (remember, there was a ton of information in a very compressed burst), but he definitely doesn't KNOW that there's a legit living Andalite on the surface.
    ```

    - u/technoninja1:
      ```
      If the Visser is trying to appear cool or whatever to the humans, and was able to change his body to the level that he did, why not change it further. Why not look like a human or a little grey man or whatever? Why retain even part of the Andalite appearance? Technological constraints?
      ```

      - u/Zephyr1011:
        ```
        The Visser's form seems entirely reasonable as is. It gives him the noble, wise alien image that he's going for. A human wouldn't look immediately otherworldly, and a little grey man risks looking cute or not worthy of respect
        ```

        - u/technoninja1:
          ```
          Sure, but my point is that if his transformation is unlimited there is probably some alien form he could take that would look even more otherworldly and respectable and noble and wise than an uber-andalite. The fact that he didn't suggests that his transformation is limited in some way.
          ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            I think he just likes looking vaguely like an Andalite. Also, appearing as a human might be a little too jarring, especially if he doesn't intend to talk about the morphing cube.
            ```

          - u/CoolGuy54:
            ```
            I assume he got the Arn to build the construct body ~~just like the one Rachel killed.~~ It has the advantage of being a hell of a lot more likeable and trustworthy looking compared to an actual R!Andalite, if Ax shows up for real he'll look like a Gremlin compared to V3's Mogwai.

            ~~Note that also means this body could be full of tricky weapons and so on, but I'd guess he's left it pretty bare so it looks harmless when it's dissected after it dies.~~

            Edit: [Word of god](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56q08u/the_reckoning_chapter_22_tobias/d8mkm9k?context=3) says it is a construct body, but his previous human avatars were actual humans infested by artificial Yeerks.

            My second para is still true I guess, but I'd written it when I thought his avatars had under-skin weapon storage, when it was actually just regular pockets...

  Okay... we have just enough information that Tobias doesn't have to call out BS on a few parts...

  The Visser claims:

  > But if we are to slip the noose that fate has prepared for us—to step outside of the roles our manipulators intend for us to play—then we must start somewhere. 

  However in the previous chapter:

  > No, it was not at all clear that Esplin should attempt to do what the watchers wanted, assuming it was even possible to guess.  Nor was it safe to try striking out in the opposite direction, to act in open defiance of an unknown force with unknown strength and values—in the end, the best he could do was attempt to reason from clear knowns and first principles.

  Thus we know that the goal he stated to Tobias is at least partially BS.

  Next statement:

  >  I see no fundamental reason for us to be enemies—my people think they want control, but that is only because true symbiosis has never occurred to them as an option.

  However, we know that the Visser killed the pool mind without saving any of it in order to guarantee that the idea of true symbiosis would be eliminated.

  So we at least know two major claims are deceptions, but I can't figure out what the Visser's endgame in this is.
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    If they accept the truce, what does it cost him? He can take the cultural victory easily in the absence of any organised resistance (military or propaganda).

    If they don't take it, he's no worse off. Indeed, he'll have sown dissent in the ranks; Cassie and Jake may well want to accede to the truce, and the Chee absolutely will. In fact, forcing them to choose between the Chee and surrender might be the key point of the play.
    ```

  - u/CoolGuy54:
    ```
    >I can't figure out what the Visser's endgame in this is.

    Remember he's not evil for the sake of it. He wants to amass as much personal power as possible so he can achieve his wider goal of optimising the universe.

    He's obviously lying through his teeth in order to make the offer as palatable as possible, but it gives him a good chance of conquering earth the way Tobias speculated. Choose the most compliant surviving human hosts and release them, let them tell nice stories, then in a couple of weeks time have an "Andalite" attack wreak some havoc on earth and the Yeerks ride to the rescue.

    The Visser explains that the Andalites are afraid of the humans challenging them, or the Yeerks using the humans as a resource, and offer more help with technology and an alliance, and some voluntary infestation. Once they're integrated enough a coordinated takeover or Arn sleeping-sickness plague or whatever allows a complete takeover, or maybe he's even able to keep manipulating humans to serve his goals without that.

    Where are you getting this from? Maybe I haven't been reading closely enough, but AFAIK a member of the pool tried to do the symbiosis thing, it backfired, and the pool decided "well that was dumb, let's not do it again". 

    Which would be the *opposite* effect.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      In Aftran's chapter this is true, but in just the previous chapter, with Visser 3 discussing with the other pool minds:

      >  ‹Aftran was compromised in more ways than one,› he said.  ‹There is a reason I kept you quarantined from her once she began taking human hosts.  She lost more in Silat than she expected, and with what was left—she was beginning to allow the humans to—influence her.›

      So even though an individual Yeerk's study of human emotions was a failure that was ignored, the collective pool of Aftran was starting to be influenced.  Of course, Visser 3 could be lying partially, but we also heard this from the Yeerk Temrash in a previous chapter: 

      > “Because we were learning!” Temrash broke in. “Things that would change the war—that would change everything. Because we’d figured out that we didn’t need him anymore!”

      In explanation for why Visser 3 wiped out so many of them.

        You already know this, but I'm going to say it anyway: this is dumb.

        Low-effort plagiarism would be better prevented by having a red "this fanfic/chapter is more than 90% similar to this other thing posted before by an unrelated person" header, since "View page source" is a thing.

          I can see the strategy making sense from a preventing low effort plagarism standpoint. While you can copy from source, it's formatted as an HTML file, so you'd need to go through extra steps to get it in a form you can publish

  This was an excellent chapter with yet another great twist in the plot development.

  My guess is that this plan is designed to be adaptable into many possible outcomes good for Visser Three, such as Tobias' thoughts of the factories to churn out bug fighters.  But I think the primary goal, above all else, is Visser Three hoping that he can manage to befriend/trick the Animorphs into revealing the cube.  The cube is possibly a prize on a similar scale to the entire planet for the Yeerks.  If they can reverse engineer the tech, they could potentially have whatever bodies they need at all times.
  ```

  - u/CoolGuy54:
    ```
    And (Is this how canon ended?) that could actually be a win-win ending for everyone if they did.
    ```

    - u/KnickersInAKnit:
      ```
      Well, here's a fun thought then - if a shard of a pool is given the morphing ability, how does that work once the shard rejoins the coalescion? Does the entire pool need to receive the morphing ability? Could the entire pool morph as one being?
      ```

      - u/CoolGuy54:
        ```
        Whoah, good question. And if it is individual shards, what happens to the morphing ability when they're reabsorbed?

        The whole pool would have a time in morph of like 30 seconds so that doesn't work.

        How about using the Visser's Tech to give the pool a few dozen construct or volunteer bodies it can control remotely?
        ```

        - u/KnickersInAKnit:
          ```
          Good point, the whole pool in morph would have a very short time, but if a shard could morph...they'd get like 6 to 12 hours in morph, easily. Wow. Kandrona feeding could be reduced to once a month or something if that were the case.
          ```

          - u/MugaSofer:
            ```
            They'd need to be larger than normal to have human-level intelligence without cheating using a host brain, I think. Still a very long morph time.
            ```

- u/LieGroupE8:
  ```
  This story never fails to impress me.

  I'm not sure what I want more - for the Animorphs to continue fighting Visser Three, or for them to team up with Visser Three against some new enemy such as the Andalites (who did, after all, want to destroy the Earth...)

  Also, the Visser's speech was so good that I can't decide how sincere he is about what he said. I think it would be very interesting if he is, in fact, sincere, because it would show that he is willing to rapidly change his mind and adapt to new circumstances. That would give him a great depth of character, and make him more sympathetic (the most interesting conflicts are Good vs. Good). On the other hand, if this is all some clever trick, I wouldn't be surprised, and couldn't complain.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Unfortunately, he's insincere. I think his previous chapter showed that he understands exactly how Prisoner's Dilemmas works, and chooses to defect every time he can get away with it.

    And he lied about the asteroid as a dead man's switch, at the very least. If he'd cared about the humans lives lost, he would have warned the people in Ventura to evacuate.
    ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    I think that it's already the case that this is a conflict of Good v. Good, inasmuch as Visser Three is explicitly fighting Moloch (under its guise as "The Vanarx"). Depending on his intentions for the post-endgame, it might not be my favorite choice or even be in my top five, but it's better than nothing IMO.
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      I don't think fighting Moloch makes him good. It's one of those universal AI drives.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      In canon Crayak was on the Yeerk side and wantd an orderly unified universe.As a monoculture of his slaves of course. So we may be looking at an order vs. chaos kinda thing,
      ```

      - u/MugaSofer:
        ```
        IIRC he wanted every species to kill each other until the strongest survived to serve him.
        ```

  - u/CoolGuy54:
    ```
    I'm modelling him as an amoral alien AI who places zero value on the fulfilling preferences of others, (of course helping others can still be useful instrumentally, as with the Arn) and whose own preferences/goals might or might not align with human preferences in some ways.

    His speech is full of lies, everything about his little show was carefully crafted to create the desired effect, with truth being only instrumentally useful, not a goal in its own right.

    Rachel will agree with me, probably Marco will too, with Cassie dead... (shit, I think it was Chaos God in the pool. and he *wanted* war to continue, and he *wanted* Cassie dead to help achieve that...) who'd going to be arguing for a truce? Ax won't trust him, who can be more pro-peace than Jake? (David!) 

    The Yeerks will definitely get some human allies out of this, and they'll benefit short-term, but V3 is not a safe genie, there are way too many outcomes where cooperating with him ends terribly for you, and more likely ones too I think.
    ```

    - u/KnickersInAKnit:
      ```
      Ax might. He's got Temrash in his head now...but then again, Temrash knows how V3 a lot better than any of the Animorphs.

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    Me neither. There's like tiny shadows of it in the crowdbraining thread from a few months ago but..... what the HELL is he playing at ????

    Nevermind how he got the fake andalite body. I assume it's like that mini bit of dialog with Cassie trying to make a dinosaur from a chicken?
    ```

    - u/CoolGuy54:
      ```
      It's not a morph, it's an Arn construct body like the human ones he keeps using. The actual Visser is still safely in orbit, I would be willing to bet a fair sum.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        It is an Arn construct, but as for the human ones, I have some bad news for you ... he's just been taking real people and running them as doombots.  Rachel killed an actual kid.  

        What the Arn and/or the Naharans did was sort out how to make a "blank Yeerk" that V3 could then control via thought using a Z-space transmitter (a mimic of one small piece of what the morphing tech is doing).  Stick that in any ol' host body, and voila.
        ```

        - u/CoolGuy54:
          ```
          Oh hah, that does explain how he wasn't a "new kid." Dang Rachel...

          >I shifted in my seat as I considered the possible ramifications, taking comfort in the weight of the various weapons and devices hidden beneath my artificial skin.

          ...*oh*, that was meant to be *clothes*, I thought it was a cyborgy kind of body... I read it as clothes later on then other kids were pulling his "artificial skin", but as a construct here. Hmm, I wonder how many other people made my mistake, I thought the artificial Yeerk was too big to infest a regular body, for some reason. This means he can infest and fully interrogate anyone without leaving Alloran then, and without the two-way communication of a Leeran.
          ```

          - u/callmebrotherg:
            ```
            I thought the same thing.
            ```

            - u/CoolGuy54:
              ```
              That's three people chiming in  to agree now, maybe edit it to read "clothes" in that instance, or "the artificial skin all humans wore" or something to clarify.

              >I would need to send a different team to recover the other five bodies, all of which had almost surely died when the link abruptly failed. The Arn would want to examine them all—brains and conduits alike—in preparation for the next round of cloning. Two or three more iterations, and we would be ready for the third phase.

              This passage also steers me towards thinking the whole thing is a construct, not just the Yeerk.

          ```
          I like how everyone is shocked that Rachel killed a single kid when the team just voluntarily killed hundreds of people, including dozens of kids, by blowing up the YMCA pool and trapping anyone who went in to help. Some of those people died in horrible pain too.

            ```
            Shouldn't we be? I'm pretty sure we all still knew that *she* believed she had killed a kid, and before I just felt extra-sad for her going through the experience of that when it wasn't true. Maybe she could have found out someday and been marginally less traumatized, who knows? Unfortunately, there is a real psychological difference between killing someone with your own hands (er, tail), alone in an unexpected fight for your life vs setting war plans into motion with a team. I don't think she made the wrong choice or anything, so this is actually better (for the story, not her lol).
            ```

        - u/KnickersInAKnit:

          Well shit, I thought the kid was a construct/cloned human too...

  This is far more elegant solution for the Visser than the brute force solutions I was thinking up. In one stroke, the Visser puts pressure on the animorphs to reveal themselves, gains some goodwill, can now play the nations of Earth against one another, industrializes and technologically advances his future industrial base, and, most importantly of all, fractures the resistance. Also, the cube.

  While it's an elegant plan, there will be issues, as other people have pointed out. Cassie is dead, for one. For another, there are still bits of Aftran left, there's another bit of Aftran in US custody (Tyaagi's got a Yeerk in stasis) along with the earplug tech, and an actual Andalite around.

  The only issue is giving humanity blueprints for super-advanced technology and expecting them to be able to up-tech to interplanetary travel in just 5 months. Although given that the Yeerks were able to rapidly industrialize, I suspect that while the first principles needed to work out how to build anti-gravity drives and energy weapons are difficult, once you have them it's easy to put together what one needs using basic early 21st century technology.

  This story just went from awesome to f**king-unbelievably-good.

  You consistently surprise me. This is the one thing it would never have occured to me for V3 to do. But it makes perfect sense from his POV. It works so well as a surprise because it violated an implicit assumption I never realised I had about the story, that the canon style masquerade had to be maintained, and that the sides in the war were set. 

  The biggest threats are not the humans but crayak and ellimist. Even if one of them is on your side notionally, they are still using you as peices in a game. To quote Masego in the Practical Guide to evil, we've been focusing on fighting the other prisoners, when we should have been breaking out of the cage.

    There's a lot of truth there, but it's purely instrumental IMHO. He's saying whatever makes achieving his goals most likely, some truth, some lies, but the only reason he'd avoid a lie is if the truth is more useful or the risk of being found out IMHO, no moral prohibition.
