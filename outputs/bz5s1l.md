  Hello, I'm CremeCrimson, and I am writing *On Snowy* *Shores,*  a hybrid of high/low fantasy and urban fantasy. I've spent the last four months writing and decided for a total rewrite, starting with adding to the prologue. I would appreciate constructive criticism that the rational community could provide.

  Please enjoy.

  I insist.

    > I would appreciate constructive criticism that the rational community could provide.

    To start off with, dropping your reader into the middle of your setting without any preamble explaining what they're getting into is a really bold choice.  Maybe too bold.  If you were a writer I'd spent a lot of time reading, I'd trust that all of that detail would be filled in later.  That's an awful lot of trust to extend to someone I'm unfamiliar with, though.

    Next, it's very dialogue- and action-heavy, with almost everything else being visuals.  We don't get into the characters' heads very much at all, and there's not a lot of setting exposition going on.  It doesn't give me much time to breathe and absorb what's going on, and, as previously noted, there's not a lot of context that's being explained, so there's a lot that just doesn't make sense to me yet.

    What isn't dialogue tends towards the [purple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_prose).  And while that can be an appropriate stylistic choice, you have your characters talking in very plainspoken dialogue, and when that's interwoven with purple descriptions of the action and the visuals, it's giving me tonal whiplash.

    And a prologue should generally accomplish one or both of two things: it establishes the tone of the work, and/or introduces the audience to the central conflict of the work.  At the end of the third part of the prologue... I can't really say that I know what either is supposed to be.

    Finally, unrelated to my impression of the work itself...  By the sound of it ("spent the last four months writing and decided for a total rewrite"), you got a good part of the way into the story before deciding to stop and start over (I apologize if that's not the case).  As someone who has read a lot of advice on writing, and who has many times gotten stuck on the write/get halfway/rewrite/get halfway/rewrite cycle...  I'd advise you to finish off the work first, and *then* start rewriting it.  Getting to the ending is the hard part; going back and fixing the parts that made you cringe along the way is a lot easier. And, the second time through, it's a lot easier to put everything in place if you know where everything will need to be at the end.

    I hope this helps.

      Wow, this is some fantastic critique! Thanks for putting in the effort to write this.

       Having finished the first arc, I found myself immensely dissatisfied with it, hence the rewrite. Getting the first few chapter right is important, need das hook. 
      The prologue is an interesting thing, the main story will be in first person, I've considered third-person heavily, getting into characters' heads is challenging. 

      I hate giving exposition. It feels cheap and cheesy to do, however, it will become a necessity when the main protagonist takes center stage. Coloring the world from his view is something I've been prepping, and it's going to require a lot of peering through his perspective. I've learned to try and flex show-not-tell. I hope to show the world piece by piece in the future, bringing a world to life has required a shocking amount of research, reading history books, acquainting myself with other cultures, and trying to capture how people would speak in this world. 
      I don't want my story to tire people out, I remember reading Wildbow's *Pact* and that was a emotionally draining read. Breathing space to fill in those missing lines of world-building through dialogue and scenery is something I didn't wholly consider. 

      Purple is something I didn't even consider when writing, nor have I heard about it until now. That's something that will disappear after the prologue, but if you hadn't told me, the future interludes would've continued doing that. 
      Thank you.

        I will read your work soon, but before that, I need to convey that giving exposition is not a sin. It's mandatory, even! It's only distasteful if you did it in the beginning of a story without having much else going on. In other words, exposition dump. Also, in-media-res demand exceptional writing skill. I'm interested to see how good you are given your insistence on doing it. I'll write my evaluation on a review once I'm done.

    Stylistic nitpick for the beginning:  You're doing a cold open.  From my perspective, characters to track are:

    * Speaker 1
    * Speaker 2
    * 'She' from paragraph 4
    * Man in front of Peter
    * The "Them" who might eat some of the corpse
    * Guy in spectacles
    * Ben
    * Alabaster woman

    I think there's some overlap.  But its the kind of thing where I have to go back and re-read.

    I'd drop a couple paragraph breaks, and just commit to the distant 3rd person you're using elsewhere.  Sarah seems to be the viewpoint, and since she knows Peter is her familiar, we can just acknowledge that, with her reactions, in paragraph 2.

    ------

    Some logistic details: You're not going to drag a person with broken knees through a forest and have them conscious/not screaming.  The characters would have to be very cruel to try.

    And a woman dragging ~200 lbs of dead weight through a forest is athletically impressive, especially if she can banter while she's doing it 

    Bleeding dude will leave one hell of a trail if you're worried about being followed. 

    ---

    World building: You're using real places in an unreal setting.  Identifying all those accents means that your narrator is extremely well traveled, and several centuries old, since she know about Mongol ships and Frisbees. 

    That seems incongruous when you put it up against the bad tradecraft in the first chapter. 

    None of the characters seem particularly worried about surveillance by the locals.  So, if their goal is a mutually-cautious talk, they could just go somewhere public and near guards. That way, neither can start shooting. 

    If the main characters are forced to accept Cynisus' terms, then I'd send the rat to scout, as opposed to jogging on to the store.

    I'm also confused about the other patrons who showed up.  Are the extremely bad body guards? Or are they actually bystanders?  I think they kinda stood around after the main characters shot a dude (5 rounds left), used magic, and then sewed his lips up with thread for some reason.
