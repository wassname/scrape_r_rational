  I'm not especially sold on this. Pure intellect isn't a reliable tool to make scientific deductions about the world, you need experiments.

  Plus, it doesn't account for some fairly well known setting elements- the elves can make magical armor and swords, and there's a super metal called mithril.

  And Morgoth personally was a continent shattering being.

  >“the Valar endeavoured ever, in despite of Melkor, to rule the Earth and to prepare it for the coming of the Firstborn; and they built lands, and Melkor destroyed them; valleys they delved and Melkor raised them up; mountains they carved and Melkor threw them down; seas they hallowed and Melkor spilled them; and naught might come to peace or lasting growth, for as surely as the Valar began a labour so would Melkor undo it or corrupt it."

  And even when weakened, he was hitting with explosive level force.

  >"Therefore Morgoth... issued forth clad in black armour; and he stood before the King like a tower, iron-crowned, and his vast shield, sable unblazoned, cast a shadow over him like a stormcloud […] Then Morgoth hurled aloft Grond, the Hammer of the Underworld, and swung it down like a bolt of thunder. But Fingolfin sprang aside, and Grond rent a mighty pit in the earth.” 

  In a world with magic it's important to note the existence of magic. Heavy weapons may well defeat them, but they have a reason to rely on melee combat. They are pumped.

    Its mentioned: overweening pride and arrogance, in conflict with reason. Which is why huldin lives, and the valar are not victorious.

      They have reasons to be prideful- they're superhumans with immense power. He may with enough tech be able to overcome that, but it's a fairly major setting element that you can make magic swords which perform much better than steel. The Valar are good at forging stuff.
