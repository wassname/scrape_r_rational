  Masego's PoV is hilarious. He really has no attention span at all for anything unimportant to him.

  I think the ending of the chapter is setting up for an exploration of the negative sides of the Truce and Terms. So far the Villains involved have been either of Cat's pragmatic antivillain style or relatively harmless ones. Now we have a case where the it protects someone who seems to be a mass murderer and rapist from the justified anger of one he harmed. Makes the moral calculus a bit harder to swallow.

  Reminds me a little of >!the Amnesty!< in Ward. >!Similarly there you have villains who have done pretty unambiguosly awful things given a second chance, and good conditions, while the normal people are living in tent cities, and the heros have to put up with it for the greater good.!<

    To be fair, I never got why that happened in Ward.  They weren’t exactly volunteering, so why reward them?

      The purpose of the reward is to convince them to cooperate; a carrot to reduce the use and damage of the stick.

  Nice ending, couldn’t happen soon enough, and Zeze-Indrani interactions are lovely as ever. But I wonder if that means now Red Sonja w./ Axe is excluded from the protection of the Terms ?
