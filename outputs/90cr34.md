  You know, Keter doesn't sound half bad. It's designed by a very talented architect with exquisite tastes, kept tidy by the most dilligent police out there (which is also stylish) and is ruled by a monarch that masterfully balances caring for his people with avoiding internal strife. There's that slight problem about free will and stuff but by the standards of Evil dictatorships kept together by dark magic, it's beautiful.

  All those haters are probably just jealous, because it makes the rest of Calernia look like a bunch of failed states. Which it is, for the most part.

    You'd think the Kingdom of the Dead would be the last place where moral relativism would pop up, and yet here we are.
    ```

  - u/Rice_22:
    ```
    Isn't all of Calernia pretty much a "backwater" in the wider world anyways? I mean, there's the Gnomes, the place where the Miezans came from, the Titanomachy and all the other bigger players. 

    Keter's the biggest fish in the pond, but it feels like even Triumphant at her height and the Dead King aren't near the pinnacle of power in Creation.
    ```

    - u/TideofKhatanga:
      ```
      The Titanomachy is one if Calernia's multiple country. But yes, Calernia is basically medieval Australia with the political stability of the Balkans. Black said that the only country that could generously be called relevant to the greater scope of Creation is the Kingdom Under. And the dorfs are massively more powerful than everyone else on Calernia.
      ```

      - u/Rice_22:
        ```
        Hmm, thanks. I took a look at the map.

        So even the Kingdom of the Dead, the Everdark and the Chain of Hunger are irrelevant to the Kingdom Under? Didn't the dwarves seal off all underground passages to the Dead King's domain?
        ```

        - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
          ```
          The chain of hunger are a bunch of starving rats kept in check by the border provinces of a second rate continental power (the principality), the everdark seem to be mostly irrelevant and not a real threat to anyone, and the kingdom of the dead for whatever reason have been keeping to themselves (although i suspect this is about to change).
          ```

          > So even the Kingdom of the Dead, the Everdark and the Chain of Hunger are irrelevant to the Kingdom Under?

          No. Compared to the Kingdom under, they're irrelevant to the broader scope of geopolitics in Creation.
          ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        There is no such thing as mediaeval Australia? Unless you mean tech level of the dark ages + isolation of Australia?
        ```

        - u/TideofKhatanga:
          ```
          That's what I meant, yes.
          ```

    - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
      ```
      The best way to put it is that the Elves everyone is terrified about were outcasts from the other parts of Creation. This implies that they were weaker than the other members, else they could have just conquered everyone
      ```

      - u/ATRDCI:
        ```
        I was more.under the impression that they are vastly outnumbered by their not racist brethren
        ```

        - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
          ```
          Yeah, that as well. It is made clear though that whatever’s going on in Calneria has no effect on the rest of the world unless Cat manages to usurp true Godhood and changes Creation (Which let’s be real is totally a thing she might do at this rate)
          ```

    - u/Turniper:
      ```
      Don't forget the big half elven society bard mentions when taunting the elves.
      ```

- u/HeWhoBringsDust:
  ```
  Gotta love how despite finding out that Dead King is so old he predates the chessboard everyone else is playing on Cat is still planning on throwing him under the cart.

  Never change Cat, never change. Only she could make such an insane plan and pull victory from it (See: The whole winter court fiasco, the part where she mugged a choir of angels, and the many many points where she used Necromancy to hold her body together)
  ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  Fuck man, Dead King is so smart it's scary.

  What's the easiest way to avoid rebellion and Hero creation among your subjects? Simple, just engineer your society to believe servitude is the most important cultural value, outside world is horrible and you're the only thing protecting *us* from *them*.

  The crazy thing is, much like Black didn't lie to Cat, I think the Dead King fulfills his end of the deal too. Keter is peaceful, doesn't suffer from disease or lack of resources and actually seems like a meritocracy. Why lie when the truth serves just as well and doesn't bite you in the ass later on?
  ```

  - u/cynar:
    ```
    A big lie is a plot hook for a story. The truth, even coloured to make it more mundane lacks that power. The kingdom is built like a glass sphere to the powers of good. Yes you could, in theory smash it, but there are no cracks to exploit, or corner to work on.

    Its about the best defence against the powers of good as can be envisioned.
    ```

- u/Nic_Cage_DM:
  ```
  What's the deal with Akua coming to talk to Cat about Masego going for a stroll? Anyone else thinking that this is some kind of shenanigan?
  ```

  - u/TaltosDreamer:
    ```
    Yes.  I think she is playing on at least 3 levels.
    1 currying favor n getting cat to let down her guard
    2 putting a subtle wedge between cat n masego.  she likely will now go to masego and let him know cat has decided to let him examine the city until nightfall, as long as he takes Archer with him 
    3 showing the dread king that she is a lot more than a mere prisoner.  should things go badly, he might have use of her
    ```

    - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
      ```
      I don’t think Akua can drive a wedge between Masego and Cat unless Cat does something totally assholish to Masego directly. Masego’s almost as close to Cat as he is with his parents. Only thing I can think of that would do it is if Cat burned down the Observatory which would be highly uncharacteristic of her
      ```

      - u/TaltosDreamer:
        ```
        It doesnt have to be likely to be an iron in the fire.  True masterminds keep all possibilities in mind, and Akua is a mastermind of the highest caliber.  I have yet to see her do anything for less than 3 reasons.
        ```

        - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
          ```
          Hmm, I’m curious. Now that Akua is mostly Winter and Cat is now literally Winter, can Cat read Akua’s mind? She can change her appearance and probably change Akua’s personality (Cat would never do this of course) but mind reading might be up her alley
          ```

          - u/TaltosDreamer:
            ```
            It seems to be something she would be capable of.  At this point it kinda looks like Akua is Cat's to mould as she desires
            ```

            - u/Mingablo:
              ```
              And that story never ends well for the moulder.
              ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    Nah, I just see it as trying to be a good minion.
    ```

- u/Mr_Evildoom:
  ```
  Can someone remind me why we're letting Akua out of her cage all the time now?  From my perspective Cat just lost against the AI in a ~~box~~ cloak. She's obviously manipulative, and in Thief's conversation with her we learned that there can be multiple layers to her manipulations. They're catching them now, but how long can they keep that up? Cat is already finding her likable.

  Obviously she's a resource, but why don't they just allow her out when they need her? Is there something I'm missing, an advantage to having her out permanently or a limitation to storing and retrieving her from the cloak?
  ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    I feel like I also missed this. Somewhere in the the past couple of chapters Cat just gave up on keeping her in any sort of confinement.
    ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  I'm wondering what the limit is of the Dead King's power to control undead. I mean, with thousands of years to grow and learn, would his actual capacity just keep growing as well? Because if he can control limitless undead he's basically a god now. He doesn't even need to cull his human herds, he just needs to sit back and wait because they'll die eventually and then serve him in death. I suppose the same effect can be done through rituals and whatnot, but if he can do it all by his own will... whoa. That's definitely god-tier.

  (Slight spoilers for The Gods Are Bastards): it reminds me of how the gods in TGAB are kept strong by the souls of the dead. "The afterlife" is basically just a big battery that captures souls when people die, which is then used to power divine magic and the gods. The gods hardly need to lift a finger, because everyone dies eventually so their power source keeps getting replenished automatically. The Dead King is basically doing the same thing here, but using dead bodies rather than souls. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if The Dead King is keeping their souls too - we already know that a gestalt can be created, and frankly it would be a pretty big oversight if TDK didn't set up one of his own. Especially since his information is seemingly so strong, I bet he's known for ages about how The Watch is powered.

  And while it's obviously horrific that TDK set up a dystopian society that will serve him willingly for eternity, I can't really say that it's any worse than what the actual Gods are doing/have done. They set society up the same way, just globally rather than in a hell. Humanity is stuck in their cosmic game, specifically designed to have limited life spans (after the Gods realized the Fae were a failure and a possible danger), and societies have taught people that this is Good or just the way things are so long that none but a few such as Black even question it. In a weird way, TDK is kind of commendable when you compare his hell to Calernia. In both people are trapped by higher powers and brainwashed by society to act as their (mostly) unseen masters desire, but at least in "Serenity" people are happy, healthy, and at peace. Despite being just as trapped, you can't say the same about Creation!
  ```

  - u/zehguga:
    ```
    Uuh, where is the souls = divine magic thing come from in TGAB? I really don't recall that. I thought it was just magical energy from the Infinite Order gods that were no longer around, that the current pantheon merged into something they could use (like fae magic is Naiya's, infernal is Scyllith's, and arcane is whichever other hidden old god).

    Do you have a chapter that backs that up?
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  I love how it's becoming thoroughly, increasingly obvious how outmatched Cat is. The scene with her Palanquin in particular was great.
  ```

- u/JustLookingToHelp:
  ```
  Anyone else think that Cat and Neshamah are gonna have a *thing*?

  She's had impressive necromantic control from very early on as just part of her Name, without any particular aspect.  She's used it repeatedly, and most notably did things with it that Masego said should not be possible even before she mixed Winter into everything.

  She's one of the only other villains out there who have given themselves a form of immortality without having an Aspected name.

  Cat has always thrived on chaos. Neshamah is about order, long plans that have no exploitable points of failure.

  Taken together, Cat is similar enough to Neshamah to be familiar, but different enough to be useful or interesting.

  Cat is currently *romantically unattached.* The fanbase has also noted she can have trouble keeping it in her pants.

  All of this together suggests strongly to me that the Dead King and the Black Queen are gonna bump unliving uglies.

    ```
    otoh, genocide and human sacrifice are a real turn off for her.
    ```

    - u/JustLookingToHelp:
      ```
      Give him a bit to explain how it's not really genocide when they come back.
      ```

      - u/DracoVictorious:
        ```
        I mean, is what he's doing objectively bad? His populace are happy, healthy, and well fed. They receive fulfillment and stimulation from their lives. And they actually know what happens to them after death. Doesn't sound awful to me
        ```
