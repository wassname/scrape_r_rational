  Always a delight to see new installments, they're sadly infrequent.

  You kind of have to wonder, now that the king has been told Mercury crafted Adamantium and disbelieved, if anyone has been smart enough to check with the gods to see if maybe it happened.

    Maybe someone would, but would the *right* people, like anyone that could convince the King? Even the Avatar was disbelieved when he said that Mercury should be left alone, and the Duke's explained reasoning for it was that the Light was good but not smart, specifically in focusing too much on defense.

    Maybe if the Light gods could be convinced to channel a message through the Avatar that more directly vouches for Mercury's character, or even directly command that she be left alone? The problem I see is that the Light gods still want Mercury captured. They obviously don't mind the Avatar advising against attacking Mercury, but they certainly haven't given any orders to leave her alone with any real force behind it them. From the Light gods' perspective there's still a chance that the dwarf king's attacks will get Mercury captured or otherwise neutralized. It was very close, twice, just in the attack on Salthalls.

    Maybe that point will be moot once the Dark Kingdom successfully finds their way into the new world, meaning Metallia will have a way there as well when she awakes, and the fate of both worlds hangs in the balance regardless of whether Mercury is neutralized? That could dramatically shift the strategic environment shaping the alignments and choices of the various gods.

    You'd hope so. But if someone doesn't want to believe a thing can be possible, they are probably less likely to go looking for reasons to validate it.
