  The reasonings and deductions on the main characters get more Sherlock-Homes-y by the chapter, and yet they keep being right. This is starting to annoy me a bit; you can't just make up super complex theories about espionage and about systems you've had about zero reliable information on, and yet keep being right every single time.

    I sort of agree with you there. The saving grace may be reveals that show our protagonists were wrong in near fatal ways. I'm banking on those. There have been a bit too many "We're super smart so here's magical correct deductions!"

      To be fair, that fits the precedent set by HPMoR.  :P

        This is way above HP:MoR. Harry was in a school that taught magic, he did a bit of experimentation on his own, and he could ask teachers for confirmation when he got crazy ideas; also, we're more or less supposed to assume he had many awesome idea that failed to work off-screen for every idea we saw work.

        Here, we have children brought up by aliens with every incentive to deceive them about the world that surrounds them, no espionage experience whatsoever, no way to confirm most of their theories, a smarter, more experienced agent actively trying to mislead them (even if mama *is* trying to help the kids, she's not exactly communicating clearly), and yet their complicated reasonings keep exactly spot on. It's not always egregious, but on the whole their priors are way, way too good for someone in their situation.

  Emma seems a bit paranoid today.......not paranoid enough !!!!, they should consider the posibility that mama has deduced that they will try the old trick of give fake information to the spy , or that Ray could be a spy ,or that mum has some way of listen their conversations, at least inside the house .Probably they considered at least some of this things , they have been very rational and almost properly paranoid until now( but not enough to realize the possibility of spies until now). Also I can see mama telling her own lies  to the spy to explain why spy them. they shouldn't lie about Connie because the others are going to discover the truth and eventually and that will weaken their trust , also it might clash with any of the lies mama probaly told to the spy.
