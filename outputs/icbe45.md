## [RST][WIP][HF][FF] Avatar: The Last Rationalist Chapter 9: Augury & Embattlement

### Post:

Hi all,
I have been gone for a long time and am back now. The next chapter will be posted here before September 30th.

I have some questions for readers:

1. 
Does anyone know what Meng's haircut is called? I tried looking for it online cause I wanted to describe it in the story, but the closest I got were pigtails which doesn't match.

2. 
So I am trying to see what calendar I can use in the Avatar world. I was going to have each month be named after the zodiac animals, but thought it might be too tacky.

After researching the ancient Chinese calendar I realized they had weeks that went up to ten days and each month is just the numbered month in the year. For example, January would be 1st month or August would be 8th month.

Which do you prefer or do you have a better idea for the name of the months?

Thanks for reading and/or commenting and have a nice day!

  I know that two buns or pigtail buns are called [odango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun_(hairstyle)) which is a fairly japanese hairstyle, but I don't know what it's called if the buns themselves are layered. Maybe pigtail layered buns?

  Don't call it double stacked buns, because that hairstyle is having two buns with one bun higher on the head than the other.

    As for the calendar, I think you are better off using the ancient one instead of the modern day one for authenticity. Or just make up the names.

    In fact, there are 4 seasons. So you could match each season to an element, and for the 3 months per season, you can name them anyway you like such as early, mid, and late air/water/earth/fire. That way you have 12 made up names which ties into the cycle of the elements.

      Thanks. That seems like a good idea. I guess I could name the months like 2nd Fire or 3rd Air and such.

    Got it. I guess I can call them stacked orange buns or something because I don’t think I’ve ever seen another character or person ever have that haircut and what you suggested does seem to be the closest to her haircut. Thanks for the help.

  I don't know the answer to your first question (you could try asking /r/TheLastAirbender), nor do I have any good ideas for your second. 

  But I really like the story so far. I just started reading it, and got caught up. I hope you continue it. The characters are written really well, very canonical personalities.

    Thanks I’ll try posting the question on that subreddit. Thanks for the support and I’m glad you enjoyed reading it. I will continue it and have no plans on abandoning it. Thanks again!

  Yey thank you for continuing!

  As for what you said at the end, I personally love the avatar and how he's from the modern world, but I'm confused/worried about Black (Is she even from the series? I have no idea who she is). Also, I wish we got more from Zuko.

  Regardless, thanks for the great chapter :)

    Thanks for the support. As to your question, Black isn’t from the series, she’s from the modern world.

  good job with the story, am rly liking all the mysteries shown to us, and the slow trickle of revelations. the first chapter was for my liking a bit heavy( Information dumb wise) but it improved as the story rly set in.
  hope this fanfic is gonna be rly long, good health and such
