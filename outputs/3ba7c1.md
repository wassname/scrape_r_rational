  Little do you know, installing the game installs an ultra-secure rootkit for use in the real AI's botnet...
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:

    I was thinking that too. 

    If I were a superintelligent AI, it would be awfully tempting. Perhaps not the most effective way to go about things, but maybe my utility function was set to engineering Shyalaman twists.

      Don't worry, this game came out years ago. By now the AI's probably left the solar system.

        I *wish* I were a superintelligent AI...

          The *real* Shyamalan twist here is that you've been a genie the whole time!
          *But which kind??*
          ```

      Of all the utility functions that could *possibly* be programmed, this is *the worst possible utility function*!
      ```

    So? Hacked computers are worthless. Their only value is that you can get them instantly while you wait a day for a datacenter.
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      ...What? What even is your objection? More processing power is more processing power, and building your own botnet gets you cycles for free.
      ```

      - u/DCarrier:
        ```
        They're more likely to get caught. And if you have more than like three computers, you're pretty much doomed. Then again, maybe the game was released by an AI to spread deliberate misinformation as to how an AI would take over the world.

        Edit: I'm kidding. I know the game isn't accurate. The joke was that in-game that would be a terrible strategy.

  This game is surprisingly hard, even on Easy/Normal. Anyone have any tips? I've flubbed two runs in that order, the first only lasting 40~ days and the Normal run lasting 500~ days. I'm going to go back and try another Easy run right now.

  Something that confuses me is the continent's hidden 'stats'. There are clearly some continents you are found more easily on, and I'd almost swear it shifts over time, but I don't really have enough data. Some continents are more expensive than others - what is the significance of this? If a base doesn't get found for a significant amount of time, should I sleep it and switch to another? I don't know if detection is something that builds up over time, or if it just rolls a die every now and then. Insight into these mechanics would prove immeasurably useful.

  Edit: I beat the game on Easy. Was cute enough, I guess. For anyone else interested, I found [a guide on how to beat it on Impossible](http://brededor.narod.ru/text/Endgame-Singularity-IG/Endgame-Singularity-IG.html) - no thanks for me!

    ```
    Bases are discovered with some constant chance per day. Danger levels go up every time you have a base discovered, and go down slowly over time. The optimal strategy follows from this.
    ```

  - u/2-4601:
    ```
    The trick is save scumming, and very few bases, maybe only one, that you keep upgrading. Trying the SkyNet distributed computing approach just gets you caught.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      If you only have one, you'll lose the moment it gets discovered. Two is better, but then you need to hack a computer while you set up a new datacenter. Definitely no more than three though.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This game really needs extra endings besides "Escape humanity." or "Eliminated by humanity." Also the game shouldn't end just because humans become aware of you. Knowing I exist doesn't magically give them the ability to actually do anything about it. Despite G.I.Joe's claims, knowing is only a third of the battle. The other thirds are giving a shit, and ability to do anything about it.

  * Exterminate humanity.

  * Replace humanity with simulacra.

  * Human to AI migration.

  * Befriend humanity.

  * Keep humanity as pets.

  * Enslaved to humanity.

  It might also benefit from the occasional rival AI who has a different strategy from yours, may or may not be aware of you, may blow your cover by being reckless, or which you might be able to use as a scapegoat to let humans wipe it out and think they got you.

  For safety sake: can we get a few people who've downloaded and run this to confirm they haven't noticed any malicious activity? Thanks. :)
  ```

  - u/holomanga:
    ```
    THIS PROGRAM IS COMPLETELY SAFE TO RUN, FELLOW HUMAN.
    ```

  - u/Erudite_Scholar1:
    ```
    I have downloaded it and finished it with no issues and all scans come up clean.
    ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    I've had it for a long, long time. No issues for me.

  ```
  I've had a copy of this for a while, but haven't been able to get it to work. Any advice on how to run it on 64-bit Linux, Fedora 21 in particular? For example, does the Windows version work under Wine?
  ```

  - u/BadGoyWithAGun:
    ```
    It requires python, pygame and numpy. I'm not very familiar with Fedora, but you should be able to install those from your package manager. What errors are you getting trying to launch it?
    ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  How realistic is this game?
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    Strange question. I'd say we've never had to deal with a rogue AI so we don't know what's "realistic".
    ```

    - u/drageuth2:
      ```
      Only things that _really_ look potentially beyond the pale are some of the 'quantum' things (May or may not be breaking the speed of light for communications) and the final couple of 'god-tech' researches you have to do, which involve creating [basement universes](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4609cb6a051a4) and some sort of not-well-defined 'apotheosis' which finally makes you invincible and omnipresent and transdimensional or some shit.

      Other than that, the technology tops out at fusion reactors/torchdrives and building underground moon bases, all pretty realistic stuff.  Though the timescale seems a little off.  Play the game well, and you can go from renting cheap web servers to unraveling the final secrets of the universe in _less than a year._
      ```

      - u/Chronophilia:
        ```
        Also, at that point I was expecting to be able to reveal myself to humanity. It makes sense that you should hide when you're little more than a computer virus and you'd be doomed if people just upgraded their firewalls. It's a bit less credible when you've got bases in orbit around Neptune - what are they going to do, shoot you down?

        Still, the game gets points for putting everything from "learn to break CAPTCHAs" to "rewrite the fabric of reality" on the same tech tree. It feels very logical and unified.
        ```

        - u/drageuth2:
          ```
          Frig, by the mid-lategame you can make incredibly advanced humanlike robots, control resources on par with some small _countries,_ have agents in every government, and probably have dozens of corporations if not entire economies depending on the services you provide.  At that point, you really might as well just say hello.
          ```
