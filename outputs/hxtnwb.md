  This is old but I never posted it here and I want to keep the WTC fanfic streak going.

    Love the streak but I keep thinking the new chapters are up...
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I really like that. Nice possible back story on the Doris God.
  ```

  ```
  Anyone else think, aside from the timing, the Dorises could be  the origin story of the blood plane?
  ```

    ```
    Nice idea but I think if the elemental plane of blood had a lineage, which Doris presumably doessome essentialist would have done something with it, though that causing an exclusion kinda explains why the plane doesn't have a lineage.
