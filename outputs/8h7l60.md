  ```
  *Chicago* is an ongoing *Puella Magi Madoka Magica* fanfiction, written Bavitz, the author of [*Fargo*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo) and [*Modern Cannibals*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446468/1/Modern-Cannibals). *Fargo* was commonly viewed as rational on this subreddit, and there was interest in the sequel.

  >Chicago's hundred Magical Girls, united under a theocratic Empress, plan to expand their territory. Except Laila, Chicago's bookkeeper. Cushy job, couldn't care less about conquestâ€”until she's assigned to Chicago's invasion of St. Louis. Yeah, maybe this "Empire" thing's not so hot. Maybe it's time to get out. But the bigger an empire gets, the harder it is to escape...

  Also, because it needs to be said: I turned out to be completely incorrect, *Chicago* actually *is* a *PMMM* fanfiction, not an original work. In my defence, I was working off [that tweet](https://i.imgur.com/A11Ndd2.png).

  whoa, Bavitz is back. Wish he would tell us who he is if he's going to keep slumming it doing rat fanfic.

    ```
    Does anyone have any speculation as to who she or he might be?

    PS It better not be alexanderwales or EliezerYudkowsky writing and publishing in secret again...

    - u/HeckDang:
      ```
      Definitely not either of those two, the style is too different.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        TIL Skilled writers can't into another style...?
        ```

        - u/HeckDang:
          ```
          You would have to ask why they would do so even if you assume either of them could write like Bavitz does.
          ```

            ```
            Don't know; I'm probably just being a pedant about the word "definitely".
            ```

  - u/Hoactzins:
    ```
    He says he's a published author, let us buy his danged books! 

    Maybe he doesn't want to be known as that guy who writes anime fanfic?
    ```

    - u/HeckDang:
      ```
      Or maybe he doesn't want his reputation as a great anime fanfic writer tainted by his rubbishy mainstream work?
      ```

    - u/Timewinders:
      ```
      Publishers usually don't want their authors to write fanfic because of its dubious legality. He probably can only write fics anonymously.
      ```

    - u/Saintsant:
      ```
      Given how the relationship between those who make & consume entertainment was handled in Modern Day Cannibals, I'm not surprised in the slightest that he wants to maintain his privacy.
      ```
