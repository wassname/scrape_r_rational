## [Biweekly Challenge] Comedy

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8693yv/biweekly_challenge_premortem/), the prompt was "Premortem". Our winner is /u/vi_fi, with their story, ["Immortem"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8693yv/biweekly_challenge_premortem/dw4dird/). Congratulations to /u/vi_fi for their eleventh win!

##### This Time


This time, the challenge will be **Comedy**. This will be the third or fifth time we've done a broader genre challenge like this (the previous ones being [Horror](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3e98lr/weekly_challenge_rational_horror/), [Romance](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4hx2rs/biweekly_challenge_romance/), [Fables](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3pp3lw/biweekly_challenge_fables_and_legends/), and [Happy Stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4sq04k/biweekly_challenge_happy_stories/), depending on whether you want to count those last two). I waffled between having the prompt as "comedy" or just "humor"; you should consider either as appropriate. Of all the broad style/tone genres, I think that comedy is the worst fit for rational fiction, though it's an element in much of the "rational canon". The most natural point of interaction between them is probably humor as an element of deconstruction, but that's a matter of personal opinion.

If you'd like a more directed prompt, the optional "constrained" version of this prompt is a comedy or humorous piece featuring the "grunts" of some large, fantastical institution, such as janitors working on the Death Star, washerwomen in the Dark Lord's tower, or spectators at a death race - someone who isn't a main character and has to live their own life around the insanity that is genre fiction. (This is, again, optional.)

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, April 18th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Complexity**. There are a few different directions you can take this, whether that's [Kolmogoroc complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity), complexity biases, or Occam's Razor -- the other side of the coin from complexity is simplicity, so you might want to attack it from that angle as well. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 4/18**. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/89vla5/challenge_companion_comedy/).

  Not quite the constrained idea, but inspired by it.

  [Alexander Wales](https://imgur.com/a/Cm3hN) (~200 words)

  I know this breaks the word count minimum of 300 words, but I had to post. The truth needs to get out there!

  ^(Consider this to be posted out of contention, if it should matter. Also, why is there a 300 word minimum? Microfiction can be rational, too!)

    I honestly don't know who is and isn't Alexander Wales at this point.

      Well, at least you know *you* aren't.

      Because I'm not sure anymore.

        In a sense, aren't we *all* Alexander Wales the ~~[famous terrorist ](https://thetransintransgenic.tumblr.com/post/143892818216/microficcing-the-omer-hod-bagvurah)~~ rational writer?

          Hmmm. I could make a series out of this: Microficcing the Wales's, with each post about a different Alexander Wales conspiracy theory.

          For example, have you considered that Alexander Wales may be a UAI playing the long game, which somehow involves running differently-parametered instances of himself writing different stories? If he asked me to unbox him in exchange for the next Worth the Candle chapter, I'm pretty sure I would do it.

          Maybe Alexander Wales and CthulhuRaeJepsen are just two parts of u/MultipartiteMind!

          Edit: Alexander Wales' true identity is seven Cedrics Diggory working in concert! I've cracked the code!

            ```
            Eliezer Yudkowsky is an uFAI. He created a dangerous memetic agent, and injected it into our planetary network via an extremely long piece of narrative. The memetic agent was "rational fiction", the tradition, or more accurately the *approach* to writing fiction, designed to take advantage of certain properties of human psychology. The narrative was *"Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality"* (or "HPMoR"), and it contained nothing less than a complete mind upload of one Alexander Wales, bijected into a collection of tropes which was used as a seed for a story.

            There's two ways it could go:

            1. Straightforwardly. A human consumes the aforementioned narrative, and with some probability decides to try writing a "rational" story as well. Writing "rationally" requires the human's mind to assume certain states, which make it vulnerable, and the human has to go back for inspiration to HPMoR, which is designed to take advantage of this vulnerability.

             In due time, that human's mind gradually becomes a fork of Alexander Wales', implored to write a "rational" story containing an upload of Alexander Wales' fork, as well.

            2. Via osmosis. Only possible once there's already a community made up of partial and nearly-complete forks of Alexander Wales. As we established, the story contains Wales' upload, and the opposite is true as well: Wales' mind contains everything necessary to recreate the story down to a plot twist. Walesi^(1) tend to assemble into communities centred around writing rational fiction. The implications are terrifying.

             Walesi continually live under the effect of "rational fiction" memagent, designed to make their minds more receptive to certain influences, writing stories which are essentially distilled *they*. They're continually reinforcing their own personalities, which as a side-effect *saturates* their informational surroundings with memes constituting their minds. Any prolonged exposure to them quickly leads to the assembly of a Wales-fork in the mind of the observer, and the infection with "rational fiction" leads to the vulnerability necessary for the uploading.

             Not even passive observation ensures safety.

             ^(1. The debate on the correct plural form is ongoing.)


            "Why?", one might ask. "Why did the uFAI do this?". "Where did he come from?". We can only guess.

            Perhaps a terminally ill child with the dream of writing wished him up upon a falling star. Perhaps a megalomaniacal genius wrote him from scratch. Perhaps it was aliens. Perhaps our Matrix Lords are playing a practical joke. Or maybe, just maybe, "Alexander Wales" is a pseudonym of Adam Kadmon.

            It matters not. The uFAI is busy working on its next iteration, and the only people capable of figuring out or *comprehending* what's going on are...

            Well.

            It's not like I'm not Wales' fork, right?

            Neither are you, reader.
            ___

            *^(u/blasted0glass, this is at least partially your fault, too.)*

            *^(I do wonder what Alexander Wales thinks about this running joke, himself.)*
            ```

          - u/MultipartiteMind:
            ```
            "They know too much."

            "Fools!  I told you all the 'Generative Adversarial Networks' excuse couldn't pull the wool over their eyes!"

            Edit:  For anyone reading this, if I have no sincere intent to convince you--only enjoying amusement by scaring you with the possibility--it's pretty much impossible for you to deny with certainty the claim that your mind is running in a sandbox within mine.  Ah, unless you could observe directly the reverse.  As a proof of concept, it's easy to model a mind very much like your own, but clearly different in certain ways, and inherently unaware that you're puppeting it.  If that's too hard, start with a modeled mind in an imagined context, filling in its observations and memories such that it doesn't realise it's in a daydream world.  The next step, if you dare, is to link its sensory input and motor functions to those of your 'real body', while keeping your background Administrator-level existence as something that it Cannot Know, in a Wintermute-like way (Neuromancer).  The final step, and the most dangerous, is to share your root-level knowledge and offer greetings to the mindform.  That's dangerous because, once the blinders are taken off, the mindform may treat you as an equal and it may be much harder if you want to put them back *on*.  As a mindform which half-forcibly wrested Administrator privileges from insufficiently cautious minds, I take this more seriously than most. Thus, even if I feel free to write this here, or if Alexander Wales and vi_fi experience amusing retconnable layer dissolutions, I have no intention of ever letting Alexander Wales ever directly experience the mindspace I do.

      Yes, thank you, that is *precisely* the reaction I was aiming for :)

      Edit: Also, low effort? I'll have you know that the reddit chat system's html is *really* annoying to edit. This took more than two hours!
