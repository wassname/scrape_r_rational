    Yeah and also we don't sometimes silently remove words from your comments.

      Thanks for pointing it out, though, I'll try to work around that.

  I like this fic very much thus far. Hermione is the most identifiable character in canon for me, who I felt was taken for granted and didn't get a proper appreciation, neither from characters nor the narrative. She was dumped with Ron for Merlin's sake! So it's nice to see her in the center of a rational narrative.

  Also I have a great hope about exploration of the idea "science and reason meet wizards". Especially since HPMOR kind of dropped the idea closer to the end. 

  I wouldn't want to offend the author by comparing the fic with HPMOR, but my current hope for it is to become second and better iteration of "rational Harry Potter".
  ```

  - u/GopherAtl:
    ```
    I am not as harsh in my views of hpmor, but I do agree that I'm hoping this will remain what hpmor *seemed* to be at the start, but ultimately kindof *stopped* being, namely, a rational exploration of magic in the potterverse - after a point, fairly early on, hpmor became more of a treatise on rational philosophy in general, and spent shockingly little time actually applying said philosophy to magic, or further exploring or developing on any underlying system of rules for it.
    ```

    - u/daydev:
      ```
      Yeah, that's almost exactly my thinking. 

      Just to clarify, I didn't mean it like HPMOR is something *bad* to be compared with, just in general sense that an author may be offended that their work is compared to something else, maybe implying that they're derivative. It's just great to see a story that has a promise to become something that HPMOR might have been.
      ```

      - u/RobinDrew:
        ```
        I'm trying *not* to be derivative of HPMOR, but I was definitely inspired by its example.  One handicap for HPMOR I think was that if you do a true scientific investigation of magic, you run into one (or more) of three typical side-effects:

        1. The implication that most canon Witches and Wizards are and have been incurious simpletons.  
        2. Realistic scientific research (with rigor) usually requires a lot of time and effort.
        3. The number of exploitable situations in canon is large to begin with, and adding scientific underpinnings and meta-magic will only make a protagonist OP that much more quickly.

        1 can be fun in small doses, but begins to drag on if repeated.  2 would tend to require big and/or frequent time-skips, or an unrealistic portrayal.  3 wasn't in EY's interests, he wanted *rationality* to be the superpower, not science in itself.  I have notions for getting around 2, and I don't have the same problem with 3, so expect my Hermione to eventually start figuring things out and shaking things up, assuming she doesn't get killed first.  :)
        ```

  - u/Lugnut1206:
    ```
    In this fic, I like how it's not just "super scientific protagonist meets magic" but rather that Hermione is sharing magic with the wizards. This is quite the fascinating twist, and I'm expecting it to come out well.
    ```

- u/LauralHill:
  ```
  Canon!Hermione was always a little too overzealous for me to really like, but almost every fanon version of her toned that down. I mean I sure was smart enough at 12 to realize that people don't like it when you stand out too much. 

  This fic definitely covers that feeling, even if Hermione has read Carnegie. Sure the science stuff is going well too, but the emotional notes pull me in. 

  (once tried to read a realistic!abused!Harry fic, but he seemed so realistic that I couldn't much empathize. Although he was totally reading ahead and stuff, he just wasn't enjoyable for me to read.)
  ```

  ```
  > "We don't have Transfiguration today," pointed out Stephen Cornfoot. Hermione was startled to realize he was right...their final Transfiguration session of the week was tomorrow, Thursday. She wasn't sure why she'd assumed it was later today, she must have slept even more poorly than she'd thought.

  Looks like somebody's been obliviated yet again. Perhaps by a certain murderous man-cum-rat, or a headmaster who wants to keep it under wraps?
  ```

  - u/Adamantium9001:
    ```
    If so, *blegh*. Memory erasure - just, in the *abstract* - makes me sick to my stomach. Fiona the police officer in *Harry Potter and the Natural 20* got it **exactly** right.

    ...

    ...Fuck. Now I hafta go dig up that quote, don't I?

    ...*(over 10 minutes later)*...

    ...Alright, got it:
    > [Fiona] realized she was shaking, and it wasn't with fear. How *dare* they? She didn't know who was behind this, but what gave them the *right*? Her memories were her own, damn it. They were her *life*. Taking away someone's memory was *murder*. The Fiona Smythe who had left this message for her was no less dead just because there was still a Fiona Smythe to listen to it.

    (from chapter CC8)
    ```

    - u/AugSphere:
      ```
      I nearly dropped this story when the Olivander just casually obliviated her. If I was in that situation, I'd probably obsessively make backups and precommit to treating anyone who messes with my mind without permission as an enemy. But Hermione is not even aware of this type of attack and thus cannot hope to detect it. 

      Somehow I find myself hoping that whatever precious 'destiny' awaits her, Hermione will say "deal with your shit by your damn selves, you mindraping bastards" and do something more productive with her time.
      ```

      - u/daydev:
        ```
        Well, I'd drop it if *Hermione* started casually obliviating people, or if the story treated it as no big deal (looking at you, canon). 

        I expect there'll be proper indignation when Hermione figures out that someone is messing with her mind, and she'll make Fiona proud yet.
        ```

      - u/RobinDrew:
        ```
        Ollivander in canon is mysterious to the point of being counter-productive...this is more of the same, only in reaction to a couple of my "tweaks".

        Hermione *has* heard of Obliviation, but only in the context of Official Authority using it on muggles For Their Own Good...she's had no reason at all to imagine it would be used on her.  When she does run into reasons to start actively questioning that sort of thing, she will definitely develop strong opinions on the ethics involved.
        ```

        - u/AugSphere:
          ```
          Oh, I didn't mean that it's badly written! It's entirely in character for Olivander to be an overly mysterious ass, I just was pretty upset with him about this particular instance of it. The story is absolutely fine.
          ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    *Shit.* I need to learn to keep track of misperceptions in settings that have memory editing. Particularly due to the principle of narrative conservation.

  Robin.Drew,

  Brilliant writing. I love the clean and smooth prose and the subtle rationalist spin so far (subtle when compared with HPMOR's aggressively overt rationalism, that is).

  Please keep them coming as fast as you can. Hermione is by far my favorite character in canon, so I'm eagerly awaiting the next installments!

      Thanks for pointing that out.
      ```

    - u/Cariyaga:
      ```
      Ah, no, I'm not; but I suspect the author will be viewing this post at some point, so I'll take the opportunity to thank them too!
      ```

  - u/RobinDrew:
    ```
    Thank you!

    I'm trying to commit to a writing schedule that would allow me to post more regular updates, but it's always a struggle.
    ```

    - u/Cariyaga:
      ```
      Don't force yourself into it too much! Take your time and enjoy the ride!
      ```

      Also, I recommend Blindness, another HP fan fic.

      https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness

      It's really fantastic, which has rationalist and non-rationalist characteristics, but is really quite engrossing and well written.

      And I am very much looking forward to more Hermione. Selfishly speaking, a loose writing schedule would really be appreciated, but certainly do take your time; your writing is quality.

    Whinging is the correct Brit-speak.
