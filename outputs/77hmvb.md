## Let's munchkin SCPs!

### Post:

For
 example:

* Encase Professor Umbridge, a redshirt, or a D-class in a cyllindrical 
object with a hole on the top and the bottom.

* Attach a laser pointer so that it is aimed through both holes in the 
cyllindric canister, and would go through if the expendable subject 
weren't in the way.

* place [SCP-272] (http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-272) where the laser 
would hit if the subject weren't in the way, the 'shadow'

* Attach cylinder, person, and laser aparatus to a crank and a 
generator, rotate cyllinder with motor to create piston action to rotate
 generator, by moving the shadow and causing SCP-272 to move the subject
 so that the laser shadow stays on SCP-272.

Or:

* Expose Professor Umbridge and Rita Skeeter, or 2 redshirts, to 
[SCP-3513](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3513).

* If possible, remove the beak that forms in their brains; otherwise, cut a hole in the 
subjects' brains and string one of them upside down above the other.

* Place a funnel in one beak, make sure the other is positioned above the funnel.

* Pour water.

* Add a generator in between.

  I don't think infinite energy is up to par here. Submitted munchkinry should ideally constitute Global Victory, such as by solving the Halting Problem, receiving friendly advice from the distant future, or transporting humanity into a pocket dimension of your personal omnipotence.

    Or if you're really up to the challenge, making it so the world is no longer in danger.

    In the SCP world, global victory means defeating the various horrors of the universe, which ... if anything, might become *harder* after doing all of the described things considering some of the memetic hazards which are in that universe.

  One I've come up with a while ago is based on [SCP-674](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-674). You precommit to performing some action (such as attempting to kill SCP-682 with a certain SCP) if a given person dies. Then you have someone shoot that person in a security camera, and have them report what happens.

    That SCP sounds *so fun*. Binge a series, then shoot a character in the pilot episode and binge it again.
    ```

  It's more fun to reverse munchkin SCP's to escape, I think

  Christ where to even start, for one given the stuff 294 has dispensed you could likely get it to dispense anomalous materials that would let you achieve world domination, or potentially a cup of grey goo preloaded with an AI that would take on the most consistent version of your utility function or something similar.

  Also there's that SCP that is a child with godlike power (so they could probably be relatively easily used to do damn near anything with slight persuasion), plus there's an SCP that is basically god and yet is portrayed as human enough that you could potentially convince them to take actions which would let you achieve world domination either directly or indirectly.

  And I mean those are _just the one's I can think of off the top of my head_, the full list of one's you could use like that is probably in the dozens. However, the ultimate issue here is that given the canon of SCP actually trying to do nearly any of these things is likely to end in some horrifying eldritch horror eating the universe. Simply because the world continuing to exist is so much due to luck and precarious balance that trying to do nearly anything of consequence probably dooms humanity (or at least dooms us perhaps marginally faster than we would have been otherwise).

    Now we know why they had to build that one SCP that clones enough humans to restart the population after a human extinction event. Someone at the Foundation thought they had a clever idea involving two SCPs and things went downhill from there.
    ```

  SCP Foundation's site has a story centred on this already: [*Visions of a Better World*](http://www.scp-wiki.net/visionsofabetterworld). It's a collaborative work which works like this: someone comes up with a way to muncking an SCP, describes the Foundation doing so; next person writes how it went horribly wrong, and adds another munckinry idea.

  Of course, these stories are deliberately written to go wrong, but this is sort-of canon: it's the Foundation's policy to not use SCPs in its work *because* it's quite likely to backfire. Munchkinry *isn't done* in this universe, not with anomalies.

  Did that ever stop r/rational, though? Ha! My idea:

  Put 1 [SCP-963](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-963) and 1 recording of any simple memagent capable of putting a slight suggestion on the target in [SCP-914](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-914), refine on "1:1" setting. Iterate until you have a two-stage memagent which rewrites the mind of the victim with the mind of someone who first perceived it. Use it on a trusted operative.

  Then infect [SCP-001.Swann](http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandrewswann-s-proposal) with it.

  Did someone mention "Global Victory"?
