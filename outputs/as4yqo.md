## [Spoilers MoL Chapter 96] How did he...

### Post:

How did Jornak retain continuity through resets? To do that, he would have had to:

1) Discover the true nature of the time loop and its relation to the Sovereign Gate.

2) Contact Panaxeth, which would likely require entering the control room. Which would require either Zach's marker or cooperation with Zach, and Zach knowing some soul magic and having some soul awareness. And also infiltrating the time magic research facility.

3) Get a temporary marker, the only way we know how to do so requiring Quatach-Ichl's crown.

4) Somehow modify said temporary marker.

All in the span of a single month. But Jornak Prime wasn't interested in changing the world. For him to be motivated to go through all that trouble would require him to already retain continuity. So how did he become Red Robe?

I suppose if Zach and Jornak had spent a lot of time together, a freak accident may have occured like with Zorian. But that's pretty unlikely. Zach likely would've given him a temporary marker willingly, since they were friends. But that would require both getting the crown from Quatach-Ichl and knowing its significance. 

Edit: The Gate was stolen from Zach. That might have given Jornak a reason to check up on it. And Panaxeth might've been able to reach him through the Gate somehow...

Edit: According to Chapter 76, Jornak was an informant for the Cult of the Dragon Below. He gave information on House Boranova, but what if he was informed of the time loop? He might have told the Cult, who were having trouble summoning demons. That information might have made its way to Quatach-Ichl. It didn't take much for Quatach-Ichl to realize that the world that they're in isn't real. And then Quatach-Ichl might decide to speak with Zach? I don't know. If they knew the crown could give temporary markers, then Quatach-Ichl might have given it to Zach, in exchange for a marker. But how would they know that?

Edit: Since Quatach-Ichl didn't know the time loop wasn't the real world, he might have stopped the invasion to see what would happen. Or given the means to do so to Zach, since he can't know about the loop. That would give Zach information on how the time loop works. And then Zach gives them another marker, and tells them the info. And then? 

Edit: Maybe they all go to the Gate. Quatach-Ichl gets them all into the control room; Zach can't do it by himself with soul awareness, as far as we know. And the mechanism to make sure no one but Zach can get in is easy to circumvent. Panaxeth might decide to pop in and say hi. And then Jornak makes the deal?

  I think its through the use of the black room, he maybe wanted to help Veyers better control his magic, as such he only needed time ->blackrooms -> very close to the sovereign gate. Veyers then returned to the classroom with new control telling zach about this as they are in similar positions. Zach meeting Jornak. Or searching for him in a new restart to get in on the time in the balckroom (maybe over multiple restarts, again zach struggling with his contorls in the beginning of the loop). Jornak got some good connections and in chapter 54 it is said that the royals regularly checked up on the sovereign gate (connection to dagger). So after letting Zach entering the black room a couple times, Panaxeth contacts Jornak, because he sees an opening. And Panaxeth helping Jornak getting a stable marker is not that far fetched. 

  &#x200B;

  Or zach told him about the gate and the items stolen from him and they checked up on it based on that. But i think it was because of the blackroom project.

    Of course! The Gate was stolen from Zach! That explains...some things. I suppose if Panaxeth could pull someone into the control room if they touch the Gate or something, that could work...

    Do we know what happens if someone's soul is in the control room when the iteration ends? Maybe that's how Jornak initially retained continuity, with Zach's consent...but then how would he get into his old body? Hm...

      I dont think it was Zach helping him with that, i think it was Panaxeth, after all panaxeth is even powerfull enough to create new bodies in the real world and transport their souls there , should be easy to take one soul and merge the marker into it... or just remerge it into the new body at the start of every restart. But Jornak needed the marker to leave and bare the gate that way... so most likely Panaxeth merging the marker into his soul. Except that its a kind of deus ex machina , so something we just dont know yet. Maybe Jornak has some connection to one of the other immortals, someone very skilled in divine magic etc... but i doubt that.

  What Jornak said about how Zach "just wouldn't understand" seems to imply that they had already spent some time together, so Zach likely already knew how to give people the ability to retain continuity. But why would Zach use such an ability when he knows that he would eventually have to take it away or kill them? I guess if he wanted to do some legal prep for his court case, he might give Jornak a temporary marker. But that still doesn't explain how Jornak could modify his marker or contact Panaxeth.

  And I don't think Jornak accepted Panaxeth's deal until he already became frustrated with Zach, which would likely take longer than a month. The only explanation that I can think of is that Jornak already had some way of maintaining continuity between restarts before betraying Zach.

  I suppose out of everyone in the story, Jornak would be in the best position to become Red Robe. But there's still a lot of things that need explaining.

    Jornak's marker must have been degrading and he had no choice but accept Panaxeth's deal. Or he might have found some loophole in the angel's contract that he exploited to stay with Zach long enough to backstab him. 

    Once RR was revealed there'll be people who want explanations even though the novel ain't even over yet. Just chill.

  Maybe QI had once been in a time loop himself. He has a divine blessing for his mana reserves and was very quick to sacrifice himself when he learned about the time loop which maybe suggests that he was already familiar with the concept.

  If this is true then maybe QI explained to Jornak how the time loop works and QI lended him the crown to get a temporary marker. Then he tried to leave the loop before the the end of his last temporary loop, but that didn't work because he is not the controller. But Panaxeth used this chance to tell him how to get a longer lasting marker in exchange for freeing it.

  I figure that Zach put a temporary marker on him so he could lawyer it up and get all the info over the course of 6 restarts.  How many restarts would it take for him to get some deep dirt on the government? Then get disgruntled?
  ```

  ```
  Jornak knows QI, or is at least in an organization that can meet with him easily.

  Jornak and Zach go to talk to him, as Zach still thinks he's invincible.

  QI learns their story and says, "Hey that's a cool soul marker you've got.  Lets do some experimenting!"

  Jornak gets ends up with the same effect as Zorian.
