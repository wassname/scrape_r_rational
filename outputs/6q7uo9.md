  I love this :D

  Read it before I even knew you were a part of this community and adored it even then -- I've always loved the strange worldbuilding of homestuck and sburb and you expand on it wonderfully here.

    Thanks so much. It means a lot to me that people enjoy my writing.

  Replay session? 
  Is this part of a series? 

  I'm not familiar at all with the concept so I'm pretty confused if there's something I have to read before or it's supposed to begin in the middle of things like this or it's just a genre of HS fanfiction

      Yeah. You don't really have to read any other works in the AU to get it (at least I hope so), but the background is all there. It's mostly just the core idea that after you beat the game you keep playing it in a new session forever, but there are a few other concepts that are considered part of the RVAU canon like new classes and aspects and corruption from angels and horrorterrors. But most of what I've been writing I've tried not to draw too deeply from obscure AU sources or write about anything that would require hours of reading to understand.

          That's... actually a really good point. Honestly one of the best things that I've had so far is that so many people are so eager to put forward different ideas and theories behind things, and while I already have the sort of "Mega plot" mapped out long in advance, it really gives me so many good places to choose from to explore and write about.

        I see, I'm having a lot of fun reading, although I'm a bit confused by the fact that some players are completely ignoring the gender restrictions on classes, is there a reason for that?
        ```

        - u/medicinalElectricals:
          ```
          That's a complicated question actually. One answer is that the original sburb glitch FAQ actually came out before gender restrictions were canonized in homestuck proper, and another is that there are only so many classes, and assigning male players to female classes and visa versa just makes it easier to create and explore characters. You could probably look at it best in terms of gender tendencies rather than gender restrictions - if classes are attached to people with specific traits and issues, maybe some of those issues are more likely to occur in people socialized female or male. Gender in the real world is already hard enough to define and deal with, I'd imagine that even if sburb had specific gender routines too they would be easily corruptible. How would the game deal with a transgender person, or someone who didn't identify with any gender at all, or someone who was intersex.

          Hell, now that I think about it, I might actually make a chapter about this. But tl;dr gender restrictions aren't a thing because I don't want them to be.

            I see I see, I got up to chapter 34 and saying that I'm engrossed by the story is an underestimation. 

            I really like that it reads like a cutting room floor article, It's my favorite kind of reading. 

            Also I wonder if dream bubbles are a thing or the whole replayerverse thing is just taking place on a part of paradox space that has no such thing "yet". 

            Since paradox space is totally weird I suppose that infinite stories could happen in any timeframe 

            Edit: guess dream bubbles so exist as a few chapters later, good to know
            ```
