## rational!legend of zelda?

### Post:

how would you do this? Some things to think about:

The gerudo only have one male child every 100 years. They're a semi-nomadic desert people who capture hylian soldiers in order to continue the survival of their tribe. They're all dark-skinned, while the hylian's are all light skinned. Also, lots of fantastic racism goes unaddressed and even is vindicated. Why all the hylian supremacy?

Also, what to do about reincarnation? Would a reincarnation be the same person as their previous incarnations, being "reborn" so to speak, or would they be entirely new characters descended from the previous ones with genetic memories, or would they be magic clones or something? Reincarnation seems to play a very big role in Legend of Zelda.

Also, how to munchkin the setting in Legend of Zelda?

Thoughts?

  "So the guy named *Ganondorf* kidnapped Princess Zelda? *Really*? Color me fucking surprised."

  "Where are you going, Hero of Time?"

  "To the pot room. You have a pot room, right?"

  "A...a pot room?"

  "Okay, listen up. Find a room with a door, fill it with pots. I need rupees."

  "I...I'm sure we can supply -"

  Link waved a hand irritably. "I'll have to buy something stupid at some stupid shop in La La Original Magical Creatures Land so I can trade it for some other dumb thing. Just get me pots, damn it."

  "A-As you say, Hero of Time."

  99 rupees later, Link backstepped outside, unsheathing his wooden stick. It was better than the Master Sword since he had figured out how to swing it like a billion times per second without it ever breaking.

  [I brought this up myself a year ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xilpd/bst_rationallegendofzelda/). The fic ran into major obstacles in dungeon design, communicating those designs to the reader, and the unending question where the line between videogame and text ought to be.

  What I said then:

  > For or those two people who don't know what LoZ is all about, I'll summarize: it's a game series where you play as Link, the prophesied hero and bearer of the Triforce of Courage who will defeat the evil Ganon, bearer of the Triforce of Power, thereby saving Princess Zelda, bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom and the rest of the kingdom of Hyrule. Along the way of this epic quest you will meet and help a variety of side characters and collect an arsenal of tools and devices, including the Master Sword, The Blade of Evil's Bane.
  > How do we rationalize that? It's pulp fantasy, through and through.
  For everyone wondering about rationalizing these sorts of irrational stories, I have some advice. I've been doing a lot of thinking on this topic, and there seem to be two approaches:
  > * Take everything about the story and deconstruct it, rebuilding a carefully designed narrative. LoZ doesn't really have enough meat to sustain a story like that for very long.
  > * Take one thing about the story and exploit it to the fullest, usually what the story did best. For LoZ, these are its Dungeons.

  > And so, **I propose the rationalization of the Legend of Zelda series by means of making Link an architect**. The fic will take a rationalist slant to architecture, engineering, level design, and puzzle design/solving.

  To this /u/syberdragon replied:

  > I like the concept and appreciate the insight in your planning/creative process, but... trying to attend a magic academy? I know ration!lovedStoryFromChildhood usually diverges pretty fast, but they usually start similarly. If your using Twilight Princes as your reference, then why not have Link start off living in a ranching town out in the boonies. He could be studying with an old architect who decided he wanted to retire away from the busy city. Then he can be thrown in to the adventure in typical LoZ fashion and rationalize his way from there. I feel he needs to start in the same place he would in any other LoZ game.

  The idea was that Link would bring an knowledgeable commentary to each and every vista while trying to save the world and ultimately break the cycle for good. But this required a huge amount of research, because I wasn't just trying to talk about architecture -- which can be very cool -- but *fantasy* architecture, and I had to do so in a way to make it cool for people who don't care about medieval masonry at all. A tall order indeed.

  I just thought of something. The triforce could represent virtues of instrumental rationality.

  *Wisdom to determine what is right, despite your biases...
  Courage to attempt what is right, despite your fears...
  Power to accomplish what is right, despite your weaknesses...*

  Of course, the triforce can be used for good or for evil, so it would be a bit more accurate to say “instrumentally rational,” or “right given your values” rather than just “right”

  We had a thread on this [some time ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xilpd/bst_rationallegendofzelda/). I don't have anything in particular to add that hasn't already been mentioned there, but it's probably a helpful reference for the discussion.

    Rational puzzle design: A door is sealed with a small tube that has a series of tumblers. In order to unseal the door you need a piece of metal with ridges on it at precise heights, in order to allow the tumblers to line up just right to allow the cylinder to turn. It would be a very easy puzzle, except there's no way to see the tumblers and tell how to line them up. The puzzle is impossible to all but the designer.

      A series of tumblrs might be more difficult.

    Rationalizing the keys is easy. The "key" is actually a container for a fairy, it opens the door by breaking and releasing the fairy.

    Of course now you have to rationalize the fairies, but you have to do that anyway. Maybe they're responsible for the hearts and rupees that Link finds everywhere too. 

    The dungeon ecosystems are driven by magic, with thaumovores and thaumosynthetic plants at the base of the food chain. That's why they're holes in the ground... the first dungeons were natural caverns that reached down to the mana table, later ones were a combination of mines and magic farms, abandoned when the Hyrulian civilization crumbled.

    Edit: I love the suggestion in the comments that Navi is the hero. You could start out with Link as the unreliable narrator gradually being replaced by Navi as she realizes that she has to take control of the mission before Link completely stuffs it up.

  If someone was *really* thinking clearly about the whole thing, they'd locate a means to use time travel to go back and prevent Demise from cursing the goddess Hylia/Zelda and the hero Link to perpetual triple reincarnation.

  I think King Daphnes Hyrule was the clearest thinker in the series: he obtained the power to end the curse and its cycles, allowing the eventual creation of a civilization that wouldn't always get ruined by evil overlords on a regular basis.

    I don't think this story is known at the time of any other Zelda game.  It seems like it got lost pretty quickly, or this was really, really long ago.

    Then again, "use time travel to figure out what you can" is a solid strategy and might lead to learning this.  Though I think hopping in a time machine and throwing the dial as far back as it'll go is a strategy we wouldn't flinch to call stupid if it didn't pan out, so I don't know if it's the obvious rational choice.

  [*Second Quest*](http://www.secondquestcomic.com/#intro) is a really startling interrogation of some of the aspects of the worlds of the zelda games.

  [Spoiler](#s "You have to have a really fucked up society to produce the kind of deadly puzzleboxes the games are composed of, to encourage the kind of blind provado every Link has been embodied, to keep forgetting its history as often as it does and to make such absolute villains of every one of its adversaries.")

  I'd take it from Zelda's perspective rather than Link's. So much potential there. In at least some incarnations, Zelda has telepathic abilities that she can use while imprisoned by her kidnapper. She can coordinate her own rescue while running her kingdom. How awesome is that?
