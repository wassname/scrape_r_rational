  Alright, I'll just say it for everyone:

  GOOD IS BULLSHIT
  ```

  - u/notagiantdolphin:
    ```
    The Gods Above seemed to get the Bard out of whatever deal they made with the Gods Below, and the Dead King has his glowing gemstone. I really, really hope that whatever that gem alerts him to is at least as much bullshit as this and the Saint put together.

    Or that Cat managed to convince Ranger to hide in a guideverse bag of holding equivalent for strategic deployment as a middle finger in this battle, whatever.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      I think the Dead King's gem was him getting a message from Malicia.
      ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  Man that last paragraph, I could *feel* the despair at her effort getting completely invalidated. Erraticerrata brilliantly toes the "only the author can save them now" line by making us temporarily forget about all the secret plans and powerful people on Cat's side, just for a moment.

  Also that conversation with Zeze feels like it's foreshadowing some super important stuff, like the "end" of the great debate of the gods... will creation unravel if/when it happens? Also foreshadowing potential pantheon woe replacing the old gods?

    This actually fits really well with what Cat is trying to do. Change how the world works. Without the context of Black/Cat he sounds just like a megalomaniac villain destined for failure. But together it feels like a fight not of Good vs Evil but Freedom vs being Bound.
    ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      It also shows in small mentions of how the good guys are becoming "blatant in stacking the deck". Instead of small nudges, they've started ramping up their interference.

      All the while I imagine the gods below just laughing at them saying "even when you stack the deck, you are losing". I can imagine the level of interference going above an unspoken line, granting great power to the Evil side.
      ```

      - u/HPMOR_fan:
        ```
        You're right there have been several mentions about that lately. I just took it as the way it's always been but Cat hasn't been around long enough to have seen it. But it could be indicating a tipping point is coming.

    ```
    Where is the stairway?
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      The updated part wasn’t the stairway, it was the erasing Liesse.

      But I think it was south of hedges
      ```

      - u/Razorhead:
        ```
        Not only that, Harrow has been removed from the map. You can see the distortion near Hedges.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          Where?
          ```

          - u/Razorhead:
            ```
            Directly left of Hedges. You can even see the border of the map bending.

            Compare with [this map, the original.](https://practicalguidetoevil.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/t2iwdoy.jpg)

            - u/Ardvarkeating101:
              ```
              (I was joking, like, what's Harrow)
              ```

  - u/KarlitoHomes:
    ```
    Nice work with the other change.
    ```

- u/cidqueen:
  ```
  Grey fucking Pilgrim
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  So... portal out of here?
  ```

  - u/Oaden:
    ```
    Still got the absolute position thing, what ever the hell that is. 

    Plus what ever the hell Adjudant is doing.
    ```

- u/ForgottenToupee:
  ```
  Fuck man, I just don’t see how they’re gonna turn this around
  ```

- u/TaltosDreamer:
  ```
  The Saint Of Swords doesnt seem big on sight powers... I wonder how tough it would be to drop illusions on the heroes and let Saint think she is cutting through the villains?  Would be quite the poetic way to end the Grey Pilgrim.
  ```

  - u/Flamesmcgee:
    ```
    Nah, she ripped through Cat's glamour with extreme ease.
    ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  Just realized that It’s now Cat vs. 7 heroes and 1.  Those poor sods.
  ```
