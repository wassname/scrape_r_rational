  There's also a phone app for this.  Was an entertaining way to kill time on an airplane (no network needed after download).

    Yeah, I downloaded it about a month ago and played it a bunch. 

    My tips: Probes are the most expendable, and you will suffer greatly if you lose landing gear, or your scientific/cultural databases.

      When forced to chose between databanks, settlers, probing systems, or landing, I chose landing, and waited for a low gravity world with oceans.  Lost 49 colonists in the descent, but out of a 1000, that's not so bad.  

      "*Engaged Atomic Age Democracy*" was the result of that one.

        Sounds like you did OK - if the hit had taken out 10-20% of your landing or construction gear, you end up taking heavy hits to your colonist populations which result in the scientific/cultural databases being reduced. You can definitely take one or two landing hits, but more than that and you're in trouble.

        I generally get rid of the surface probes and the scanners first, focusing all the damage to a single scanner, and keeping two scanners as pristine as possible to upgrade.

          Played it many times, that was my 2nd best one.

          I still find it irritating how stupid the colonists can be.

          Oh look, there's *deadly ruins* over here... let's mount an expedition that gets **300** people killed.  That's... that's great.  I figure the AI could leave them a note that says "Hey, this place will kill you, don't go there!", but... alas.

  What a terrific project. Thanks for sharing this. I seriously want to just stay in space until making contact with a spaceage civilization, but there is no guarantee that that is a possible result. That option was less tempting after getting my seedship attacked by thieves. Iâ€™m pretty happy with my second result: the colony on the ice world of Heart reaches the Information Age with 97% of their cultural records.
