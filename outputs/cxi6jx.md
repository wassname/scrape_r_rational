## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Let's talk about playing defense on the Internet. What strategies do you take, as a writer or other content creator, to avoid being the subject of a witch-hunt by people who misperceive, misunderstand, or mislike your work?

  Three obvious techniques are:

  - to try to not write stuff that's controversial, preventing the controversy from forming in the first place
  - to use a pseudonym in a way that detaches your creator-identity from anything that could affect your life outside the pseudonym
  - to ignore controversy surrounding the things you create, denying controversy any power over you

  But what are the other techniques?
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    To sustain yourself entirely off the attention of the masses, good or bad. The controversy FEEDS you!

    A.K.A, the zach weinersmith, "begging for hate mail" option.

    Some people write author's notes to help explainify things (eg. The views of the characters are not the the author's views)

    Beating the crowd or person into submission through name calling, the questioning of their intelligence and salt.

    In all seriousness there's the option of looking at what people comment, filtering out the noise and finding those with merit and then addressing them through the story. Maybe not the next chapter but at some point in the story.

    Basically a silent author who watches the fire but takes notes.

    Picture a large mob of angry people. They’re all standing in a stadium, shouting at each other, screaming insults and laughing. Behind you is a guillotine, on your left is a cart already half full with severed heads and decapitated bodies. In your shaking hands, you’re holding a paper. As the crowd falls silent, you have to read what is written on the paper aloud. Your survival will depend on the reaction of the crowd. People are staring at you, some of them expectantly, some of them with boredom, some of them with a piercing fury that already sees you lying on the chopping block. You start reading.

    (note that this doesn't mean you have to censor yourself in terms of themes and story; just be really really careful not to give too much ammunition to people looking to take you down; Wildbow is a pretty good example to follow, and he still gets tons of hatemail, I'm told)

  I'm watching Star Trek again; it's a bit formulaic, a bit impractical, and a bit irrational but its optimistic view of the future gets me every time.

    I'm going to disagree and say that's there's no *bit* about it.

    It's also massively anti-transhumanist, which alone would be enough to put me off it.

  If this subreddit let people submit songs with rational themes as well as stories, I'd put [A Light, An Answer](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZRew-b78ZFg) here.

    I'd also put forward [Apple](https://youtu.be/NOD5vhlTr9k). Though it is a little more humanist than it is rational.

    As someone who listens to primarily classical music I find it's worth it to buy decent quality headphones/in-ears. There are a lot of caveats and things to keep in mind when you're looking into audio stuff.

    The first is to have a very strong understanding of precisely what you actually need and are looking for. For listening to random music while you're exercising, the noise from your movement is probably going to prevent you from noticing a lot of fine detail, and you finding that $15 in-ears are nearly as good as $150 headphones isn't that surprising. In general, you want to avoid paying for any feature that you don't actually need, or that doesn't have a noticeable effect.

    Regarding "well-known brands," when choosing consumer audio stuff (professional is a little different) the brand is not very important, and known brands can even have a premium that isn't justified by the product's quality. You have to look at each individual product model & how it performs & read reviews by people that know what they're talking about, and importantly, that actually do the tests with a decent methodology. And even then, at the end of the day the conclusion is going to be subjective.

    I will say, looking at the brands you specifically mention having owned, they are all ones I personally would avoid in general (Shure, Bose, Skullcandy, even Sennheiser) due to either being low quality, overpriced or some other reason. If you read around (for example in [head-fi forums](https://www.head-fi.org/forums/)) you generally get an idea that there are a few standout models of headphones, IEMs etc that everything else is judged by. For example, my current set of headphones is the Sony MDR-7506 which [was introduced in 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_MDR-V6#MDR-7506) and is still on the market today. Audio is particularly a case where "new" does not necessarily mean "better."

    In the IEM case when I was looking for a "balanced" sound type set the standard for comparison was Fischer Audio-DBA-02, a brand which you may not be familiar with. I ended up going with the Brainwavz B2 which is essentially the same driver but slightly tweaked to have a stronger bass. The only reason I'm not still using them is that the cable deteriorated (became stiff & tended to break) so much that it wasn't really feasible to continue repairing it. Partly for that reason I replaced them with the Audio Technica ATH-IM02 which is honestly probably slightly worse sound quality despite being over double the price (although it could likely become better if I bought a specialised amplifier) but have detachable/replaceable cables & substantially better build quality.

    Your use case is that you're using the to listen while exercising. This has unique needs (as you note - your Sennheisers are wearing out due to this.) For example, you might think about - can you easily replace the ear contact padding once it gets worn? How's the weight/comfort? Sound quality itself is just one of many concerns you might have, and sometimes it's not the most important. You mention you like the look of the P7s - this is a legitimate thing to keep in mind as a consideration.

    I could see two different strategies you could go for. You could get the best "value" headphones spending as little as possible and just expect to replace them fairly often as they wear out. This would likely be perfectly fine as you can usually find sound quality that's almost as good as the high end (especially when being driven by a smartphone & not in a quiet environment) for much, much cheaper. Alternatively, you could go for a higher end set that you intend to keep for longer, but you do have to make sure that it actually has the features it needs & you have the knowledge you need to be able to make it last. Up to you what you feel is going to be better.

    Regardless, doing research pays off heavily in this area. Not only product research, but understanding what actually matters, how to translate your own preferences into the terms reviewers use, how to read reviews properly, and importantly, learning which reviews to actually pay attention to in the first place. People's opinion of audio equipment is heavily influenced by what they've been exposed to before and even people who know exactly what they're doing and have a lot of experience have their own subjective preferences. So it's pretty typical to see a lot of positive reviews for even gear which is objectively crap or not worth the price compared to other options.

    If you don't want to do research, it's going to be more difficult to get good value and you might have to accept paying more. Still apply a skeptical mindset of course and you should still ask yourself exactly what it is you're looking for, but if spending a few hundred dollars more for something you use a lot is less of an investment than the time and effort of learning about your options then that could be the better choice. For someone with a full-time, decently paid job that's probably going to be the case, unless you enjoy the process of learning about & understanding these things for itself in addition to its utility to you.

    Well, I mostly buy midrange and the differences between really cheap headphones and things like Senheissers are night and day for me. It may just be that these differences don't influence your experience as much as they do for me or some others who splurge.

     And while I can't speak personally I do know many think extremely expensive headphones quickly start to hit diminishing returns so keep that in mind when buying $300+.
    ```

  - u/ratthrow:

    My daily drivers are Audeze iSINE 20s ($600 MSRP). Audiophile bullshit is mostly bullshit. A lot of it is hobbyist enthusiasm and diminishing returns.

    Lower quality headphones usually sound a little muddier to me but for casual day to day use it really doesn't matter because there's so much ambient noise anyway.

    Have you tried the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x? You can find them on sale or used for under $100.

    Re: P7s, I don't know, what do you want? If you're reasonably happy with your Sony's, I can promise you that spending another $200 won't bring you to a totally new level of happiness. But if you can afford it, why not?

        Looks like P7s are going for around $200 used on eBay. That's probably worth a shot, audiophiles generally take unusually good care of their stuff.

          Also, wireless isn't _that_ bad anymore. Bluetooth has come a long way and some audio companies are starting to take it quite seriously.

          I have the Ciphers myself and they're quite nice for HQ audio on the go.

  I am a bit sad two web serial authors I enjoy decided to switch gears.

  It has me thinking, as an aspiring author myself, how do other writers avoid burnout? Did particular writing habits trip you up that you plan to avoid in the future?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I think schedules and deadlines are one of the things that cause burnout for me most often. I treat writing like a job, but it's a job where I can take mental health days, or where I can start up new projects that are particularly tickling my fancy, and where I'm as minimally beholden to grinding through a lack of desire as I can be. I think what happens a lot of the time when people get burnout is that they get into this cycle of not wanting to do the project, then doing it anyway, which just leads to more and worse bad feeling toward the project. You can, to some extent, simply grind things out, but that doesn't fix the problem, it just makes it worse. Especially with serial authors, not getting at the root of the problem just means that the problem gets worse and worse.
    ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    I have some writing experience myself. The only way to avoid burnout (in my experience) is to never stop writing. Make it a habit and set a minimum period of time for writing. Clock in and clock out at the same time every day. Never finish a project without having started another. Never end on finishing a chapter without having begun the next one.
    ```
