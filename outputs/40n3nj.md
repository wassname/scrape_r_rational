  This works for adventurers that never get far above level 6, but once you get into high teens, your adventures both a) become larger sources and sinks of wealth than entire empires and b) have 'fate of the world' level consequences for failure.

  That Empire might have a bit of a problem if the Dark Lord's plan to awaken the [Apocalypse Moon](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Atropus) succeeds, or if the Nightmare Player finishes his performance of the [King in Yellow](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?75718-Assatur-the-Nightmare-Messiah-Elder-Evil) in the capital of the Empire, or if [Ashardalon](http://www.andycollins.net/Campaigns/Bloodlines/40_ashardalon_finale.htm) succeeds at becoming the Font of All Souls and all future mortal children are born soulless and mindless.

    One might question how many adventurers get above level 6 then. You might only have a couple level 7 characters per empire, a couple level 10 characters per world. You might need to get quite far in the multiverse before high teens becomes common, and worlds where that happens could be very rare.

      Acccctually, as a necessary consequence of the [Settlement](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/settlements) rules in Pathfinder/3.5, any settlement with more than 25,000 people has at least one spellcaster capable of casting 8th level spells, meaning an at minimum 15th level character.

      Look at any Pathfinder book describing the world of Golarion, and you'll see many high level characters and monsters in each country and area.

      In D&D worlds, Authority Equals Asskicking is a law of reality. Most Emperors are going to be mid to high teens level, or else they would have been killed and replaced by someone who actually is.

        That rule means that the economy is rather broken.

        They can summon up limitless wealth, for example.

        It also makes the world rather weird looking, given how much high level magics can break the world. As such, many people make such magic users much rarer.

          Oh yes, the practical implications of the rules are staggering when brought to their logical conclusion.

          I have an Artisan character (Basically a super Magic!Tinker) who is in the process of skipping the Industrial revolution to generate an obscene amount of money (Downtime Capital) and convert it directly into power (most recently in the case of an enormous flying carrier which holds what is effectively a Gundam and AI drones the size of F-18's.)

  *tl;dr:*

  1. **Murder hobos want little in return for success.** They aren’t requesting that the Emperor properly arm, train, feed, and pay them.  They want acknowledgement, upgraded equipment, and lump-sum cash to take care of the job themselves.

  2. **Murder hobos are a dime a dozen.** What, did the party honestly believe they were the only self-proclaimed heroes to band together and fight back against the Orkish menace? They were the only survivors, the only ones to pick up swords and fight? Volunteers always appear when the world presents a lucrative murdering opportunity--and here was a murdering opportunity. So disposable. And so many people waiting in line to die!

  3. **The army is busy.** The Emperor has to think big. And, in thinking big, he’s thinking about his heartland, where he grows the food to feed the overly perfumed population of his core cities. The frontier brings him nothing.  His cities, everything. The Emperor isn’t going to burn his armies on something as tedious as the frontier when he has volunteers standing in line to defend it and die on the cheap. No, he’s going to unleash his dark armies on his neighboring nation-states and take them, instead. Orks, after all, don’t pay that much in taxes. Elves, well... Elves do.

  4. **Politics.** Who speaks in Court for the peaceful peasant villages of the frontier?  Maybe a lower level aristocrat owns those lands. Maybe no one owns those lands and the villages are a collective community of tiny oligarchies. Maybe they are voiceless and hope and pray that murder hobos will defend them from the rampaging Ork Hordes of the east. The Emperor must balance all the voices of the various factions who swirl around him at Court. If no one insists the overrun frontier is more important than, say, the Emperor’s plans to invade the Elves and take their lands, he sends no army.

  5. **Murder-hobo investment pays dividends.** For the sake of argument, the murder-hobo investment in some cash and equipment pays out. A princess gives them medals and proclaims them heroes. YAY! For a pitiful investment, the Empire gets to flip the frontier into a stable strip of Empire. They weren’t expecting to do so--but, hey, now it’s here!  Sure, it’s far from the Capital City and inconvenient to tax--but any tax is greater than zero tax. *Now* we send out the army to stabilize and build the edifices of government.

  *Consequences of murder-hobo failure:* The outcome depends on what the Orks want. If they simply want better land, the consequences are long-term obnoxious but not Empire-ending. The Orks overrun the eastern frontier, declare themselves their own tiny nation-state, and are eventually made a satellite of the Empire through trade and culture. But if the Orks want raw conquest, the Empire has a real problem on its hands...

    I love the open acknowledgement in this of RPG Heroes being murderhobos.
    ```

  - u/NotAHeroYet:
    ```
    I would add complete to murder hobo failure. All it takes is one murder hobo succeeding, after all- or failing lethally enough.
    ```

    Finally, we get decent WAAAAAAGH levels.

    If the Empire has a *real* problem, of course, it can send in its OP special forces.  To get some of those, you select the best heroes who come through and succeed against regular Orks, and then actually pay them a salary and train-and-equip them *properly*.  Sayeret Matkal's got nothing on that.

  300,000 seems ridiculous for medieval Europe which most fantasy is based on

    "Create Food" and "Cure Disease" do wonders for amplifying the size of one's population base.

      Agreed but it's unusual for a world to really take into account the economic implications of magic and monsters
      ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    Note that the state referenced in this article is explicitly called an *empire,* not just a typical medieval *kingdom* or *(grand) duchy.*

    Rome: [450,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Roman_army)

    Qin China: [Well over 500,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_dynasty#Southward_expansion)

      I think that reinforces my point more than defeats it, I've played and read many fantasy worlds and their use of Empire to liven up the name of their in universe nations is not unusual, but it tends not to actually make much of an impact on size. It's obviously not a huge deal but compare to this, and you're moving out of the Middle Ages and into Renaissance.

      Like I said, if it's not based on medieval Europe then it's fine, the number just surprised me is all, it's much more comparable as you say to the vast numbers China could bring to force.
