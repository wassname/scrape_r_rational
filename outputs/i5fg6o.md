## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I hate When Authors take the possibility of the MC losing out of the equation for a situation.

  I.e. "your team must win, or YOU AND EVERYONE DIES!"

  I immediately roll my eyes, since the author here went for cheap suspense, meaning he won't actually kill off the main character or else. . .story over. and any loss won't really be too substantial or .  . story over.  The author won't try to subvert it either as they'd have to get people used to other characters enough that there is no real main character(Game of Thrones before season 6) so that characters CAN die and DO die from making bad choices.  Subverting this would make readers stop reading.  It would be better to just "strongly imply" that the MC would die if he loses, but not outright say it, so that the reader actually has some suspense.  Too many times Authors tend to spoil their own story arcs (or even stories) when they don't need to.

  What percentage of the population do you think could get superpowers without society breaking down, particularly worm style powers where every power is useful for combat at least?  I feel like it has to be limited to a few thousand people for stuff to not change too much, and under 1% if we don't want a complete change to everything. I guess at near 100% it would become normal but society would have major upheaval before the world settled down.

    Depends entirely on the powers in question, and who gets them. A whole bunch of people having the equivalent of a firearm is probably not that big of a deal. A handful of people having the Death Note ... that might be enough to bring low human civilization.

    Generally speaking though, I think society could handle almost any number of "street level" powers, if not entirely cleanly. The biggest change would be that the monopoly on violence that the state enjoys would be challenged, but that's nothing that states haven't had to deal with in the past. People with powers would be inducted into the police and military, or licensed, or imprisoned, and the only way that would seriously upset the status quo is if sufficient power ended up in the hands of those who were opposed to the state in one way or another, or if it led to serious escalation of conflict between state and non-state actors. (Note: I am not talking specifically about the United States here, but rather, the relationship between the state, violence, and the citizenry.)

    Most people don't have a propensity for violence, and don't want to use violence, and are perfectly content to go their whole lives without throwing a punch except in a moment of passion. Those moments of passion would probably be more deadly if more people had street-level superpowers, but that's not catastrophic to society. Even among criminals, the vast majority of them don't particularly want to hurt anyone, they want to take stuff and then get away without being caught. Robbery (defined as the use of physical force or threat of force in the commission of a theft) *typically* doesn't have a desire for violence as a motivating factor, though it sometimes occurs as a matter of escalation, self-defense, etc. Most violent crimes are between two people who have a prior relationship (same goes for most sexual crimes). Given that, I think even with powers, you probably wouldn't see that much change?

    It gets more complicated if we're talking about powers that aren't street-level, especially if they're exotic, and have no known analog in modern society. Automatic truth detection, being able to pull memories, mind control, body control, future sight, past sight, teleportation, portals, all those kinds of things ... it's harder to say, and an analysis of how society might break down depends on how many of those types of powers exist, and what their distribution is.

    (One of the things that irks me about a lot of superpower stories is that people instantly change when they gain power, which is interesting, and generates conflict, but which I'm not confident is actually how the world (or the people in it) works. I think a lot of people, if they had the equivalent of a firearm with them all the time, simply wouldn't ever use it, or would otherwise be responsible and conscientious citizens. It's certainly more interesting to have a story about someone who gains the power of invisibility and then does a bunch of terrible things, but realistic in the average case? Citation needed.)

      > I think a lot of people, if they had the equivalent of a firearm with them all the time, simply wouldn't ever use it, or would otherwise be responsible and conscientious citizens.

      I think it depends on the strength of the powers. If you give someone a gun-tier energy blast, sure, they'll probably treat it basically like a gun. Maybe a little more costumed vigilantism, because that's what they've been acculturated to see as appropriate for people with energy blasts.

      But I think a lot of people fantasize about getting to right great injustices. To fight global warming, or famine, or genocide, or any number of other things. And I think if you gave people the kind of power that would let them do that, I think a lot of them would. And, yeah, probably not by just running down a list of political opponents and punching them to death, but probably with at least the *threat* of force.

      Imagine that you were a gay man in the 1980s, or a black man in the 1950s, or a political prisoner in a Soviet Gulag in the 1930s, and you suddenly gained the powers of Superman. Wouldn't you be at least a *little* tempted to fly over to your head of government, bounce some bullets off your chest, and demand that your grievances be addressed?

        >  But I think a lot of people fantasize about getting to right great injustices. 

        I think you are on to an interesting line of thought.  Locating crimes as a super powered vigilante would be hard because of the logistics of finding crime, but going after the people in power that perpetuate systemic injustices is straightforward and easy to target.

        >  Wouldn't you be at least a *little*  tempted to fly over to your head of government, bounce some bullets off  your chest, and demand that your grievances be addressed? 

        It wouldn't even take that much...

        To imagine an even more banal scenario, with even more law abiding and reasonable citizens, think of the current protests in the US, how the cops would overreact to a protestor with invulnerability sufficient to make them immune to rubber bullets and tear gas standing out in the middle of retreating crowd.  The cops react by escalating further... maybe empty a few clips into the invulnerable with many shots missing and striking the crowd.  Now imagine a person with a reflective shield power instinctively activates it, reflecting the bullets back at the cops that escalate further and fire more shots now that they are taking "return fire".  By the end of the day, the police would label every super powered person involved a super powered terrorist, and even a "reasonable" (given the Overton window of the US) president might concur, never mind our current president who would probably call for the deaths of the superpowereds involved.

        In other words, a reasonably peaceful group of protestors could get radicalized overnight just with the current way US law enforcement tends to escalate situations.  Of course, the US government doesn't always escalate... see for example the Bundy Standoff, but if the superpowers went to historically marginalized groups, and the government kept its current way of responding to them, vigilantes and supers opposed to the government would be an almost inevitable outcome.

    I wrote The Fifth Defiance, which is a web serial that posits that superhumans reduced the world to post apoc status in short order,  so obviously my thoughts are that the # is very very low.  

    Essentially every one which is stronger than the military, you roll a dice for their particular reaction to the Ring of Gygax test, let your particular assumptions re: human nature fill in the values on the table you are rolling on.

    Once you hit one of those bad values, that's pretty much it for your society, unless one of the other super powerful people rolled that they want to stop them.

      >Ring of Gygax test

      I've always thought about this, like, Wouldn't it be better for the strong people to have an in-tact society?  I would think most people powers Would use those to gt filthy rich, and enjoy Life in an in-tact society rather than just destroy it utterly.

      &#x200B;

      ...But then again we have epstein's island. . .and this is with people WITHOUT super powers, just a lot of money. . .   Maybe you're right.

        Sure, but it's a tragedy of the commons. You want everyone *else* to obey the law but you personally will break it if you can get away with it, because your individual actions have a negligible effect on society.

    It depends what you mean by "breaking down". Also it depends a lot on the specific powers people get.

    If you assume a basically Worm-ish setup where people who are generally unstable get powers that are mostly good for crime, but not massively powerful, I'd expect that society would generally continue, I'd just be worse. There'd be more murders, robberies, rapes, and other crimes, and the police would be less able to stop them, but not at the kind of rate that would collapse human civilization.

    That is, as long as powers don't give individual people the power to challenge world governments (e.g. the higher end of power levels for Superman). At that point, every single superhero is an existential threat to human civilization. It just takes one guy with the power of "supervolcano control" deciding that the universe is better off without humanity to cause a global extinction event. Even if there are other heroes who support the continued existence of civilization, the collateral damage from taking down rogues would be immense.

    But it also depends on the kind of power, not just the strength. Worm-style Tinkers wouldn't collapse civilization in the same way that serial killer Superman would, but they could probably cause something like the Singularity, which probably counts as "society breaking down". Someone with mental powers that aren't all that impressive on their own could also destroy society by mind-controlling people with access to nukes.

  So Im reading Children of Dune and Im a bit confused about what is going on.

  My understanding is that because Alia has access to all past lives of her genetic history that a personality from the past has taken control and become the one in charge, so to speak. This is because she used it ever since birth and had no core of self to protect her mind. That comes from an overdependence on the spice to gain prophetic visions and is why they call her an Abomination.

  She is trying to get the twins to use the spice in the hopes of them being overwhelmed by a past personality, possibly the one controlling her now, in some kind of prophetic singularity? 

  Am I right or did I miss it completely? Im only 30 or so pages in and I dont want to go any farther if Im misinterpreting the entire premise of the book.

  I think I found a youtube video explaining a concept that is very present in rational fiction: What the youtuber calls "hard worldbuilding":  
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcyrrTud3x4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcyrrTud3x4)  


  I think this implicitly also serves as a critique of rational fiction: Sometimes softer worldbuilding can serve to make the story richer and more meaningful.

  So I was watching [The Critical Drinker Fixes... Rey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5BL6d7MOMY) earlier this week.  (warning: he lays on the Scottish accent quite heavily, it is annoying to some people).

  In the video, he's talking about the "what" and the "why" of how to make an interesting character that can realistically see some growth through the events of the story.

  And for whatever reason, I was thinking of a quick litmus test for aspiring writers to judge whether or not one of their main characters is a Mary Sue or not.  The test is: Would you date this person or not if you met them at the start of their journey?  If the answer is an unhesitating "yes", then you might have a problem.

  With Rey, what's keeping her out the dating scene, other than that she's poor?  OK, sure, living on a desert planet, with no apparent access to a shower means she likely smells worse than a bantha's hindquarters... that might not be too bad if you always stay upwind of Rey while outside, but inside a spaceship... ugh.  Anyway, aside from that, there's not much to turn a prospective date off.

  Compare that to Luke or Han at the start of Ep4.  Han's kind of roguishly charming sure, but also... not a thug per se, but not someone you'd be glad to bring home to meet the folks either.  Luke is kind of a dork or an eager puppy, which he grows *way* out of by the end of Ep6.

    Family issues *should be* a big one, but it doesn't get enough focus/realism in the trilogy (despite it ostensibly being one of the major throughlines). Abandonment issues, fear of commitment, etc. *should* all have been defining character traits/flaws. But it's not even that the execution didn't work, it's that they didn't even really try.

      Yes. All of those issues, and more could have been worked in.

      Things like long term food insecurity leave a mark on your soul. We should have seen something.

  - u/tjhance:

    this seems like a really bizarre criterion and almost opposite of the one I would use. Mary Sue doesn't mean "likable". Most Mary Sue characters are, frankly, annoying, the sorts of people I wouldn't want to date. And conversely, there are plenty of well-written, immediately-likable, non-Mary-Sue characters where I'd probably go "sure, I'd date them" at the beginning.

    I think date is the wrong word, be best friends makes more sense.
