  [Obviously a spoiler](#s " Luminosity is actually two separate novel-length works. In the first one, Bella gets turned into a vampire under controlled circumstances, using painkillers to keep her unconscious for as long as possible, although they wear off before the end of the transformation. She and Edward used preserved eggs that Bella had harvested, and with the help of a human surrogate who formerly worked for the Volturi, they have 'Renesmee,' who in this version is named Elspeth, and who has the ability to be completely believed, as long as she's saying something which she believes to be completely true. Bella visits the Quileute tribe's adult female members and activates their werewolf transformation deliberately, as a way to empower them to protect themselves from the Volturi, who Bella accurately anticipates are going to make a move to disband the Cullens for amassing too much power and too large a population of vampire in one location. Bella's mind-read-proofness turns out to be a uniform shielding ability that makes her immune to a lot of things, including death pretty much, being able to rapidly reconstitute her body after it has been categorically reduced to particulate matter. The Volturi attack, using mind control to force the werewolves to work for them. A large part of the narrative is spent with most of the main cast believing everybody else in the main cast are dead, while Elspeth is temporarily being raised by Rosalie, Emmett, Carlisle, and Esme, who believe Bella and Edward to be dead, and Jasper and Alice to be disappeared or captives to the Volturi. Bella *isn't* dead, and she kidnaps Elspeth back from the Cullens, going on the run with her. There's a lot of recapturing and escaping and recapturing and brainwashing and memory stealing and memory-giving-from-what-was-stolen. The overall story ends with all of the Volturi dead except Marcus and Alec and Adelaide, Marcus' wife Didyme 'resurrected' through the use of memory transferral, and Bella categorically the uncontested ruler of the entire supernatural world - and, implicitly, the human world since she has future-readers and the like at her disposal. This actually manages to happen in a way that makes her authority believable and not completely odious. At the end of the story, the only 'good guys' who are 100% dead - and not memory-resurrected like Didyme was - are a few werewolf original minor characters who died before the memory-resurrection ability was discovered. Alec willingly uses his powers to 'numb' people through voluntary vampire transformations, so that it isn't painful at all for them. A bureaucratic system for allowing people to voluntarily become vampires is introduced in stages, and Carlisle is doing R&D on blood substitutes so that a vampire population won't destroy the human population just by being hungry and dangerous. There is never, ever, at any point in the story, a love triangle featuring Jacob and Bella. I'm forgetting a lot of things that were original to the fic and really quite novel and clever, but I've covered the actual plot, and those clever things were more... mechanisms that advanced the plot.")

  I think that about covers it, and yes, this is the VERY CONDENSED version, even if it ran a little long. Luminosity and its second half are an incontestably huge body of writing.

    That sounds... absolutely atrocious.

    I wish I could give you more than one upvote in thanks for the time you've saved me not reading it.

      Did you enjoy canon Twilight?

      Luminosity was basically an AU of the whole Twilight series all in one, with Radiance being an entirely new story (a necessary one, since the end of Luminosity is a big cliffhanger). I liked them for different reasons. Luminosity has an interesting alternative take on Bella and Edward forming a relationship, and Radiance has the whole transhumanist angle going on. Actually, perhaps the biggest issue with Radiance was that the climax failed to follow the Unspoken Plan Guarantee; we see characters plan things out, and then things largely go according to plan. I still found it worth my time.

  Now let's try for a 5 minute version of Effulgence!

    Bella acquires a Joker.

    Bella uses Joker to become all-powerful.

    Bella encounters plot.

    Plot is derailed or obviated by Milliways.

    Repeat 9000 times with fun variations?

    (It's actually not that samey, I'm just being flippant because it so huge that anything would look samey at the necessary distance to see the whole, but it does have a LOT of anti-climactic resolutions with plots that die out or get fixed before they go much of anywhere. The good parts, and there ARE a lot of really good parts, like The Assault on the Alethian Afterlife, for example, are kind of buried.)

  I haven't read it in several years&mdash;but, IIRC&hellip;

  &mdash;Bella gets injected with vampire venom, becomes a vampire in record time, gets the mystical vampire bond of love with Edward, and has a daughter by him.  
  &mdash;For some reason (to gain allies against the Volturi, who eventually will discover the breach of secrecy and attack?), Bella decides to investigate the possibility of an alliance with werewolves, specifically female werewolves among the members of a particular USAian indigenous tribe. (Heretofore, all known werewolves have been male, but Bella hypothesizes that, because only males with the werewolf gene ever were exposed to vampires (in battle), the females just never had the gene triggered, despite carrying it.) She has lunch with an old female friend who is a member of the tribe in question. Her new vampiric status triggers the friend's werewolf gene after extended close contact.  
  &mdash;The friend blabs to her mother, who entices Bella to make *her* a werewolf as well. However, the mother is pregnant, and she nearly dies when her fetus transforms within her.  
  &mdash;The Volturi find out about Bella's dealings with the werewolves and send a task force to eliminate everyone involved. Bella is the sole survivor (by some fluke like hiding under the ashes of her comrades), while all the Cullens are burned and all the tribe members (werewolves and not) are killed. Due to being a super-cool rationalist, Bella avoids suffering the standard fate of a vampire who loses her mystical mate (catatonia); instead, she forces herself to continue living for the sake of her daughter.

  I personally found *Radiance* significantly more interesting than *Luminosity*.

    A few things that are off:
    - The fetus transforming is not a thing. One of the new werewolves hurts her father in a fit of rage, forcing Bella to turn the father to save his life. Said father soul-bonds to his wife, and impregnates her while she is still human. The mother nearly dies due to giving birth to a half-vampire.
    - Bella doesn't survive due to a fluke; her mind-shield protects her to the point of reconstituting her body (it protects her mind, and her mind can't quite survive without a body, can it?)
    - The Cullens don't die. They break ties with Bella in order to be safe from the Volturi. Edward obviously can't (soul-bond), and gets killed (or at least, that's what Bella thinks).
    - The werewolves and their imprints don't get killed either. They just get mind-raped into serving the Volturi (except a few who manage to escape). The non-werewolves do get killed though.
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  Basically, Bella is much more self-aware and thoughtful, and achieves through deliberate planning pretty much everything that canon Bella achieved more or less through luck, [until](#s " the Volturi suddenly invade, break everything up, burn or scatter her family and mind-control the werewolves.") Then [Radiance](#s " reveals that the 'killed' vampires were actually imprisoned in order to borrow their powers, and Bella organises a coalition to bring the Volturi down and establish a new world order, with vegetarianism and hybrids.")
