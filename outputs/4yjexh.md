## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Just completed a writing project that I started eight months ago. It's terribly written, full of blunders and mistakes, lot of grammar mistakes too. But damn it, I DONE IT! I completed a thing. 

  Now, I am going to be working on finishing yet another project, a rational stargate fic. 

  There's an original fic that I wanted to do, but it's very research-heavy. I need to find an original fic that's not such research heavy or find a better solution to worldbuilding. It's very hard to write when you have no reference materials to fall back on.

    Congratulations. Finishing things is hard and you deserve your pat on the back, I'd say.

    If you don't mind me asking, what was the nature of the project you finished? (An original story? A Fan Fic? Non-fiction? ect.)

  There was an MCU fanfic called Move Fast and Break Things posted on this subreddit yesterday that most people seemed to like. Am I the only one who didn't like it? I didn't think it was terrible, just not good enough to keep me reading past the first three chapters.

  Instead of reimagining an established story like HPMOR did, it seemed to be retreading old ground with only superficial differences. Toni Stark is nearly identical to her canon counterpart, and the situation she's in is only slightly different and makes just as much sense.

  The biggest problem I have, however, is that it's missing what I loved about the movie it's based on. You can't just write dialogue that sounds like RDJ and expect it to have the same impact without his acting. Writing in prose is different than in movies, or even comics.

  There's also no Iron Man in it. Toni doesn't even save herself from the terrorists, she escapes almost by accident without overcoming any obstacle. When I sit down to read a story about a superhero character, I want to see them do heroic things. Where was Iron Man?

  I don't understand why people like this fanfic. I don't hate it, I just find it boring. It lacks what I liked about its source material and it didn't have anything I wanted that the original story didn't. Maybe it gets better after Toni gives press conferences, but I didn't care enough to keep reading after that.

        I read the whole fic with the belief that the romantic love interest was Bucky [The Winter Soldier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky) who chose the name Roger because he had good associations with the name Rogers for obvious reasons. I think that one of us must have drastically misread it... but I don't think I'm going to go back for a reread just to check this detail.

        Anyways, I am totally fine with gender benders even if they don't have a point. I mean, fanfiction changing any other particular details of setting, character, or plot for any reason of aesthetic or authorial choice is totally fine by me, so it would be sort of weird of me to demand specifically that characters genders remain inviolate while allowing other things to change for any or no reason.

  Let's talk about the horror genre. 'Supernatural' horror genre, to be specific.

  **I.** You see, I quite like it: it's one of my favorite genres. Characters encountering unknown, usually dangerous and hostile but almost always *strange* forces, trying to understand them and deal with them. 

  And, as could be expected from a member of this subreddit, I like rational and sane characters, original plot twists, and when priorities are assigned correctly.

  Probably not too hard to guess that I rarely get everything I want. Almost never, in fact.

  Characters in horror stories are almost always ridiculously stupid and genre-blind, fishes-in-a-barrel. Horror stories are full of cliché character roles and cliché twists and cliché antagonists and cliché everything. Instead of focusing on *encountering supernatural,* they care about something inconsequential like an old grudge or some blightul love triangle. Nobody ever does anything interesting, and if they do, I almost certainly am reading/listening to/watching a parody.

  On the other hand, I saw but a few genuine horror stories in the rationalist community. Usually it's something about the horror of wireheading or uFAI, which is scary, but not exactly what I seek. Why, I wonder? The aforementioned premise is a great way to show characters' rationality, genre-savvines, ability to update their beliefs and explore the unknown. This genre is *full* of low-hanging fruits.

  Really, just imagine that: the main characters notice that something weird is going on in their home. Instead of ignoring it or rationalizing it away until it's too late, they investigate. A monster, they quickly discover, bewildered. They contemplate running for their lives for exactly two seconds. Instead, they carefully study it, making heavy use of modern technology, like quadcopters with video cameras, then capture it and sell it to the scientists, acquiring eternal fame and wealth. Scietists subsequently discover 'supernatural', turn it into a branch of engineering, find a missing piece in their model of the universe, and lead the world into post-scarcity utopia.

  Did anyone ever perceived a story that went at least remotely like that? No, I expect. *sigh* I suppose I will have no choice but to write it myself, will I?

  **II.** That part probably belongs in a Monthly Recommendation Thread, but the rant above doesn't, and I wanted to post it all at once.

  I do know a few instances of rational-ish works in this genre:

  **[SCP Foundation](http://www.scp-wiki.net/)**; **[Lovecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft)**'s works; **Wildbow's** **[Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/)**, partially; **EagleJarl's** works: **[Pay Attention](https://www.amazon.com/Pay-Attention-novella-psychological-horror-ebook/dp/B00V4ZIEMQ/ref=la_B00WCPXLMA_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1471618396&sr=1-2#nav-subnav)**, **[Baby Blues](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Blues-David-K-Storrs-ebook/dp/B00V52XRIE#nav-subnav)** and **[Supernaturally Rational](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11530632/1/Supernaturally-Rational)**. I suppose most people here already know about them; included for the sake of completedness.

  **[The Cabin in the Woods](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/)**, a movie. To be brief, Worm : Superhero stories :: The Cabin in the Woods : Horror movies.

  **[Oculus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388715/)**, a movie. It promised to be *perfect*. Kaylie's plan, outlined in the first half of the movie, was exactly the sort of thing I expect a rational character to do; I cannot express how pleasantly I was surprised. Unfortunately but inevitably, it didn't last: she [spoiler](#s " picked up an Idiot Ball") towards the end (almost literally (it was ~~an apple~~ ~~a lighbulb~~ an apple)), and [spoiler](#s " got herself killed.") The first half is very good, though.

  **[Another](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another)**, an anime/light novel. Has a very good atmosphere, genre-savvy and not idiotic main characters, and an interesting and complex yet consistently-behaving opposing force. Has its flaws, which can be summarized as 'the last two episodes of the anime'. I intend to write a rational fanfic of it, someday.

  I invite everyone to recommend their favorite works in horror genre, preferably with rational undertones. Everything's fine: books, movies, anime, podcasts, games, etc.

    The horror is in mysteries that *don't* fold like wet tissue paper to inquiry, and/or in victims who *don't* have the resources to overpower the threat. "Rationalist goes to town on baddie" belongs in the climax if at all, and needs to be written carefully to not ruin the atmosphere.

    &nbsp;

    Recommendation: **It Follows**. The characters aren't geniuses and don't make perfect decisions (sleep deprivation is a factor), but they're all [level 1 intelligent](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent) and actively prioritize *solving the fucking problem* over petty drama and everyday concerns. And the monster mostly behaves like a problem to be solved rather than a plot device with on-demand powers (though [spoiler](#s "the climax is a mess")).

        Ah yes, good ol' infohazard-horror. 

        Don't think too carefully about why this is dangerous, or it'll get you. If you're having nightmares, it's probably too late.
        ```

        - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
          ```
          Infohazards are good, but it doesn't even need to be an infohazard.  Could be as simple as "appears to be reverse-engineerable, but is actually setting you up to spread its eggs everywhere".
          ```

      > The horror is in mysteries that don't fold like wet tissue paper to inquiry, and/or in victims who don't have the resources to overpower the threat

      Of course; I didn't mean to imply that winning in every rational horror story would or should be *easy* for the main characters. However, it would be far more interesting and horrifying if the threats were dangerous or incomprehensible enough to hold its own against the full extent of humanity's technology and creativity, instead of relying on the protagonist not having access to a handgun and being stupid.

      Thank you for the recommendation.

        Horror is one of the genres hit hardest by the propagation of cell phones, I think, because it now takes more contrivance to get main characters out of contact with the rest of the world.
        ```

        - u/Noumero:
          ```
          Aforementioned Oculus has an interesting, even if overkilling, solution to this problem: [Spoiler](#s " The phones work just fine, but you can't trust the words you hear from them, you can't be sure you called the number you wanted to call, and then you can't be sure you've made the call at all. Alternatively, the phones in fact work, but you see 'no signal' on the display.")
          ```

          - u/Roxolan:
            ```
            Hmm. Very easy for a story like that to stop being rational (not that Oculus ever tried). You can't have a Fair Play Whoddunit with zero trust in your senses.
            ```

            - u/CreationBlues:
              ```
              Actually, you can, you just need to have somewhere you can be certain you can trust your senses, and be willing to replace your senses with technology. Also be really good at following and formulating plans. 

              Think of it like the Mars rover: we can't communicate with it in real time, so we have to send it instructions for what to do. In this case, you would be acting as both the rover and control, and instead of a light delay it would be a delay of how long it took to shuttle yourself in and out of the zone of distrust, combined with how much time it takes to review the data.

              You can also use things like autodialers and other automatic systems to circumvent self distrust, but this is just an extension of the rover analogy.

    I really, really loved the horror-ish parts of Dan Simmon's Hyperion - I'm thinking particularly of The Priest's Tale: The Man Who Cried God, and a few different parts of the end of The Poet's Tale. The Priest's Tale was strange and disturbing and horrific in a number of ways that really worked and resonated with me. Strangely enough, Simmon's completely straight up horror works like Carrion Comfort and Song of Kali never really worked for me at all in the same way.

    I really liked the novel House of Leaves by Danielewski. It's got a wonderful creepyness and the structure of the book is just really unique and interesting; everyone should buy and read this book. I just love how the author structures things as stories within stories and how the book is crafted. 

    I really love parts of Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem (Gamecube) for it's 4th wall breaking horror stuff. It's also got a really nice Lovecraftian aesthetic and structure, and the voice acting is actually astoundingly good quality. The actual gameplay itself isn't all that great, but the other parts of the game have so much going for them I beat it the full three times to get the complete ending. 

    Song of Saya (Saya no Uta) is a light novel that takes it's inspiration fairly directly from Lovecraft, and was written by the Urobutcher. If you can survive the fairly graphic and disturbing sex scenes, it's got some excellent horror content with a particularly neat aesthetic. It's super disturbing in many ways.

    [The Northern Caves](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522) is actually pretty neat horror-ish stuff with a non-neurotypical slant, but the most directly rational horror on AO3 is [Cordyceps](http://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868), which bills itself as irrationalfic.

    I wouldn't have called The Cabin in the Woods horror - for me, the movie (while wonderful) never really evoked any sense of dread or terror because of the framing narrative. For me, I felt the movie to be more of a comedy deconstruction of horror in the same sort of vein of things like [Illbleed](http://lparchive.org/Illbleed/)

    There's been lots of shitty horror recently because it's really cheap to make. But there have been some excellent horror movies recently, Green Room and It Follows come to mind. Each has characters making dumb but believable choices (they're teenagers after all) and getting smarter through the movie.

    Not exactly horror, but the director of Green Room also did Blue Ruin which is a fantastic story.

    Counterpoint/reconstruction: Warhammer 40K and the Warp.  Everyone in the setting is *horrendously* irrational, because the Warp actively harms people who attempt to study or interact with it, while ignorance and superstition, while no real defense, are at least ways to *not attract its attention*.  The only factions *capable* of behaving rationally without getting skullfucked by daemons are those who literally don't have souls enough to damn.

    In a related matter, I'd really love to know what happens when fucking David Chalmers discovers the Warp and how he reacts to the Hard Problem being resolved by irrefutably true nonsense.

    Off and on I'm working on a novella about some horror authors attending a small writer's retreat at an expy of the Stanley Hotel, and they cotton on to what's happening pretty quickly. There won't be much scientific investigation, because (1) they're authors, not scientists, and (2) bad things are trying to kill them, but they do their best to avoid being bad horror protagonists. 

    (a problem is that one of the antagonists is *also* a horror author >:P )

  I just read someone mentioning the Dunning-Kruger offhandedly (in Twig's comments), and decided to checkout out the Wikipedia article on the subject. It's the phenomenon where people with low knowledge of a subject tend to overestimate their knowledge of it, and people with high knowledge tend to underestimate it.

  Now, I'd read/heard about it before, mostly interpreted as "you should be careful teaching things to people or you could make them overconfident" or "this guy thinks he knows a lot about X, that means he doesn't know much", and it feels like a meme that would easily spread by allowing people to be smug about people who disagree with them (not only does he not know the first thing about X, he thinks he knows a lot about X! what an idiot) regardless of its veracity. So I searched for articles criticizing the effect.

  Well, it turns out the Dunning-Kruger effect isn't real. The experiment failed to replicate several times, and it has basically no credibility in the psychology community. So I guess everyone who quoted this "science fact" is a gullible idiot, and if you feel like telling them that, well, please don't because this whole paragraph is a lie (also don't repeat what I say without looking things up yourself, dammit). Starting over.

  As far as my ten minutes research can tell, there is an effect that does replicate (though only for occidentals? I'm not sure), but the "stupid people think they're smart" meme is basically unfounded. low-skill people tend to overestimate their skill and vice-versa, but perceived skill still augments with actual skill. What happens is people who get a 10 think they have a 40, people who have a 50 think they have a 60, and people who have a 90 think they have a 80. [(see this graph for a more visual explanation)](http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dunning_kruger.png).

  The actual explanation is contested. Dunning and Kruger think that, as people get more skilled, they get more tools to notice their flaws and loose some of their overconfidence in the process. On the other hand, most of the effect might be explained by regression to the mean (most people are terrible at judging their skill, most people think they have a constant high level X, and as they get more skilled their level gets closer to perceived level X, without any learning one's flaws involved).

  So, what did I learn today? A. Small Wikipedia articles about psychology can be wrong, or, at least, not as informative as googling "is [X] true?". This really bothers me. B. Quoting psychology experiments to prove a point is a horrible idea and you shouldn't do it even if the experiment agrees with you especially if the experiment agrees with you, especially especially if you haven't at least read the entire Wikipedia article about it. That also goes for the Milgram experiment, the Stanford Prison experiment, that one peer pressure experiment with the short lines and the long lines, or the Rosenhan experiment.

  What should we do with information that isn't helpful for people to know. For example it is a fact that intelligence is strongly tied to genetics for any reasonable definition of either of those words. Knowing this doesn't help though. In fact, believing this has been shown to correlate with low achievement especially in children. Should we then avoid mentioning this. Should we pretend it's not true? 

  I'd say probably for one we should have more study. Is it actually the belief that is causal or is it reverse causation. If it's the latter than there is no harm in spreading the info wide and far, but if it's the former we at least need to be careful about publicizing it.

  Also totally unrelated, but I just got told that I'm on to start the first phase of technical interviews with Google. Strangely I feel better about that than I do about more standard interviewing so we'll see.

    It helps if you're in a position to influence policy. Children genetically doomed to low IQ need a very different kind of help than children who happen to be stuck in a damaging environment/education system.

        The only way we could resolve that argument with facts is by using that research data.
