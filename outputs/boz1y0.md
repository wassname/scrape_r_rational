## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

    Closest thing I can think of would be Epilogue on RoyalRoad, but that's pretty far off. It focuses on the characters themselves after a generic isekai, and how they deal (or don't deal) with the stress of readjusting to a suburban life.

  A Dresden Files RPG, but the city it's set in is a near-future anarchocapitalist charter city with a Pateron-funded military and heroin vending machines in all the for-profit charter schools.

  The wizards use the overflowing pharmacopeia to bring about the states of mind they need to best use their magic (e.g. ketamine to use ritual magic). They've figured out ways to allow spirits of intellect to inhabit electronics, making them slow-takeoff AGI. 

  A considerable plurality of the White Council are trying to rebrand themselves as superheroes. Their leader is the caped alter-ego of the investor who started the charter city.

    The To Aru Majutsu No Index setting might not be that far off from what you have in mind. [In Memoriam](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442823/1/In-Memoriam) is a more rational rewrite of the first arc or so, and you might find details to lift from the original such as headsets that allow for dreams to be saved and shared, or the space elevator having magical significance much like a wizard's tower.

    I'm not sure how Dresden Files magic would get along with the kind of surveillance state I'm assuming the charter city looks like, but maybe enough people carry around jammers that the mages don't stand out, or the interference mechanism only affects obsolete electronic systems that have since been replaced with optical circuits.

    I like the idea of drug-enhanced magic, it's a shame the magical interference would stop them using transcranial magnetic stimulation headsets or brain implants.

    With regards to rebranding as superheroes, that seems like it would lead to all sorts of fun conflict. Will the PMCs be out for blood when their Patreon subscribers leave them for the more charismatic capes? Will the other supernatural groups join in with this twist on the masquerade? What are the advantages of presenting oneself as a superhero rather than just being openly magical?

    EDIT: Also, the Shadowrun setting might be close enough to give you ideas. The main difference is that magic is publicly known, but after 5 editions there's a lot of material about daily life in an ancap cyberpunk dystopia.

      I really dig the space elevator=wizard's tower idea, thanks!

      I'm not sure why you assume that there'll be a surveillance state. By assumption, there isn't since there isn't any *state,* surveillance or otherwise. Sure, there'll be insurance companies who offer lower rates in exchange for allowing monitoring, but nothing like what *I* usually associate to the phrase "surveillance state". But, since the landholder of the charter city is a White Councilmember's alter ego... lets just say that the developers who were willing to play ball with their construction so their buildings complemented magical flows got fast tracked while the developers who were less tolerant of her "eccentricities" got bogged down in bureaucracy.

      Yeah, I anticipate a lot of fun wizard vs superhero vs mortal dramabombs (one of the players is being an Objectivist True Believer. If the joke doesn't wear thin, it should be fun). There's no particular *advantage* to being a superhero versus being a wizard, it's more of a color politics thing. Both sides *claim* amazing and obvious benefits, but it basically comes down to a difference of aesthetic.

      The backstory is the leader of the capes learned quite a bit of magic on her own, but didn't think it was magic, she thought it was superpowers (this is an old character of mine whose high concept was "budding supervillain" \[it was a hard time in her life, but {spoilers for Worm} >!she didn't do any worse then the pre-Levithan Undersiders!<. She came to the Council's attention when she robbed a "bank" which was actually a front for the Venatori. She didn't break any Laws of Magic, though she did break a few laws of the US Government\] until she joined the Council and did a >!Skitter->Weaver-esque!<heel-face turn). By the time she encountered the White Council, she'd already made a bunch of distinctly superheroish magical items (an enchanted mask, a warded bodysuit with a logo, etc) and by that time she just kinda kept up the shtick for fun. Fast-forward a few years and she's prominent in a more progressive clique of the Council and adopting superhero garb became a way of showing party loyalty. (Also, I imagined the White Council chambers with half of the Wizards in black robes and the other half looking like a comic book panel and I found that image too charming to not crowbar in somehow.)

    I've actually been thinking about a similar setting that takes place in modern times but with the recent emergence of magic leading to people playing hero/villain. Patreon or something similar seems like it would be a plausible explanation for how heroism could become lucrative (so it doesn't just appeal to a very small subset of magic users) without getting the government involved.  I think a lot of youtube culture would create some interesting dynamics in such a world, where things like collaborations, faked rivalries, scheduled fights (or the horrific dis-tracts that have become common on youtube), and reaction/response/apology videos are used to help boost subscriptions. Apology videos might become commonplace whenever a hero crosses a line or says something that isn't particularly PC. I think it would be interesting to see how some heroes deal with the uniquely vitriolic nature of internet comments too, being told to kill yourself hundreds or thousands of times a day might be more mentally strenuous than the sort of criticism a newspaper/magazine might publish. Youtubers also wield a fair amount of power in the form of their viewers, singling someone or something out in a public video can easily lead to an outraged mob of twitter trolls calling for boycotts, harassment, and, often times, the hacking and release of personal information. User's of this system would probably have to jump through some serious hoops to avoid being doxxed and the creator of the Patreon/Youtube website would probably be targeted by the government almost immediately. Agencies that manage heroes/villains would similarly be targeted.

    &#x200B;

    On the emergent AGI topic, I wonder if the fact that they are created using magic might make them more or less manageable (magical off switch?). I'm not familiar with spirits of intellect, but depending on how they work it could imply what sort of utility functions the AGI will have. Love the drug enhanced magic idea, btw.

  I'm running a side plot in a Dungeons and Dragons story where a dragon has begun introducing the gold standard to replace carrying actual gold weights around. The dragon has secretly started creating money without the gold to back it up but is so far keeping inflation low.   


  In my campaign, the rules as written are the laws that govern the universe rather than an abstraction. So when a resurrection spell says it costs X gold pieces worth of diamonds to cast, that means that whatever quantity of diamonds can currently be purchased with that amount of currency is the quantity required to cast the spell. If the dragon causes steady economic growth while still offering the gold exchange then the value of gold pieces will drop and thus cause spells that are pegged to the gold coin to drop in cost and dramatically alter the value of a life.   


  In a context where the raw materials to bring somebody back from the dead drops below the cost of feeding somebody for a month, what are some cultural changes that are rationally likely to happen in a mostly agricultural level society?
  ```

    For most people the real costly component of revival is going to be the work of the cleric, bard or druid casting the spell. So depending on the level of magic availability it seems i impossible for this to happen.
    You might Also want to look at glyph of warding or simulacrum. As the possible uses of these change with the availability. 
    AN example could be local centers with spells Mass produced into glyphs. As soon as the materials for glyph is less than the cost of the time saved by centrelisation. 
    Good spells for such shoos might be
    Sending
    Clairvoyance 
    Fly
    Read thoughts
    Toungous

    - u/Gurkenglas:

      Glyph of Warding can only store harmful spells. Try, like, any other magic item, those are also pegged to the gold coin. Simulacrum does mass-produce 10th-level slaves if you have the cooperation of a 13th-level wizard and knowledge of a 20th-level template. By default, these cost 5000 a pop, plus 910 for the spellcasting service. The 12-hours casting time might increase the latter number. They cannot learn or grow, so I would guess a wizard can only ever prepare spells that the original ever prepared (if you have a spellbook for him), and perhaps they have the memory of an HPMOR portrait, barring the creator's commands?

    High-level clerics become extremely wealthy and powerful. Whether they're getting paid in a fee-for-service approach, or a weekly 'tithe' that might consist of money, goods, services and 'favors', they're rapidly going to become a dominating force in society. One way or another, most people will make sure that they are in the good graces of a cleric who can revive them.

    This is exacerbated by how cheap human life becomes. Crusades may quickly become rampant, as the cost of war falls close to zero, and everyone becomes eager to prove their loyalty and faithfulness to their clerics. Theocracy quickly becomes commonplace, as the keys to social, financial, and military power all end up consolidated in the hands of a handful of high-level clerics. It becomes a self-perpetuating cycle - as war becomes more common, it becomes more important than ever to prove your loyalty to a cleric who would revive you if needed, furthering the power of an ever-growing multitude of theocracies.

    As the Great Crusades burn across the land, strategy quickly turns towards locating and seizing the enemy clerics, possibly converting them to your side by blackmail, bribery, or coercion. The warfare is particularly brutal, as mere sieges against holy cities can be held off nearly indefinitely by consumption of the flesh of those who die of starvation, followed by resurrection, in a perpetual cycle. Instead of trying in futility to wait out the defenders, attacking armies sacrifice lives carelessly in the pursuit of quick victory, scaling walls with ladders and engaging in bloody and direct assaults with overwhelming numbers.

    As the crusaders close in upon the great temples that now form the seats of political power in most societies, they might feign a retreat or call to negotiate, or turn to plundering houses and burning homes. A simple ruse. You see, anyone slain in battle can be revived anywhere else in the world with a true resurrection spell. You can't truly kill a cleric. They would simply emerge again somewhere else. While the ruse is ongoing, the smoke still thick in the air and the sounds of battle and screaming maintain a cacophony of noise, special forces teams consisting of wizards, rogues, and high-level fighters move in invisibly and capture the clerics by surprise. They cannot be allowed to kill themselves. With the clerics secured, a horn is sounded and the rest of the city is wiped clean of defenders.

    Captured clerics now have a difficult choice. Be held alive against their will indefinitely until old age takes them, or recant their heretical beliefs and pledge their loyalty to the gods of the invaders. Most are strong-willed, but some convert. Gradually the most powerful religions grow stronger and stronger as the weaker religions are purged from the world. In time, one dominating religion conquers the world. Peace ensues. One world, one religion, one True God.

    Tell your dragon to stop before it's too late.

    Not a direct answer to your question, but I think you'll like this blog post ([https://critical-hits.com/blog/2014/09/27/fiat-magic-reagents-the-god-of-the-market-and-modrons/](https://critical-hits.com/blog/2014/09/27/fiat-magic-reagents-the-god-of-the-market-and-modrons/)) and probably the rest of Dungeonomics as well.

  What are some good resources for writing a semi-realistic fantasy setting that is based on medieval Europe? I specifically want to avoid a lot of stuff that fantasy settings tend to get wrong, especially about geographic stuff (how many settlements are there of what size, how common are castles & how large are they usually, how expensive are goods in relation to each other, etc.)

  I can't seem to find anything directly answering my questions - a link to a site or the name of a good non-fiction book would be very appreciated. 'Medieval Europe' is a very large topic, both in terms of time and space, but details of any sub-area (such as Italy in the 1200s) would be an excellent starting point.
  ```

  - u/TheTrickFantasic:
    ```
    The Shadiversity channel on YouTube has several videos that address misconceptions about Medieval Europe.  I can't promise that Shad answers all your questions, but I have observed that he has several videos covering castles (including, but not limited to, the effectiveness of castles against magic and dragons).

    As an aside, my favorite work of his is the Fantasy Re-armed series, where he postulates on the best medieval weapons for use by/against various fantasy races/creatures.
    ```

    Seconding Shadiversity. Aside from that, I've found [Medieval Demographics Made Easy](https://gamingballistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Medieval-Demographics-Made-Easy-1.pdf) [PDF] to be a good resource, though I've got no clue how accurate it actually is.
    ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    I often find it really helpful to search in /r/AskHistorians for relevant keywords in cases like this (though I'm writing about the WW2 era), as you'll often find really detailed answers AND lots of information about sources. Asking questions on there is also helpful, but the more general they are the more likely they are to be answered (i.e. ask "What are the marriage and courtship customs in 1200s Western Europe" rather than "I'm a young Italian man in the 1200s. How do I find a wife?" and waaaay rather than "How would a 30 year old Sicilian farmer who is a widower in 1250 woo the daughter of a blacksmith?")
