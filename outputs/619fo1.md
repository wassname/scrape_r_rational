## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I think it's generally accepted that the education system in the United States is pretty suboptimal. (This may also be true of education in general/elsewhere, but I don't have experience with those).

  I'm curious if people here have looked into marginal improvements to the system? I'd be really interested in hearing what other people have thought of.

  (These are all directed at high schools mainly.)

  Things I'd like to find ways to improve in particular:

  * Molochean cycle in students->college->jobs that leads students to compete hard w/ one another, leaving actual learning behind.

  * Goodhart's Law-esque problems with tests (as a subset of the above) where things like the SAT are essentially gameable.

  * Lack of well-defined pathways for very smart students.

  * Critiques of the traditional classroom paradigm

  * Lack of widespread use of well-backed pedagogical techniques, like retrieval practice
  ```

    I've always felt that the most low-hanging fruit is separating the goals of education into different roles. Right now, everything is teacher and student. The teacher, in particular, is playing too many roles. They're the judge - they grade the student and determine whether they've passed or failed. They're the educator - they want the student to learn things and are working on their behalf. They're the law enforcement - they try to keep order in the classroom, assign detentions and such.

    There's a reason we separate these roles out in a court room. We have judges, lawyers, and court security, respectively. The incentives for all acting parties are inevitably going to be in conflict if you fail to separate these concerns. At minimum, I propose creating two entirely distinct institutions for education and credentialization. The institute of education has no permanent record and they are only there to curate the best educational content and advise students regarding how best to make use of said content. They might give out assignments if they think it is helpful for learning, but students are under no real obligation to do them. In general, they are there to increase the knowledge, skills, and competency of their students. On the other hand, you have the institute of credentialization. Their job is to test students. It's to evaluate and assess. They give assignments and tests too, but there are actual consequences for students that fail to complete and pass them.

    By separating out these roles, you've made the incentives clear - the educators will always be seen as advocates and allies of their students (where they are currently *not* in most students' eyes) and the credentializers will always be seen as an obstacle that needs to be overcome. Currently, students have to look past the fact that the teacher they need help from is also the jerk that gave them a D on their midterm. That's a hard sell for a lot of people.

      There was a bit from Eliezer's April Fools day thing that touched on this as well:

      >Tell a real educator about how Earth classes are taught in three-month-sized units, and they would’ve sputtered and asked how you can iterate fast enough to learn how to teach that. Tell them that the same universities that taught were also responsible for certifying that teaching had occurred successfully - that the performance of education, and the verification and certification of education, were carried out by the same financial entity - and they would have just turned and walked away. Tell them that students paid up front whether the university succeeded or failed at training them, and they’d turn around and start yelling about dishonorable fraud.

      I don't know how it works in the US, but at the European School (and I believe in France), external examiners are brought in to write and grade baccalaureate (final) exams. Oral exams are held by your teacher + one outsider, as a sort of good cop / bad cop routine where your own teacher tries to nudge you in the right direction.
      ```

      - u/Escapement:
        ```
        Here in Canada, you don't really see anything like that for any schools below university / college, especially in the public school system. Here, for college and university, you get oral exam and thesis assessed by minimum of supervisor + internal (inside department) + external (outside your department) + person from outside your university... at the Masters and PhD level, programs. Some different programs mix it up a bit - having a thesis for the Bachelor level, or not require an external to the university for Master's degrees, or whatever.  This sort of thing would probably be a really good idea but it would also be time-intensive. The closest thing we get to that here in Canada are that the final set of written exams for high-school level are set nationally and marked by contractors who are not the instructors.
        ```

      - u/somerandomguy2008:
        ```
        We don't typically do anything like that that I'm aware of besides maybe [standardized tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test#United_States). These aren't used for most classes, though, and are more restricted in terms of what they're actually assessing compared to what I'm advocating for.
        ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        So, there is standardized testing at the state level in the US, but many of the standardized tests are "Goodhart's Law-esque" traps in terms of education, teachers teach to the test and not to maximize learning.

        The Florida FCAT, I remember was despised pretty thoroughly.  I hated it as a student myself, although mostly because it was so mind numblingly easy, I didn't have much sympathy for the complaints of students not able to pass it.  (Performing well on the FCAT literally required bare minimum reading/writing/Math skills, I have a hard time understanding how someone not developmentally disabled might fail).  In High School there was also county level exams for each class, which were a littles less than 1/3 of the semester grade.  I thought these were too easy as well, and they didn't capture everything that should be one the curriculum for a class sometimes.

        Others have mentioned the SAT, which I think is okay as a test, but basing someones entire college admission on just the score or setting an absolute minimum threshold is stupid.  If someone for example had several AP credit classes in high school, and had lots of community involvement and activities, a lower SAT score should be tolerable.  As it is, I think it varies from college to college, with some colleges using it as an easy way to weed out applicants.

        I think the AP exams were actually good tests.  They were hard, but because they were hard, inclusive of a lot of material, and designed with multiple types of questions (short responses, long responses, multiple choice, even oral recordings for some classes like foreign languages), many colleges accept them as credits.

        > Oral exams are held by your teacher + one outsider, as a sort of good cop / bad cop routine where your own teacher tries to nudge you in the right direction.

        This sounds like a pretty good idea... I would imagine US schools would find someway of screwing it up though.

          The thing about Goodhart's Law traps is spot-on! I'm working on an extended write-up for high school friends of mine, so my asking of the question here was to source some add'l viewpoints for solutions I'd yet to consider.

          I think AP tests are fairly suboptimal in terms of their grading (very lenient curves that reduce the actual amount you need to know. Something like 50% of people get 5's on AP Calc BC, for example, and you can get that score if you skip some problems) and setup (studying an entire year for a three hour test seems fairly unbalanced), though.

    > I'm curious if people here have looked into marginal improvements to the system?

    The easiest and most direct thing I can think of is throwing money at the problem, particularly in the form of teacher salaries across the board and in the form of classroom supplies (for poorer classrooms).  

    More teacher salary will attract more teachers, and possibly attract higher skill teachers who would otherwise pursue more profitable professions.  This will allow for reduction in class size which would allow for more specialization in teachers (dividing up the students by giftednesd level or even by learning types or student needs).  As it currently is, teachers are not paid in a way that matches their education level or the sheer number of extra hours their job requires (planning curriculum, grading homework, calling parents, and any extra clubs or programs they support).

    Classroom supplies... right now schools are funded at a local county level, not at a state or federal level.  Students from poorer areas can be screwed on basic supplies like textbooks or if the students are especially poor, stuff like folders/binders/notebook paper/etc.

    So yeah.  Kind of a simple solution, but surprisingly difficult to implement given the opposition to federal government intervention and how it would change how the money moved around.

    To answer specific concerns:

    > Critiques of the traditional classroom paradigm 

    More money for teacher salaries=more teachers=room to experiment with one or two teachers specializing with less traditional classrooms or alternative teaching/learning approaches.

    > Lack of well-defined pathways for very smart students.

    More teachers=more room for specialization/smaller class sizes=classes specifically targeted for the handful of most gifted students in the school (and conversely the students most in need of additional help/guidance/one-on-one focus).

    > Lack of widespread use of well-backed pedagogical techniques, like retrieval practice

    More teacher= each teacher can have more planning periods/time allocated, which may give them room to learn and prepare to use advanced pedagogical techniques.
    ```

    - u/None:

      > More teacher salary will attract more teachers, and possibly attract higher skill teachers who would otherwise pursue more profitable professions. This will allow for reduction in class size...

      I'm a little confused how additional salaries would decrease class size. Are we assuming that we're just hiring additional teachers? (As opposed to, say, just increasing existing teacher salary?)
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        I'm saying both more money for more teachers, and more money to pay more teachers.  At some level, you need one to achieve the other (just making more teaching jobs without increasing the pay would exhaust the supply of teachers eventually). 

        The level of increase of both I think is necessary to really improve the US education system would drastically increase how much taxpayers need to pay for schools, and thus is completely politically untenable, Republicans have an ideologically obsessive level with reducing government spending, and the belief that privatization can solve costs.  Paying through the federal level would ensure the money was spent evenly (so that poorer areas don't get screwed in favor of richer ones), but would be hated by Republican "state-rights" types even more.  Paying more on the local level would accelerate the rate at which poorer areas education system deteriorate, as they would suffer from a brain drain as their more skilled teachers are hired by richer districts for higher salaries.

        For a case study... Florida passed a class size amendment, but then the legislature didn't back it up with sufficient funding.  Many schools (at least the schools in Hillborough County) responded by juggling kids around in class to meet the caps, instead of hiring teachers (because their budgets didn't increase enough).  So for an extreme and simplified example, instead of 24 students in one class and 20 students in another (if for example level or ability or scheduling made it convenient to do it that way), they would instead move 2 kids and have 22 kids in each class, regardless if that was right for the kids or teachers schedules/learning ability.  Whereas if they had more money, they could hire an additional teacher, and then do maybe 18 kids in one class, 16 in another, and 10 in the third.  That was a simple example... in some ways it is worse for that.  For example, a rural area with a lot of immigrant children, the school might bank on the fact that many of them drop out throughout  the year, so they'll arrange things to meet the class size check early in the year, and then rearrange things as kids drop out.
        ```

  - u/buckykat:
    ```
    How about fundamentally socioeconomically segregated school funding? Districts are funded largely by local property taxes, reinforcing other detrimental effects of parental poverty on student achievement. Instead, we should redistribute this property tax school money on a statewide, or even nationwide, rather than district level.

  So I recently bought a game called [Cultists of Cthulhu](http://daystareld.com/review-cultists-of-cthulhu/) from Thomas Eliot, a fellow rationalist who has designed and released multiple board games. You can read the review of it I put on my site there, and in it I discuss dice rolling mechanics in games, and how Cultists adds an extra level to it:

  >Now, normally dice rolling is one of my least favorite parts of games due to the random element it puts in, but this one does something clever with it.

  >After you roll your dice, you can choose any symbol you’ve rolled and reroll all dice of that kind. So let’s say you roll your dice and get 2 Success, 1 Weird, and 2 Fail. The card requires you to get 3 Success to get the positive effect, 2 Weird for the Weird effect, and 2 Fail is enough to get the negative effect. So a smart choice might be to reroll the 2 Fail dice. Hopefully, you’d get the 1 extra success you need and avoid the 2 Fail effect… but if the Weird effect is actually something you really don’t want to have happen right now,  it might not be worth the risk, and you might choose to just reroll the Weird, accept the two Fail, and hope that one dice will get you the third Success.

  >Mechanics like this help add a lot of nuance to otherwise rote gameplay, and is one of the strongest parts of the game. There are some genuinely hard choices it forces you to make, while also helping mitigate the downsides of a luck-based mechanic. I’ve had some great arguments erupt at the table as people try to decide which dice to reroll, and it’s all made more tense by the knowledge that one of the players is actually a cultist in disguise!

  It made me think about ways to introduce decisions to chance mechanics in other games too, but when I tried to think of other examples I came up a bit short. My favorite games tend to be those with a lot of social aspects and with few (if any) dice rolling (Avalon/The Resistence/Secret Hitler, or Dixit, or [Game of Thrones](http://daystareld.com/game-of-thrones-game-review/)) so I was wondering what some of /r/rational's favorite board games are, and specifically whether any of them have dice or chance mechanics that are influenced by player choices?
  ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    > My favorite games tend to be those with a lot of social aspects and with few (if any) dice rolling 

    *Shadows Over Camelot* is a perfect example. There are dice included in the box, but they are not rolled (they're used to show a player's health, which can never go above six)
    ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Note that a lot of this is purely a matter of perception. 

    E.g. if you have to roll lots of dice, or do it often, the improbabilities will average out, but for many people it *feels* more random.

    E.g. card games (with decks of very different cards) are *super* random, but perceived as much less so than dice games.

    > whether any of them have dice or chance mechanics that are influenced by player choices?

    "Deck-building" games, in which players start with a simple deck but can buy/earn extra cards in-game and thus slowly shape the probabilities of their draws. E.g. *Dominion*, *Arctic Scavengers*.

    *Olympos* and *Game of Thrones* have a mechanic where the exact consequences of an action are random, but you're in control of whether it's a "good" vs "bad" outcome. (In GoT, the wildling attack. In Olympos, the god cards.) So if a certain bad outcome screws up your strategy you can blame luck to a certain extent, but it still feels like it's "your fault" for not paying for the good.
    ```

    ```
    Not a boardgame, but Malifaux is a roleplaying game that uses a deck of cards rather than dice. When you would roll a d20 in D&D, in Malifaux you instead flip a card from the top of your deck (adding the result to the modifier to see if you hit the DC).

    In my opinion there are two neat things that Malifaux does with this. The first is that there are positive flips and negative flips, which somewhat mimic advantage and disadvantage in D&D (though I think Malifaux the minis game had them first). If you have beneficial circumstances, you can flip two or more cards and take the better one. If you have negative circumstances, you flip two or more cards and take the worse of them.

    The second neat thing is that players have a hand full of cards drawn from the deck, which they can use in order to replace any neutral (one card) flip or better. Cards in hand are a limited resource, so you don't want to use them too often, but they're basically luck mitigation so long as you aren't trying something ridiculous that you have bad circumstances (negative flip) on. Since you can only refill your hand at certain points, there's a good balance to it. And suits of the cards matter, so even low value cards in your hand are worth something depending on what you're trying to do.

    (Malifaux the RPG is descended from Malifaux the minis game, so probably closer to a tabletop than most. It's got some other issues, but the core mechanics are pretty interesting, especially the tarot reading you do as part of character creation.)
    ```

  - u/blanktextbox:
    ```
    There's a class of eurogames that use dice as input rather than output. You'll roll a pool of dice and begin making decisions about what you can do with the results, often spending dice with specific faces as resources directly. Stefan Feld has made a lot of games in this space, often with forms of dice manipulation; I recommend checking out his body of work. We're also seeing a wave of dice games come out with some of these ideas, and dice spin-offs like Pandemic: The Cure and Roll for the Galaxy that explore implementing other ideas in fistfuls of dice. They generally use reroll mechanics because they're simple, fast, and fun, and you often see result conversion, too.
    ```

    - u/thecommexokid:

      Other examples of dice-as-input board games: Alien Frontiers, Euphoria, Discoveries: The Journals of Lewis & Clark, Voyage of Marco Polo, Steampunk Rally, Colony...

    ```
    [Tragedy Looper](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148319/tragedy-looper) is my absolute favorite game, *possibly* because it's a time travel mystery deduction game.  
    If you are psychic there is no luck in the game, but because you lack information you have to make informed *random* choices that can be (un)lucky. As the game goes on and you get more info, your actions become more purposeful giving you a sense of progression and capability.

  So I have to apologize for not updating last week. Deadlines, while great for productivity, are not so great when the total time I have available is so small and thus extremely susceptible to setbacks.  I think I’m going to shift more to communicating my what my next task *is*, and not committing to a specific time for completion.  


  In addition, I’m going to start working on a 3 weeks on, 1 week off schedule (which is more a formalization of the status quo anyway), so as to introduce a pressure valve.  This past week will count as my week off, so the next three weeks will be on.


  ----


  In spite of calling this last week my week off, I did get quite a bit done when I had not committed myself to *needing* to get anything done.


  First, I managed to get chunks to understand how far they are from the player, which will of course be necessary for dynamically allocating simulation time to chunks which are further away:


  http://i.imgur.com/vyTICYJ.gifv


  In the above image, you can see that those chunks follow the strictest definition of “distance”; because of the way that corners work on a rhombus made out of hexes, it results in some rather wonky topography where the jagged corners exist because of the corner technically being covered.  It’s unintuitive and I later overrode this to be a bit more intuitive, but it’s only one of many strange behaviors that one gets when one doesn’t use square grids.


  Chunks now load from a pool based on a few different limits: I can say that chunks can only be loaded within a certain distance of the player, and I can also determine a total chunk limit.  Both of these numbers are enforced and can be changed dynamically at runtime:

  http://i.imgur.com/xdJkZzA.gifv


  Both of these gifs show a traditional wrapping setup, where the entities that cross over a boundary automatically teleport to the applicable spot on the opposite side. As shown, this does result in an invisible barrier that would have to be worked around (usually done by locking the camera so it doesn’t show the barrier).  However, it also requires that all entities that exist on the wrapped portion of the map be represented with a certain amount of “ghosting”, something like this:

  https://cdn.tutsplus.com/gamedev/uploads/2014/03/tutsplus-ghosts.png


  Having so many copies of entities seems to me that it will produce a ton of headaches in the long run, simulation-wise.  Instead, I opted to change everything over to operate the way I had originally designed, where the player can move anywhere at all and they are never teleported, and the map itself handles the logic of deciding which chunk to load beneath the player’s feet.  


  This *does* mean that the game has to have a maximum distance that one can go.  If I travel to the right and never stop, the world will cycle and wrap beneath me, but my X position goes to 100, then 1000, then 10,000, and on and on until we start to hit issues with floating point precision.  If any of you are familiar with the Far Lands in old Minecraft builds, this was a similar issue that they ran into: eventually, the part of your position before the decimal is so large that there is no data left to represent the portion after the decimal, and so you can only move in increments larger than a block or more.  


  However, since this actual position limit for a single-precision floating point decimal would be somewhere around 8-10 million, I’m confident that this limitation won’t be an issue in practice.  After all, when the player saves and loads the game, I can push all entities to sit within the wrapped coordinates of the original map no problem, effectively invisibly resetting the coordinates every load.  So one would have to somehow traverse 5000 km (3106 miles) *in a single play session* to break this limit.  


  Anyway, enough theory.  Once I got the infinite positioning stuff working, I threw together some quick and dirty block creation/destruction code, and now the actual wrapping effect is evident:

  http://i.imgur.com/r7zSRLB.gifv


  (You might notice that the colors pop; my tile coloring code only triggers when the chunk boundaries are crossed, so you end up with all sorts of interesting weirdnesses that I haven’t bothered to fix yet.)


  And there we have it!  A fully-functioning, wrapping voxel world.  It’s currently using the standard Torus wrapping.  I have one final addition to make, that of making it operate more like a sphere (well, a cylinder), and then I’ll be satisfied that I’ve explored the finicky parts of the voxel design.


  I have actually [thrown a build together here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0LYycfi-K18Xy1kUl9EeS1sVXM), for Windows, Linux, and Mac.  Controls are ESDF to move, left mouse button to create a block, right mouse button to delete a block. I still would not recommend full screen (I keep forgetting to add ESC to exit).

  Not a rational fic, but let me know what you think!

    Loved it! I don't think I've read one where kids feel guilty for picking on Malfoy before. The interaction also made sense in terms of Ron being from a prankster family with lots of competition for attention whereas Draco is an only child from a very self-serious family.

  Ok, so I've been thinking about Death Note recently. Not really sure why. And I had a question I've been meaning to ask some of the fine minds here at the r/rational sub, specifically those that have seen the manga/anime already (if you haven't, I highly recommend it, it's a very intelligent series and very well done, if a little contrived at times. I'd probably call it one of the more rational works out there). 

  As anyone who's seen or even heard about it knows, DN is basically about this guy that find a death magic notebook that lets him kill anyone who's name and face he's seen. He proceeds to use this to kill criminals (a fairly inefficient method, for a number of reasons) to help create a "new world" because he finds the current one is rotten and unjust.

  Now, my first question. What are some gaping holes/issues in the series that you noticed and that bothered you? One for me is how the deductive reasoning skills of L and Light, while being somewhat believable, still seemed almost magical at times. Oftentimes, a plan would be enacted and I'd find myself thinking "There's no way, no matter how smart you are, you would've foreseen X and so done Y like that!". I get that we're supposed to buy it because these guys are legendary geniuses but I felt like this was used cheaply to move the plot along. I still enjoyed the ride, there's no question, but I found these instances fairly annoying from a rationalist standpoint, as the real reason was sometimes very obviously "The writer made it this way" as opposed to "Someone really intelligent figured it out".

  Now, for my second question (and even non DN watchers can answer this): Do you think the main character has an effective, moral goal? He has a death notebook and is using it to kill criminals (murderers, serial rapists, etc.) to act as both the ultimate deterrent and to remove those who've committed heinous acts from this world entirely. Is this the best way for the MC to use such a thing if he really wanted to make a better world? And, even if it is effective, is it morally right?

    > Father had once taken him to see a play called The *Tragedy of Light*, about this *incredibly* clever Slytherin named Light who'd set out to purify the world of evil using an ancient ring that could kill anyone whose name and face he knew, and who'd been opposed by another incredibly clever Slytherin, a villain named Lawliet, who'd worn a disguise to conceal his true face; and Draco had shouted and cheered at all the right parts, especially in the middle; and then the play had ended sadly and Draco had been hugely disappointed and Father had gently pointed out that the word 'Tragedy' was right there in the title.

    > Afterward, Father had asked Draco if he understood why they had gone to see this play.

    > Draco had said it was to teach him to be as cunning as Light and Lawliet when he grew up.

    > Father had said that Draco couldn't possibly be more wrong, and pointed out that while Lawliet had cleverly concealed his face there had been no good reason for him to tell Light his *name*. Father had then gone on to demolish almost every part of the play, while Draco listened with his eyes growing wider and wider. And Father had finished by saying that plays like this were *always* unrealistic, because if the playwright had known what someone *actually* as smart as Light would *actually* do, the playwright would have tried to take over the world himself instead of just writing plays about it.

    > That was when Father had told Draco about the Rule of Three, which was that any plot which required more than three different things to happen would never work in real life.

    > Father had *further* explained that since only a fool would attempt a plot that was *as complicated as possible*, the real limit was two.

    > And, even if it is effective, is it morally right?

    This is a common rhetorical trap for utilitarianism: if you *knew* this great evil would result in even greater good, should you do it? Yes - **but** in real life, *having that certainty* is all but impossible. When you account for a probability of failure, the expected value can drop very quickly.

    Given that it's only effective on people who are publicly known to be terrible criminals but have evaded arrest, it's only going to eliminate a small percent of all criminals.  Eventually, people will figure out that only people who end up on the news get killed, so the deterrence level of "I'm okay as long as I don't get arrested" only gets increased to "I'm okay as long as I don't get discovered and broadcast."

    A much better method of improving the world would be to become an unstoppable assassin.  Bin Laden?  Dead.  Kim Jong Un?  Dead.  He can take out any evil dictator and any of their officers as long as their name and face are public knowledge.  He could probably anonymously contact the government, prove the legitimacy of his power, and coordinate with them to kill off a number of important people in an enemy nation or group simultaneously, and have the army go in there to handle the power vaccuum.  Since he can control the death time down to the second, they would know exactly when to move.  And given that he can basically mind control someone for 23 days before they ultimately die, he could probably force them to step down from dictatorship, and set up a new, more democratic government, before going off and dying in a ditch somewhere (or giving some speech about how terrible they feel for their actions and committing suicide).

    You can argue about the morality of this, it's clearly abusable.  But it would be far more effective than killing "criminals" who are responsible for at most dozens of deaths rather than thousands.

    Even if he wanted to become a god, he should have just secretly threatened all of the politicians, of every nation, and made them into puppet governments.  I don't know about Japan, but if he did that in America at least 80% of congress would cave.  At any point in the story when he realized he was getting in over his head he could have just got up and went to America and become a shadow king.  Yeah, it would have been totally obvious to the investigators after he left that he was actually guilty, but by that point he's in another country with a new name, a new life, probably in the witness protection program or something because he has congress by the balls and can make them do pretty much whatever he wants as long as he can make sure they don't kill him.

      I think the first ten episodes of this show are basically perfect, but even I found it really odd that Light limited himself to people in Japan. I also found it really weird that an FBI agent showed up only for the US government to be uncharacteristically intimidated into submission by Kira's response. Even by the standards America has set for being the global center of attention, it these seem like an odd oversights.

      - u/zarraha:
        ```
        I guess what he would need to do is set up his new identity in a way such that nobody knew he was there.  So if he did witness protection he'd have to mind control some secretary or something to switch files around, rather than having the threatened people officially arrange for it.  Or just kill someone with no family/friends and take their identity.  If all of his contact with them was anonymous, he could still have them do things that benefit him (like creating and funding a new government branch CIA-like-thing that does things he tells them to and pays him a salary into a swiss bank account)

    No, I don't think so.

    The Death Note manipulates the future, correct?^1 The people whose names written in it will die either in forty second of heart attack, or at the time of your choosing in the situation of your choosing?

    If so, it's so gameable it's not even funny. *'[Murderer #443] died during March 31, year 2020, after serving as my devoted slave for three years,'* is there a reason it won't work? If it needs to be a *cause* of death, simply write 'died of overworking'.

    But that's small fish. Can't you simply write *worldstates* in there? *'[Bystander #4] died of heart attack in year 2304, in the most advanced hospital of the perfect human solar_system-spanning eudaemonic utopia peacefully established by humanity in preceding centuries, right next to the equipment necessary to ressurect him in the next five minutes'*?

    *'[Bystander #5] had his neck broken by a solid-state drive containing the ready-to-execute code of a truly Friendly seed AGI that appeared above his head'*?

    It seems people focus too much on the 'death' part of the 'death control', and not enough on the 'control'.

      This is correct but experimenting with its capabilities is one of the first thing Light does. If you try anything too implausible then what happens is they just die of a heart attack.

      I'm not sure if it's specifically tested whether someone can die prematurely if you've set them to die at a future date.

        Hmm. Fair enough. I still think that manipulating worldstates through causes of death is a better way of fixing the world.

        Finding patients that are expected to die in a few years if no cure is found, placing their deaths a few decades later due to accidents. Writing people dying of heart attacks after reading valid articles telling about worldwide decrease in death rates or poverty. Manipulating politicians into showing more concern for existential threats.

        Even if these are still too 'implausible' and need to be toned-down, I'm positive that you could manipulate the future through one artificially-created cause of death better than with natural consequences of one's death.

          Yeah. It's the usual problem where any narratively simple rules about wishes are easy to manipulate. Death Note could use a Rules of Wishing style set of refinements, but I probably shouldn't write death note fanfic because it would get a bit grimdark...

      The Death Note has several limitations that make any game breaking a huge challenge, if not downright impossible. The main relevant limitations are you only have control of someone up to 23 days after putting their name down. Now, the upside is that you have pretty much full control over them during that time. You could easily write:

      *Bob Jones, heart attack, April 16 2017, does whatever I, MC, commands until then without question or hesitation.*

      And it seems the Death Note favors the writer, as opposed to the victim, where there's ambiguity. So, in the above example, Bob wouldn't be able to find some loophole in my orders as they're implemented magically based on how I feel they should be done (no djinn tricks here!)

      As far as your other questions, the Death Note has no effect on anything besides people. It can't make things spawn out of thin air or anything in that realm. All you can do is kill people and control how they die. But their death needs to be reasonably able to be accomplished. if "fate" or whoever determines their death is too difficult, then the person just dies of a heart attack. This also occurs if, by causing their own death, said person kills other people (unless those conditions were laid out specifically in the conditions you wrote, such as *Bob kills himself by hijacking a bus and driving it into a river in an attempt to take as many people with him as he could*. If you left out the last section, events would happen such that Bob hijacks a bus and drives it into a river solo)

      You're also limited in that you only have six minutes and forty seconds to write in conditions. After that, it will run with what you have written down or, if it's not possible because your conditions need the other stuff you wrote down to happen, the victim dies of a heart attack.

        Just want to state that if you were to write that death, assuming MC is a replacement for your "real name", it would kill you by heart attack in 40 seconds. Having your name written in the note results in your death, even if you're writing it in a description.

        I see. But it *assures* that things *will* be where I write them to be, *if* they could plausibly end up there through human actions, correct? Why won't the ones in my comment up the tree work (the reply to u/DRMacIver), then?

          Well. That'll teach me to skim XD

          Also, in re-reading my comment, I realize I may have come off sassy. That wasn't my intent at all. I was honestly saying you could peruse them at your leisure. But your comment made it clear you already did that. So...yea...I shouldn't skim, lol.

          > I see. But it assures that things will be where I write them to be, if they could plausibly end up there through human actions, correct? Why won't the ones in my comment up the tree work (the reply to u/DRMacIver), then?

          Some of those sound viable. The rules state that 23 days is the max length of time you can set someone's death to be. If you write down a date beyond that, the person will either day immediately or after 23 days have passed. 23 days is like the hard limit put in place. The manipulation and stuff is possible; it's just that the person in question will die in three weeks. Once you can work within that time frame, you can realistically make anyone do anything. And there definitely is lots of potential there.
          ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      Yes, the *Death Note* controls the future. I vaguely recall there's a time limit, but I can't find it skimming through that link, maybe I'm mistaken. 

      But if the death is "too implausible" it will be replaced by an immediate heart attack, and there's no strict rule about what counts as implausible. (It's a convenient escape clause to prevent any trick unwanted for Doylist reasons.)

      The protagonist, in good /r/rational fashion, [experimented with a number of edge cases](https://youtu.be/vfMspmV9bsw?t=8m03s) (though stupidly letting his enemies learn from them as well). As a lower bound, anything that can't be achieved by casting the Imperius curse on all of humanity will fail. Getting information out of the aether is right out.
      ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    Replying to address my second question: I think it's a very inefficient way to go about things. I don't have hard numbers but I'm certain that at least a few thousand people worldwide are the perpetrators of crimes that the MC would consider heinous enough to die for. He simply doesn't have the time to kill all of them, especially when you consider that he needs both a name and a face. That's a lot of research to do and he can't afford to sit in his house at the computer all day. 

    Now, I'm sure it would act as a deterrent, in the same way that police forces and martial law does, but I don't think it will significantly improve the world in any way in and of itself. Certainly not enough for him to consider himself a "god of the new world".

    As far as if it's morally right? I would say yes *If and Only If* our MC had some way of confirming his victims were truly guilty and if he didn't kill the people that would invariably be trying to catch him (which, in the series, he does. Heavily.)

    Some other responses have already listed good uses, so to answer another question about the detective skills involved and staying anonymous while using the Death Note, I would recommend [gwern's writing on the subject](https://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity).
    ```

- u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
  ```
  So I've been looking through this Jumpchain thing that people use to make stories, and is it just me or is it really badly designed from the perspective of wiritng interesting stories? 10 years in-story is way more time than most people have in them to write. So a lot of it just ends up being phoned in because the writer feels like they need to get through multiple ten years slogs before they're done. They're mostly SI so the person choosing the perks avoids the difficult (read interesting) perks and difficulties in favour of choosing an optimal build that makes everything easy. This and other things means that not only is it a low pressure stomp train even at its hardest, more often than not you end up reading a summary of events rather than an actual story. Ya'know, a story with a plot, and intruige, and suspense, and characters with meaningful goals that aren't quasi-brainwashed into always following the main character regardless.

  It's like taking a standard SI and then pumping them full of steroids, removing all of the actual challenge and difficulty, then skimping out on proper character interactions because really what's the point if they're not going to be there next jump.

  What a waste of beginner writers.
