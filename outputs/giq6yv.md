## [D]Why is LitRPG often considered a 'Rational-Adjacent' genre when so many of it's protagonists carry the Idiot Ball?

### Post:

For real, I had to drop so damn many LitRPG books because the people in them -- especially the main characters, but not only the main characters-- were acting like such morons, and the world building didn't stand up to even the slightest scrutiny, and it didn't have a feel of evoking a grand storytelling tradition or really good writing to fall back on.  What gives? Why is this described as somewhat close to rational? I feel like there are under 5 LitRPG's -- be they actual published books, or stories you can find on Royal Road or similar, that could be considered 'Rational'.  Am I missing some treasure trove somewhere?

  For some people minmaxing is equivalent to rationality. If you simplify a setting down to just game mechanics, then sure, making smart moves mechanically is easy; but rarely are settings that pared down. It’s much harder to write a character that improves themselves by thinking clearly about problems and addressing personal problems than to just make arbitrary numbers get bigger and pretend that’s self improvement while ignoring everything else, and people are lazy so they want to write the second one.
  ```

  - u/Gavinfoxx:
    ```
    But hardly anyone ever actually minmaxes in these books! That's my complaint!
    ```

    - u/slightlywrongadvice:
      ```
      Even easier than writing about minmaxing a simplified system is to just not establish clear internal rules and have arbitrary numbers go up for arbitrary reasons.

      And people are REALLY LAZY so they want to write the second one.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        Sure. Okay. But why do *readers* recommend those types of stories here so often then?
        ```

        - u/slightlywrongadvice:
          ```
          All these categories are fuzzy and can readily lead to type categorization errors. 

          A big part of it is that the concept of “idiot ball” isn’t inherent to a story, it’s produced through a readers analysis. If I never pick up on stupid decisions made, I never think the characters are stupid. Stupidity is also a little bit subjective, so I think between those two things recommendations that someone thinks are barely passable for them, are completely unreadable for someone else.
          ```

          - u/Bowbreaker:
            ```
            The idiot ball goes beyond mere stupidity though. It's when a character does something stupid *despite* his characterization and specifically in a stupid way that doesn't fit. The classical example is "Let's split up" when everyone is clearly scared shitless and one of the characters has actual experiences of being in horror movie situations. Even a relatively dumb person wouldn't be okay with it. Another one is when someone uses some cool skill all the time, except that one time where it would obviously and easily solve their problem, thus negating the need for some plot thread.
            ```

            - u/slightlywrongadvice:
              ```
              I’m just trying to explain why recommendations might come through that seem inexplicable.

              To some people the moments of idiot ball handling might not have felt so egregious, I agree that the definition is quite clear cut, but detection is still incumbent on the attentiveness and thoughtfulness of the reader.
              ```

            - u/fassina2:
              ```
              Splitting up isn't inherently stupid. Armies, police and firefighters do it often, generally they still keep in groups of 2 in case they need back up but that's it.

              &#x200B;

              There are feel situations where 3 people rather than 2 would be that much of an advantage in a normal dangerous situation irl. Combat IRL is faster, and very high damage, even without guns. It's generally better to encircle or close escape routes than to just pack up bodies and be easily avoided or miss the mission target altogether.

              &#x200B;

              It's only seen as 'stupid' in RPGs and other derived works because it annoys DMs, by making their job harder which in turn means the players get punished for it.
              ```

              - u/Bowbreaker:
                ```
                I was more thinking of horror movies or adventure stories set in "horror" settings like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Like, "there are definitely monsters here that are hard but not impossible to defend against and that like using ambush tactics (we know because we've been through it multiple times now) so let's split up to maybe find a random doodad a tiny bit faster". That kind of stuff.
                ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```

      People not minmaxing doesn't mean they necessarily have an Idiot Ball.

      Remember, the Idiot Ball is when someone who is normally smart and/or thoughtful does something stupid solely to make the plot move forward.  If a cautious character suddenly decides to walk down a dark alley in the bad part of town for no reason, that's an Idiot Ball. If that same character is in a desperate hurry because they are trying to save their friend's life and the alley is a shortcut, that's rational.

      Minmaxing your build is the rational thing to do for people who are thoughtful, measured, understand game systems, have the math skills (it's usually math) to identify synergy, and have time to consider.  There are plenty of reasons why someone might not do this.  Maybe they don't have enough information. Maybe the Game Master frowns upon it and will smite you. Maybe a level up requires you to make all choices within a few seconds and you don't have the information to make choices in advance. Maybe it's a question of personality -- characters with terrible impulse control won't sit and read through a hundred skills to find the perfectly optimal one. Maybe the chapter doesn't *want* the perfectly optimal one -- magic is the better choice, but a devout and observant Christian will still go sword-and-board because witchcraft is forbidden. Etc
      ```

    - u/SoylentRox:
      ```
      To be fair to properly minmax an RPG you need to play it.  To really do it well you need to play it over hundreds of thousands of episodic playthroughs to learn the actually optimal strategy.  (Which may not be "put all your points in int for maximum magical power", unless the game is very poorly balanced)

      Alphastar doesn't Zerg rush every StarCraft 2 match.

      In most lit RPG scenarios the character has to "live" it, with no respawns.  Ergo things that improve durability or ability to dodge or escape are probably optimal, given the character usually gets only one life.

      On several good rr fics, the character wants to be a Batman wizard but the system offers them an Uber rare melee class.  So they have to play it as this is the optimal strategy available.  (Defiance of the Fall on RR is one I read)
      ```

    - u/Terkala:
      ```
      There's a few I can think of. Certainly more common in this genre than others.

      Fimbrulwinter

      Mother of Learning

      The Gam3

      The New World

      All those have protagonists that intentionally minmax their stats or train in a focused way that others in their setting never consider doing.
      ```

      - u/notgreat:
        ```
        Mother of Learning isn't a LitRPG. Perhaps you meant Worth the Candle? (Though there no one else has the LitRPG system so it doesn't really fit what you said)
        ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        The Gam3's protagonist holds so many idiot balls that for a brief period I thought him being brain damaged was going to be a plot point. It's also poorly written. I can't disreccomend it hard enough.
        ```

        >Fimbrulwinter

        Fimbulwinter (Daniel Black Book 1) treats the female characters like masturbation puppets, though. I tried reading it and got really skeeved out after a while. It's a sort of ultimate Nice Guy fantasy: I do good things for these women so they all pay me with sex! 

        Insert "decent human being" tokens, get blowjobs and titty fucking from people with less power. It creeped me out.

  - u/None:
    ```
    Its frustrating becasue the lessons that allow you to do well in at an rpg are often the opposite of what is useful in real life. (e.g. scouring through rules for specific exploits, treating rules as immutable facts of the universe, acting like you are the only person with agency)
    ```

      ```
      The only time I’ve seen a litrpg manage to avoid this trap (mostly) is worth the candle. Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty gets an honourable mention because it plays with the trope of RPG rationalist having to navigate a suddenly much more complex world and system. 

      I think part of it is demographics. Both writers and readers skew male, young, and tech-y. If you say “pick 2” you probably manage to capture 99% of the community. We like rpgs, they’re systems we actually know pretty well, and they have aesthetic choices we like. Most of us are humanist leaning, some trans-humanist, which actually narrows our scope of what we would accept as rational.

      Take a story in which the Christian god is real and the protagonist is already Christian and made aware of this, they then rationally work to convert as many people as possible. I don’t know if I would read this, probably not.

      My point is that “Rational” fiction as a category is significantly defined by the aesthetics of its audience, to the point of exclusion of what might objectively be called rational fiction in other contexts, ie, fiction with smart, reflective characters that have different value sets than our own. It might be hard to even identify from an outsiders perspective. Do I recognize the protagonist of a harlequin romance as being unusually rational in her attempts to woo the paramour? It’s hard to imagine, partly because (and here I’ll admit a major exception to my thesis) the tropes present in the genre don’t demand smart characters. It’s not like there are countless other rational works just with different value sets scattered around your library, but there are probably a few we just might not recognize immediately. 

      I’d love to read some of them actually.

        As someone who doesn't identify with that "pick 2" list, I appreciate this comment. :)

        I like reading about rational characters. It's fun and interesting, and if I had a choice I'd prefer my characters to be intellectuals because in all likelihood they'd make the plot more intriguing too.

        But you know what I don't particularly like? Game fics. Characters constantly munchkining everything. Smut fics with some rationality sprinkled in.

        Guys: not all rational fiction needs to be a litRPG, high fantasy, or fanfiction rewrite. You're missing out on a lot of great options. What about a rational horror story? The rational character thinks they have the mystery solved until...turns out the villain was just smarter than you. Or what about a rational comic with sarcastic characters? Historical fiction dealing with difficult scenarios that are difficult to resolve, even using the characters' combined intelligence? Heck, you could even write children's literature! Create a character who describes rational thinking in simple ways.

        Write one of these things and ping me, I'll read it.

  Litrpg has a specific and explicit "System" with rules, numbers, and exploitable mechanics so is more likely to have genuine consistency and consequences than a standard new magic/physics system. This lends itself well to munchkinry, and generally scientific / rational exploration of novel mechanics (which may be complicated, but are much more susceptible to exploitation by a rational actor than new physics). They still often fail in this regard, but usually fare better than standard fantasy of the same quality level.

  Also I think its just that people who enjoy rational fiction are more likely than other groups to enjoy litrpg as well. Rational fiction readers are more likely to enjoy gaming tropes and progression fantasy than the average reader.

  - u/Gavinfoxx:
    ```
    Oh God, I wish there was actual competent munchkinry in these books. They'd be more fun to me!
    ```

    - u/nohat:
      ```
      I don't really disagree. There's a lot of litrpg in which the system is just "throw awesome sounding stuff at MC." I think requiring some specifics, some mechanics is still helpful compared to similarly low quality non litrpg stories. Eg Xianxia where most of the time the MC just really wants it hard and has an unspecified "Overcome Impossible Odds" ability. 

      I think most of the popularly recommended litrpg stories on r/rational are fairly consistent mechanically and some have a decent amount of munchkinry. EG Two Year Emperor, worth the candle, delve, so you should really talk about specific books rather than the entire genre (for one thing I've never heard anyone recommend the whole genre).
      ```

    - u/Flameburstx:
      ```
      Especially annoying to me is munchkinry based on facts the character doesn't know. Delve has this. The character calls himself a munchkin but starts with a super suboptimal build that only becomes remotely viable because it opens up a rare class. But he didn't know that class existed, so he's just bad at minmaxing and lucked into a strong synergy build.
      ```

      - u/PreciseParadox:
        ```
        I mean in Delve I think it’s understandable. He was in a spot where he couldn’t really converse with anyone or increase his knowledge of the system in any meaningful way. It would be pretty unrealistic if he magically figured out the unlock condition for some super rare class. After actually getting his class, he’s much more scientific in learning more about how the system works and making optimal choices.
        ```

        - u/Flameburstx:
          ```
          To clarify, it doesn't bother me the mc made suboptimal choices, it bothers me he made suboptimal choices claiming they were the optimal choices, then being proven right after the fact by things he had no possible way of knowing.
          ```

          - u/Reply_or_Not:
            ```
            >it bothers me he made suboptimal choices claiming they were the optimal choices

            I didn't get this while reading it.  If anything, the MC puts himself down *for subpar combat capabilities for his level*. 

             For example, a huge plot point is him getting the full suit of armor and then developing a complex about taking it off, because the MC knows that he is a totally squishy.  

            The MC sees other people fight, and realizes that he has almost nothing that is comparable: he does a bunch of math to try to figure out how to bridge the gap between his own damage output and the output of the people around him, and he figures that he is just better off embracing the support role, because the gap is just too big.

            If anything, the MC is only happy about the intangibles that his build brings.  Going all clarity let him learn the language and modify the screens.
            ```

      ```
      That's generally what people are *looking for*, but it's like taking drugs - you're always looking to recreate your first hit, which lowers your standards. 

      For me in particular it was Harry Potter and the Natural 20, and I largely got into LitRPGs because I read (I think?) the first Chaos Seeds book and thought "oh this kinda reminds me of Nat 20, but it's a complete story - I wonder if there's more?"

  For a couple months I've had a post in my blog's drafts folder that addresses this very subject, and seeing this post made me decide to finish that post and hit publish.  [Here's the full post](http://kineticliterature.com/the-strengths-of-litrpg/) (which is too long for me to copy/paste into this thread without hitting the Reddit character limit), but to summarize the broad points:

  * LitRPG tends to have more consistent systems. (Also, the characters tend to "meta-game" those systems: even in a story without wild munchkinry, LitRPG characters are more likely to at least meta-game on basic level of choosing equipment or abilities that are well-suited for a particular fight.)
  * Most movie fight scenes act as though characters have "hit points," because viewers seem to prefer this kind of action scene, even though this isn't how real fights work.  LitRPG actually bothers to quantify the "hit points" thing and set up a world where it's consistent with the world's rules for two characters to just punch or throw fireballs at each other until one of them is finally defeated after taking a certain number of hits.
  * LitRPG is (usually) honest about characters' power levels, as opposed to speculative fiction like e.g. the MCU where the universe absurdly pretends that Black Widow (a woman with a glock) and Thor (a literal god) are anywhere close in terms of how much they bring to a fight.

  Also, another point that's less explicitly "rational," but more a trait of good storytelling in general: LitRPG tends to offer a clear sense of progress for the reader. Often, stories will have to shoe-horn in certain elements to make the reader feel like they are making progress toward a goal (like "this character needs to collect six infinity stones"), but LitRPG lends itself to quantified progress much more naturally as characters regularly "level up" (and grow stronger in other ways that are common in video games but rarer in other types of stories, like learning new skills, gaining better equipment, and so on).

  There's also the fact that LitRPG and "rational fiction" are both relatively young genres that have both sprung up in the past 10 years, and tend to largely exist in in web serial form, so they tend attract readers from among the same cohort of individuals who are interested in (or willing to read) serialized web fiction, which is a tiny fraction of the total number of people who read fiction.

  I don't think a protagonist holding the idiot ball is inherent to the genre itself. I think that happens so much because of some combination of novice authors, competing pressures from mixing in other tropes (like power fantasy and wish fulfillment), and [Sturgeon's Law](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw) (it sounds like you read a lot so you're probably gonna hit a lot of shit books). 


  As for calling the genre itself "Rational-Adjacent", look at the adjacent tropes list in the sidebar

  > [Fair-Play Whodunnit](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit)


    if you consider "what RPG build is best to go for?" as the mystery and the author shows the individual abilities/choices the protag has to make. Then this is essentially fulfilled.


  > [Munchkinry](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin)


    pretty natural to go from RPG to exploiting the RPG's rules


  > [Genre Savviness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy)

  > Absence of [Deus Ex Machina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina)

  > [Deconstruction](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction)


  The other 3 don't really seem essential to the genre to me, but 2 out of 5 just for being in the genre seems pretty good to me.

  Who's doing the considering? I haven't felt that the sub gives litRPG an automatic pass as rational-adjacent, even though it's a popular genre for a chunk of the sub and one of the most popular works here is a litRPG. If it were true, the rec posts would be more of a flood than a trickle...

- u/best_cat:

  For me, it's a "cultural affinity" as much as anything.

  Most stories follow a "[Like Reality Unless Noted](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted)" pattern.  (Content Warning: TV Tropes)

  So, if someone's writing a Science Fiction story with a Galactic Government, then we'll be informed of some things like  "This government is a monarchy under the King of All Cosmos", but the low-level background details, like if the characters would be on a first-name basis with their Space-Postman, are assumed to be the same as in reality.

  Only, we can't say "The Same as In Reality".  Not really.  Different regions have subtly different expectations for mundane stuff, like 'do you know your postman?' or 'is it normal to ask a cashier about their family'.  So, really, authors default to reality-as-they-perceive-it or reality-as-they-want-it-to-be.

  This means that the same story, by a Cosmopolitan British Author will end up subtly different than the story by a person from Rural Manitoba.  They might both describe a ticket-seller as taking money, making accurate change, and handing over a ticket.  But the Brit would see that as efficient and respectful of the buyer's time, while the Canadian might see the seller as cold or rude.

  To me, LitRPG hints at a cultural affinity.  It's basically a flag that says, "This author is a nerdy analytic type!  If you're not a nerdy analytic type you will HATE this!"  And that's interesting because I feel like most mainstream authors come from a different place. 

  Good rational fiction also waves that flag.  Now, the flag is no indication of quality.  But, it's a similarity in the same way that "Both of these books are written by Canadians" is a similarity.

  I wouldn't consider LitRPGs as a whole to be rational or rational-adjacent by any means. I consider rationality in fiction to be a spectrum, however, not binary - and I'd consider several LitRPGs to have some elements that are rational (or rational-adjacent, if you prefer).

  There are certainly more than five stories I'd consider to be rational-adjacent. Here are six to start with.

  **Some examples:**

  [**Log Horizon**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083SC2CNV/) does a better job than most LitRPGs of portraying the kind of social dynamics you'd see in a "transported to a MMO" scenario. It has a min/maxer protagonist who spends most of his attention on improvements to the quality of life for people there, politicking, and making peace with the natives to the world they're transported to. Because of this focus - and the game itself feeling more genuinely MMO-like than most of the games out there - I think this is a reasonable example.

  [**Delve**](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve) is popular in the rational community because it goes into significant depth with the character's min/maxing. It also shows a great deal of the protagonist's thought process when he makes decisions, which helps give it a rational feel.

  [**Threadbare**](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare) has some min/maxing, but I mostly consider it rational-adjacent because it has strong transhumanist themes.

  [**The World of Prime Series**](https://www.amazon.com/WORLD-PRIME-5-Book/dp/B07H9D3P8F) is rational-adjacent in that it involves a mechanical engineer from our world being transported to a D&D-style setting and trying to use his knowledge to uplift society. It isn't perfect, but one of the best rational-esque qualities I liked is how little the protagonist actually remembers in terms of how to reinvent things - he doesn't have any easy time of slapping together the renaissance in Rome like some protagonists do. 

  [**Kono Sekai ga Game da to, Ore dake ga Shitte Iru**](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/kono-sekai-ga-game-da-to-ore-dake-ga-shitte-iru/) involves a protagonist being transported into a game that is absolutely riddled with bugs. The rational-adjacent part here is that finding and exploiting bugs is a huge part of the story. This is a parody, and thus, not 100% rational.

  I consider my own [**How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps**](https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Defeat-a-Demon-King-in-Ten-Easy-Steps-Audiobook/B086R2N27Y) rational-adjacent because of the min/maxing involved, as well as the protagonist using lateral thinking and exploits to try to break things. The extensive use of foreshadowing also lends a rational-adjacent quality, since being "fair play" is generally considered a component of rational fiction. Like the above, this is a parody - the characters involved are (deliberately) archetypical, similar to something like Maoyuu or Yuusha Yoshihiko. This is actually probably *less* rational than any of my other books, due to the shorter length, simplicity, and comedic elements - but I'm mentioning it because I wouldn't consider my other books LitRPGs.

    I haven't yet seen any glaring examples of that in Delve.

  Rationality, as I see it, has 2 key components. 1) understanding reality (map v territory) and 2) optimizing behavior to achieve some outcome (system 1 vs system 2 decision making)

  Rational fiction has other sub goals like having character actions match their goals...etc but I think the community pretty quickly realized that those are kind of generally good characteristics of any book. However, just because the badguys backstory is more than "he's evil" doesn't mean that story would fit in with this community. There's a general flavor that goes with rational fiction and it tenders to involve heavy uses of the two themes from the first paragraph.

  Now consider progression fantasy. Given the above points about what makes a work "rational fiction" it may start to become clear why so much of rational fiction is also classified as "progression fantasy". Any GOOD progression fantasy will have 3d characters and action/goal consistency while at the same time, the entire genre focuses on the two pillars of rationality I mentioned before. Those is because most fantasy naturally explores the mechanics of its magic and world, while progression fantasy in particular has an explicit focus on optimization based on this knowledge since it tends to focus on goals that can only really be achieved by personal strength. Further, there's only so much satisfaction that can be had by saying he can move x% faster so exploring/exploiting those world/magic mechanics tends to be important.

  Thus, I think the heavy lifter here is actually good progression fantasy being heavily crosslisted with rational fiction.

  From progression fantasy it's only a short jump to litrpg. The good ones don't chang much from progression fantasy, simply using numbers to put a slightly harder edge on the world/magic so they can be better quantified. The bad ones just show numbers increasing which still loosely ties them to progression fantasy (they're getting stronger) and therefore rational fiction.

  While most authors aren't rational, most LitRPGs have simplified and understandable rules that can have rationality applied to it.

  It's not so much that the characters are rational, but the enviroment is and the reader can more easily figure out how they could do it better.

  Rational people like problem solving, LitRPG gives them a problem to solve

    That might be fun at first, but with each step that the protagonist takes that permanently puts them on a worse path than the reader already found the more frustrating it becomes.

  Rational isn't a genre, it's a style.

  There's a fair amount of stuff that shows up on this forum that's not rational fiction, but more, "People who like rational fiction seem to predictably also enjoy..." That includes LitRPG, Xianxia, stories about planning paying off, stories about progression, and knowingly trope-heavy works. Liking these things isn't going to be 100% true of everyone in the community (e.g. I don't get Xianxia), but we're just using that prediction to make media recommendations, which are already expected to be hit-and-miss.

  I actually think this is a great feature of the community. Having a specific focus and letting people be off topic add breadth and texture to the discussion, but ensures some degree of shared tastes.

  LitRPG as a genre is so flooded with poorly structured stories that it's easy to consider that the definition of the genre - "getting stronger" is a viable substitute for character development, if your book is free and your readers are bored. But it isn't 'genre-adjacent', because rational fiction \*isn't a genre\*, it's a writing style, and one that can be applied in any genre (though some are tougher than others).

  There's also a general conflation of rational writing with *rationlist* writing - munchkinry is a degenerate form of rationalism, and is a \*lot easier\* than writing a truly rationalist character, so it tends to get overrepresented. A \*lot\* of litrpg attempts to be rationalist - the sort of people that want to invent an mmo system are the exact people that are interested in min-maxing a d&d character. Unfortunately, that group is also frequently unaware of the importance of plot and character depth to a story.

  I will eternally recommend Worth the Candle. It’s so good.

    Seconded. WTC is really strong.

    Delve is a work lesser in scope and craft, but still something I find joy in, look forward to every week and check for daily.

  Boring answer is that they both have links to the kind of forum culture on places like spacebattles (see also worm). So have an overlap in fanbase, if not content

  I use rat-adj explicitly where I *don't* think the literature is rational, but might otherwise appeal to that sort of demographic. A rational litRPG is just rational.

  Idk if I'd call litRPG rat-adj, simply because of how much garbage the genre gets, but I agree with others' points that it can be conducive to similar themes.

  Here's the bulleted list from this forum, along with my thoughts about litRPG's correlation.

  * Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  *The word __creative__ is salient. Characters might win solely through grit, but without at least an occasional win using wits, it is very difficult to assign any work into this genre. It's for this reason that Log Horizon with its political interplay is Rational, while Sword Art Online is not.*

  * Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  *This one tends to be a weakness in litRPG. The character goals are nearly always "defeat these monsters" - which can get repetitive. The genre's powers and skills have a decided tendency to be almost entirely combat-related. Subversion of this can make for a great Rational story, but this doesn't happen often.*

  * Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

  *Mother of Learning, a non-litRPG, had an ending that truly embodied this. It's rare in litRPG for there to be happy endings that are earned by great acts of plot engineering.*

  *Even in Rational stories, this tends to be uncommon. The climax in a story usually involves sacrifice, character growth, or something similar. It's really rare outside of detective stories that the resolution is a Rational epiphany.*

  * Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.

  *This is probably the most problematic Rational facet for litRPG. If a character aspires to be more canny, many works will portray the main character bumping up mental stats in order to do so. This can feel unearned, and brings up questions of the characters' agency. When subverted, though, this can be a thrill to read. [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249) plays with this fairly successfully. At one point, a secondary character realizes that she'd gain a mechanical benefit by changing her attitude, and immediately does so, horrifying the main character.*

  * Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

  *This particular facet is pretty common in litRPG. There's some nice world-building around RPG mechanics. [The Wandering Inn](https://www.reddit.com/r/WanderingInn/) is set in a fantasy / medieval world where gender equality exists pretty much universally because class differences vastly overshadow gender differences.*

  Having said all this, I'll add that Rationalism isn't simply binary, nor does it necessarily lead to more enjoyable stories. There are some great litRPG stories out there with very sharp protagonists that simply aren't Rational.

  One final thought for now: this subreddit has moderate traffic, and a number of interesting posts to read, admittedly including material that doesn't come across as wholly Rational. Zealous gatekeeping is to our detriment unless the noise to signal ratio here gets a lot worse.

  Honestly? Probably just because Two-Year Emperor pulled it off and that was early in this subreddit's history.
