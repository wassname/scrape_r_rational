  Could you at least put a summary or reason for why you're recommending this on here?

  Just knowing that there's a summary of "A Practical Guide to Evil" up until this fan work starts would be useful information for people, especially those who haven't read it or have read past it and don't remember the certain situation.

    Oh, I thought one above the fic itself would have sufficed. Reposting it here, I suppose:

    >After the flying fortress of Akua Sahelian was brought down, Catherine gets hit with a mindwhammy that turns her introspectiveness up to 11, and realises just how much she has to change about herself. But will the time be on her side? Three short months remain until the 11th crusade hits Callow, and Heavens are bringing their best game this time.

    A/N this fic has a (relatively) short chapter detailing events of the previous books at the start, to help people who didn't read the original fic somewhat catch up.

  A more sensible Cat who explores her powers more and doesn't immediately write off her alliance with Malicia is intriguing and i'm interested in seeing how the story diverges from canon. I'm looking forward to seeing how this Cat deals with Akua and Black. I suspect the most difficult aspect  of this story will be recreating all the characters distinct voices but I wish you luck. I would suggest that when Cat goes into 'introspective' mode to make sure her internal narrative isn't too clinical and dry in order to help avoid this.

  In regards to plot, if we're holding Catherine to a higher standard in this more cautious and methodical transformation she's undergone then she really should have attempted erecting a scry ward with Winter for the first time when it was just her and Masego rather than in front of a head of state. It would only take a moment and while it's true that if things turned south Masego would have been able to knock her out (which i'll take on faith) it certainly is less than ideal to have to potentially lose control of your faculties and be restrained in front of someone you're about to negotiate with.
