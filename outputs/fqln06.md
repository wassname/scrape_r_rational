## PDF of the Practical Guide to Evil Books available anywhere?

### Post:

I am looking to read PGtoE offline if possible, and therefore would be glad if someone could point me to the works existing in pdf form anywhere.

  Late reply. I made a Python script that scrapes all of the 7 books from WordPress and generates an EPUB file. https://github.com/GabbyNEW/APGtE_Scraper

  No, the author, /u/ErraticErrata, says they basically sink any chance of him getting the book published.

    ```
    When is it getting published?
