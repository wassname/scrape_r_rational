## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have been offered Power by the muse of genre TV. You can pick any power-set that would be narratively coherent for the main character of a genre show. You cant pick an existing one - you have to make one up, but it needs to be something someone would actually make 6 seasons and a movie for. 

  Limits:

  a: "Cost of SFX": If your powerset would be expensive to film, you cant use it very much. Minutes a week. 

  b: "Too OP, nerf": If your powers dissolve plots you will find they mysteriously malfunction every other week. 


  Plot: No matter what you do, you will get in trouble every tuesday. This is not the muse creating trouble, she is merely steering you into trouble that already exists.  - If there is a human trafficking ring within 300 miles of you, *you will* get kidnapped by them sooner rather than later. Pick a vacation spot, you will by coincidence happen upon a nefarious plot to launder cartel money. 

  Random boons : 

  "I can totally afford this loft on a PI salary". Economics can go take a hike - you cant throw money at plot to make it go away, but on the other hand, your bank account mysteriously always has enough cash in it for a nice place, a fast car and eating out every evening. 

  "Everyone on TV is attractive". What is says on the tin. You gain fitness without ever working out, your hair is always stylish, or roguishly messy in a way other people have to pay 200 dollars at the barber for. 

  What powers do you pick to survive this? And no, you cant say no. That just gets you plot without powers.

    The easy answer here would seem to be to pick a power that wouldn't be OP for a character on genre TV to have because they would use it in a really stupid way or have moral compunctions about fully utilizing it. 

    The most obvious example of this then would be high end psychic powers, since they are absurdly versatile and their full mind control abilities basically never get used by heroes with them. So since the muse only steers you into _preexisting_ conflicts, you can "win" by just taking control of the world and creating a utopia. Plus even if the powers "OP rating" is based on how you use them _rather_ than how most protagonists would use them. You can still win by taking control of the world (and rewriting people's minds so they are loyal even without direct mind control) within a week.

    Another obvious exploit would be something like AGI, absurdly advanced nanotech or genetics tech. All of those could easily gain cement control of the world within a week. Of course Veedrac already mentioned FAI but I would obviously point out that there's nothing in the actual original comment to indicate that would fail, you need to make a lot of assumptions beyond what in that comment to get the kinds of results talked about in the rest of that comment chain.

    I would also point out preemptively that creating FAI is not really beyond the realm of a genre TV character (friendly human level AI is super common therein) all you need to do from there is get the FAI to use it's super fast genius mind to do recursive self improvement.

    I want the power to fork and re-merge. Basically I can split into up to sixteen copies that can later merge with each other to combine knowledge, experiences, and physical states. Re-merging heals but they can't split again for a few minutes.

    Easy to film, powerful, but not so powerful it'd be boring.

    My first thought is to go for the ability to see twenty-four hours into the future, but in such a way that the vision can be changed - that is, the ability shows me what would have happened had I not used the ability. Dead easy SFX cost, and I get forewarning about disaster(s).

    The second power I'd ask for is the ability to see what people are thinking - in effect, read-only psychic powers, which only work either when I want them two or when Plot needs them to work. Again, easy on the SFX, and tends to lead to more Plot rather than less.

    Between them, these powers will tend to give me useful information about what's going on - so I can make informed decisions about how to handle my Tuesday Troubles.

    I also intend to keep the local police on speed-dial, and make sure that there is at least one person who will call for a rescue for me if I don't check in every two or three hours on a Tuesday. This won't dissolve plots *entirely*, but it will help me avoid certain uncomfortable situations.

  You are a god. Your power is unchallengeable, your might undefeatable. Well it was. You are a god of the void. Before you created the world, you were omnipotent, but now ... well there is much you are incapable of without destroying the universe. In fact you possess power mostly over the soul within your creation as it bears the touch of the void to permit creativity. You are still all knowing  about basic details about the universe but free will prevents you from knowing everything. Through you have a pretty good guess. Your powers permit you to link you anyone who requests help from a outside entity, especially you. This link lets you grant inner strength and guilt their conscience. However you cannot pass on knowledge as the link is too imprecise. Someone could potentially have you guide their hand and then apply statistical analysis to the results but that's not really very practical. As a extension of this, You can freely talk to designated prophets who require a strong desire to receive guidance and a certain mindset. they come along every few generations and while you may not talk to them, you can't just randomly choose anyone. This is merely talking to the prophet and you cannot control them. You may instruct them to write you a holy book but for instance you cannot tell them to write down the equations for a theory of everything as it would require to many mathematical symbols and even writing that down would be beyond a lay persons grasp. Unless they are a physicist. Specifically to a prophet you may pass any information that would be understandable by the prophet.   You can also decide where soul go after death. Now under these constraints how would you become worshiped by people worldwide and help people thrive.
   Note: This was conceived of by considering the solution to the problem of evil that God is not omnipotent. The thing is it's possible to have a being worthy of being a god who is far from omnipotent .
  Further Note: Human beings make things up. Other religions do exist, but have no basis in truth. You may answer prayers from followers of other religions but it will make it hard to get worshiped. 
  Further Further Note: Your holy book can be corrupted and you can do nothing except tell a prophet to fix it.     

   Edit Simplified version with no story details 

  You are God

  You created the universe

  You wish to be worshiped by and help the people of the universe 

  You possess the following basic powers:

  1: You possess knowledge of all the facts of creation but free will can still trip you up ie If someone plots a murder, you know but whether they will go through with it is only a guess.

   2: You may answer prayers of any religion by granting inner strength or guiding the hand of the individual praying to you. This cannot pass knowledge on, except maybe by statistical analysis.

  3: A prophet comes along every few generations and you may freely talk to them. You may pass any information you wish onto them, but if it's beyond their understanding, it will not mean anything. For instance, to write down the theory of everything it beyond the average person as its written in the language of very complicated maths.

  Other religions exist but are made up by humans with no basis in fact

  Your holy book can be corrupted. The only thing you can do about this is send a prophet to correct it.    

  Does that fix your complain. I have never used paragraphs particularly well

    You really need to edit your comment, it is seriously difficult to read both due to the way it's written and the fact it's just one massive block of text.

    You have two main objectives. 

    One, you need people to recognize your true prophet from false ones. Presumably when you say 'void' this includes space, so you would simply move the stars to spell their name. Depending what you can do with souls, then it might be in your interest to boost your prophet in whichever way you can, of course with the threat of taking their power away if they misbehave. 

    If that doesn't work you feed your prophet a bunch of information he couldn't possibly have, such as historical knowledge that can be verified. If THAT doesn't work you'll have to start a new religion, starting by having your prophet recruit from vulnerable people, such as people who recently lost a loved one or who are having an existential crisis.

    Two, you want to increase the number of prophets. Through your now recognized prophet you change your religion, such that it has 'that certain mindset' and 'seeking guidance from the divine' as the foremost virtues. Further you establish a weekly school session in which your prophet ~~indoctrinates~~ teaches the younger crowd how to exhibit those two virtues.

    Once you have found the right way of cultivating that particular mindset everything afterwards will be childs play. You want at least three prophets per generation. If anyone are threatening your religion you can just destroy them with the most recent technology, which you prophets know because you know. 

    If you're having trouble communicating specific technical things to your prophets you send them off to grad school with the money they earn from the lottery/stocks/who wants to be a bilionnaire.

    How does "free will " exatly work?
    Like to what extent knowing how the brain of a person works allows you to more or less know what they will do.

    Like I'm not sure if there is a coherent way to do free will that's not people randomly doing things sometimes, or having a true rng in their brain that doesnt normally affect things munch but make things a bit unpredictable(but household still be able to predict most of someone's actions ,or otherwise  people and society would work really  differently.

    But anyway you should tell your profets what you can do and what you want from humanity, no need to be deceitful or ambiguous  about it, and encourage studying math and science,and to teach this kind of thing to everyone, and give them some ay of recognizing new profets(there are multiple ways to do this like giving them an encrypted message that can be decripted by a public key, and a lot of posible verification methods, you just need to find one that people can easily verify  ), also there are lots of  ways of protecting your messages to becoming corrupted .

    You will start teaching profets progressively more complex math and science , and If you can comunicate it directly you can just send them as signals of certain concepts that are decoded as the message in some code, I'm not sure how the can't send things they won't understand  rule actually works .
    Also you can  use the code thing to send messages to people that pray to you , by sending them feedback in intervals when they pray, in a way you said  to your prophet.

    You can shape the beliefs of your people by encouraging the ones you approve of during prayer .
    Also give people an easy and short method of prayer that is easily done multiple times to maximize bandwidth .
    Instructions on how to get to the frame of mind to become a prophet and how to recognize one will be in all your messages.
    Prophets should be able to get a lot of money and Influence thanks to you which should help the cause , and of their ability of convincing people.
    Once people have enough tech and math  you can instruct them to create better systems of transmission and verification of messages from you , especially with the help of computers.

  You are given three wishes by a genie. You must present all three wishes to the genie at the same time.

  The genie will randomly select one wish to be the exact opposite of what you ask for, and grant all three at the same time.

  How would you acheive the best outcome for yourself?
  ```

  - u/GemOfEvan:
    ```
    Assuming that's all the finaglery the genie will do:

    1. I wish to gain 100 regular wishes.

    2. I wish to gain 100 regular wishes.

    3. I wish to gain 100 regular wishes.

    If, in addition to the terms, the genie is a stereotypical one, then you've already lost.

    Wish for the same thing three times, the reversed one cancels one of the normal ones (if you've designed them properly) and one of the normal ones survive.  You now get one normal wish (with some restrictions):

    1. Come up with one single wish that is designed to be

    a) finite and stackable, something like "1 trillion dollars" or "+1,000,000 years to your or every human's standard lifespan", or "the probability of cancer occurring to each cell is multiplied by 0.000000001%"  Avoid absolutes like "cancer never occurs"  I don't know what would happen when you reverse that, and the math in step 2 won't necessarily work out.  But if you use some ridiculously large or tiny numbers using mathematical notation you can make things effectively infinite or zero, which should be just as good.

    b) Incorruptible.  Use standard genie defense techniques, word everything carefully, depending on how literal this genie is.  Maybe instead of wishing for money, which might hyper-inflate the economy, ask for some sort of goods that can be sold and add value to the economy.

    2 . Wish for the same thing three times.  So long as the reversing stacks mathematically and does cancel one of the others, you now have a normal wish that successfully got through.

      I love that there are standard genie defence techniques. Like this is a thing that happens regularly.

        Well to be fair some genie defence techniques are useful as a way of practicing thinking about GAI.
