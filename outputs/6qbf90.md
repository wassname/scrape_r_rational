## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  This is less munchkinry and more a question of optimization; hopefully that's okay.

  * Bulk goods can be teleported pretty freely and can be considered irrelevant for the purposes of this prompt.
  * *People* can only be teleported through the use of teleportation keys, of which about 1000 exist; roughly 100 are controlled by your kingdom. It is impossible to make more.
  * The teleportation key allows up to five people to teleport to a given location, taking the teleportation key with them, along with whatever they're carrying (but again, bulk goods can be teleported more or less freely, so that's not really a boon).
  * The refresh timer on the teleportation key is two hours.

  You are the Minister of Teleportation and part of your remit is reforming the teleportation key allocation system (TKAS) in order to A) maximize throughput, B) ensure allocation is "fair", and C) ensure that the TKAS is responsive to e.g. national emergencies, urgent diplomatic missions, etc.

  Here's what I have so far:

  1. The primary goal of the new TKAS is that all teleportation keys are used whenever their two-hour limit is up.
  2. The secondary goal of the new TKAS is that every single use of a key will teleport the maximum of five people.
  3. Teleportations primarily happen to and from "hot-spots" where there are lots of people wanting to teleport both in *and* out, because otherwise there's underutilization on one side.
  4. Teleportations primarily happen to and from guarded locations where personnel will immediately take control of the teleportation key and ensure that it's safely back in the TKAS.
  5. Actual allocation is probably best done through a market system which takes into account the necessity for a return trip (i.e. a key needs to make money going both directions).

  It's *almost* but not quite the same problem as organizing airline flights, where you want to keep airplanes in the air as much as possible in order to maximize profit from each individual airplane, but I think for airplanes it might be more a matter of profit per flight mile (because airplanes suffer from wear-and-tear, so continually keeping the airplane in the air isn't efficient if they're not making a certain amount of money per trip).
  ```

  - u/Elec0:
    ```
    Really this sounds like an algorithm problem, similar to the basic airplane scheduling one you mentioned.
    ```

  - u/Laborbuch:
    ```
    There will be a significant interest in the number of keys in the market, as a measure for the kingdom’s power in relation to other kingdoms’ powers. If the total number on the local market are known, that allows one make guesses and judgement about the kingdom’s power.

    This has knock-on effects on the intelligence levels. You will have arguments for not utilising all keys all the time. If you underreport, the kingdom appears weaker than it is. This might help to avoid the baleful gaze of other, bigger kingdoms, or induce a smaller kingdom to attack a kingdom they deem less powerful than it actually is.

    If you go with eternal-potato’s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6qbf90/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dkwfiz4/), then the TC would be a prime target for all kinds of espionage and counter-espionage actions.

    Lastly, I fully expect there to be a national strategic reserve, and a an unreported reserve for clandestine purposes. The sizes may vary depending on importance.

    PS: I very much enjoy your story. *thumbs up*

    This probably isn't what you're looking for, but since there are 900 more keys for you to conquer....

    Step 1) Arm a group of 5 people with all kinds of bombs.

    Step 2) Teleport group to some foreign key.

    Step 3) Bombs detonate, everyone around your key and the foreign key is dead.

    Step 4) Using another key, teleport another 5 people to the same spot, and now collect the two keys and return home with all 3 keys, gaining a net bonus of +1 key. 

    Step 5) Repeat until you have all 1000 keys.
    ```

    - u/eternal-potato:
      ```
      Both keys are destroyed at step 3.
      ```

      - u/buckykat:
        ```
        So make it sarin or something instead of bombs, whatever.
        ```

    - u/zarraha:
      ```
      Can keys be carried as cargo without being activated?  If so you could use a third friendly key to avoid suiciding your own people:

      Step 1) Arm a group of 5 people with all kinds of bombs and two teleport keys.

      Step 2) Teleport group with bombs to some foreign key using Key 1.

      Step 3) Teleport group home with key 2, taking key 1 as cargo and leaving bombs behind.

      Step 4) Bombs detonate, everyone around foreign key is dead.

      Step 5) Using  key 3, teleport another 5 people to the same spot, and now collect the foreign keys and return home using it (or a fourth friendly key if you don't know if theirs is on cooldown), gaining a net bonus of +1 key.

      Step 6) Repeat until you have all 1000 keys. 

      Of course, the plan is countered by keeping key locations top secret at all times, or at least vague enough that enemies can't teleport directly on top of them.

    Can I carry a second teleportation key with me as I go somewhere?
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Yes, you can.
      ```

  - u/eternal-potato:
    ```
    Can teleportation key itself be teleported via 'free' inorganic goods teleportation?
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Yes, but ...

      Free is stretching it. The real-world equivalent would be containerized cargo shipping, which makes cargo transport cheap enough that you can move tonnes of materials without really having to think that much about the costs involved. Moving an *individual* item like a teleportation key through that method would be incredibly costly, but you could maybe send teleportation keys through the cargo service as riders on other shipments, at the not-insignificant cost of making the personnel transport interconnected with cargo transport (i.e. having them be co-located, delaying cargo transport to have teleportation move in synchronization with key countdowns).
      ```

  - u/buckykat:
    ```
    Throughput is uselessly small for a nation-state scale public transportation use. Goals A and B are wishful thinking until and unless you can mass produce keys. So it falls to goal C, teleport keys are a strategic asset, held ready for emergencies or used for infiltration/exfiltration.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    For commercial purposes, keys will only go either point to point in the kingdom or to allied nations. The landing port for each key will be a heavily fortified area set up like an embassy: considered sovereign territory of the nation porting in. This reduces the likelihood of a host nation attempting to steal a key from a landing point, as that constitutes a declaration of war.

    Some percentage of keys must be kept by the military for their operations. Some military keys will be used the same as commercial keys to ferry troops and materiél around, while one will be kept unused in a bunker. In the immediate vicinity of the bunker key is tons and tons of explosives, enough to obliterate the largest city in the world. If a war gets dire enough, the invading nation's largest city or cities die.

    I think you don't give a key to the sovereign. Other legal measures will be in place which will force the sovereign to set up strong institutions capable of weathering the death of the executive, so their ability to escape from any situation into the most fortified bunker in the land instantly is simply less important than keeping that key in active use.

    Can you send teleportation keys using the bulk teleportation method?

    What stops terrorists from, I don't know, teleporting a sponge where that supporting pillar used to be, or teleporting a bomb into Congress, or any number of other things that make it so anyone with some ressources can build a Death Note that needs a location instead of a name?

      Whoa there, are you trying to butt in on the Minster of Defense? You were assigned the task of reforming the teleportation key allocation system and now I see you surrounded by anti-terrorism white papers and theoretical physics texts?

      There are non-intersection rules governing teleportation; it doesn't work if you're trying to teleport into a density greater than 2kg/m^3 which is about twice the density of air. In other words, a light rain at the destination will stop teleportation from working, let alone a stone pillar.

      There are also wards to stop people from teleporting things into a given location, and these are their own problem, since a covert agent could sneak into your airport-equivalent and place them in order to halt all teleportation, but they're fairly easy to find and defuse, and they usually expose the perpetrators meaning that they're not a reliable method of teleportation denial unless you control the physical location. But counter-terrorism falls under the control of the Minister of Defense, and isn't part of your job, except insofar as you have to liaise with the Defense Ministry to coordinate personnel, screening systems, key requisitions for special troop transport, et cetera.

  You wake up in the Coruscant Underworld (from Star Wars) in the year 26 BBY (four years before the Clone Wars) with nothing but the clothes on your back. You are Force-sensitive, but don't know it (yet).

  Your goal is to take over the galaxy - not the entire galaxy, mind you, I'm not including Wild Space or the Unknown Regions. You also don't need to be an absolute dictator, either.

  How do you do this?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    What do I know, then? Am I a self-insert that was given your prompt without "You are Force-sensitive, but don't know it (yet).", that might eventually discover that he's Force-sensitive?
    ```

    - u/addemup9001:
      ```
      Yes, you are.
      ```

      - u/buckykat:
        ```
        Do we know the war is coming, or do we have to guess that ourselves? Either way, the broad plan looks kinda like, "leave, then fire a relativistic kill vehicle at, Coruscant."
        ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Step 1) Steal the cloning device.

    Step 2) Mass produce clones of myself.

    Step 3) Use clones to colonize some distant planets no one knows about.

    Step 4) Begin horrible mad scientist experiments, using clones as fodder. 

    Side Note: I am not willing to undergo or perform horrible experiments, but then again, I'm also not willing to take over the galaxy. So I assume that when you say my goal "is to take over the galaxy", that goal overwrites my utility function, and so me and my clones would gladly kill/torture themselves and destroy everything they love for the fulfillment of that goal.

    Side Note 2: These experiments will almost certainly discover that I'm force sensitive, even if I'm not looking for that specifically. Not that I would really use the force, but I suppose it might help to do more experiments. Being able to move things without touching them certainly seems useful for making various control groups and experimenting in environments too hostile for my life.

    Side Note 3: The fact that all my clones are single-mindedly pursuing scientific advancement at all costs, and that I'm a pretty good scientist, odds are high that I would gain technological supremacy over all other life in the galaxy.

    Step 5) Use my newfound technological supremacy to take over the galaxy by force. My preferred tactic would be playing billiards with stars. 

    Fun fact: when some stars supernova and turn themselves into neutron stars, they can also fire themselves off at super high speeds in some direction. 

    Fun fact 2: If a neutron star is coming your way, you either get out of the way or die. You cannot divert it, it has too much momentum for any kind of nukes to mean anything. You could fling entire planets into it and it would probably just continue moving along the same path. You cannot block it, because it just absorbs whatever is in the way and continues. You cannot survive it, because it's gravitational strength is powerful enough to spaghettify you (stretch your body until it breaks apart) and everything around you. 

    I would experiment to figure out how to aim these neutron stars (which is probably doable at the moment just before they become neutron stars), and then aim them at enemy planetary systems. They will either die or become homeless vagrants, desperately fleeing their home planets with barely anything, doomed to wander about in deep space as I continue to destroy every planetary system around them that they might colonize.

    Well goal one needs to be to get the fuck out of the Coruscant Underworld, that place is scary as hell. Now, unless we've got plot armor (which I guess might more or less be the case, depending on just how much latent force potential we've been given), success at this stage is actually far from certain. 

    Corcuscant's underbelly is basically a death world, and it's not exactly easy to escape from the ghettos down there even if you're a native (otherwise no one would be living down there in the first place). And we're definitely no native. Like, I think you may be underestimating the difficulty of just surviving from your specified start point. This is thousands upon thousands of years of just building on top of the remains of old buildings, full of all sort of nasty wildlife, often dangerous discarded technology, criminals looking to hide and the truly desperate and destitute pushed out of the over-city. On top of that, even the most obsessive Star Wars fan is going to have less practical, day to day knowledge of basic science, technology and everyday life stuff than the local equivalent of a fresh Highschool graduate. Also, there's no guarantee that we'd even be able to *talk* to anyone out the gate. Basic may not be the same as English, and even if it is there's all sorts of other languages spoken by specific groups and species that no one from Earth would know so much as a single word of. 

    But, let's just assume we get past all that without getting eaten by ROUS or shivved by gangers or getting crushed by some crumbling bit of architecture that's been abandoned for longer than the history of agriculture back here on Earth. What then? 

    Well, with only 4 years of lead time, there's no way we're stopping the Clone Wars from starting, and sticking our nose in it is a good way to come to ol' Sheev's attention, which has 'bad end' written all over it it big flashing letters. 

    Probably the best bet mid term is to find some way off Coruscant, and once it becomes clear that we have the force, to seek out tutelage in itone way or another. We're obviously too old for the Jedi of this era (and honestly aren't the best place to start for this whole 'galactic conquest' thing even if they would train us), and like I said before, coming to Sheev's attention would be no bueno. So, Holocrons? One of the various groups of force users out there? Probably won't be able to afford to be picky, at least not at first, but given our near-total lack of starting assets and the scope of our goals, we'll need grab anything we can with both hands. 

    Obviously the exact details would depend heavily on how things play out, but there's lots of little enclaves of force users with their own tricks and specialties scattered around, so my first thought is to go around picking up as much as we can from all of them, aiming to pick up as many 'one-trick-pony' sorts of abilities as possible and seeing what synergizes into something really broken. The end game would be founding our own order of some sort, building it up in the shadows until we can step into the limelight at some pivotal point and set ourselves up as something along the lines of the Jedi Lords of old, with me as the head honcho, of course. 

    I'd talk about picking up stuff like the Katana Fleet or seeking out specific groups for training, but realistically, given zero time for research before being dropped over there, finding anything specific would mostly come down to trusting the Force (and sheer dumb-luck) anyway, so super specific goals and objectives don't really make sense here, to my mind.  

    EDIT: 
    There are a number of things that are done strangely and seemingly illogically in Star Wars that people like to talk about leveraging and exploiting in these sorts of scenarios. The big ones that come to mind for me are computers (basically anything to do with them) and the way battles are fought is space. Now, it's easy to sit here in the real world and just go with the Doylist explanation (a combination of ignorance and stylistic/plot reasons on the writer's part) but that obviously doesn't work once you're actually in the setting. So you need to shift to thinking of Watsonian reasons why so many things are done in ways that seem sub-optimal, especially when we're talking about a technological society that's got records going back tens of thousands of years. 

    The obvious ones to me are:

    A) Cultural. That's just how things are done, and it's how things have been for so long that no one would even think to suggest doing it any differently. There are enough examples like this in real life history that I wouldn't find it implausible at all for any number of issues to fall under this one. 

    B) There are additional factors at play that make the strange things more sensible (one theory I've heard brought up before is that computers and IT are so dismal (and for why you see stuff like soldiers sitting and manually operating gun-emplacements on frickin space ships) is because a number of droid rebellions happened over the years and the galaxy at large decided to make like the Colonials from nBSG and make their computers 'too dumb' to hack). 

    C) Things don't actually work exactly the way they're shown in the movies. They're obviously not meant to be serious, factual, historical documentaries, so maybe sticking too slavishly to every detail as presented would be like watching a bunch of WWII movies and then getting dropped into the battle of Stalingrad. 

    So yeah, it's entirely possible that someone with a basic understanding of modern technology(or military tactics or whatever) could revolutionize the galaxy by 'inventing' smart phones or telling fighter pilots 'hey, have you tried *not* having WWII style dog-fights and actually taking advantage of being in zero-g/the vacuum of space?', but I feel like counting on being able to do shit like that is a good way to get burned when you find out that there's damn good reasons why people weren't already doing it. You can't just assume the entire galaxy has been holding idiot balls for the past twenty-five thousand years.
