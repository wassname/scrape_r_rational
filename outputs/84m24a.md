## Anyone else loves Greg Egan? What do you think is his best work?

### Post:

I stumbled upon Greg Egan's "Orthogonal" series some time ago and I must say I was absolutely stunned that something so specifically tailored to my tastes even existed. I don't even know how it feels to read that if you're not into physics (I have a PhD and still had to do multiple takes on some of the most convoluted passages) but *damn*, the entire fictional science system he developed is so good. I read "Zendegi" afterwards, which is a very interesting and realistic take on a possible road from machine learning to mind uploading - I could at any point believe this would actually be somewhat feasible in 20 or 30 years from now. I would like to read something else from him I guess, but as it often happens with writers I love, I also tend to sort of avoid binging all of them because I don't want it to be over so quick and then having to wait for their next published book!

Any suggestions about him? What are your favourite works of his?

  His best books for me are _Schild's Ladder_ and _Diaspora_. The first chapter of _Diaspora_ was originally published as a short story and is available online as ["Orphanogenesis"](http://www.gregegan.net/DIASPORA/01/Orphanogenesis.html).

  I would be careful about _Distress_, the first chapter was really disturbing and it doesn't lighten up all that much. It's really good, just, pushes boundaries about personhood and bodily integrity. And of course has an underpinning of weird physics, like always...

  _Quarantine_ - there's like three or four stories in this one, all entangled together. The primary arc really plays wicked games with the Copenhagen Interpretation, taking it way literally.

  ["Riding the Crocodile"](http://www.gregegan.net/INCANDESCENCE/00/Crocodile.html) and _Incandescence_ take us to a galaxy that's as far beyond the world of _Schild's Ladder_ as they are beyond us, but where people are still people no matter how much of what defines us has become optional.

  ["Dust"](https://archive.org/stream/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07_djvu.txt) and _Permutation City_ combine strange physics and strange computational neurology in odd ways. A large part of the story involves an experiment that Egan later decided was horribly unethical, and he returns to it with a whole different viewpoint in ["Crystal Nights"](http://ttapress.com/553/crystal-nights-by-greg-egan/).

    I must say though, the man is an amazing writer, but not the best web designer XD. That site looks like it's straight out of the 90s.

      I disagree ... it's a great website.

      There's like two embedded files per page, one CSS, one JS, that's it. It's all in plain HTML, and can be trivially converted to plain text. It's practically the Platonic Ideal of what a website should be.

      The only thing I would change is the light purple background on Orphanogenesis, it gives me a bit of fuchsia shock.

        Yeah, it's the design mostly. I don't have a problem with pure or minimalistic HTML. A lot of modern sites have bells and whistles, but I think simple is fine. Still, design isn't just about being pretty, it's also about readability, which is a practical need. As you mentioned, some colour schemes are horrible. Ditch the animated cubes in primary colours please. The font could be picked better, and there could just be more free space here and there. Just by organising the page better, giving the text a bit more breathing space, and picking a better colour scheme (all doable with very basic CSS), I think it'd improve by leaps and bounds.
        ```

          Well, hmmm...

          1. Those are peccadilloes compared to the average WordPress mess.
          2. Didn't expect my comment to turn into a tutorial about mobile website development. :)
          3. I'm actually fine with the color scheme, the last line was a joke.
          ```

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            Well, yeah, this is going pretty OT I guess XD.

            Dunno, I understand why when looking *under* the hood a lot of this stuff can be horrifying - personally every time I try to get into the more modern trends in web development I feel like screaming considering how much shit people pile on top of each other (often writing pseudo-code that then gets compiled three or four times before becoming the final JS, complete madness). But with stuff like simple sites and blogs, default templates provided by things like WordPress are *the one* thing I really appreciate. Spaced text, good font choices, sensible colour schemes. I mean, even something like Reddit is very simplistic in look but also very clear and readable. That site to me isn't very much.

            Of course it's a matter of taste, still, I think one can conjugate simplicity and looks without falling into the trap of "just another library!" that web developers often seem victim of.

        > It doesn't try to be a mobile app

        I've designed my girlfriend's professional site and keep track of it with Google Analytics, and I can tell you, *a lot* of people visits it by smartphone. Many more than do by PC. The audience here may be different of course, but I don't think mobile readability is a bad thing. Of course I'm not saying to use Bootstrap or some other sophisticated framework, if you keep the content simple (just text and images, basically) you can do that with pure CSS these days. In fact most sites will simply work well in mobile anyway if you don't go wild with content and formatting.

        > doesn't have a ton of java scripts

        You can make a much better looking site with absolutely zero JS. Only HTML+CSS. JS is unnecessary altogether if you don't want any interactivity or some fancy resizing options.

        I was talking about template, font and colour schemes, mostly. I'm not saying a good site needs to push cookies or have some super-hi-res hero banner that takes 5 seconds to load or some WebGL effect constantly playing while you visit it. That'll go down in history as the most annoying aspect of 2010s web design, like MIDI tunes that play automatically are for 1990s one.

        I don't think it's a bad thing that websites *can* be applications. Sometimes you need them to be. They shouldn't add more complexity when it's not needed though.

    > This man redefined what hard science fiction can mean.

    Truly. I went into Poul Anderson's "Tau Zero" hearing from everyone how it was hard sci-fi and stuff, then rolled my eyes multiple times at the blatant nonsense that happens in that book (despite it being often entertaining nonsense).  
    Then I went into Egan's works and I realised if I wanted to pick anything he said apart I needed to sit down with a few textbooks, a computer and a stack of paper.
    ```

  ```
  Quarantine and Permutation City.  His later works kinda went anti-emotional and/or ran out of truly relevant interesting premises.  Quarantine has no anti-humanism/hope/light, Permutation City has some but a powerful enough premise to make up for it and become one of the great peaks of SF, and then it starts heading downhill.  "Could not cast a Patronus" summarizes a lot of the issue.  Similar progression to Iain Banks; if you can still like _Excession_ you'll like late Egan too.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Just to make it clear, you feel like he got too pessimistic/dark for your tastes, basically? "Orthogonal" struck me as fundamentally optimistic. There's a lot of bad shit but ultimately there's also trust in the ability to make things better, and the epilogue always makes me grin ear to ear.
    ```

  - u/AndrasKovacs:
    ```
    I agree, and while I generally enjoy humanistic works the most, I can also enjoy classic nihilistic Egan, in a different manner.

    I don't like Orthogonal though, because it has too much physics with too thin characters, at least for a non-physicist reader, and its alien social narrative is profoundly unimaginative: aliens progress towards human 20th century liberalism. Along with Egan's rejection of superhuman intelligence this is too parochial for my tastes.

  Personally, I must disagree with the sentiments people are expressing. So far I find Egan’s books to be... hollow. Lacking a soul. I’ve only read Permutation City and Diaspora, and although they were great bingeable hard sci-fi, the characters were morally empty. Where’s the virtue? Where’s the eudaimonia? Where’s the humanism? Instead, everything is reduced to a checklist of meaningless hedonic experiences. Even the characters find the world soul-crushing: there is a disturbing trend of characters copying themselves and the copies committing suicide (this happens in *both* Permutation City and Diaspora!).

  Reading Egan books is both extremely fun and extremely draining. I’m drawn in by the hard sci-fi, but afterward I’m mildly depressed and need a drink.

    I haven't read either of those. What I can say about the two (well, four, as Orthogonal is a trilogy) I *have* read:

    - in Zendegi, the story is very human, but it does indeed feature a situation similar to what you describe, of a character being sort-of copied and that ending not too well. He's not a great writer of characters, mind you - a lot of feelings are conveyed in really unsubtle manner. Still, I found the topic of that book - a man coping with the death of his wife and his own impending demise, and the wish to leave a trace of himself through his son - to be extremely human.

    - Orthogonal features absolutely non-human characters, but is also the one that perhaps gave me the strongest emotions, mostly towards the women, who in this world undergo the horrifying fate of being able to reproduce only by dying (as they basically undergo mitosis). Again, the individual characters are perhaps relatively simple, but the overall portrayal of the emotions and social consequences of this mechanic is very vivid and believable.

    I think in general Egan is a writer that shines when talking about science and society, and less about individuals. I think that's fine, not everyone can be talented at everything, and in fact I'd say that's a common thing among sci-fi authors. In fact at least his social analysis tends to be much more deep and thought out than what some others do. His characters are, mostly, means to an end - the end being advancing a plot that communicates its themes through collective, rather than individual, action. But he's surely no poet, yeah. His prose too is rather dry and, in itself, unremarkable.
    ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    If you want to be really depressed, try _Distress_.

    In Permutation City, Paul Durham's copy tried to commit suicide but failed, and he had a good reason for trying... and Peer's original is the one who shut itself down after he learned that Kate left him. Thomas Reimann rewrote himself and his whole universe by rerunning his defining moment over and over again until he made the "right" decision... that can be seen as somewhat self-centered but on the other hand he did save his lover's life in the end.

    In Diaspora, are you talking about Orlando's five-dimensional version? Or the final version of Orlando alone with Yatima?

  I only read "Permutation City", and it was very good, even though I don't usually enjoy very abstract sci-fi (and this book becomes VERY abstract indeed). I still (years later) sometimes think about the ideas from that book. I've tried something else by Greg, don't remember what it was, but I just couldn't keep reading because of the level of abstraction and the density of the ideas. I usually skip a lot of filler in the books I read, and with Egan's books you can't do that, or you don't know what half the words even mean.

  His style reminds me a lot of Jacek Dukaj (only "The Old Axolotl" was translated to English, haven't read that one, but "Ice" and "Black Oceans" by him are very good).

    I second Permutation City. One of the most mind blowing books ever. Teranesia comes a close second (almost as mind blowing). Surprised no one has mentioned it.
    Also, [TAP](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/tap.htm) is a great short story.

  PERMUTATION MOTHERFUCKING CITY, AWW YEAAAH

  :ahem: Sorry, I really love that book.

  edit: For those who have read it and want _more_, did you know there's a Permutation City fanfic by [our esteemed leader himself](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover)? Manages the rare feat of taking a Greg Egan book and making way more physical sense than the original.

  edit: While being a mass fanfic crossover! Not since Blindsight has nonsense made _this much sense_.

  I've only read Diaspora. His vision of the far future, as well as the ending, is very melancholy.

- u/paroxysms:
  ```
  My favorite is Disapora. It reads more like paper outlining different possible futures for humans than a proper narrative. However, I really enjoyed it, in particular the birth of sentience in part one. 
  My next favorite is Permutation city, followed closely by Distress. The Orthogonal series had too much physics for me to handle and not enough narrative to compensate.
