  Well, two out of two for the "A children wins when they actually input what they like best" theory. The actual implementation of that scheme would require a full database about the likes of every children in the world, which would create a 'Likes Best' entry for that children. Those whose input matches that entry wins a ticket. And actually liking something best is harder than it seems.

  And now I guess that the next episode will feature the chatters trying to use this strategy, and failing.

    It could be literally "what you like *best*", what you like *more than anyone else on the planet*.
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      yeah this rings the most true of anything I've seen, and would limit the possible winners sufficiently to create this scenario.
      ```

      this is a great answer and i hope it's right

      What if you like pencil collecting more than anyone else on the planet, but nevertheless personally prefer pen collecting, but you like that less than someone else?
      ```

      - u/appropriate-username:
        ```
        Unless you follow the above logic and put in pencil collecting, you're unlikely to win the ticket if the above logic is how it works.

      Can't wait for the person who likes hentai best
      ```

      - u/mbzrl:
        ```
        That person is probably not a child, though that raises a question if it'd be "likes best among eligible applicants"
        ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          That's probably true but then you could say that for a lot of concepts. If vaping and appreciation of absence (or whatever nothing is meant to represent) are able to be 'liked best' by teenagers then hentai is probably going to benefit from the same hormone fuelled passion.

          Also surely so many narcissists would be the best person at liking themselves and would definitely type themselves
          ```

          - u/mbzrl:
            ```
            Yeah I'm with you, I think "being able to be liked best by" is different from "more likely to be liked best by" though. I think the answer, for this premise, is that the child who likes cigars best among children would not be granted a golden ticket if there are any adults who like cigars more.

            That point about narcissists is a good counterexample, makes me think "what you like more than anyone else on the planet" can't be the answer. Lots of options for likes that are too personal for it to be applicable to any competitors
            ```

    I think it's probably better to model Wonka-tech as a sort of candy-coated cthonic horror than as a rational process.

  - u/IV-TheEmperor:

    It could also mean the puzzle is rigged for specific children.

  - u/GopherAtl:
    ```
    Still think it's going to be putting what they like best in *themselves,* presumably while staring at the entry page.

      Yeah. He likes emptiness and incompleteness. An empry input Is literally everyone's first guess for what won him the ticket.

  Almost-President's section reminds me one problem I had with very similar story. That is, the weirdness and uniqueness go a little overboard and it feels kinda 'le random'. Though it could also be those parts are referencing the source material. I'm not really familiar with the Wonkalore. ^(I do have some guess about why the Department of Anti-Astronomy: We Really Hate Stars and Related Things exists though)
  ```

  - u/general_enthusiast:
    ```
    It makes a lot more sense if you've read The Witches, suggesting this is a more general Dahlverse. The Anti-astronomy department I couldn't place as a specific reference, and probably isn't intended as one: I suspect we have similar theories on that one.
    ```

    - u/meterion:
      ```
      Ian Gitax figured it out on the WtC discord. Anti-Astronomy and the slashed space program are things because of [Vermicious Knids](https://roalddahl.fandom.com/wiki/Vermicious_Knids). An extinction-level threat in space held at bay only because they are incapable of entering the atmosphere without burning up or manipulating tools to create shields to do so. /u/IV-TheEmperor ping for you too.
      ```

      - u/WalterTFD:
        ```
        Long, long after I forgot everything else about those books I remembered the Vermicious Knids, spelling out messages of doom.  Gave me nightmares when I was a kid.
        ```

      - u/general_enthusiast:
        ```
        Of course, I'd completely forgotten about those! Horrifying as they are that's almost a relief, since it could equally have been going in a more simulationist direction (where only the world is modelled in detail, and people aren't supposed to know). 

        That's not a bad plot in itself, of course, but there's a definite appeal to a setting having complex and strange rules that can't be explained in a sentence, such as 'this whole time the Dahl books were a simulation'. It's also suited more to plots about life outside the simulation or a individual character's journey, and there's too much of an ensemble cast for that to feel like the case here.
        ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      It makes a tiny bit more sense if you've read the witches, but no where near actual sense.  that whole sequence was somewhere between Douglas Adams and Salvador Dali...Roald Dahli?
      ```

      - u/general_enthusiast:
        ```
        I suppose the part I was trying to answer was whether the events were included just to be 'le random'. While the actual plot of The Witches isn't something that tells us what's going to happen, it explains some basic motivations (witches are cruel, may have specifically planned to get these children, and may scheme towards grand strategies such as electing a figurehead for some purpose) and gives a precedent to some abilities (i.e. the feel of the magic in The Witches matches what was possible here).

        It's a definite dream sequence of events, but it seems likely to follow an internal logic through the story as we learn more about them, in the same way that the selection of winners will make sense in the context of the setting.
        ```

        - u/wren42:
          ```
          it's definitely walking the line between random for random's sake and coherent story.  The first chapter had me intrigued, this one has me on the edge, as it seems to be getting intentionally outrageous.
          ```

          - u/IICVX:
            ```
            >  it seems to be getting intentionally outrageous.

            I mean what else do you expect from Roald Dahl fanfic?
            ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          Not even just the feel of the magic, really. For instance, witches are canonically able to turn children to stone.
          ```

    - u/IV-TheEmperor:
      ```
      Thanks. I'm totally gonna read 208 page novel to get a better understanding of a fanfiction that may or may not be at its last chapter (no sarcasm).

  >!After all, every person in the world, in every moment of their lives, whatever they believe is the best option. That is what choosing means.!<
  ```

  - u/appropriate-username:
    ```
    Choosing is choosing, its definition does not deal with the quality of the choice being made or any other of its properties.

    Also what about "I really should eat vegetables but I'll eat one more cookie"? Clearly that person believes vegetables are the best option for them to choose.
    ```

  - u/phylogenik:
    ```
    My answer would be “Candy”, because Wonka is a candy company, right? It stands to reason they’d want to reward those who like their products. Alternatively — “water”, because buckets like water.
