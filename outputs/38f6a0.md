## Any rational DBZ stories?

### Post:

I would really enjoy reading a story about overpowered warriors explained a bit more rationally. Power levels are hilariously out of sync with each other and I think it is unfair that, while Goku and Vegeta are so incredibly overpowered, regular humans such as Krillin can't even compete. 

I would enjoy a story, possibly from Krillin's perspective about how he survives (or even thrives) in such a brutal environment.

Anything like that out there?

  I remember one that started awhile back set from Gohan's perspective that seemed promising, since Gohan's the most studious/intelligent of the Z warriors, but I don't think it ever took off past a couple chapters. I think the universe itself is ripe for some rationalizing, what with the crazy technology (capsule corp, FTL travel, etc) especially if the superpowered humans start using their abilities for things other than fighting.

    Right after I commented I remembered their automatic Deus ex machina machines. Dragon Balls can be terrifically overpowered and are in canon, seeing as Bulma is the only person making an effort to gather them in the entire world.

      To be fair, those things are hidden like HPMoR!Quirrelmort's horcruxes. They're not on top of unclimbable mountains or in deep caves or anything like that. They're just somewhere. If you don't know about the radio emissions, they're impossible to find.

        This is actually a good point. In canon, highly advanced bad guys get blindsided by the Z squad's "Dragon Radar" - our heroes' ease of finding them really is a miracle exception.

        Bulma's also built a time machine. Come to think of it, she's probably a great candidate for a rational protagonist.

        ...man, now I want to read this.

  Okay, it hasn't been mentioned yet, so I feel required to point out "DBZ Abridged". I never watched the original shows, but this has me laughing out loud. To my surprise, I still ended up legitimately invested in the story anyways. Turns out if you cut out all the dead air and lengthy monologues, you're left with a half-decent story.

  There was [Rational Gohan](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10304402/1/Gohan-and-the-Saiyan-rationale) (too short)

  And [here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2mp1g9/any_good_dragon_ball_z_dbz_rational_fics/) the last time your question was asked, not much there. The only actual suggestion was the !Good Cell fic [Honor Trip](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4746383/1/Honor-Trip).

  Well. I'm afraid we have only one choice left.

  [FNN Search for dragon ball z fics](https://www.fanfiction.net/anime/Dragon-Ball-Z/?&srt=3&r=10&c1=16&p=1) filtered by Character:Krillin and sorted by reviews. Anyone want to volunteer to find the good ones? Anyone?

    ...I've read a lot of fanfiction but I'm not sure I'm prepared to go that far.
