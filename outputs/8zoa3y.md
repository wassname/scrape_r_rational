  I just reached the list in the first chapter and I don't like those arguments.

  1. As people live longer and have "better life", they tend to get less children. Also they have magic to terraform the universe with and they can learn all the secrets of magic without losing a ton as they don't die.

  2. Wtf? Would Harry have given immortality to everyone else than blood purists? They can start a war anyway, but Harry would have a chance to make his side overpowered before that.

  3. Remake what? If it means the earlier fabric, meh. Society has gone through changes before and this would be a good change. Things changing doesn't mean that society would be broken until personally fixed.

  4. Harry already has shit like the invisibility cloak, which is definitely assassination worthy for many. With controlling dementors and all the other stuff he already has a ton of such secrets. Losing information like this would be idiocy.

    I can see your point, but keep in mind that these are common arguments against pursuing immortality. Whether or not you or I agree with them, they exist, and plenty of people believe them. In this story, Harry is dubious about them as well, as fits his character.

    This work of fiction is not didactic. I'm not trying to teach anyone or sway anyone to an ideology. There were a couple reasons I went the Obliviation route, but one of them is, it's really hard to write a humorous, relatable coming of age story when the character is god-level overpowered compared to his peers. The other reasons are plot related, and will be revealed in later chapters. :)

      Then this is not a sequel of HPMOR. Harry James Potter Evans-Verres, like his author Eliezer Yudkowsky, has the wish for destruction of death and immortality for ***all*** written in to the core of his character beyond even rational/logical conclusions.

  I reached chapter 5, and I’m honestly curious about this subreddit’s thoughts on this story. I contemplated which chapter to post, and I chose the most potentially controversial one I've written so far, because that makes sense, right?

  It’s a sequel to HPMOR, but I'm not sure that it's rational fiction, per se. It's a character driven mystery plot with humor and romance. However, I read the side bar, and I think it complies with the bullet points for \[RT\]. So...maybe I'm in the right place?

  Either way, I thought you guys might at least be curious enough to take a look. :)

  Let me know what you think of it so far, I love honest feedback!

    The introduction was a bit hard for me to get my head around.  I think the problem is that the pieces were presented a bit out of chronological order.  From what I can tell, the time periods are:

    > [End Of HPMOR + 1 month] "Are you ... absolutely sure?"
    >
    > [EO HPMOR + 3 years] Harry bounced on his feet
    >
    > [EO HPMOR - 1 year] If Harry had heard that account in his first year
    >
    > [EO HPMOR + 3 years] Harry glanced down at his present
    >
    > [EO HPMOR + 6 months] On the summer after his first year in Hogwarts
    >
    > [EO HPMOR + 3 years] Someone was forcefully rubbing his hair.

    I might suggest re-ordering the introduction a bit so there aren't as many flashbacks.  In this case, the story seems to start when Harry loses his memory.  Open there.

    My next question is how long it took before finding the letter.  Was there a while where Harry knew that someone had tampered with his head, but didn't know why?  If so, how did he react?

    Alternately, did he wake up next to the letter?  If that happened, did he take any steps to verify that he was the one who wrote it?  What sort of arguments did he use to explain that "going to space" made more sense than trying to recreate his original discovery?  He has notes, right?

  I really enjoyed this, very well written, although I was pretty confused in the first chapters because harry kept being vague about stuff, it got better though.


  I can't wait to read more, hope you go far with this

  I notice that I am confused about a few things.

  First, why do they have DADA professors?  At Quirrel's funeral, they made a resolution that older students would teach younger students Battle Magic from then on, rather than have DADA professors who might get cursed.

  Second, what exactly do you mean by this (Chapter 3):

  >The problem was distance. The closest star system was several light years away. Even if humans mined all the plutonium on Earth and created a rocket ship that ran on cold fusion, there simply wouldn't be enough available energy to travel that far. It was also currently impossible to build a rocket that could navigate deep space, communicate with Earth, sustain life for long periods of time, and keep the astronauts from killing each other out of boredom.

  ...Other than "sustain life" (especially over the duration that such a journey would take), none of that seems anywhere *near* impossible, and I have no idea where you're getting the energy levels you're talking about.

  Third: How is the transfiguration being sustained?  Philosopher's Stone is not an option, as that would be the same as killing the person-who-is-a-stone.

  Fourth: The harsh treatment being inflicted upon Hermione by Madam Bones seems like military indoctrination, which isn't there to make you stronger.  It's intended to make you *weaker,* to break down your will, so that you'll readily accept hierarchy and new norms uncritically.  Which does kind of match up with the description of the Auror tests, but... the characters keep saying that it's to make her stronger.  Are the characters just wrong about what the effects of this kind of indoctrination are supposed to be, and this is going to be cleared up later?
