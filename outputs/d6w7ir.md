## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

    It's very brave of you to stand up here and make that kind of commitment, so: kudos, congratulations, and thank you for sharing that with us.

    Several of the problems you describe (addiction, lack of motivation, disinterest in keeping healthy) are both symptoms and aggravators of depression; have you considered seeing a therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist?  As someone who has struggled with depression myself, I have found it to be helpful, if for no other reason than to have someone to talk to without the risk of being judged.

    I wish you the best of luck in your journey to become the person you'd like yourself to be.

        > I don't know if "brave" is a word that I'm really deserving of.

        I obviously can't speak for you, but it seems to me that people online, even when operating pseudonymously, have the same sense of community that they do IRL.  They value their reputation, their place in their community, their social standing, all of it.

        And, sad as I am to say it, substance abuse and related stuff do hold a kind of stigma.  People have been attacked and driven out of communities for less.  You'd hope that a community based around the idea of conquering your own internal prejudices would be immune to such things, but, hey, 25% of any community is assholes, so you had to know it was a risk to expose yourself.

        Put those two things together, and you willingly risked something you valued out of a desire to become a better person.

        If that doesn't qualify as "bravery," what does?

    > I had an idea at the beginning, of “Elizabeth as a character” with a meta story alongside the real story... y'know, whatever, that was too stupid to even be worth an explanation.

    Oh yeah, definitely.

    For what it's worth, "buying into your own hype" is probably, like, the n°1 rationalist sin, so you're 200% not alone. And it's an attitude you quickly outgrow once you identify it.

    > Three people have messaged me to take me up on my offer to help with getting in better shape and improving health. I've only gone in depth with one of them. One of the others I should've been trying harder to follow up with after they went radio silent

    I wouldn't worry about it.

    Speaking as one of the person you message, I have my own things going on; I'm not really in a pace where taking up a new exercise regimen would be convenient or productive.

    If someone asks for help, you answer and they don't follow up... well, it's kind of their problem.

    The hardest step of any change is admitting you were wrong. We're not supposed to have that problem in this community, but we're all human and that's a human trait.

    Remember that [relapse is common](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/alcohol-abuse/related-topics/alcohol-relapse-statistics/#gref), not indicative of personal or moral failure, and some experts even consider it part of the recovery process. Obviously, if you can stay off entirely you should, but you aren't inevitably doomed if you can't. You should look into [drugs which reduce alcohol cravings](https://www.addictionsandrecovery.org/medications/antabuse.htm) with your doctor. They aren't cures, but they do make the process easier. The efficacy of 12-step programs is unclear, but what they definitely do is provide structure and a community of people who understand, both of which are known to be helpful. You may be able to find a secular one somewhere, you may not. Definitely look into therapy/psychiatric care. It is not weakness to admit you need help, it is weakness to deny it.

    Also, alcohol withdrawal can be lethal. If you feel truly awful, don't hesitate to go to the hospital.

    Good luck. You deserve it.

  What are some good documentaries (movies, tv episodes, etc.) on primate ecology & evolution? Some time ago I asked for resources relating to evolutionary primatology for a new course I was signed up to teach. It went well (though my emphasis on Bayesian computational phylogenetics was... polarizing, let's say), and it looks like I'll be covering it again this upcoming year.

  This go around, I'm looking to spice up the content with short video clips, where relevant (lectures are 90 minutes long, and a 3-5 minute video break midway seems refreshing). I've already sliced up a high-res copy of [Life E10](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1575290/) on primates, which features excellent cinematography and solid narration. Does anyone know of other materials I can use? Preferably something recent (so e.g. blu-rays are available) with high-ish production values. Bonus points if it's actually educational! :D

  Thanks for any help!

  (also, just finished another new course this week -- had a lot of fun! It was more intro-y, which meant I could focus on the 'greatest hits' of my field without getting bogged down in additional details. Just got student evals yesterday -- and I know we're not supposed to care about them, that they fail to naively predict subsequent performance for whatever confounded reason and are biased towards men etc. etc. -- but reading them is still one of the highlights of the whole process lol)

    There's the Jungles episode (E8) from Planet Earth which spends some time on chimpanzees, as they chill out and snack on figs, and then form raiding parties and eat each other.

      Solid, thanks! The colugo clip would be useful too, as they're primates' closest living relatives.
