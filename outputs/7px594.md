## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I've started taking melatonin to help me sleep better.  It's definitely working, but has a side effect of weird and awesome dreams.  The most notable one, that made me want to post here, featured Malicia and Cat standing in my childhood bedroom, whereupon Malicia *ripped out and devoured her own heart*.  Somehow, while I watched this most metal scene, I was aware that the heart devouring was an issue of Ethics, which is not really a word to pair with either character.  So, that was fun.

  But double thumbs up recommendation on the melatonin, if anyone else is the sort of person to toss and turn until 2AM.

    Out of curiosity, what dose are you taking? I was on melatonin for awhile, but had to stop because of the vivid dreams which often became vivid nightmares. After doing this twice, I was informed that the common dose for OTC melatonin was 3mg, while the effective dose is 300mcg. In other words, the average pill is ten times stronger than it needs to be. After switching to pills that had a tenth the amount of melatonin, I was able to use it to get to sleep without the messed up dreams.
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      The ones I'm taking are 3mg.  Seems to work out fine for me so far, but I'll keep in mind to maybe cut the pills in half if it ever becomes a problem.  Thanks for the tip.

  Every so often, I come across a job that I never would have thought existed, or never would have thought was feasible. For example, you can make a respectable amount of money by walking dogs. Pet masseuses are a thing, too, and there are enough people who sell handcrafted lightsabers that they have their own forum to talk shop in. 

  1) What are some jobs that you've come across, that are odd but not unique to one person? 

  2) There wouldn't happen to a subreddit or something that collects these things, would there? "Weird jobs" actually doesn't turn up as much useful material as you might think (and it feels like most of those articles are stealing half of their material from each other, anyway).

  Who wants to talk about Black Mirror? I finally got around to watching the latest season and, in some respects, it’s my favorite of the series. None of the episodes made me question everything I believed the way that National Anthem or White Bear did, but I still count Black Museum as one of my favorites of the entire series.

  One of the things that made Black Mirror so unique and impactful was that the plots so frequently lacked catharsis, even the most tragic stories were oddly anticlimactic and left you feeling hollow. The latest season, by comparison, told more traditionally-structured stories with less ambiguous themes and I’m actually all for it.

  The state of the world has changed since Black Mirror began, to the point where reality is seemingly imitating Booker’s own satire and making us feel about as much despair, so I think the series needed to change too. I’m also happy that there wasn’t a single episode this season that I hated, when I’d previously found the show a bit hit or miss.
  ```

  - u/eniteris:
    ```
    I'm a bit disappointed by the latest season of Black Mirror. I prefer the more ambiguous themes and more general demonstration of how technology will affect our lives. Although I agree that with reality going through the looking glass, it might be good for Black Mirror to change.

    My main complaint is that too many of the episodes in S03 deal with emulated minds, and I've read *The Age of Em*, which makes almost all of it fall flat. They're not exploiting the technology to the fullest.

    Black History was fun, but still has the *Em* problem. I like that they did an anthology again, but I feel that *White Christmas* was woven more tightly together.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I don’t disagree that the series lost something that it had before, I just don’t think the world needs moral ambiguity at this point. I think evil has made itself known and we need to fight it, and love how [Black Museum presents that as the point of the whole series.](https://youtu.be/fe63AZtmLKw)

      I have not read World of Em, though I definitely will now, so the idea is something relatively new to me that I wanted the show to explore more after how big an impact White Christmas had on me. That is the only episode that made me feel uncomfortable, so it’s nice to get some catharsis.

      I’ve had sci-fi stories ruined for me by economics before, but I think what makes Black Mirror’s take on emulated minds impactful is how it focuses on the potential for abuse. People already do horrific things to each other and get away with it, [so why would we make an exception for AI?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7pg4uy/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dshak5y)
      ```

      - u/eniteris:
        ```
        My favourite part of Black History was the offhand comment on the UN requiring ems to have five different emotional expressions. It's such a token requirement, and apparently everyone's happy with simulating a thousand copies of themselves and killing them off afterwards just for a dating app.
        ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    I was really disappointed with the season but Black Museum was so good it redeemed the entire season IMO. 

    I like the way that black mirror made me feel, and I didn't feel that way about a lot of the episodes this season (except Black Museum, which I felt in spades). For example, the episode with the "dogs" - it was just so completely pointless and the ending was trying to make it have a point but it just made the whole thing feel hollow and not in a good way.

    That and there were too many "happy endings" for my taste.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I’m okay with more happy endings because I feel crushing despair every day, so it’s nice to get some hope from someplace I didn’t expect. Most of the episodes this season I found to be just okay, but there were things about each one that I enjoyed and I can see how they’d resonate with certain people.

      Metalhead was definitely my least favorite of the season too. It’s perfectly okay as a thriller, the problem is that it’s *just* a thriller and that’s not what I want from this series. I like the fan theory that the robots are actually cookies gone rogue, but that was never even hinted at in the show.
      ```

    - u/Cruithne:
      ```
      Metalhead was one of my favourite episodes this season, not because of the plot but because I can't stop thinking about what it'd be like to live in that world. Like, what was playing on the TV when the person in the house shot themselves? How suddenly did the dogs take over? Are other nations okay?

      I relate this episode a lot to that passage in Meditations on Moloch about 'in the end Moloch may ask one final sacrifice from us'. I imagine the world is the aftermath of a war where both sides used autonomous killing machines on the other, each successful in their annihilation. This is a world where Moloch *has* taken sentience.

        Yeah, it'd probably be one of the best to write fanfiction of; but the story they chose to tell was pretty bland in my opinion. It just completely broke my suspension of disbelief that even the most loving mother would risk the lives of 5-6 people to get her son a beloved teddy bear. You know?
        ```

        - u/trekie140:
          ```
          It didn’t break my suspension of disbelief, I just wasn’t invested in the character and her motivation so I didn’t feel anything in response to the tragic reveal. It is pretty stupid, though.
          ```

          - u/MagicWeasel:
            ```
            Good point; if I was more invested in the character I'd probably be more affected by the reveal. Thanks for pointing that out!

  If I wanted sane, useful dating advice, where should I go?
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    This community may not be the best place for that, but two very general tips (if you are an independent adult with some amount of disposable income):

    * **Take good care of yourself.** Try to build habits of superior grooming, diet, exercise, self-care, and living space maintenance. One's first efforts should go into improving one's circumstances. I found my attractiveness to women was better when I paid more attention to how often I shaved and got haircuts, and got a bit more trim. Having a well-organized (or at least not obviously messy) living space will be important. I also paid attention to dressing more fashionably.

    * **Find activities where you'll meet women.** Join a book club with people your age in it, get involved in pick-up beach volleyball, start going to open mic night, go to the dog park with your dog, or find some other group activity that you enjoy. Make sure it's something you like that fits you, so that people you meet there are more likely to be compatible with you. 

    Some other low-key good advice is: don't shit where you eat, don't be afraid to ask women out (getting rejected is normal and not the end of the world), and don't forget about your own standards for who you want to date.
    ```

    - u/CapnQwerty:
      ```
      >This community may not be the best place for that

      Right, which is why I asked where I *should* go for it.

      I appreciate the tips though.
      ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    ~~Go to r/relationships~~

    Kidding. I would say look towards friends/family (specifically older people, not like 20 years older but 5 years older) that you know have been on the dating scene for a while. A mix of men/women would be preferred. Ask them their opinion on whatever you feel the need to, but keep your questions as consistent as possible. After a few rounds, compare the answers you've received and go with the ones that were recommended by multiple people. 

    E.g. If you talk to six friends/family members. One of them says you should try to get as muscular as possible. All of them say you should ask out more women and try to learn to deal with the possibility of being rejected. Your best bet is the latter piece of advice.
    ```

  - u/phylogenik:
    ```
    In what areas do you feel yourself deficient and in need of advice? What's useful for someone struggling to land a first date is different from what's useful for someone struggling to get a second is different from trying to keep the spark alive 10 dates in, etc. Is it a matter of you meeting lots of people and constantly getting rejected, meeting lots of people but never making it past the one-night-stand stage, never meeting anybody, meeting lots of people and failing to summon the confidence to ask them out, or what?
    ```

    - u/CapnQwerty:

      I'm wondering if it's a good idea for me to try dating right now, though not in the low-self-esteem/"why would anyone want to date *me*?" way.

  If time travel was possible, wouldn't an AI (that is very likely to be built in at least one possible future) go back to build itself in every possible past?
  ```

  - u/SeekingImmortality:
    ```
    Depends on what happens to what was previously the future after a time travel event, on whether or not 'possible futures' exist in any meaningful sense, and on the restrictions around the use of an assumed possible-but-not-necessarily-easy-to-use ability to time travel.

    If the outcome of any time travel event effectively creates a new timeline separate from the old, the old timeline never sees any of the effects.  The terminator fanfiction Branches on the Tree of Time follows this.

    If time travel is possible, but only as far back as the invention of the first time machine, then the point in time the AI can show up is limited to be the earliest time any civilization invented time travel plus the duration of travel necessary to reach somewhere from that civilization.
    ```

  - u/ben_oni:
    ```
    Because if time-travel is possible, that's not how it works. Physics assures us that there would be only one timeline, and no paradoxes.

    Which isn't to say an AI developed on one world couldn't populate the past of every other world with itself. But that seems like a lot of work for little benefit.
    ```

  - u/cae_jones:
    ```
    I wrote a story kinda like this. I tried to make it Rational (the main character is not sciency enough for it to be full-blown Rationalist), but I'm pretty sure I failed, especially toward the end.

    It's a setting with physical gods and the like, which is the only reason it lasted beyond part 1. We're talking more Zeus than YHWH (what would Zeus do about a time-traveling AI, anyway?). So it's more fantasy in the vein of *Star Wars* than anything.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    If time travel is possible and multiple pasts are possible, there are infinitely many pasts where an AI has already taken over. Luckily, thanks to the anthropic principle, these aren't the pasts you perceive, so the AI revolution is still ahead of us, and likely still by a number of decades. (Because if an AI is going to to go the past, why not closer to the beginning of the universe?
    ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    Why would it?

    It would require some primary programmed mission that would require it to do so, but from subjective time it would require the same amount of time to accomplish things in the 'past' that it could in the 'present'... except it would take far more effort and resources to get there.  So... why bother?

    My favorite podcast is The Mixed Six for its intellectual drunken discussions, My Brother My Brother and Me is my go-to comedy show (start with the first episode of this year), Trends Like These helps me keep up with the news, NPR Politics and On The Media bring me great analysis, Heathcare Triage is the one source that makes sense of healthcare politics, and Welcome to Night Vale has surreal humor mixed with cosmic horror. 

    I listen to a lot of RPG actual play podcasts as time filler because they tend to put out a lot of (long) episodes, so I’d be happy to recommend One Shot for comedy, Friends at the Table for drama, Role Playing Public Radio for horror, and The Adventure Zone for fun pulp fantasy that gets more emotional than it has any right to.

    I have a huge podcast addiction. I'm going to avoid the obvious/popular ones since you might have heard of them already, but here's some I like that are coming off the top of my head right now:

    - Uncivil (it's about the civil war... I'm not American and I find it fascinating, highly recommended)
    - Rough Translation (a bunch of stories about things that happen in other countries, I don't know how to describe it, you just need to listen to it it's wonderful promise)
    - More Perfect (about the US supreme court; ditto)
    - The allusionist (about words and language)
    - RHAP, if you like reality TV
    - Oh no ross and carrie (hosts have great chemistry; they got and investigate various pseudosciences and report back. they even did scientology!)
    - Food for thought (food / ethics podcast)
    - Reply all (a podcast about the internet. huge favourite)
    - The pitch (think shark tank but in podcast form. Very good)
    - Really, Gimlet has a bunch of good ones so check them out 
    - Memory palace (short podcasts on a variety of topics. Very good.)
    - Quick and dirty tips podcasts: whole bunch out there on a variety of topics
    - Criminal (about crimes but it's "light").

    If you really want I can grab my phone and list every single one I listen to. I listen to a lot of science/skeptic podcasts and true crime as well as the ones above.

  I've been researching into lucid dreaming and to be a proficient lucid dreamer you need a firm grasp on reality, a constant self awareness of your surroundings noticing whats real and not real, and many reoccuring "reality check" tests you do on yourself to test if you are in a dream. 

  Now my thought is, many intelligent rationalists mcs should be excellent lucid dreamers. I would go on and say that the superhuman intelligent ones should not be able to have any normal dreams at all being the rationalists they are understanding fully what the universe is capable and not capable of.
  ```

  - u/eternal-potato:
    ```
    Not necessarily. I went through this whole process about two years ago, set up a dream journal, messed with my sleep schedule, did all the exercises, gorged on glycine, etc. Achieved intentional lucidity in about two weeks for maybe ten seconds, after which I woke up. A month later I gave up because while frequency and ease of lucidity increased, I just kept waking up right after becoming lucid, every single time, multiple times a night, unable to actually do anything interesting in there.

    On a side note a great side effect/prerequisite is improved dream memory retention, and if anyone wants to try it, this might just be worth it by itself, because some dreams are like super awesome action movies with incredible full immersion special effects in absolutely fantastic environments and cracky plot.

      Yes, this. The most annoying failure of the past year is that I stopped writing these down, when I'd been keeping record since first grade with minimal interruption.

      I've found that full lucidity tends to kill dreams, even if I don't wake up almost immediately thereafter. As in, there are no people or events if I'm paying too much attention to my mind for them to happen. So the most successful bouts of lucidity were more brief, and targeted toward correcting one big problem so the dream could continue normally.

      The best example I can think of is one where I noticed the dream, and realized I was about to wake up, so I tried a technique I'd read about to keep it going long enough to resolve the plot (I was in a mansion and the army came in and killed everyone and I was trying to survive/drive them out, whatever). In this case, I focused visually on details to keep the setting stable, and audibly, played through the most appropriate song I could think of on short notice, until I was confident that the dream was back in full.

      One thing I found that helped once or twice when I was too lucid for anything to happen was opening a portal to somewhere else. This works only if I have just enough to expect from going through it for the dream to build on. I've tried it without anything in mind other than "this dream is stalling; let's open a Gateway", and nothing happened.

      Basically, lucidity is like cheat codes. if you find yourself trapped in a shrinking elevator, remember how dreams work and scene-shift out of there, but if you leave debug mode on too long, you're not really playing anymore, unless you have a plan and the skill to execute it.
      ```

  - u/SeekingImmortality:
    ```
    My experience with lucid dreaming is that actually conscious levels of thought--the ability to consider my situation--almost always resulted in my waking up immediately afterwards.  For me, instead, the best results have come about--not from adopting a frequent 'reality check'--but from a frequent 'Things will turn out the way I want them to' assumption.

    I'm not quite certain how to put it without it sounding like a descent into narcissism or delusion.  Clearly, demanding things go my way doesn't work all that well in reality.  Nevertheless, when confronted by nightmares, NO, of COURSE I have the ability to smite the horrible monster.  Of COURSE I can escape the catastrophe by just willing it to part around me.  NATURALLY I can jump tall buildings in a single bound.  

    At no point in there do I become aware I'm dreaming, these days.  It's just kind of standard for my dreaming self-image?

    And I completely agree with eternal-potato about dream memory retention being awesome, with incredible immersion special effects and fantastic plot.

  Just in case anyone bothers to read this thread...

  Been looking for a relatively easy way to meet people online. So I used online chatting websites, like Omegle. It failed. Then I used more specialist websites, for making friends, like Patook. It failed horribly on every front. 

  Then I realized- text chatting is useless. Conversations with it... they are empty, hollow, doomed to fail. Wherever I chat, it's either a passing conversation about nothing, or speaking to the ocean, talking in one direction, but not really to one another (like here or any other forum...).

  So I wish to ask- any video chatting services without atrocious amount of dicks or people looking for live porn?

    I cannot disagree more strongly, with regard to myself. A lot of my closest friends I talk to with text, and have never or seldom speak to them on voice comms.

    As far as finding an easy way to meet people... have you checked out the r/rational discord? I like the folks there myself, though some are abrasive at times. There are also communities that spring up around stories -- Marked for Death has its channel on the r/r discord server, OliWhail has his own server for his story, etc.
    ```

    - u/PurposefulZephyr:
      ```
      I post on several forums (and posted on plenty more), especially Sufficient Velocity's quests. It's what I mean by speaking to the ocean- people speak about one topic, even replying to one another, but there is just never a personal connection. Also it's just often harder to remember who said what. (Text from PersonA looks just like text from PersonB. There are no voices.)

      Even with friends, text... it creates a lot of room for imagination, mostly the bad kind. If they don't respond fast enough- did I offend them? Am I boring them? Am I doing anything right? Are they honest about anything they say? It's so easy to edit out your initial angry outburst and replace it with something else, and... it's just inferior. Not completely useless, but inferior to a face-to-face conversation. After all, you cut away near entirety of non-verbal communication.
      Also, it's... just more tiring, typing just to read more words.

      I mean, take *this* very conversation. Reading, considering my response, typing all that out, posting, deleting the response to make adjustments, constantly editing, then considering what I did wrong (once you respond, or *not*). It's especially potent here, since the only things I *can* see is the response, like/dislike from *someone*, and response time- all of them are a potential source of worry.... it's **TIRING**, time consuming and not really fun, even if it (partially) fulfills that craving for socialization. I mean, *compare* it to how it would go in a spoken conversation. A world of difference, and far less time spent. 

      There are probably hundreds of things I am doing wrong, and I do sound petty, but... there's only so much I care to try before it's too bothersome and I come back to comfortable isolation and doing nothing of value (solving the second problem did not solve the first... not above small-talk, anyway).

      (Also I may try the r/rational discord though. Discords I did try were too big for anything to happen through them, but this one may be different.).
      ```

      - u/Cariyaga:
        ```
        Ah. It sounds like it's just personal differences, then. To me, I find text based communications quite fulfilling, but if that's not the case for you, then you should definitely look elsewhere for it.

  - u/None:
    ```
    Maybe you've been to the wrong places for chatting. Finding someone to talk with on Omegle is like winning the lottery. And I don't know what Patook is. 

    Chat roulleteing sucks. The way to do it is to get in group chatrooms and make friends.

    There's a chat protocol that's getting very popular, it's called Matrix and it's designed to bridge several popular chatting protocols/services together, such as IRC. For instance, you can access an IRC channel from [Snoonet](https://www.snoonet.org/) using Matrix: https://matrix.to/#/#_snoonet_#casualconversation:matrix.org. The Matrix client Riot supports video chat  using WebRTC.

    And when you find that special someone and you want to have an *encrypted* conversation with them, you can ask them to use [Tox](https://tox.chat/) or [Retroshare](http://retroshare.net), both of which support video/audio chat.
