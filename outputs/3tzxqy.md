## New chapter of A Voice Across the Void (Rationalist!Star Wars)

### Post:

The new chapter is [here](http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/133818185152/ch-6-an-opportunity). Earlier chapters are [here](http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/133818575647/a-voice-across-the-void). 

I also took the opportunity to expand chapters 1 and 2, both of which have been doubled from their original length. The plot is unchanged, but I have inserted some more detail and backstory to make the various supporting characters feel a little less one-dimensional. I realize that ongoing revisions are highly non-ideal for readers, but those chapters were badly in need of editing; besides, the whole point of writing this on my end is to get a handle on the basics of writing fiction.

    There's [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3oogyb/hsfrtstar_wars_au_timeless_warrior/) that was linked recently. It's pretty good, but short. 

    I'd also like to know of more.

    [Into The Storm](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4302076/1/Into-the-Storm) and its sequels [In Shadows and Darkness](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4344112/1/In-Shadows-and-Darkness) and [At the Brink of the Dawn and the Darkness](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4520729/1/At-the-Brink-of-the-Dawn-and-the-Darkness) are really interesting takes on a Luke who gets captured by Vader at Cloud City and turned by Palpatine.

    [Here's some](https://www.fanfiction.net/movie/Star-Wars/), and [here's a few more](http://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=âœ“&work_search%5Bquery%5D=Star+Wars). No promises on quality, though.

  While reading Chapter 2: "Wait a minute.  Those teachings.  Is that... *her?*"  (\*goes back, checks her name\*)  
  "No, I guess not."  
  Ch. 3: "Wait a minute... *Nerra*?!  It *is* her!"  

  You clever bastard! I wonder if anybody else put two and two together.

    You got it :) 

    Not sure how many people noticed -- maybe one or two others besides you (the author of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3oogyb/hsfrtstar_wars_au_timeless_warrior/), which takes the beginning of the story and goes in a different direction, probably did). Not that many people played through or remember KOTOR 2, I suppose.

  I like what you've written so far, very keen to read more.
