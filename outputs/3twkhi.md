  I like ponies. Squee!

  I'd also wanted to know if it would be ok for me to add this story to the LW group on FiMFiction, Calamitizer.

    Totally! I wasn't aware of such a group, but that would be awesome!

    And I like ponies too. =3

  Basic info is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3te0fy/rtff_shears_chapter_1_rmlp/cx5d65r).

  A small edit was made to the line in Ch. 1 itemizing the Elements of Harmony, please check it out. Thanks for reading =]

  ```
  > For one, infused gems lose strength over time if not activated (the Inertial Decay Problem)

  That is, the mana dissipates, but the infused spell stays? For every intense spell that takes too long to cast at a moments notice and that isn't medium-destructive, infuse it into a gem with a flux trigger, but supply no mana. To later cast the spell, vivify the gem.

  Now for some theories that fit too well not to post. Not phrased as questions because of literary satiation.

  Reflection is imperfect because there is a moment of inertial decay in the gem. Vivification itself is lossless.

  Horn capacity is at the equilibrium of its inertial decay and the owner's intrinsic constant vivification of it.

  Infusion can allow animals to vivify with their own color of mana.
