  Wanted to write something upbeat, so I did 8-). For a little background to some of the events referred to in The Gardener, see "Flicker and the Wolf" and "Briefing" under my Stories links.

  I am starting work on revising Fall now, so updates will tend more to short stories and vignettes for a while.

    Fun story, if shorter than I would like.

    I really enjoy the Fall series, and I look forward to seeing you get back to it.  In particular, I hope you're going to deal with that dangling Tabula Rasa plot thread soon...?

      Next regular chapter of Maker's Ark.  I need to be sure to get the interaction between Flicker and Jumping Spider right, because there are other long dangling threads and some subtext there.
