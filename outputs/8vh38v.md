  I am still having fun with the story but I think the tech / hacker side of things might be getting a bit unnecessarily specific and tv-trope-silly.

    Following the above comment, I enjoyed the hacker sections, but I was very confused in that, unless I've missed something, Hector should not be able to do something that no one else can do in the Internet, unless it's somehow exploiting his power to use information that others can't get.  Unless he actually has technology-manipulation powers, for him to be head-and-shoulders above professionals(/government) by coincidentally being a technology genius (as well as having his own specific amazing) feels contrived.  (Unless this is actually a second set or subset of powers from his extra sensititivity genes?)  If he learned how to do hacking the normal way, almost everything he can do was learned from others; while there's still the possibility that he learned head-and-shoulders-above-others techniques from a specific technology genius (Stevens-related?), the conclusion that there should be others who are able to do what he can do, and probably would have done it...  that said, him being the only one available to follow up that particular email is powers-enabled, but conventional wisdom should also take a hit?  Unless it's conventional wisdom that it can't be done, but government wisdom that it can be (just being kept a secret from the public), and he's using those methods...

    In summary, him {pretending to have Internet powers that nobody else has} as a smokescreen for his real powers is enjoyable.  Him actually having Internet powers that nobody else has (even the worms, is he the only person to think of and implement worms like that?  How could that be without technology powers/genius?) comes across as incongruous.  Contrast with the earlier more-normal-seeming 'Yes, you tried to use proxies, but the CIA are better at Internet handling than you are, so they connected you and Delphic anyway'.

      No, that's pretty much how worms are typically implemented.
      ```

      - u/MultipartiteMind:
        ```
        (Is that to say that lots of different agencies simultaneously have the same sorts of worms in the same systems?  Would they have been able to get the same information as him?  Is the difference that he's not sharing the 'starting point' details with them, and so knows what to look for while pretending to be Delphic?)
        ```

    ```
    I'll keep that in mind.
    ```
