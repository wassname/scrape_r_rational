## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  This is not really worldbuilding but kind of is. I'm trying to iron out a plot for a generic urban fantasy "two people find out that vampires are a thing and go to try to save the world". I think I've discussed this on here before.

  Here's my story beats:

  * There is a very powerful vampire who is slowly relearning that humans are moral subjects due to the power of love

  * Meanwhile, two young women find out that vampires are a thing (one is a cop, the other is a mage - yes, she'll work her way up to shooting fireballs) - in doing so, the vampire is aware both that they exist and that the mage has magic powers

  * For some reason they decide not to go to the authorities/media????

  * They kidnap the vampire's love interest, plot happens, love interest is returned but everyone gets some character development

  * There's some more drama during which the cop becomes a thrall of the vampire, making her reluctant to kill him, and at the same time the vampire realises a rival vampire is going to get some big angelic powers thanks to a eugenics cult he's been running the past few hundred years

  * The main vampire ultimately decides that the mage is a valuable potential ally, and decides to offer her a truce where he'll use his influence to stop vampires killing humans and she'll use her magic to do stuff to make him the big vampire leader of the country/world. This truce is accepted, and when the masquerade inevitably breaks, the main vampire is a popular and beloved spokesperson of vampires everywhere and peace is achieved. (The Main Vampire won't go back on his promise when he gets power because he's already feeling uncomfortable about the commodification of humans)

  The go-to answer is that there's already a big conspiracy where vampires have their tendrils in everything, but that only says that telling the media/police about it is retrospectively a bad idea; the cop/mage needs to think it's a bad idea before they tell anyone rather than just get a big case of the deadsies after telling someone. 

  Writing all this out I'm wondering if I can make the cop a thrall of the vampire from more or less the very beginning, and have the vampire decide to try to use the cop to get to the mage. He could quite easily consider the risk of the cop/mage hurting him very low. And if the cop is in thrall with the vampire she's going to be very conflicted about killing him; the mage is a much more "submissive" personality and the cop could easily bully her into not going to the media (by saying "they must have infiltrated everything", even if she's not sure if that's true). But is that Rational? 

  Maybe combine a) and b). Have the mage talk to a reporter, give proof of her powers. Reporter is associated with a vampire, and this leads to the vampire deciding to "manipulate" the mage into making him the king of the world.

    That could definitely work, regardless of whose point of view it is from (if the story is from the cop's point of view then we get lots of internal conflict, if from the mage's then a feeling of betrayal, and if both then um both). 

    > But is that Rational?

    I think so, if you let the cop character make some good arguments (and especially a more pleasant alternative plan). Preferably, this scene would be from the mage's point of view so that we can see her thought process here, potentially see any errors that she's making, and understand that it's all reasonable from her point of view. Bonus points if she explicitly flags some part of the argument as overly convenient but rationalizes after the fact; rat!fic has room for people making errors and not being perfect gods of pure reason. R!animorphs has plenty of that but I haven't heard anyone say that it isn't rational (in fact, if we held a poll for "most rational fics" it'd probably be in the top tier). 

    (One possible argument: Yes, let's talk to reporters, but let's get as much information as we can, both to prove our case and to know what to do after. It's very easy to justify "not doing anything just yet.")

    I also like the idea of combining a) and b). Is it possible for her to run into some other kind of (smaller) trouble as well, to further convince her that talking to reporters is not a good idea?

      > Is it possible for her to run into some other kind of (smaller) trouble as well, to further convince her that talking to reporters is not a good idea? 

      What sort of smaller trouble did you have in mind? Like, she sets up an appointment with a reporter and there's a dead cat in her letterbox with a note that says "STAY AWAY FROM THE MEDIA"? Or like, she's walking alone one night and a mist condenses into human form and the pallid corpse tries to kill her and she only manages to get out of it from sheer dumb luck? Or every time she speaks to a reporter they seem to "mysteriously change their mind" about running with the story within a day?

      Or along the lines of the Mage runs into (say) a person who was robbed by a... satyr, and she tells the Victim to talk to the media about the whole satyr situation, and then the Victim ends up dead from being "kicked to death by some sort of animal"?????? 

      > let the cop character make some good arguments (and especially a more pleasant alternative plan)

      Good point - as long as the cop makes a convincing argument, then if the mage believes it, we're all good. The cop finds some evidence by looking through old police files - perhaps she noticed they were misfiled somehow to suggest a police conspiracy? (THere probably is a little at least, because a vampire would be stupid if they didn't have a human in the police and a human in the media: would make perfect sense for a vampire to have someone in Records who could mislabel the files somehow... now I'm pondering how patient the records team in my building would be with answering questions about how they'd hypothetically misfile stuff so people couldn't find evidence of vampires)

        > What sort of smaller trouble did you have in mind?

        Any and all of those! Anything at all that'll make her think that "the vampires control the media" is plausible enough that she should play it safe. 

        Additional argument in favor of the media being compromised: Why has the truth not come out already? There are reasons that this situation would be different, but it does suggest that caution is warranted. 

        > now I'm pondering how patient the records team in my building would be with answering questions about how they'd hypothetically misfile stuff so people couldn't find evidence of vampires

        Does anyone on the records team like fantasy novels? 

        "Answer all my questions and I'll give your name to a minor character." 

        "...I'm not sure if I want my name associated with 'the guy who mislabels police evidence for his secret and very illegal boss the vampire.'"

          > Anything at all that'll make her think that "the vampires control the media" is plausible enough that she should play it safe.

          Oh, so she could even (say) be followed by a creepy looking dog and be worried that the vampire is transforming and tailing her?  Hmmmm. I'll have to try and think of something.

          > Additional argument in favor of the media being compromised: Why has the truth not come out already? There are reasons that this situation would be different, but it does suggest that caution is warranted.

          I really like that. The anthropic principle. I was considering having them find other hunters on the deep web but I prefer them being "alone" with only Mage's nascent magic skills to guide them.

          >misfiling stuff

          Really from my experience looking for non vampire related files you only need to make sure the titles are badly worded enough that nobody would think it would contain anything relevant...

            That'd be great. 

            "You were right, we never should have talked to the reporter! We're screwed, we're screwed!" 

            "What happened?" 

            "There was this old pigeon today that I ran into, and it gave me a really evil stare. It must have been one of the vampire's servants!" 

            (But yeah, if you know that magic is a thing, and vampires are a thing, then it would be really easy to get paranoid)
            ```

              The funny thing about the evil staring pigeon: there's a comic relief character who is a talking crow. I'm debating between writing him out of the novelisation or making him into something a bit more Australian like one of those lovely Ibises I was telling you about...
              ```

              - u/callmesalticidae:
                ```
                I vote for an ibis. Ibises need the good PR, based on what you told me.
                ```

                - u/MagicWeasel:
                  ```
                  It'll be great. My urban fantasy series becomes the new Harry Potter, children are demanding common Australian Ibises as pets more furiously than they asked for owls, all of a sudden Ibises replace the Emu as the national bird of Australia. Wetland habitats are protected forever.

                    A *very* good end.
                    ```

  - u/Kinoite:
    ```
    From a story perspective: if you don't want to put a bunch of detail into how the conspiracy works, I'd just do what Neverwhere does, and assert some big magical reason as part of your premise.

    In Neverwhere, exposure to magic means people forget you.  I don't remember a deep reason.  It's just a thing that you accept as part of the set-up.

    ----

    Going straight to the government / media seems like a "throwing down the key" thing.  It's an emotional reaction that drives the plot.  But I'm not sure it's something most people would actually do.

    I see something apparently supernatural.  Immediate reaction is that either: magic is real, I'm going nuts, or I'm a victim of an expensive practical joke.  I'd spend a few hours on Youtube and WebMD.  Have other people posted videos of supernatural stuff?  Are there drugs that would slow my perceptions so someone seems super-fast?

    Suppose there's no evidence anywhere.  I get a clean bill of health.

    My next thought is that other people must have seen vampires.  Other people must have told the internet, the media and the government.  So, why isn't the information public?

    On possibility is that the government knows and keeps the whole thing classified.  Alternately, there's a conspiracy so powerful that it can scrub vampire information from the CIA, FBI and NSA.  Both option are intimidating enough that I'm not going to a local reporter.

    Unless I can think of a plausible reason why I'm the first person to try and expose vampires, I'd either give up or spend months to years planning my big release.

    And, part of my planning my big release would be arranging resources & an 'escape plan' for when I end up in the public eye.  Being either Snowden or Assange sounds terrible.  It would be even more terrible if I didn't have money, layers, a PR agent, and place to escape to once I was thrust into the public eye.
