  Now that I think about it, it kinda makes sense that Cat and Vivienne are no longer Named.

  I always kinda took being Named to mean that you help a conviction in something that would not ever change.  
  Basically, I thought they needed to be insane over something really specific to their names that they could never compromise over.

  And basically the whole of Vol 4 was Cat learning to compromise.

  I do realize that this probably has some holes to it, but I like it.

    Makes sense, Black skirted close to the line, Cat dances back and forth across the line like its her job (it is).

    The way I see it, a name is not just something gods grant some people. It doesn't define you, you define it. It's a reflection of what you are, at your very core.

    Vivienne saw that she was no longer acting as a Thief, no longer thinking as a Thief. She changed and the name no longer suited her. In the same vein, Cat became a queen and broke away from the Black Knight. She is no longer a his Squire, or anyone else. Be it in title, in actions or in personality.

    They have the potential for a new name and will probably awaken one, specially now that Callow is free and they are from there. I just worry there is not that much of the story left to tell those tales properly.

  Fun fact for Abigail: When Cat started at the college, she was under Hakram. This is from experience.

  I didn't really buy that there was a significant risk of Procer, who are quite familiar with the Black Queen, throwing 7,000 cavalry at her. Seems like it would be standard procedure to not engage powerful Named without heroic assistance - any army doing otherwise wouldn't last long. I'd expect that this army in particular would be informed to not assault the Black Queen specifically, unless they have heroic assistance.

  You see the Black Queen, you turn around, you go grab Pilgrim and Saint to deal with her and then you proceed from there. This may well be what happens but the will they/wont they tension (and subsequent Cat's a badass vibe) didn't really connect for me.

    But thats what they did. They wanted to cut the escape route for some of Callow army but then the Cat pops up and they flinched.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    She just dropped out of the sky during their charge. The question was not whether they would stop, but whether they would notice her fast enough and notify superiors in time to stop. 30 seconds prior, they were charging in to cause a rout, so stopping on a dime wasn't exactly a thing they could do.

  Catherine the absolute MAD LASS!
