## [BST] Rational Percy Jackson

### Post:

So my first thought is that mortals are p-zombies, because apparently they can't accomplish anything - almost everything in history was caused by demigods.

Not sure what else could be changed.

The irrationality of PJ seems interwined with the universe a lot. You can't, say, overthrow the gods, because they have prophecy and Fate on their side, and you can't trust them to be nice, because they're Greek gods.

  Maybe you could have the gods be reflections of more abstract concepts. Less pop culture, less human. You'd also need to add way more demigod infrastructure, because only having a summer camp is unrealistic.

  The real meat of the setting though, are the monsters.You could go the diskworld route and make them gods with almost no belief, a hivemind of some sort, or even genuine individuals

    I've only heard of the series, not read it, but the thing that's so great about Greek gods and myths is that they *are* human, not just embodiments of abstract things like in so many other mythologies.

    Edit: well, that and the fact that the things which are metaphorical, like the arts being the daughters of memory, are incarnated observation rather than bullshat explanation.

      I agree, part of what makes PJ good is that the Greek gods are human, and they've become more modern in some ways.

      If you revised HP, you wouldn't take out wands because they don't make sense.
      ```

      - u/Igigigif:
        ```
        no. However, if the HPverse was only hogwarts and some scattered magical creatures, then you would at least give a watsonian reason for this, if not add a larger wizard society. Plus, in the PJ series, the god's true forms are physics destroying monsters that nuke their surroundings just by existing. They could easily be re-interpreted as personas designed to let the underlying entities interact with humans.

        EDIT: words
        ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  How do you define fate? Do Gods control fate or does fate control the Gods? If fate is just the inevitable course that history takes, is it inevitable BECAUSE the Gods are making it that way? Or does it just happen to be consistently inevitable in the Gods' favor?

  If it's the former, thwart the Gods manipulations by figuring out how the Gods ascended in the first place so you can ascend other humans. If it's the latter, you might be able to do the same, depending on whether fate favors all Gods or just the first ones. If you can't, find a way to escape to another world or universe where the gods don't have jurisdiction. Otherwise you're just screwed. 
  If Fate is actually a character and one of the gods, then that makes Zeus a figurehead with Fate as the real power behind the throne, so to speak. Keep in mind that none of the Gods are all powerful. They can be outsmarted, since their minds are still human.

  That being said, I haven't read the Percy Jackson series, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.
  ```

  - u/notentirelyrandom:
    ```
    I don't know about in the Percy Jackson series, but in canon fate beats Zeus. It's why he's legitimately threatened by prophecies like "Thetis will have a son more powerful than his father," threatened enough to *actually keep it in his pants for once*.

    See also Aeschylus: 

    "Who then is the steersman of Necessity?

    The three-shaped Moerae (Fates) and mindful Erinyes (Furies).

    Can it be that Zeus has less power than they do?

    Yes, in that even he cannot escape what is foretold."

    They don't actually rule the world. They could, if they wanted to, but (mostly for Doylist reasons) they don't. Zeus is ruling in his own right and not on anyone else's behalf, and that's fine, just like the President of the United States doesn't become a figurehead for not being able to ignore gravity.
    ```

  - u/ThatDamnSJW:
    ```
    It's consistently inevitable. (What notentirelyrandom said)

    Most of the Gods didn't ascend, and ascension is both limited and controlled by Zeus. There are no other universes.
    ```

    - u/Timewinders:
      ```
      You might not need to overthrow the gods to become one. Even in canon wasn't Percy offered the chance to become a god? After that you could play politics to get the things you want done. The gods weren't a united front.
      ```

      - u/ThatDamnSJW:
        ```
        Right, but they were a united front in a way that's unsolvable. You can't manuever, say, Hades, into reviving the dead, because that goes against everything Hades is.
        ```

        - u/wendigo_days:
          ```
          >You can't maneuver, say, Hades, into reviving the dead, because that goes against eveything Hades is.

          *This* is what fate is for the Greeksâ€”the unalterable part of someone's nature.

          If you want to do rationalfic Greek mythology, there's a clear link between struggling with your flaws and struggling to think clearly. The Greeks were pretty clearly on the "inescapable double edged sword" side, whereas now people seem to at least want to think of people as mutable. Where on the spectrum you fell would be up to you.
          ```

        - u/Timewinders:
          ```
          If you can't convince Hades to revive the dead, you might at least convince the other gods to give him more space and resources so he can make the afterlife a nicer place. Maybe try convincing him to be a little less harsh in punishing evil people.

          In the worst case, Percy could just choose not to tell the other gods that Ares was the one who really stole the Master Bolt or frame Hades for some other crime. Then he could get Hades thrown into Tartarus and replaced with someone more malleable.
          ```

          - u/ThatDamnSJW:
            ```
            I'd imagine whoever replaces Hades continues the Fields of Punishment. In fifty years, people find out about Hades on a quest in fifty years and Percy gets sent to the Fields. Hades is now really, really pissed at his imprisonment, and just sends everyone in Asphodel to Punishment, because fuck trying to be merciful at all. There's a much larger conflict between the Big Three which dwarfs World War II.

            It's not Greek myth if your flaws don't fuck you up, and Percy should know this. Rational Greek heroes would be constantly watching themselves to make sure they didn't do anything unjust to the gods, because it would absolutely screw them over.
            ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      Not to mention that's actually not the way it happened in Greek mythology. The Olympian gods came to power after overthrowing their predecessors, the Titans, who had come to power after overthrowing the primordial deities. And according to Plato, the Demiurge shaped the material universe, including the Primordial deities, out of ideas. The ideas themselves could be unmade platonic ideals or something.
      Maybe the Olympian gods just want people to think that they're invincible and have always been around

      - u/noahpocalypse:
        ```
        In canon everybody knows all the mythology that we do. The demigods are familiar with pretty much the same mythology that you'd find in a textbook. Percy Jackson's world consists of a.) the real world, the same one we live in, plus b.) the hidden world where Greek mythology is real (and so is Roman and to a questionable extent Egyptian as well, though that may have just been an easter egg to a different series the author wrote). It's like Harry Potter in that aspect.
        ```

- u/Nepene:
  ```
  Making mortals p-zombies is a bit depressing.

  How about just making it so that magic is required to get anywhere in the world.

  The mist prevents mortals from seeing monsters and magic. That means that any magical being can use their powers freely. Suppose a non magical person tries to gain power in an army. A magical being can put on their magic mask and beat the crap out of them, or twist their senses and drive them insane.

  This is a world of entrenched power structures. Magical beings held every position of power in society, were at the top of every social pole with few exceptions. To get anywhere in life you need magic so you can see through the mist and tackle the problems you face in life.

  As to why you can't overthrow the gods, that doesn't seem irrational. They're much more powerful than mortals and have dominance over most social structures, the camps included, so to defeat them you'd have to be immensely powerful and rally every weaker being to your banner. They have control over the fates and control over every major position of power.

  How about a story where Percy allies with Kronus to save humanity from the gods?
  ```

  - u/ThatDamnSJW:
    ```
    I'd think requiring magic is much more depressing. Imagine if literally every successful person on Earth had to have a superpower, and you could never get that superpower yourself. You can't understand why what the superpowered people are doing is done, because illusions.

    What really horrified me when I read the books, the way Dementors horrified me as a kid, was this. At the end of your life, you're judged by people you didn't believe in to see how heroic you were. If you were a dick, you get sent to Punishment; if you were heroic - and you're a mortal, so you're not - you get sent to Elysium or the Isle of the Blessed. If you're a monster, you reincarnate as a plant or as a target. Everyone else gets sent to Asphodel, where they promptly do nothing forever.

    So you live your life not understanding the real universe because of the Mist, and when you die you just stand there forever. Unless you were shitty enough to be punished.
    ```

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      You can't get anywhere in society, yes, but many people live a moderately nice life at the bottom. In your world most people are non conscious and as such aren't living much. If people are alive but essentially enslaved to the magical world at least there's a prospect of freeing them in story.

      Yes, and that means there are likely countless people eternally standing there in boredom forever. A sad fate. And they have no idea why.
      ```

      - u/ThatDamnSJW:
        ```
        It's way better for only maybe a hundred thousand people to have ever lived, and half of them to be happy forever, then for 107 billion to have lived and for most of them to spend the rest of eternity miserable.
        ```

        - u/Nepene:
          ```
          There are a number of other gods, the egyptian and norse ones in particular, greeks and romans aren't the only ones. Not all will be in the same afterlife.

          Also, having most people be zombies is personally depressing for readers. They have family members, most of whom are statistically likely to be non magical. This story has a premise that feels like stage one is to slay almost everyone every reader loves. It's personally depressing. Random people who they don't know are less depressing.

          Plus they can be saved.

  >You can't, say, overthrow the gods, because they have prophecy and Fate on their side, and you can't trust them to be nice, because they're Greek gods.

  You can **totally** overthrow the Gods, though. Fate doesn't *protect* them, just warn them via prophecies. There's literally a prophecy in the books about the protagonist possibly overthrowing the gods IIRC.

  Also, it's a major plot point that the gods have, themselves, overthrown the last batch of gods (as is standard in Greek myth.) Maybe they actually started out as humans/demigods? That would explain a lot, actually.
  ```

- u/Imosa1:
  ```
  I don't suppose the God of War answered questions about how the Greek Gods could be overthrown?
  ```

  - u/ThatDamnSJW:
    ```
    Nah, it just raised more. It's the equivalent of a Lovecraft protagonist finding himself in the Mythos and deciding to murder every creature there. And succeeding.
    ```

- u/MadScientist14159:
  ```
  At one point I started working on this, then sort of forgot about it when the idea for NaClO got into my head.

  General advice:

  The gods shouldn't be outside the realm of science, but they should be *really fucking complicated* physics wise, or else Athena-cabin would have reverse-engineered godhood in like a week.

  Luke should be smarter and more rational than Percy. Obviously.

  The gods are pricks. Even the "nice" ones like Hermes are truly monumental arseholes who abandon their kids and fuck with human lives for fun. Seriously, they're narcissists at best and omnicidal at worst. Treat them as such.

  Base it on the books, not the films. People will be extremely angry if you don't.
  ```

- u/fljared:
  ```
  I'm pretty sure many/most of the famous people claimed to be demigods are really mortals the gods like- it costs them nothing to lie, and of course Athena would love to be the mother of George Washington, despite having little reason to be in the British Colonies around that time. Who's going to call her lie?
  ```

- u/callmebrotherg:
  ```
  I would really like a story where the protagonist found out that zir family had been p-zombies this whole time and only members of the secret world were conscious.
  ```

  - u/ThatDamnSJW:
    ```
    Yeah, think of it -

    The gods are truesapient, and they keep seeing these naturally-arising machines going around, modifying their behavior sometimes, and sometimes not doing so. They're not people, really - they're more like works of art. And some of these art pieces are ones you find interesting, or beautiful, and you *want* them. It's not like you'd hesitate to take an unowned rock from the ground, so why would you hesistate to take a p-zombie from the Earth when no actual person has claimed them?

    Sometimes your family steals art you wanted, or your husband gets too obsessed with the weird hobby, so you get mad at them, but the art? It's worthless compared to family, just set it on fire or something so they stop obsessing over it. If it annoys you a little? Destroy it, another nice one will come along soon. Finished admiring it, and got bored? No reason to keep it near you.

    It's amazing how much more the books and myths make sense if gods don't think of mortals as people.

    The weird intersection is demigods - they're a bit like you, but a bit like mortals. And monsters/nymphs/etc, of course, which are truesapient but weak - maybe they're just puny gods.

    It'd also make it a little less horrifying if mortals didn't have souls - they don't get sent to Asphodel and Punishment. The flipside's that Hades would seem a lot weaker.
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      Maybe they're like non-conscious programs. Hades has billions and billions of shades that don't have self-awareness or the ability to question his orders. Whether shades can act on their own or have to be inserted into some kind of physical container in order to do stuff, that's still a potent threat.
      ```

      - u/ThatDamnSJW:
        ```
        That's true, but it also feels weird. Computers and animals don't have souls, why would humans?

        Hades still has all the dead heroes and villains, if he wants. Maybe he created his own automata ("ghosts") that act like mortals made of underworld stuff, and the ghosts we see in series are basically those. (I guess that's sorta what you meant?)
        ```

        - u/callmebrotherg:
          ```
          Copies of the dead? 

          Maybe Hades (the place) is like a records depository of all the lives that have been lived. Alan Turing may not have been conscious, but Turing still did things, and Hades has a copy of Turing's not-really-thought processes at the time of his death, to call upon whenever necessary.
          ```

          - u/ThatDamnSJW:
            ```
            That makes sense, yeah.

            Maybe the Isle of the Blessed is for copies that have shown themselves to be valuable, and Elysium's for real people. Asphodel's basically a trash heap.
            ```

            - u/callmebrotherg:
              ```
              I like this. 

              I'm not familiar with the series, so does this make Hades more powerful than in canon, because he has access to the sum total of human knowledge? And not just that, but its best problem-solvers, &c &c. 

              Is there a war on? Well, just let Hades get together all of his copies of the world's greatest generals. &c.
              ```

              - u/ThatDamnSJW:
                ```
                I think most of the other gods get a tithe of souls, for people that belong to them strongly. In canon, Ares got Confederate skeletons crewing a ship as minions for his daughter without going through Hades. It'd make sense if other gods got their own souls as they died.

                Hades might get last pick of human souls, which pisses him off the same way that he was pissed in canon - no respect at all, even if he doesn't have to manage a hundred billion people. He gets a bunch of demigods who couldn't ascend to godhood and whose parents wouldn't keep them, but no decent mooks.

                Thing is, everyone's a demigod, and he'd have them all - George Washington, Alan Turing, etc. But he wouldn't have any menial labor drones.
                ```

                - u/callmebrotherg:
                  ```
                  Rational!Hades would be able to deal with that, I'm sure. >:]

                  I'm not sure how things are in the series, but original!Hades was definitely the nicest of the Top Three, and I'd support any motion to set him on the throne. He didn't hate mortals, it just happened to be his job to rule over the underworld, and it was the way of things that mortals were gonna die. 

                  Now, there *was* the Rape of Persephone, but (1) we're comparing this against the far greater number of assaults committed by Poseidon and Zeus and (2) some early versions of the myth contest the idea that there was a kidnapping at all, and suggest that the problem was just that Demeter couldn't deal with her kid growing up.
                  ```

- u/MadScientist14159:
  ```
  The only optimal solution seems to be to suck up to the gods and act all "Greek Hero"y in the hope that they apetheosize you.
  ```

- u/okaycat:
  ```
  This is a really interesting idea.  The Percy Jackson world is very grim if you start to think about it.  Its nice that souls exist and there is a verified afterlife but it all goes downhill from there.  The majority of people get their memories wiped and sent off to Aphsodel (sp?)
  Only the truly exceptional get admitted to Elysium which isn't really most people.

  The worst part is you can't really overthrow the gods.  They are deeply conceptually tied to western civilization itself and have authority over domains such as fate, wisdom, war etc.   Good luck getting one over them.

  The p zombie idea is interesting but I find keeping the mortals sapient makes the story more meaningful because there are real people who are suffering.

  Maybe instead of your protagonist trying to overthrow the gods to bring about change they can work within the system.  Maybe try to convince the gods to be less assholish and maybe convince Hades to be nicer to the recently departed.  It would be nice to see a rationalist deal with a universe where all their assumptions about how the universe works is basically wrong.

  Good luck with your story.
