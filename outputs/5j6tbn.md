## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  My husband is obsessed with SSC's Moloch and he's proudly telling everyone of how we defeated him this week. 

  Like most households, our rubbish bins often end up overflowing before someone finally gives in and empties them. And it's a standard Moloch thing: we all benefit from having the bin emptied earlier, but nobody wants to be the one to do it because it requires effort and someone else can do it. 

  The big reason we don't like emptying the bin is because the wheelie bin outside is now kept out the back (so that way I can scoop our dog's poops directly into it), which means you have to go out the back garden, put shoes on, risk stepping in a poop that is recent enough not to have been scooped, etc. 

  Added to that our recycling bin is pretty small and often full of empty almond milk cartons (<--- gratuitous virtue signalling).

  So, we thought of an idea to fix it. The problem was that the wheelie bin is out the back, and we need the wheelie bin out the back because otherwise scooping the dog poops is almost impossible, since I'd have to transport each individual poop through the gate into the wheelie bin, and it's much easier to have the wheelie bin in the back yard and transport it to the front once a week for rubbish collection.

  So, we decided to buy a new bin to have out the back, so that way both bins were out the front. We ended up buying a bin that was bigger than our recycling bin and now our old recycling bin is out the back collecting dog poop while we have a much higher volume in our new recycling bin (plus it has a proper lid so the aforementioned dog can't get into it).

  I am not sure if it's going to work, we've only had it since Saturday, but my husband is *so proud of himself* for it, and yesterday when the bin was only about 80% full he went and emptied it and proudly proclaimed he is doing his part in the fight against Moloch.

  So, my take-away from this is that if nothing else, at least my husband now feels *good* about taking the bin out.

  Discussion question: where have you folks applied rationality to the general domains of housekeeping?

    That sounds like an excellent plan (and good virtue signalling there!)

    When I had a partner the most rational thing we ever did was agree we could each do the tasks we hated least, which turned out not to be the traditionally gendered tasks, but I didn't mind taking bins out half as much as he did so that was cool.

    Nowadays I find the most rational thing is to actually pay a friend's kid to do some cleaning. This means that unlike most cleaners I feel comfortable doing tidying and stuff while he's around and we can chat about science and gaming while we do it.

    Oh and [UFYH](http://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/) is pure gold.

      Yep, we've got a fortnightly cleaner, best decision ever. $80 for about three hours. I earn $45/ph (my husband's on $180/ph but as a lecturer most of his work is unpaid, and the hours aren't good...) so it's such an efficient use of time, and we can focus on the tidying rather than wiping our counters down and mopping and sweeping.

      A friend's kid would probably be an ever better idea, but with this, every second Wednesday I come home from work and everything's so nice (ooo, speaking of which, that's *tomorrow*!!!!)

    My favorite was switching from one large bin in the kitchen to two smaller ones. When one gets filled, someone takes it out. We have to take out the trash twice as often *but* we also always have half as much trash in the kitchen. We barely ever fill one up and start on the second one, because as soon as it gets filled up, someone takes it out, replaces the bag and we start using that bin again.

    The second one is really for emergency use.
    ```

      I'm glad it works for you, but we'd just have two overflowing bins e_e

  So. [This](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/12/15/scientists-reverse-ageing-mammals-predict-human-trials-within/) happened this week.

  I am going to remain pessimistic and assume that 10 years until human trials is wild optimism on the part of the scientists, but even so, that means *most* (?) of the people on this sub should live to see age-reversal be a thing.

  And it might not even take an FAI.

    Presuming it follows the same demographics as the rest of reddit, and the actuarial tables are accurate.

    And that that actually does what it claims.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Well...right.

      The study was done on knockout mice with a rapid aging disorder, so that's several variables to isolate out right there. Even if this method doesn't work on humans it's a start, and it's definitely something to be happy about for humans born in the next ten years with an aging condition.

  So I've been combing through a ton of cognitive psychology / behavioral economics for a school research project.

  I've found several good papers on trying to make better plans, teaching the proto-skills that CFAR's turned into their own techniques like Murphyjitsu.

  Similar to the Rationality 101 writeup, I'll be working on a Planning 101 writeup focusing exclusively on fighting the planning fallacy (which is in-line w/ my research).

  Unsure if anyone's interested in just browsing through the actual research papers themselves, but here's a link of my resources, if anyone wants to check out papers related to planning:

  My mom (who I will say I do not have a good relationship with) recently told me I am too analytical in my life. This is something I was already aware of: my brain refuses to turn off and is constantly trying to find the underlying patterns or reasoning behind anything. As a brief example, I once hooked up with someone I had feelings for since we were both barely into our teensâ€”and even as we kissed, half of my brain was trying to figure out what this meant for our relationship, whether this was a good course of action, how to proceed past this, et cetera.

  I will clarify that I am quite charming and charismatic in day-to-day life, and don't come off as any kind of strawman Vulcan or Sherlock-wannabe. (She also thinks I'm arrogant and prideful, but I think that an accurate appraisal of one's strengths is as important as understanding one's limits and weaknesses. I also don't go around bandying this information wily-nily. But I digress.)

  My question to you all is, have you experienced this inability to not analyse? Do you think it's negatively impacted you?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Have confidence in your ability, but make that confidence silent. It makes you look like a braggart or a ponce when you ask for help about your own intelligence. You probably analyze too much, but like hell anyone needs to *know* that. When in doubt, proceed according to a precommitted social code rather than snap judgement, even if it seems like a good idea at the time. You can update when you have sources and time to think.

    It might be a handicap to think to deeply on things - primarily because you might take issue with things that are ordinary or mundane. Avoid paranoia, pretend stress doesn't exist. Remember, your intention with every action is to *cut*, not to think about cutting, or to make preparations for the act of cutting. I think rationality has helped me in this regard, but for you it might be something else.

    Most of all, don't worry so much about what other people think that you stoop to asking for help or similar scenarios on the internet. This counts as "bandying this information around willy-nilly". I could have just as easily called you a fag and walked away - or otherwise posted this to /r/iamverysmart for internet points. Committing your worries to word means that they are real, if not physically, then in the pain that they will bring when others spring on your vulnerability.

    These are the rules I follow. I imagine if you've put as much thought into it as I have, you follow them as well.
    ```

  - u/None:

    I often experience it and it can degenerate into cynicism if I'm reading too much Evo Psych or economics recently. Concentration meditation also causes this kind of dispassionate analyzing that verges on cynicism/depression, which is countered well by compassion/metta meditation. Metta meditation makes me a lot...Softer/warmer and less focused on possible reasons for why people do things. 

    Being analytical can be helpful for many things, and can prevent people from taking advantage of you by manipulating, but it can make social life a little gray or depressing. 

    Wish you the best :)

    In popular parlance [(link)](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin):

    > The Munchkin is the Tabletop RPG player who plays the game to win at any cost, even if that isn't the point of the game. Perhaps the most ridiculed Player Archetype of all time, this player is rarely interested in the story behind the game. Indeed, his characters are little more than extensions of his own personality or whatever personality would give him the most bonuses.

    In how it's often used on r/rational, though, Munchkinning refers to seeing beyond the rules as they are societally constructed to see the rules as they are truly--it's not a purely negative description. A Munchkin finds edge cases or areas where the rules provide unique advantages not previously thought of. "Low Hanging Fruit" that people didn't even know where fruit. But also, a certain sense of *ruthlessness* when it comes to exploiting these things. 

    For example, let's say you have a character construction system that lets you take Flaws, and the more Flaws you take, the more bonus points you get to spend elsewhere. So, you take a bunch of Flaws, like maybe you take Poor Vision, and also Color-Blind, but you use the bonus points from those to gain Mage's Eye which gives you perfect vision anyways, and you still have points left over to put elsewhere. Or maybe you age your character up to age 35, when everyone gets +1 to each mental stat and -1 to each physical stat. This seems balanced, except your mental stats are all high--15, 16, 17--and it would cost like, 10 points to increase them. However, your physical stats are all low-- 8, 9, 10-- and it costs 1 point to increase them. So aging to age 35 gives you valuable stats that are hard to buy and frees up points to offset the cost.

    At the end of the day, John is playing Tuvo the Elf Ranger, Alan is playing Alaric the Halfing Rogue, Peter is playing Thoromund the Dwarf Fighter, and you're playing Marvolo the Magnificent, the Murky-Eyed Poor Vision Color-Blind mage-sight 61-year-old (he'll turn 62 and get more stat bonuses and maluses after he learns Polymorph) aquatic (for bonus swim checks, of course; this template has no downside so why not take it) human wizard 1 / sorcerer 1 / double-arcane thaumaturge (The rules don't prevent this).... etc

    In stories, it often means someone who grabs low-hanging fruit etc in this style.

  How do people deal with peer pressure? In reality I think this is a question that's quite close to the problem of living a long time. Given your current moral code and believing it is the right one how do you keep from becoming a monster as you would definite it given extreme time. More importantly maybe should you even have that as a goal.
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    Mostly avoided by not having many peers. :P

      Until recently this was my solution too, but it turns out to be flawed for long term use.
      ```

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      I have a better solution, I choose to only have *good* peers.
      ```

  - u/Dwood15:
    ```
    Finding peers that will pressure you to be a better person in general is a good start. Peers who encourage self destructive behavior are ones you should be wary of at best, and consider cutting off if they are bad.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I think this is very true.  If you're able to have some control over the people you associate with, finding people who encourage you to do the sorts of things you think would help you out is a pretty good idea.

      It's hard to avoid social forces, but it's definitely possible to turn them to they're more beneficial than if you didn't try to optimize them at all.

  I had a moderately startling thought while driving today.  What if the answer to human carbon emissions in the atmosphere is to simply stop recycling used paper, and start burying it?
