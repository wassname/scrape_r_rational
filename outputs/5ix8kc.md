  This dangerous looking [lady](http://konachan.com/post/show/130921/blonde_hair-bra-breasts-cleavage-demon-elbow_glove) totally is Lyra isn't she?

  In fact, you even have a small snapshot of her tail in a heart-shape at the bottom of the page [here](http://sadehall.tumblr.com/).....as well as a youtube video of the exact same picture higher up in the screen that I can't believe I totally missed seeing.

  Although...I was visualizing Lyra more like this [sweetie](http://konachan.com/post/show/180569/anbe_yoshirou-bell-bow-breasts-christmas-cleavage-) but pale.

    She actually spent a night during her incubation looking pretty much exactly like that last link as mentioned in chapter five, but usually she's more of an amalgam of the two.

      Have you considered commissioning any art of particular scenes or characters? I know I often end up planning the requests for my own stories by doodling a sketch and writing out clearly what I want more skilled artists to make for me...and then I decide to keep the money due to being a poor college student.

        Relentlessly. Actually, I've been sort of looking around for an artist with the style I want (anime, not too chibi but not hyperreal either,  willing to do explicit kinky monster porn for obvious reasons) to do this exact thing and haven't found one.

        The money thing is a thing of course, but I've been considering setting up some kind of donations-for-illustrations exchange to remedy that. Totally unscientific poll: please indicate interest here or in PM if you'd be likely to donate to such a thing.

  This speech (and behavior?) block thing is getting more and more fucked up. She wants to call her maker-lover "baby" and she has no reason to think that he wouldn't like it and yet she can't, and it seems like she can't even tell him that she can't. That breaks all the meanings of consensual.

  And even if Jack could release her from it, how would he ever know to do so? Judging from everything else so far she would be unable to tell him about this problem or even hint at it. I mean being made to serve is already iffy enough but this thing creates actual dissonance!

  When did it start by the way? Was it after the stone raft session, was it when she became an extension of his in a super-improv claiming in order to be able to use his sword or was it during the quickly thrown together ritual of summoning? The last one was, according to her words, supposed to last only for a few hours, which makes it even less consensual if whatever mind alteration happened there turns out to be permanent.

  On a different note, I'm really curious about what all the classifications mean and what the hierarchy between them is.

  * Demons/Spirits is the largest, including all kinds of stuff and Succubi seem to be an intelligent type of Demon. 

  * Succubi are sorted into (four?) Houses, probably since before birth, more like a blood line than something you really choose are get chosen to? At least as far as I understood her very ghost-seed was a Sade ghost-seed and chose Jack in part *because* of his kink, so the master/slave stuff is not solely the fault of his subconscious.

  * Sade Succubi seem to sort themselves based on their preferences. The Overlord/hench is a clear D/s thing. I don't know what Dres and Capricorn are or if they are Sade exclusive.

  * On top of that Lyra is a Hollow Heart which seems more metaphysically important than her Hench identity label. It seems that humans may be Hollow Heart too (people are guessing Jack is) but again I don't know if that is a Sade and Sade-incubator thing only or if Hollow Hearts can be found all over the Succubus Houses. We also haven't seen any other types in this hierarchy level yet. Just that according to the captain they are rare enough that staying out of their business is feasible and that Lyra could have a "no one understands me" phase meaning that most of her friends are probably also not Hollow Hearts. Then again, there is something called the Hollow Heart Abyss, which I *think* is an actual physical location, which in turn would point that it either is a Sade thing only or that it is located somewhere where the areas of several houses overlap. With several trillion Sade existing the second one sounds impractical at first but Succubi seem to learn fast travel and teleportation pretty early on.

  How much did I get correctly? And could you shed some more light on the classification hierarchy without spoiling anything important?

    I can't answer too much without being spoilerriffic, but you're asking the right questions about whatever is messing with her speech. Some other interesting ones:

    * We've seen that, though it might not work exactly as our narratrix describes, consent protection is definitely something people worry about. How *might* this be consensual?
    * What's the evidence that she's disallowed from telling him? Against? If she's able, why doesn't she say anything despite multiple opportunities?
    * Does this madness have a goal? Is it just stray magic or a developmental quirk of some kind? If this is 'for' something, what might it be trying to accomplish?
    * Based on how it seems to work on her speech, *have* we seen it modify her behavior? If not, why not?
    * What else is it doing than word replacement?

    As for classifications, think multiple overlapping independent taxonomies, but you're on the right track overall and don't really have anything *wrong*. The only thing I can say really without spoilers is, how do these things overlap? What types of combination make sense?

      > We've seen that, though it might not work exactly as our narratrix describes, consent protection is definitely something people worry about

      We have no evidence that the spiking Rocks, the first source of the seed-ghosts and whoever created the various Succubus-related magical rituals are all following the same prime utility function to a tee. For all we know consent is the ultimate goal for the Rocks even though the Succubus species was created with more important priotities while some of the rituals have specifically the goal of undermining the Rock detection system in a deep and fundamental way (like, say, removing the ability to not consent and rewriting the mind of a now former non-consenter).

      >How might this be consensual?

      If she lost abilities she wanted to have, didn't expect to lose and doesn't know exactly why she lost them (or even if she does, doesn't agree) then it can't be consensual. At least not as far as informed consent goes. And uninformed consent is worth crap.

      >What's the evidence that she's disallowed from telling him?

      Mostly the fact that she hasn't even though she loves him and it limits the ways she can show her affection and it bothers her. That and some of your subtle comments in previous threads like this one. I know that isn't definite evidence, but-

      >Against?

      I have none. Having no evidence for one hypothesis and some evidence for the other makes me skew towards the one I do have even slight evidence for.

      >If she's able, why doesn't she say anything despite multiple opportunities?

      From the very beginning she seemed to have trouble explaining stuff without prompting. Even before the first ritual. Sometimes she slips but she seems to think that's a bad thing. From my judgement of Jack's character it doesn't seem to be his specific kink to not be educated by his beloved property through her own initiative. And if it is that would be a pretty shitty character flaw that would honestly make me think less of him.

      But if I'm right and it isn't then the source is something else. It might be whatever makes a Succubus (Sade only?) into a Hench if that is something beyond mere in-post classification of preferences. It might be some other supernatural thing. Or it might be something else entirely with a source genuinely coming from Lyra's experience and education. Like for instance not wanting to scare Jack or turn him off and knowing that learning about some side effect of all this ritualism without time to acclimate and preparation can cause such things in new humans. But if that's true then she deliberately acted to make *Jack* agree to things without informed consent, which would be a whole other can of worms.

      >Does this madness have a goal? Is it just stray magic or a developmental quirk of some kind? If this is 'for' something, what might it be trying to accomplish?

      Can't compute due to lack of information. The only evidence for the existence of a greater goal is some of your previous comments and the meta-fact of this being a story posted only in the /r/rational subreddit, which by now has developed its own little set of tropes.

      >Based on how it seems to work on her speech, have we seen it modify her behavior? If not, why not? What else is it doing than word replacement?

      I don't know. We haven't seen her do a single thing not somehow explicitly to Jack's benefit in quite a while now. But then neither have we seen much evidence of her wanting to. So this may well be due to more deeply rooted stuff than this (relatively) new and superficial mental block.

      But a block on verbal speech only would be very weird. Except if for some reason the ritual (whichever one it was) was created specifically with the "feature" of replacing all of her euphemisms for her master with "Master". In which case I would call it weak-to-medium evidence that either the ritual wasn't created by some form of nigh-omnipotent utility maximizer or that said nigh-omnipotent utility maximizer is crossing off an arbitrary list or working towards a specific fantasy world rather than having one or more simple and logical end goals.

      >The only thing I can say really without spoilers is, how do these things overlap? What types of combination make sense?

      The lack of knowledge of almost any label other than those that would apply to Lyra within each taxonomy rank makes this hard to answer for now. We know that there are more Houses but we know next to nothing about any but the Sade. We don't know if the Overlord/hench dynamic is found in other houses. We don't know if things like Dres or Capricorn are exclusive or even in the same taxonomy rank as Overlord and Hench. About Hollow Heart we know nothing other than that Lyra is one, Jack probably is one, many others in this new community aren't, that it isn't always easy to be one, that there is direct metaphysical stuff involved with being a Hollow Heart and that there is *something* called the "Hollow Heart Abyss". We don't even know if there *is* anything similar in the same taxonomy rank slot or if it is a simple thing of everybody either being Hollow Heart or not being Hollow Heart.
