## [BST] How Powers change Perceptions.

### Post:

[BST]Thinking about writing a series of short stories on how having different superpowers would change your perceptions/experience of conciousness. For example, how the ability to perceive other minds would change how you see the world/how you feel in your own mind or how the power of teleportation would change how you view distance, and other such things. Any ideas for how other powers would change other perceptions?

  I think one of the biggest things comic books get wrong is the idea that only evil people would want to take over governments. Generally speaking most people in the US don't think the government is doing a great job, have ideas about how it could be done better, and don't think they could achieve those changes himself or that it could be easily done. Change that last part to *thinking it's* easily achievable because you have super powers and I think the situation would drastically change.

  The idea that you would have non-powered politicians controlling superheroes or superpowered people is absurd, it would very quickly become the other way around even with the absolute best intentions and possibly especially with the best intentions.

  *edit*
  Added in parts with the stars to clarify.

    I just had a discussion where I had to deal with someone going "well...there'll be a few ambitious malcontents but most people won't..." which is absurd. Comics have really tainted the conversation.

    People are inherently embedded in a political system. The idea that the system would *allow* them to escape first of all is not guaranteed and probably optimistic, let alone that they would go about never using their new powers to their advantage.

    And why not? At the end of the day human societies have a "cost of doing business" where we accept that certain people will be crushed. Certain people will be fucked by judges, be executed on the orders of foreign-backed dictators, get hit by cars shoddily designed and fail to get recompense, have to deal with a shitty municipal body. People talk about the glorious nature of the system but a lot of it is inconvenient, and annoying and runs cause no one can take it apart.

    Superheroes completely flip this on its head. The super won't be crushed, at the worst society will be.

    And these are just reactive supers. As you say, I certainly wouldn't tolerate a lot of the bs you have to tolerate if I was one of those supers basically approaching complete independence like Superman and I don't think all the self-serving bleating about "freedom" from American tv would change anyone's mind. Should your family suffer, starve or be inconvenienced for movie speeches?

    I do disagree that it'll be easy to effect good change though, especially in the real world. Well...perhaps change'll be easy if you have a big enough stick, but in terms of just effecting political change, the massive distrust would immediately put the brakes on most things you can achieve within the system.

    Think of Caesar and Rome; sometimes he wasn't necessarily wrong about a problem so much as people didn't want *him* to be the one dealing with it

    A person who starts out good might want to take over a government. But doing so by short-circuiting the defined processes to do so means you're morally at the same point as a military coup - there will be good people who will honestly think you are evil and attempt to remove you even if at the cost of your (or their) lives. At that point you either have to step back or do some fairly reprehensible things...

    ...or, in other words, it may be true that a good person might want to take over a government using superpowers. But, aside from being voted in, how can one do so while *remaining* a good person?

      Good is not the same as lawful. A good person is perhaps someone who takes actions with net good consequences. Also, there's no need to be the head of state to take over a government.

    Not unless the superpower directly related to the political process in some way, or the superperson was already politically-minded and used the power to show off, draw attention, or otherwise make people think they were pretty cool and voteworthy.

    Most powers, though, or at least the standard ones, don't really help directly with politics. You can't bench-press a policy and smear campaigns don't care if you're invulnerable. Politicians would absolutely still be able to control most people with superpowers in the same way they control people without them - through social structures and policy. If you're willing to follow the law and you want people to like you, that's half the battle won for the politicians to start with. And most random people aren't necessarily going to be super-smart or super-witty or actually want to be a politician if they get powers.

    (Reverse example: politician Nathan Petrelli from *Heroes* went out of his way to *not* reveal he could fly. No point in making the voters jealous or scared. Nothing to see here, just your totally normal representative who is totally a normal person just like you.)

    Someone who did want to get into the political process, though, either through running for office themselves or influencing existing politicians, might be able to do so via powers like mind control/influence, super-charisma, or (I guess) powers which let them rig the voting process. But honestly, those are effects which can largely be bought with money anyway, at least to a degree.

      Depends on how strong the super is. Sure, a lot of -TV especially- supers and so on can be held in check. 

      There comes a certain level of power though where a super does what they want, collects clients and followers and moves to defend them.

      > might be able to do so via powers like mind control/influence, super-charisma, or (I guess) powers which let them rig the voting process. But honestly, those are effects which can largely be bought with money anyway, at least to a degree.

      Degrees are important. You cannot buy the mind control powers of Professor X or the ability to fuck with people like Puppetman from Wild Cards. Seriously, look up some of the stuff he did to fast track himself to the presidency. 

      Now, Donald Trump may have skewed perceptions right now but it's not as easy to outright buy the presidency as it is to use magic or superpowers to get it.

    You know, I hear this view a lot, and it always baffles me. It assumes that no superpowered people are law-abiding. In a rational world I would assume you would have some supers who consider themselves ubermensch and try to take over the country. You would have far more supers who believe in the rule of law and try to prevent the evil supers from taking over the country. This is your standard hero / villains split.  It's exactly why only villains want to take over -- because the social contract related to appropriate methods of regime change is one of the most fundamental parts of a civilized nation. Once you use force to effect regime change you demonstrate that that's okay. Pretty soon you'll have revolutions brewing, other supers wanting their shot, etc. 

    Yes, you can construct worlds where it happens anyway -- if you have a world with one amoral God-level super and a bunch of bush-leagues, then the big one can take over. He'll still have to deal with passive resistance and coup attempts, but he can do it. The point is that these worlds were constructed to allow it. "Supers will inevitably take over" is not an always-true statement unless you choose it as an axiom.

    Not exactly. Even though so many people boast about toppling the government, they don't actual revolt against it, despite often having access to "superpowers" (firearms, home-made explosives). The reason is simple: there is always a fish bigger than them, which is army.

    Similar situation would take place in a world with superpowers. People on the higher end would be most likely integrated into the upper class of society as celebrities or just rich guys, since their abilities may be easily turned into cash.

    If a power would let you live comfortable and prosperous life, would you really throw it away for a small possibility of ruling a city, country or the world?

    Squadron Supreme explores the idea of heroes trying to overthrow governments to change the world, though I haven't read it and have only heard very good things about it. However, I have seen Superman vs The Elite (an expanded adaptation of the better named What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and The American Way?) that successfully deconstructs and reconstructs Superman's ideology when he encounters some new heroes that have good intentions but no respect of the law. It single-handedly managed to turn me into a Superman fan, so I highly recommend it.

      I despise Superman vs. The Elite. It's a cynical take-that at The Authority, which is kind of okay, even if they're right they do have their issues and are themselves pretty cynical.

      But, as a concrete argument for why you should act like Superman it's just bad apologia. Basically, you should act like Superman cause people who don't act like Superman are monsters. 

      It's the same dichotomous thinking that gave us "if you kill him you will be just like him"
      ```

      - u/trekie140:

        That is absolutely not the impression I got from it. I didn't agree with everything Superman did and didn't think I was supposed to. The Elite weren't monsters, they were well-intentioned extremists that pointed out Superman's failures and forced him to ask difficult questions about what he stood for. The movie is an indictment of moral simplicity from both the Lawful Good and Chaotic Good perspectives.

        What I love about the film was that it allowed me to understand what Superman represents and why he is so important. He's pure idealistic compassion and he has become a cultural icon because of that. That doesn't mean he can't deal with morally complex issues or that his methods are the only answer, it just means he exists as an ideal we can look up to and try to reach for. Superman gives us hope for tomorrow.
        ```

        - u/None:

          Let me see if my memory of the Elite's actions is clear:

          * They decided to go out and massacre the leaders of two countries cause they're going to war with one another.

          * They execute a criminal they've defeated cause a victim voted for it.

          * They decide to sadistically hunt and kill Superman cause he punched one of them.

          How exactly is there a balanced portrayal here? Yeah, Atomic Skull hurts people but it's partly cause of the situation the government put him in after Superman caught him, the Elite *directly* kill the leaders of two opposing countries for fighting, and just sorta expect it to work out, then decide to kill an iconic hero cause of an insult. 

          There's little morally threatening to Superman here, Superman's actions don't always work out, but the Elite's actions looked deranged at times. Just on a personal level, Superman can be trusted, the Elite cannot. 

          The story is there to validate Superman's position. Which is a thing that should always be noted with these sorts of stories; Superman is not going to become the Elite (or whatever they're supposed to represent), so the work finds a some strong-looking version of the arguments against his beliefs for him to defeat.

            I feel like your complaint is that the movie did exactly what it set out to do. You're right that the Elite are untrustworthy loose cannons that exist to validate Superman, but the Joker only exists to validate Batman in The Dark Knight. Superhero stories exist so that heroes can do heroic things, it's an escapist fantasy meant to emotionally resonate with the audience. Even dark deconstructions of the genre like Watchmen or Worm are about characters who keep trying to do what's right despite obstacles both internal and external. What did you want from the film that it didn't give you?

              Right. But that doesn't mean it it makes a good argument just cause it's defending its genre conceits,presumably  that's not all  you'd want in a r/rational discussion. 

              I don't mind characters trying to do the right thing, I dislike the narrative around this one  I dislike it cause it keeps showing up in discussions like these, often cited as a definitive argument. Along with that "jet powered apes" quote.

                I get where you're coming from, but that's kind of the problem with fictional evidence. You can only use it within the logic of its own universe. That's something I had to get past when I first got into comics, but once I did I saw that they had artistic value for what they are. Even if Superman vs The Elite isn't rational, I still think it's a well-written story that respected my intelligence and challenged my views while completely changing my mind about a fictional character I'd always found rather boring. If anyone would like to watch it, you can find it for free on KissCartoon.

  Being a speedster sounds maddening socially.

  Being able to see the future would make everyone else's choices seem highly irrational due to hindsight bias.

  Being able to split into multiple bodies would likely strongly disrupt how you view productivity, individuality, and more.

  Being able to float around as a ghost without body would change your impression of the mind body problem.

  Anything by Vernor Vinge or Peter Watts. Also the tropes on the [Starfish Aliens](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens) page. I know that this isn't what you are asking for, but writing about the mindset of an alien is simply a more extreme case of writing how super powers can oddly affect the human mind. So these references should be good for a starting point.
