## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I've found that doing exercises while listening to something boosts my productivity, but that the boost is proportional to how much of my attention is focused on what I'm listening to. If the content is conveyed slowly enough that by the time I digest a statement the next one still didn't arrive, the productivity is lower than it would otherwise be.

  So, recommendation request:

  Any fast-paced podcasts or audiobooks? Or podcasts in which complex material is conveyed in a very information dense manner, so you need your full focus in order to follow it? The topic doesn't matter. Much.

  For reference: I'd prefer something 1.5 times faster than Rationally Writing.

  (I know I can take any podcast and play it at 1.5x speed, but I'm wondering if there's a more elegant solution.)

    Listen to things at 2x or more.. It's what I do most of the time. Try not inferring which method is the most effective too early when trying new things, you'll get used to 1.5x speed soon but if you define it as optimal now it may never let you improve further..
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Yeah I saw "1.5x speed" and I am like "you are like little baby watch this"... I go as high as 2.6x now, depending on topic. The more information dense ones are definitely more like 2.1x though.

    What could possibly be more elegant than playing a podcast on *exactly the subject you wish to learn about* at *exactly the speed at which you just barely are able to understand it*? Beyondpod lets you increment the speed in 0.05x blocks, if your current app doesn't have that fine-grained control.

  I'm reading Worm, I'm approximately at the part where [Worm spoilers](#s "Coil reveals himself to the Undersiders and the Empire 88 goes crazy") and I would like to know from any readers if this problem I have with it improves later on. The problem being, my suspension of disbelief is already very thin about the protagonist and her team being still alive, since they went multiple times against superior enemies that should have totally ripped them to shreds. Lucking out once is one thing, but this seems now a trend. Unless [Worm spoilers](#s "this is somehow the work of Coil and his destiny manipulation ability - and Telltale's description of it suggests it shouldn't be the case - then it feels a bit like excessive luck on their part.")

    Minor spoilers (you already have enough information to deduce this):

    >!Yes, Coil is using his power to help them. He gives them different directions, or doesn't have one instance do anything, etc. His power is actually ridiculously versatile and OP (a lot of worm powers are). But with that said:!<

    &#x200B;

    No, it's a recurring pattern that only gets worse the further the story goes. Worm fell square into the trap of endless escalation. Taylor faces off against increasingly strong enemies and while victory is always hard-won and always exacts a price, she doesn't really get seriously hurt. For example, she gets shot a few times, stabbed, etc, but she's always able to either get it healed by other capes or have a surgeon take care of it. There are some reasons for this, but they're pretty thin.

    &#x200B;

    Major spoilers that you haven't read yet and can't possibly know:

    >!Superpowers come from parasitic alien "worms". The worms don't physically attach to a host, they link to it through some sort of dimensional thing. They're the ones handling the grunt work of actually controlling the bugs, but there's a degree of cooperation between worm/host that gives the host access to additional minor powers that would definitely make it easier to survive. This is explicitly mentioned later on, though it's never clear whether Taylor is truly aligned with her worm or not because she doesn't think about it. The worms want conflict and Taylor doesn't really see herself that way -- but whatever she \*wants\*, she's definitely in the thick of a lot of conflict. There's also other chessmaster capes moving Taylor around (she ends up being important due to how unique powers are). So there is \*some\* justification for her surviving, but not that much.!<

      > Worm fell square into the trap of endless escalation.

      Ouch, that doesn't bode well. Especially considering that her first sortie against Lung was *already* way in over her head. I expected the story to use that as a way to set a power ceiling for parahumans in this world, then scale back down and have her engage in smaller incidents. Instead every fight was even bigger and more dangerous. 

      There's also the fact that the Undersiders just don't seem to have a set of power suited for all-out fighting. Grue + Skitter with Tattletale's intel would be excellent assassins, but they're terrible for close quarter combat. Heck, Taylor is basically just a normal 16 year old girl. Brandishing a baton or a knife will hardly make her supervillain material when it comes to melÃ©e combat.
      ```

      - u/HarmlessHealer:
        ```
        Early on it's like that. Lung's power counters Taylor's really really well. But later... let's just say the villain lineup includes gansters, giant monsters, terrorists, giant robots, artificial intelligence, and finally gods. And that's just what I remember off the top of my head. 

        &#x200B;

        Most of the fights are like Lung -- she hangs back while someone else plays tanks, gets hurt when the enemy closes in, but ultimately wins by figuring out how to exploit a weakness.

          I really hope she ups her game by then. If a 16 year old defeats Cthulhu with a knife and a few spider bites I'm going to be very disappointed.

              My immediate thought was something along these lines:

              > "Wait a moment, Great Old One. You might find that destroying my world isn't that easy. Do you know about the Weaver? Ancient primal entity? Spinning the web of space and time and the thread of life with his thousand legs?"

              > "He's *technically* a spider."

    Not really. There are a lot of instances in the story where I found myself thinking "Okay, that was a really cool scene, but no. Taylor would absolutely, absolutely be dead (or in police custody) in this situation."

    It's a kind of suspension of disbelief that you have to apply when reading Wildbow stories.

    (eg, in Twig, every single fight against >!nobles (after the Duke's introduction) !< has them being severely handicapped to let the protagonists win)

    I don't want to spoil anything, but >!if it helps you with your suspension of disbelief I can say that there's a pretty good in-universe reason they haven't been killed yet!<, and it is (slightly more spoilery) >!related to Coil's power!<.
