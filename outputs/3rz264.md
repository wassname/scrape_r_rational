## [WIP][D][BS] National Novel Writing Month: Week 2

### Post:

This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for National Novel Writing Month, which is currently in progress.

* Want to check in your some progress?
* Want to talk about what you're writing?
* Out of ideas and want some help?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

  Just cleared 18k last nightâ€¦and finally hit my first major plot point. The buildup may have been drawn out, but I used it to establish worldbuilding and develop characters/character interactions.

  As I progress, I've become a lot more liberal with my use of placeholders, such as #charactername, or #thatthingImentionedduringtheintro, so that I can just keep writing without breaking my flow by going to check whatever it is, or spending time coming up with a name for a side character that just decided to show up. It makes for some pretty interesting scenes upon rereading. "I, #studentname, son of #mothername and #fathername, put forth 75 #standarddenominationsofcurrency towards my prediction of the #scientificnameforsomeflora being dead by the end of next #amIjustusingweeksormakingupsomeconfusingalternative."

    Congratulations on being ahead of the curve!

      Thank you! As I mentioned previously, my goal is less to write a certain number of words in one month, and more to write a certain number of words *every day*, so as to create for myself a habit that will persist, in some fashion, beyond the month of November.

      This is the first book I've written that I truly feel I'll be able to publish one day. Progress is awesome.

  For myself, I'm caught up on my initial deficit and trying to move the plot forward. After one more minor timeskip (the third) I think everything will be in place for the pieces moving. As always, the most current copy [is here.](http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html)

  Also, finished up the appendix for *Shadows*, which means that's no longer eating into NaNo time.

    [Curiosity-prompted questions (which you can ignore if you want):  ](#s "Assuming that Oaths don't improve mental abilities (from what we've seen), what use is there to an Oathkeeper (or the Rectory) in taking the Oath of Isolation?  Is there any disadvantage/catch to writing down a detailed description of a memory before sacrificing it (or of accidentally seeing the memory in another participant's mind), or of telling a victim of memory sacrifice what the memory had contained?  How many dark wizards start with stumbled-aross tomes (the scribe idea), versus trusted tomes received from proven practitioners?  How much of the mental armory came from people who experienced unusually-ecstatic nights of passion with the prince (or, for a family-friendly version, suddenly received a really delicious cake from the prince) and remembered nothing of it the next morning?")

    Just encountered this story, and all I can say is I'm surprised this is the first time I've seen it, because it is really good. I have to say I like this slightly better than Shadows, mostly because I find these magic systems more interesting. More personal preference than anything; your skill as a writer is clear in both stories. Well done. 

    Rowan... I can't help but admire his determination, cleverness and work ethic. Of course, he's taken some big risks, over and over, and eventually that's going to cost him. But in the mean time, I really hope he becomes king soon, because he makes for a great antagonist, and I'd love to see how he shakes things up.

      Glad you're enjoying it; it's still in really rough form and there are issues that will need correcting, but I'm pretty happy with how it's turning out so far.

  Oh, didn't realize it was time for this already. Regardless, I'm about halfway done with act 1 of my rationalist fanfiction, with act 2 pretty much finished. Only 4 more chapters to go and then I can start publishing weekly chapters! I gotta admit, I'm pretty exited.

    I'm excited rather than exited, but great work!

  ```
  Well, schoolwork killed my Nano aspirations.  Ah well, I'll at least write 10k words or so. Currently at 4k, results posted to /r/rational
  ```

  Well, looks like I am the poster child for the planning fallacy. 

  I had a great plan: finish *Induction* in October, write a romance for NaNoWriMo, use December to edit both of those and as much of the two remaining 2YE novels, publish all of it. There was some wiggle in there due to travel for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but it seemed doable. 

  Nope. 

  I'm still not finished with Induction, which means I haven't even started the romance -- this is both due to it ending up being longer than expected and to me having some writing days that produced a lot of required backstory (usually  "How does this power work"?) but little to no prose. 

  I will in fact have written ~50,000 words in November, but it won't be on the book it was supposed to be on. 

  Damn.
  ```

- u/brandalizing:
  ```
  Okay, this is ridiculous. I passed 20,000 words today, and am still in the middle of my Inciting Incident, which only even started two thousand words ago. At this point my book is going to need 250,000 words, easy, if I keep up with this pacing.

  Am I just writing a whole lot of bloated nothing, or is this normal? I haven't even been adding much description, just making some notes here and there and sticking my placeholder tag so that I can add it all in upon revision. I'd definitely appreciate some other people's wordcount-to-plotpercent comparisons, or some other form of assurance that, yes, sometimes your book is just going to be that long.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    The advice I've always followed is to start as close to the inciting event as possible. You want to launch into "the plot" as quickly as possible, because that (more than characterization and worldbuilding) is what's going to keep attention. One of the primary things I do when editing something that I've been freewriting is look for bits at the start to lop off.

    I would guess that you *do* have some bloat, since bloat is one of those things that editing is meant to remove and you haven't done much if any editing at this point.

    As to the question of plot to wordcount ratio ... that's a little harder to answer, and I'm not sure it's a good metric because I've always been of the belief that it doesn't matter how much plot you cover so long as it's gripping (and plot progression is only one element of what makes a thing gripping). But I can look at what I have and give you that answer:

    * Prologue (main characters are babies) covers about 6K words
    * Early childhood (main characters are five years old) covers 20K words
    * Middle childhood (main characters are ten years old) covers 12K words, though this needs to either be expanded or cut entirely
    * Setup to the Main Plot covers another 20K words

    I'm not sure that this answers your question though. The weird thing is, plot is fractal. You can take something like:

    > Two dark wizards kidnap the princess

    And then expand that plot point out into a dozen others. That could be the plot of an entire novel, if you wanted it to be. You could easily spend tens of thousands of words on just *preparation* for the kidnapping, scouting out the location and getting supplies, recruiting people, etc.
    ```

  I basically need a double word count day today in order to catch up. This November is turning out to be a really crappy time for NaNo for me for two reasons; I'm working with two different clients that have very tight deadlines and both want to monopolize my time, and I took on an obligation to host a large D&D game in mid-November, which means that I need to finish writing dialogue and descriptions for that (it's Hogwarts themed and should be fun). On top of that, I have two lingering obligations for *Shadows* that I'm going to have to put off, mostly because the thought of hitting deadlines at work and going home to hit more deadlines is enough to drive me nuts.

  Those are my excuses for why I'm 1.5K words behind right now. NaNo isn't really about making excuses. I think I can catch up and get a comfortable lead this weekend, if things go well.
