  My dude Hakram just canâ€™t catch a break. Shot from a trebuchet, launched at the bastion, and now dragged by Archer into an exploding adventure.

  They all call Catherine mad, but there isn't not a single bit of sanity in the fifteenth. Only madness, glorious and beautiful madness. By the time Procer comes knocking, every regular in the Fifteenth will be addicted to the smell of goblinfire in the morning.

  I can see why Robber and Nauk both fell in love with Pickler, that was beautiful.

  Seems like Cat's crew is doing some real work while the old legions are getting spanked. With the explanation of the legion structure at the beginning, I think it's more likely that Black is behind the assassinations. 

  If Warlock manages to plug the Greater Breach the Fifteenth could bail out the other legions and earn their legitimacy. Having said that, it's curious that the two goblins were left alive... goblin conspiracy is a go? Either that or maybe Black didn't assassinate the generals needed for the victory.

  Hope we get back to Cat next chapter.

    Good observation that Goblin generals did not die.

  Stray thought from the last chapter: the 'instant raging undead' ritual that the rebels pulled off in the end of the first interlude is awfully close to what we've seen of Imbricate. I mean, this is Diabolist, a little overlap, especially with an open Hellgate on the field, might be well within her power, but still.
  ```

  ```
  Pickler's POV sent me back to war college days: glory and gore with hilarious twists. Such fun.
  ```
