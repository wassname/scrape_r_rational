  Me near the story's beginning: Oh, this is probably going somewhere typical. Juniper falls for the princess while the plucky best friend is left on the wayside, sucking up her feelings for the sake of the group's unity. 

  Me midway: Huh....well Fenn's loyalty is much higher but it's still probably AmaryllisXJuniper OTP

  Me now: ....goddammit, /u/cthulhuraejepsen subverted it! He goddamn subverted it! 10/10 did not expect a full on subversion. I expected maybe he would bang Fenn but overall regret it because he cared for Amaryllis more, Fenn's heart would be broken but she'd get over it eventually and so on. But nope. Juniper chose. Props to that flower named guy.

    /u/cthulhuraejepsen even subverted the [First Girl Wins](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins) trope where it's usually the first girl introduced who ends up as the protagonist's One True Love.
    ```

    - u/nytelios:

      Too early to say that. The subversion could go *n* levels deeper! In this cruel cruel world, I wouldn't be surprised if it's a battle royale where [Last Girl Wins](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastGirlWins). Their relationship being established so (relatively) early is also triggering all my pessimist flags and I like Fenn :(
      ```

  - u/therealflinchy:
    ```
    I think it's going to continue to be very realistic as it has been, they're both damaged characters in terms of relationships, and this is going to be a healthy healing rebound where it amicably ends eventually.
    ```

  I like this.

  It's (so far) a subversion of a harem romance. Instead of Juniper dating both Fenn *and* Amaryllis, we see Juniper faced with possibilities and making a choice. Not to say that I dislike the idea of harems (they're like candy-stories, fun to read but very unrealistic) or that I'm hoping it does turn into a harem story later on. But I liked how it could have gone either way (Fenn, Amaryllis, or both) with it keeping me guessing.

  Thanks /u/cthulhuraejepsen for writing such a good story loaded with so many subversions of the usual tropes and cliches.

  >From the age of nine, Juniper Smith began filling notebooks with his worlds, at first places of fantastical imagination, but later with each as an expression of some theme or idea that momentarily grabbed his interest. Over the course of eight years, he shared these worlds with his friends through twice-weekly sessions of tabletop gaming. Now at the age of seventeen, he finds himself in Aerb, a world that appears to be an amalgam of those many notebooks, stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world is trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.

  This marks the end of Book III, at roughly 110,000 words, just shy of the 250,000 word line. There won't (shouldn't) be any discontinuity of publication going into the next "book"; those divisions are mostly there as waypoints so that the kind of people who like to binge-read in chunks have logical stopping/starting places to do that.

  I might be cleaning up the work a touch in the next few days in order to ensure that people aren't running into problems on mobile or the downloaded formats; this mostly means ensuring that there's no dependence on the custom CSS or character sheet hovertext.

  ----

  If you're a CSS/HTML wizard and have Ideas for how you would redo the character sheet in compliance with [AO3 available options](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5191202?view_full_work=true), which doesn't rely on custom CSS in the work skin, and which works for AO3's "Download" button in EPUB/MOBI/PDF/HTML, let me know, because those are the constraints I would ideally be working within. (Changes to the character sheet would have to be reflected in the text, but that's mostly a non-issue because of how rarely it's been described.)

    Told you posting to TopWebFiction would be worth it :P And not only is the position well deserved, I fully expect it to climb.

    (Also, I've noticed that your style is to never have post-chapter author's notes, which, to be fair, makes the text a lot easier to read. Though if you'd like to make an exception for the end of a book, you could include the TopWebFiction link on AO3; it doesn't eat links like fanfiction.net does.)

      You know, I'm continually surprised that people actually like this story. I have a fair amount of confidence in my ability as a writer, but I kind of figured that I'd be a hundred thousand words in and still met with either deafening silence or maybe even "ugh, is this thing still going?". There's always this worry that people will just ... not actually click on things, or that they'll hit some snag early on and leave without the writer having any idea why that happened.

      (Some of those people you want to leave, because this is not a story for them, and if they stay after they should have left, they get unhappy and like to vent about how much they don't like this story that was trying to signal them away.)

      Anyway, I'm very grateful to everyone for reading, and especially for those who engage with the text, which is not something that I think a writer can count on.

        I've read all of the stories listed in the top of topwebfiction and the only one I had ever really connected with was Mother of Learning. I think Worth the Candle is now clearly in that category with MoL. The way Juniper analyzes situations is so compelling and the world and its characters are a joy to discover. 

        The only risk I see is that there are so many open storylines and possibilities right now that there's a risk of not being able to tie everything together at the end. It looks like you have a lot planned out so Ithough so I know you'll do a great job. I'm excited to see where this goes :).

    Is inline CSS okay? The HTML guide you linked seems to imply that it's allowed, but then the example seems to show that it doesn't work.

    The FAQ isn't clear about this at all.

    It looks like the .mobi format is based on HTML 3.2, and it has very limited table support. On the other hand… it's hard to tell.

    I'm guessing the short answer to this is just, “No, inline CSS doesn't work.”

    ---

    I'm going to edit this as I think about this more.

    ---

    It's not just the styling. Tables have to be pretty tiny before they work well in an ebook. Even reading on my computer the tables are pretty much illegible in epub or mobi format.

    You could turn it into a list, though that's awkward in its own way:

    ### 5 – PHY – Physical: Your body and physical existence in the world. Governing stat for all physical skills and the three physical abilities.

    ##### 4 – POW – Power: How much force you can exert. Used to break down doors, bend rebar, or shove someone out of the way.

    * 1 – Unarmed Combat
    * 3 – One-handed Weapons
    * 
    * 1 – Improvised Weapons

    ##### 4 – SPD – Speed: How fast you move. Used to juggle knives, race over rooftops, or do cartwheels.

    * 
    * 0 – Dual Wield
    * 5 – Pistols
    * 

    ---

    Do you really need all of that information? Could you cut out the tooltip information?

    ---

    Maybe you could keep the table, but arrange the skills vertically?

    force | a | table
    ---|---|---
    5 – PHY | 4 – POW | 1 – Unarmed Combat
     | | 3 – One-handed Weapons
     | |  
     | | 1 – Improvised Weapons
     | 4 – SPD |
     | | 0 – Dual Wield
     | | 5 – Pistols
     | |
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      I think tooltip info gets moved to the start of the second chapter, and if you're not on the HTML version, that's the last you ever see of it until the text mentions some part of it explicitly. Originally all of the in-text all-caps mentions of attributes had tooltips, not just the ones in the character sheet, but that was a pain in the neck and I stopped doing it within the first month.

      I actually think that one solution to the tables might be to have several "independent" tables that gets "stitched together" through custom CSS. That seems like it would work though; the table consists of six columns, which would then be split up into three tables of two columns each.

      The problem with a list is that it would have ~50 entries on it, which is a lot of text to wade through; on desktop, this is fine, because you don't have to look at it if you don't want to, and it represents what it needs to without taking up too much screen real estate.

      I'm probably going to have to play around with creating a "test story" and then downloading and tweaking repeatedly.
      ```

      - u/renegadeduck:
        ```
        You might change the attribute abbreviations to actual words, e.g. POW → Power. It makes it a little more obvious.

        Yeah, I get the issue with the list. I was trying to figure that one out, too.

        I thought about transposing the table, but that actually makes it wider because of the length of the skill names. That might help with splitting the tables up, though… you could have one table for each overall attribute. Then just set `float: left` and you're good to go. Well, good to spend a couple of hours tweaking it, anyway.

        Another way to do this is to make it an image. The idea makes me sad, but it might be the most practical. You might even be able to use SVG, though I have a feeling that mobi doesn't support them and Ao3 won't convert them to something mobi does support.

        Hit me up if you need CSS help. I used to be a professional web developer.

    It's a bit of a shame that your current format is so incompatible with mobile or e-book formats. I find the hovertext tables a neat stylistic departure from the visual information clutter/overload of some other litrpg's.

    I thought /u/renegadeduck's format for a list was a good place to start. If you want to conserve space, you can keep it in a partial table format. 



     &nbsp;| PHY - Your body and physical existence in the world. Governing stat for all physical skills and the three physical abilities.|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp;|
    :------ | :-: | ------: | -----:|
     &nbsp;| POW - How much force you can exert. Used to break down doors, bend rebar, or shove someone out of the way.|  &nbsp;
    &nbsp;1-Unarmed | 2-Onehand | 3-Twohand | 4-Threehand
     &nbsp;| SPD - How fast you move. Used to juggle knives, race over rooftops, or do cartwheels.|  &nbsp;

    Etc. (Without reddit's chunky table format)

    Or you could opt only to have the descriptors in the first character sheet of the story/book.

  > “I know,” nodded Amaryllis with a soft smile. “That made it easier to kindle the flame. I fantasized about what it would be like to kiss you, or to have you hold me. I tried to imagine what it would be like to have you take my virginity, and I tried to imagine sex with you as this positive thing that I wanted with all my heart.”

  I tried to crush a crush by forcing a crush on someone else like this once. They were halfway a stranger, so they were safer to be attracted to. Do not recommend. It basically worked, but in retrospect it was a really dumb thing to do.

    > Still, this is a little concerning too.

    I'd say it's the sanest thing she said the whole chapter, for her own sake. This is she saying "bad plan was bad, I will not go foward with it". Sunken Cost Fallacy the way out of stupid scheme, deal with the damage that is alrealdy done and get on with life.

    - u/TheGuardianOne:
      ```
      Well, there was the pre-battle conversation where she found out that her power level will always be in line with Juniper, AND about Juniper and Fenn's mutual interest... So maybe less "bad plan was bad" and more "this isn't a good idea anymore".
      ```

  Another excellent chapter. Fenn is a continual delight, and I like the characters deliberately averting the standard "Previously revealed secrets are exposed to the wrong person at a critical moment" bs.

  - u/None:

    I think it's partly that, maybe even largely that, but also Amaryllis having an excuse to talk about her feelings and let her guard down or be vulnerable in a way that she could justify to herself as necessary.

  Fenn continues to be, well, Fenn. Delightful, annoying and delightfully annoying.

  > [conversation with Amaryllis]

  That was certainly a fascinating reveal. Not sure how I feel about all this yet.  
  I was guessing Amaryllis was keeping the option open for some kind of romance with Juniper, but not as to the lengths she had gone to to make it a possibility.

  > [first kiss]

  That was suprisingly intense and unexpected. Very well written.
  ```

- u/Saintsant:
  ```
  This was pretty painful to read, as someone who's been rooting for Amaryllis, but the in-depth exploration of her motives and rational treatment of romance just heightened my respect for her character. Comparing her ruminations to the unicorn's power was an elegant way to frame it, since it was the climax of Amaryllis' arc. Very melancholy, despite a decidedly uplifting ending with Juniper and Fenn; "For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these, 'It might have been.'"
  ```

- u/MarkArrows:
  ```
  /u/cthulhuraejepsen Thank you for resolving the romance, and handling it in such a rational way!

  ... Trying to get a read on this.
  Amaryllis is either a Kinsey 5-6, or entirely Asexual, and either way,  got extra issues on top from being a princess and, well, likely some trauma from the unicorn abduction when she was a child. 

  I am betting on "GAAAAY" because that would be funnier. High on compersion, too.

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    What made you conclude Amaryllis is gay/asexual from what she said? She always assumed she couldn't marry for love due to her heritage (A common and practical belief that many nobles hold because it's **true**) and she just didn't really have any sort of natural romantic inclination towards Juniper. That seems to be all we can derive from her statements in this chapter. 

    I'm not saying it's an issue if she is gay or asexual; I just don't think we have the evidence to make either of those conclusions.
    ```

    - u/-main:
      ```
      > What made you conclude Amaryllis is gay/asexual from what she said?

      She didn't expect sex with him to be anything other than a chore. It wasn't like she was planning to use him for power, and then *also* have some bedroom fun with him as a part of that. Why not enjoy the man you're planning to seduce? Why not at least hope that it'll be nice? Is there anything wrong with him, which would forever kill any chance of even okish sex? 

      As far as I can tell, yes, there's something wrong. And it's that he's male. She didn't have any specific objections -- didn't start talking about physical or personality traits of men -- except that she's not really into men *in general*. She talked about a dream of being  a woman who was more into men -- not just Juniper.

      It's not that she didn't love him. It's that she didn't even think using him to ease her lust was any kind of possibility, because she doesn't have that lust. Maybe she just has an extremely low libido? But there's a point at which it's so low that a person is pretty much ace anyway. 

      Although apparently she did manage to convince herself she was into him, at least a bit, which is evidence against her being gay or ace.
      ```

      - u/Agnoman:
        ```
        > evidence against her being gay or ace.

        There's also this line:  
        "..started to see something in you. There was a glimmer of a real spark when I looked at you.."   

        And also the:  
        "I didn’t feel anything like attraction to you when we first met"    
        Which, especially with the surrounding context of "You grew more handsome" which was just thrown sort of thrown in there, suggests she might find him attractive now.

        Plus Juniper's put a few points into MEN and INS and didn't come to to those conclusions, or really speculate on them/ pick up that sort of vibe. (Which is pretty weak, as evidence goes, but might still be worth noting).

        I was definitely picking up on the same things as you though, and was/am wondering about her sexuality.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I think there are two little pieces of phrasing:

      > I don’t have experience with men. I don’t have that natural spark that Fenn does either, that raw sensuality, the way she can effortlessly draw the eye.

      and

      > [if I had been] more craving of a man’s touch

      That first line has the ambiguous "**the** eye", which might mean Amaryllis' eye, or Juniper's eye, or both of them jointly, or a neutral observer (and even if you told me that a neutral observer would naturally find something attractive, I would probably take that as a reflection on what you find attractive). The inference from both lines might be that her use of "a man's touch" or "experience with men" was meant to apply *only* to men, though it's again ambiguous.

      Edit: I do take those bits of phrasing as being men in general, not just Juniper, but it's still somewhat ambiguous.
      ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        Those bits, and also, the way she talks about sex with Juniper as something which stirs feelings of revulsion.  

        Juniper is - at this point - a fit, intelligent, young man of appropriate age who has been well trained to behave respectfully by a previous lady who is on another planet, which implies he has likely also been taught to be a considerate lover. 

        More, they have been through several adventures together, and they get along.  

        Just, all around, taken together, the prospect of banging him should not be something to dread if she had much of a libido aimed at men at all. 

        Also, just a lot of her interactions with Fenn?
        ```

        - u/dalitt:
          ```
          Yes, and IIRC Amaryllis suggested running through the woods naked with Fenn while she was high on unicorn blood.  I think this is also a big hint.
          ```

        - u/Kishoto:
          ```
          I did find her remarking on Fenn's sensuality kind of odd, considering that Fenn makes no overt attempts to be sensual (unless you count the nudity, which I moreso see as her being really comfortable with herself) 

          In re-reading the chapter, I do find the possibility a lot more possible. She makes it very clear she simply wasn't into Juniper but she also does seem to imply that she's not big on hetero stuff. So I'm more inclined to believe your hunch is correct :)
          ```

          - u/jaghataikhan:
            ```
            She definitely falls somewhere on the spectrum of:

            1) Not into Joon 

            2) Not into guys

            4) Not into anybody 

            Originally I thought it was just #1. Given some of the things people pointed out, #2 is starting to sound like a distinct possibility. #4 would probably take the most proof given its the most strict claim

  Something about Mary's confession seemed to parallel one of Fenn's failed romantic encounters:

  >“So I thought I would be that to you,” said Amaryllis. “If you tried to kiss me, I would kiss you back, and if you wanted to fuck me, then I would --” she looked to me, “Endure it,” she finished, apparently not pulling any punches. “I would get through this thing that I didn’t want to do, and I would learn to like it, or at least learn to not visibly dislike it.” She folded her hands in her lap. “I’m aware of how that makes me sound,” she said.

  >“Kind of makes me feel like crap,” I said. That wasn’t the half of it. It wasn’t her saying she didn’t want to have sex with me, it was the idea that she would still her instinctual response of recoiling from me. That made my heart drop, not because of what it said about our personal relationship, or just our friendship, but what it said about her.

  Fenn's incident:
  >“Well, that guy is the reason why,” said Fenn. “He seemed normal enough, at least by my standards, or the standards I had then, and it was going well, but when it came time for us to have sex, after I had undressed, he was there between my legs, staring, poking, and prodding. Like I was just this thing to him. I can’t even describe how revolting I felt. Maybe he thought he was … I don’t know.” 

  Anybody else getting that vibe?
  ```

  - u/Icare0:
    ```
    Nah. The guy was a creep. 

    Mary merely abhors the idea of having sex with Joon, but tried to manipulate herself into seducing him anyway because, as she perceived it, it was the only way to get more power. It's horrible for completely different reasons.
    ```

    - u/jaghataikhan:
      ```
      Oh, no argument about that guy being a bona fide creep. It's more the almost clinical sense of detachment I see in both (no actual *joy* or *connection*), with the effect of making Joon/Fenn feel really dehumanized (de-semi-elf-ized?) and crummy about themselves
      ```

- u/jaghataikhan:

  What's the best way to subscribe for future story updates for those of us without an AO3 account?
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    Well ... currently, your best option is to just check every once in a while, which is kind of a pain in the ass. A story-specific RSS feed is on the AO3 timeline, but it doesn't seem like it's very close.

    Alternately, you could set up an HTML page change detection on [the table of contents](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/navigate) using something like [changedetection.com](https://www.changedetection.com/), which I can't vouch for.

    (It would be possible to set up a manually edited/updated RSS feed if I had somewhere convenient to host it, but that would be a pain in the neck for me. Less of a pain in the neck, but more of a timesink, would be to automatically shoot story update e-mails to a bot that would then update an RSS file ... which is a hackey solution and would still take time I didn't want to devote to it.)

    So basically, sorry, there isn't a good way.

  > “So I thought I would be that to you,” said Amaryllis. “If you tried to kiss me, I would kiss you back, and if you wanted to fuck me, then I would --” she looked to me, “Endure it,”

  > “I know,” nodded Amaryllis with a soft smile. “That made it easier to kindle the flame. I fantasized about what it would be like to kiss you, or to have you hold me. I tried to imagine what it would be like to have you take my virginity, and I tried to imagine sex with you as this positive thing that I wanted with all my heart.”

  Shit. This is both horrible and insane on so many levels. Had to stop reading and type something. Holy shit.

  So she basically tried to gaslight herself into a pavlovian mindset that would allow her to manipulate someone else into a marriage for the sake of her ambition. I'm at a loss of words to try and describe how idiotic this scheme is and how power hungry must she be if that was something that could come up as an option and not be immediately dismissed as a horrible idea. It would be a really, really crappy thing to do not only to Joon but to herself as well. The psychological damage by itself would make the plan not worth it. 

  And now imagine what would happen to the kingdom, ya know, the reason the considered doing all this crap for, if the plan didn't work as foreseen and the relationship ended in a obvious and explosive way shortly after they were estabilished as rulers.  Not pretty. And that end seems kinda likely since she increased her Loyalty that many levels just for knowing she didn't have to follow the plan through, that there was another way.

  Oh, and speaking about the Loyalty increase. She only spoke about all this crap after knowing that manipulating herself into a mindstate that would allow her to manipulate Joon wasn't her only endgame. I know she claims she is speaking about this now because of the unicorn blood, and that this is the first opportunity, but she kinda had the time to speak about it before the loyalty increase if she really wanted to. I don't know whether she is speaking the truth and she is confessing this because her secrecy was compromised, or this is just her aborting the plan because literally anything else has cropped up as an option, but either option just smell like different shades of shitty. I guess the second one is kinda less shitty if you squint and look at it sideways.

  She isn't exactly a bad person per se as an ally but god, what a nutjob. I dunno if you did it on purpose, but way to cut all interest I might have ever had in a Joon/Mary ship, /u/cthulhuraejepsen .

  Ok, rant over. Back to the chapter.

  > Okay,” she said. She shivered slightly, and her hands clung to my waist. “I’ve given it some thought. One date, and we’ll see where it goes from there.”



  YES, PLEASE. I'd rather read about Joon and Grak making out than the idea that he *might* end with Mary.

    Yeah, it's sickening but it's a shit world and she was born into the unenviable position as first princess in a ruthless primogeniture-based dynasty. So either she gives up and dies (option B: forced royal intermarriage) or everything she does by now is a study in political maneuvering and maximizing any advantage. Gaslighting and Pavlovian conditioning might be a bit of a stretch, but self-manipulation/deception commonly occur in arranged marriages where spouses convince themselves that they can grow to love the other.

    > And now imagine what would happen to the kingdom, ya know, the reason the considered doing all this crap for, if the plan didn't work as foreseen and the relationship ended in a obvious and explosive way shortly after they were estabilished as rulers. Not pretty.

    You're assuming divorces happen in Anglecynn (and that marriages of love are commonplace in the sovereign heirs). I'm getting the impression any "explosive" endings are resolved with a quick dagger in the underdog's back.

    Amaryllis doesn't seem like a pure megalomaniac. She's invested herself into the political game all her life and now that she's out, her situation is just sad. We don't know why she rejected the marriage with Larkspur, but she's probably always expected to marry for power. Then Joon comes along who's the *perfect* candidate as Uther's second coming, but in the process of figuring he's a decent guy to marry after all, he's ended up with Fenn. 

    Still, I find her hard to read. Mainly because everything points to her being an amazing actor and I can't shake the feeling that her responses are premeditated to the point of always being acts.

    I understand that you are rather disturbed by Mary's behavior and plans regarding a relationship with Juniper but I think that it is important to also understand that this kind of thing is very common. Throughout human history woman marrying men that they were not in any way attracted to for the purposes of personnel security or familial profit was the default. Annabeth was simply following a pattern of behavior used by woman throughout human history. The fact that this is considered disturbing in our current civilization may be a good thing but we should not ignore the long historical legacy in which it was the only option for many women.
