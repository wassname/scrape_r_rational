  I'm back! Rational elements begin in chapter 3, which I just posted today.

  Fling a Light was my extremely strange Worm AU in which Taylor Hebert, AKA Tesseract, concerns herself with fighting the Endbringers and trying to economically revitalize her city. Well, it's back, with a tighter focus on Endbringers and economics.

  As a big fan of the premise (particularly the first Fling A Light re-write), I'm very excited by the first few chapters. 

  General comments- Taylor feels much more well-developed in this version, although also not as proactive or driven. And the original version focused on economics in the form of setting up a global transportation network, which seems to be completely absent so far. I'm interested to see the new direction the economics focus takes. Also, great job with the AU- the amount of detail felt perfect, just enough to show that this is radically different and pique interest without going exposition-heavy.

  I do like the fleshing out Taylor's power and particularly chapter 3 for its development of the portal mass launcher technique; that felt like it came out of nowhere in the previous version with the Simurgh, although maybe that was intentional because it was a cool reveal. Either way, it was interesting to see it being developed in this version (the limitations seem more grounded in physics than the original version of the technique).  

  Last, three chapters isn't much to judge but I will say I worry that so far the narration so far feels a bit "jerky," with the reader being introduced to and pulled from quickly learning about Taylor's like and "Taylor protesting" to "Taylor fighting Endbringers" very quickly. It felt like it was settling down a bit by the most recent chapter, though.
