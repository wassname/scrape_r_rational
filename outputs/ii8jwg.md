## Dafuq is going on with everyone on AskReddit being so irrational?

  There's a reason r/AskReddit has a dedicated \[Serious\] flair.  With ordinary questions, the intent is purely to entertain.  Even the most creative answer to that question wouldn't be as widely appreciated in terms of enjoyment value as humour.  I don't think any of them, if they got that power, would choose to attend sales pitches, or go to work as a pharmacist.  They're not being irrational, they're being funny, because the point with the question isn't solely to munchkin.

  random internet commenters on popular subreddit are not expert munchkins, news at 11

  To be fair, the question was "how do you use it to get rich," not "how do you use it to improve the world." Using it as a lie detector has limited wealth-generation power because you have to be physically present. I guess you could rent yourself out to the FBI or whoever and get them to pay you a salary that's greater than whatever you make paying someone $10/lie to lie to you all day, but that process would take a long time, during which you could have been racking up the Benjamins.

  EDIT: Also, exposing yourself to an alphabet-soup org for cash is probably a bad idea in the first place. It's highly unlikely they'd just let you walk around free once they realize you're a perfect lie detector.

  Because using it to shift through every single thing anyone says to you is too much time and energy for something that might not be that big a deal. Sure if you suspect your SO is cheating on you then it might occur to you to use it as a lie detector. But 90% of the time this is basically a passive source of free money with minimal effort, so it makes sense to sit back and let it do its job.

  does the lie have to be understood?

  If not, have someone rig up a speaker and make a computer lie to you at extreme speeds to get some cash

  can it predict the future?

  this horse will win the race etc...

  &#x200B;

  can it handle universal truth? 

  use it for research. "string theory is a more accurate description of reality than relativity..."

  Ways to make money as a perfect lie detector... maybe high stakes poker?  Be a chatty kathy and get them to tip their hand?

    I did not take the full five minutes to come up with this idea, I'm at work, be nice

  AskReddit? Rational? Objection! Counsel is assuming facts not in evidence!
