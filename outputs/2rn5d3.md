## [RT] "Red Legacy" short story (or: I am published!!!)

### Post:

Asimov’s Science Fiction has purchased one of my stories!!! This is the first thing I’ve written to be published. I’m very proud. :)

It is “Red Legacy”, on page 48. In bookstores now, or there's links to get electronic copies [at my blog](http://www.deathisbadblog.com/i-am-published/). Unfortunately it isn't available free online anywhere. :( Very sorry. Asimov's has all print rights to it for a while. It appears in the February 2015 issue of Asimov’s, which is actually out right now despite the "February" dating.

I’m not sure one can call it Rationalist Fiction, but it is IMHO at least rational. It follows a Soviet mad scientist during the Cold War era. If anyone here gets their hands on a copy and reads it, I'm really dying to know if you think it fits the "rational" category, or if it's just SF.

For those who'd like to know, I first submitted the story to Asimov's on 2/28/2014. Official publication date is 1/6/2015, so just slightly over 10 months to get a short story published via traditional dead-tree publishing. It's a long friggin wait. I dread ever trying to get a novel published.

  Congratulations!! Your pride is entirely justified. Traditional publication is still important and it's great to see so many digital options available.

  This is a phenomenal achievement. Asimov's is one of, if not *the* biggest names in the field and very hard to get into. Their pages are mostly filled with established writers and a few up-and-comers -- to be in that latter category is a a real mark of accomplishment. Congratulations!

  Dude congrats! I wish I could get on your level. Here's hoping this leads to many more successes!  :D

  Congratulations!  I'm a big fan of your HPMOR podcasting works, your blog and youtube clips from Toastmaster(?).
