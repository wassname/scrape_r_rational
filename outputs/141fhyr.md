## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I'm looking for videogame fanfiction. Whether it's Skyrim or Stellaris or any other genre, I'm interested, as long as it's well written. Some video game fanfics I particularly like are:

   - [Factory Isolation (Factorio)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.404479/)
   - [King in the long night (Stellaris)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-in-the-long-night-asoiaf-got-stellaris-uplift-project.578392/)
   - [Are you not sufficiently comfy? (Stellaris)](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12676114/1/)
   - [Ghost in the city (Cyberpunk)](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/62125/ghost-in-the-city-cyberpunk-gamer-si)
  ```

  - u/lucidobservor:
    ```
    A strong +1 for The World As It Appears To Be, mentioned above. Otherwise, from glancing through my bookmarks:

    - [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/) is set in the world of the Dungeon Keeper games, though I'm not sure it really counts as "videogame" fiction, despite that, as opposed to a dungeon core crossover type thing.
    - [Easy Mode \(Gamer/Multicross/SI\)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/easy-mode-gamer-multicross-si.491065/reader/) was a fairly fun read, MC lives through various games, and once one game is "beaten" they can make a portal to the next one, or travel back to previous ones to get more skills/resources.
    - [Fairy Dance of Death](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2393225/chapters/5288507) is a SAO fanfic, but the whole premise is that everyone is playing a (deadly) videogame, so it's a partial answer to your ask.

    Also, consider searching past recommendation threads for "Mass Effect." I remember quite a few instances of Mass Effect fiction getting recommended, previously; I haven't followed up on any though due to not having played those games.

    - u/Bowbreaker:

      Seconding this one. It was written before the release of a handful of very interesting characters that would have made the story even better IMO (specifically I am curious what Benedict_SC would have made of Doomfist, Moira, Sigma, Echo and Ramattra) but it's still one of the greats.
      ```

        Got me to play OW, that's how good it was. Benedict clearly loved the world of OW.

    [Runs in the Family (Overwatch)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/35984962/chapters/89706349)

    *Angela didn't spend that much time living with her uncle. Not in the grand scheme of things.*

    *Fortunately for humanity, it was more than enough.*

    Angela grows up under the 'tender care' of her uncle, the Medic from TF2. Content warnings for child abuse early on. The story heavily focuses on trying to cure death, which is always a popular topic here.

- u/EnigmaticAnt:
  ```
  I'd like to recommend the magazine [After Dinner Conversation.](https://www.afterdinnerconversation.com/)  It's a magazine that takes short stories that cover ethical dilemmas or questions of moral philosophy. In their own words, they're looking for "the trolly problem in short story form". Obviously this is the sort of thing that might appeal to people here.

  You can get a free issue of the magazine on the website, and there are some free stories up on the website as well. A monthly subscription comes with access to all back-issues.

  For the curious, my short story "Cruel Means, Bitter Ends" appears in the November 2021 edition.

  So I'm really craving some good Lovecraftian/Cosmic/Eldritch Horror. Just finished [Paulus Somni](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25475/palus-somni) and it was perfection. It was as if I was reading Bloodborne distilled into a story about one of the churches in Yharnam before the events of the game take place.

   Also just finished Darkworlds by Tony Walker and while it wasn't the best two books the descriptions of Madness were fantastic. Don't want HFY, no figuring out the secrets. I want the real horror stuff.

  The oft recommended "Warhammer Fantasy: Divided Loyalties - an Advisor's Quest" just dropped an [update](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/warhammer-fantasy-divided-loyalties-an-advisors-quest.44838/page-13532#post-28100687) after almost 5 months.

  For those who don't know what it is, it's essentially a well written Warhammer Fantasy fanfic with lots of reader involvement in the plot and character development.

  Here to plug my cultivation and magic epic fantasy, [Beyond the Aeonshift](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/66700/beyond-the-aeonshift-a-cultivation-magic-epic).

  Aspects of Interest:

  * I wanted to write a more rational xianxia world where the implications of people who live for hundreds or thousands of years actually made an impact in society.
  * I wanted to create a story where both the systems of magic and cultivation can coexist and interact in unique ways.
  * It frustrates me how xianxia and magic are most often set in static alt-medieval worlds. BTA is set in a world in change where a revolutionary breakthrough in magic has propelled society into a new world. This means that the world is going through huge changes with the status quo shifted causing all sorts of changes in the societies around. I want write the story so that the world itself becomes a character in the narrative.
  * I like stories of good people doing good things and xianxia protagonists seem to mostly be selfish, evil monsters. To some extent, such an attitude is advantageous and rational in a xianxia world, but I want to see the obstacles people with their own moral code might have to deal with in a ruthless xianxia world.

  The total wc of what is out is 17.5k words out and I plan to update it M/W/F with chapters around 2-3k each.

  Inspired by works like 40 Millenniums of Cultivation, Name of the Wind, The Desolate Era, Sanderson's worldbuilding, ect.

  The actual summary blurb:

  > For millennia, magic served as a lethal curse to those daring to wield it, a ticking time bomb that slowly poisoned their bodies and condemned them to tragically short lives. That was, until the groundbreaking creation of the Aeonbond  - an arcane ritual that allowed mages to forge connections with spirit beasts, who could supply vital prana and filter away the deadly toxins. This monumental event, dubbed as the Aeonshift, hattered the world's fragile equilibrium and unleashed a maelstrom of extraordinary changes.
  > 
  > Now, two centuries later, the continent is in the midst of a magical revolution. Airships and animated constructs fill the skies and streets, and the number of mages has surged to unparalleled heights. However, these rapid advancements in magical power unsettle the cultivators and powers that be, who fear that mages may be meddling with forces beyond their comprehension. As the winds of change continue to blow, the continent confronts a host of new challenges: sinister abyssal cultists lurk in the shadows, population dynamics shift, and revolutionary ideologies arise.
  > 
  > In the heart of this chaos, two friends, Vyas and Maya, are forced to forge an Aeonbond - a bond never intended for two humans, a decision that exacts a heavy toll on both of them. Bound by their shared destiny, they are determined not just to survive, but to thrive. With lofty dreams and aspirations, Vyas and Maya find themselves entangled in conflicts with formidable figures and organizations, navigating a world irrevocably transformed by the consequences of the Aeonshift.

  Do we have an alternative place for this thread in case (or rather:once) reddit becomes shitty enough? 

  The site certainly will stay up but with the shit around the API going on I feel a lot less welcome; and I dare assume I'm not the only one. 

  Emotions aside, the usability drop without RIF for me is also a big factor.

  [To the Far Shore](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50836/to-the-far-shore) was great if you're looking for a character raised in a clan of sociopaths, but also slowly incorporating a new culture of community and acceptance. Oregon Trail meets Fallout with *excellent* worldbuilding, fun characters, and some rather uncommon forms of "magic" (radiation and shaman magics).

  [Disco Inferno](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/67633/disco-inferno), Eldritchpunk dystopian SCP setting, the author mentioned inspiration from Project Moon. Story has just begun, but I've enjoyed what I've read, story has some pretty brutal imagery. MC is a premier young master dragged down into the slums, and has to claw his way back up, growing in power and in character. Try it if your into double-edged artifacts, an immortal yet still vulnerable MC, horror settings, and grotesque anomalies

  I'm looking for recommendations for a specific story format. It's about traveling from one scenario to another, accomplishing goals in each and then moving to the next. I understand that jumpchain might be similar, but that's based on existing IP's and I don't like fanfiction. Terror Infinity(CN) is the original that's about people hopping from one horror movie to the next, but I didn't like it. Meanwhile my favorite is Devil's Cage(CN) which is all about original settings. 

  I like that it focuses on a shorter but structured scenarios. Like an arc in Devil's Cage is a castle that's under siege, and the protagonist just has to survive, and once he's escaped, it ends. Short, sweet, and focused. It allows the story to focus on world building and plot, and it allows for a a lot of experimentation, since if an arc doesn't work you can just end it and then never mention it again. Meanwhile if it does work, you can always reuse it later. It's the perfect web serial format in my view.

  Like to expand on the castle arc, you can have the protagonist kill the enemy general, kill the leader of the castle, focus on saving as many people as possible, or killing as many, or just about looting the treasury and escaping. And they don't all have to be about combat. It can be about investigating who stole an item and tracking it down, it can be about solving a murder, or just exploring a tomb. the protagonist can either be good or evil, or anything else and adapt to the situation and what suits it. You can kill off characters, or even allow the protagonist to fail and die, since adding extra lives suits the format a lot more than other types of stories.

  And the scenario/short stay really is essential, I've read plenty of world hopping stories where the protagonist can stay there indefinitely or until they die or whatever and that's way too open ended.

  I've read everything with this premise that's been translated from Korean or Chinese, but it's not really that popular in the West sadly, at least not yet.

  Other Chinese stories with this premise are:

  - Ultimate Evolution
  - 48 Hours A Day
  - Fantasy Simulation
  - Carefree Path of Dreams

  Korean ones usually keep the scenario focused premise, but focus more on the real world, while occasionally going into other worlds. So I don't really like them as much, but SSS-Class Suicide Hunter is a great example. 

  Recently I've read Super Supportive on Royalroad, which seems to be a mix of this and a superhero story. And it's really good.

    You might enjoy [The Menocht Loop](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31514/the-menocht-loop), but it may prove too long instead.
    Story starts near the end of the protagonist being stuck in a Mother of Learning-esque timeloop during which time he's accumulated skills and knowledge through the trial and error only a timeloop can provide, with the first book being the escape sequence from the loop. Next arc is guy adjusting to and then having to leave the "real" world and ascend to the next, before having to find his feet again.

    I stopped partway into the "third" world since it felt like it lost a lot of momentum, not helped by me being up to date and waiting for updates to come out, but I've been meaning to go back to it for a while. There's been several books worth of content since then.

    I also enjoy this genre but I always get disappointed when the stakes increase and the protagonist gets stronger. I dropped both devil's cage and terror infinity. I will definitely check out carefree path of dreams though, so thanks for the rec in that regard.

    I prefer the romance drama variation of this, like Quick Transmigration Cannon Fodder's Record of Counterattacks. And Cheating Men Must Die is a manga example that I recommend. Both of them are more comedic than serious compared to the examples you gave though.

    For more serious, I think some horror mystery works follow the same pattern, even if the different dungeons are not new worlds, the scenario & ghost will provide new rules that the protagonist has to figure out. Like My House of Horrors, which I recommend.

    I don't personally enjoy BL, but world hopping is popular in this subgenre and I liked Supernatural Movie Actor App.

  Any recommendations for fish out of water stories (fanfic or otherwise) where the fish in question is intelligent and analytical but the world in question isn't too cliche'd either (so no generic isekai)?

  My mind goes to various glowfic as an example but, well, it's glowfic. I can only read so much of that at a time.

  Edit: Oh, this is the old thread. I'll repost the question in the next one.

  I liked Spy x Family but I wish it had more romance developments and less of a focus on slice of life episodic stuff. Any stories/fanfiction/anime/manga that has a similar dynamic with a fulfilling romance?
  ```

  - u/CatInAPot:
    ```
    Dynamic in the sense of people with opposing personalities, opposing roles, or having a kid between them? 

    Not a huge romance reader but I've enjoyed:

    [I Ran Away To Evil](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68117/i-ran-away-to-evil-a-litrpg-romcom), pretty new story, warrior princess who'd rather bake cookies is sent off by her crappy family to kill the sorcerer king of the Dark Forest. Quite cozy. 

    >– and I know girls can rule with an iron fist. Grand Duchess Calisto of North Sumbria is so tyrannical that her nobles don't get to keep any of their collected tax money. They have to put it into *infrastructure*. It gives my father a hernia just talking about it… 


    [Dad, the Beard Gorilla, and I](https://mangadex.org/title/95543d8f-05ba-4345-8800-bc75f4a3ed78/chichi-to-hige-gorilla-to-watashi), the romance is slow to happen, but very nice. Michiru is pretty similar to Anya.

    [Bonnouji](https://mangadex.org/title/e5e6b437-611a-4d7f-81a3-c3cd692fc885/bonnouji), [Tonikaku Kawaii](https://mangadex.org/title/30f3ac69-21b6-45ad-a110-d011b7aaadaa/tonikaku-kawaii?tab=chapters&page=2) and
    [Horimiya](https://mangadex.org/title/a25e46ec-30f7-4db6-89df-cacbc1d9a900?tab=chapters) are all just extremely cute, comfortable romance manga.
    ```

  - u/AviusAedifex:
    ```
    Koroshi Ai has a similar dynamic but with a focus on romance, but it's a shoujo.
