## Chapter 1 of "Change Storms: Induction", plus two munchkin-the-superpower challenges

### Post:

As I've previously mentioned, the Change Storms books are my "superpowers in the real world" series.  I'm currently working on "Induction", which is #3 in the series, but it's standalone.

I've created [a subreddit for the series](https://www.reddit.com/r/changestorms/) which is currently showing [Chapter 1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/chapter_001.html), as well as two munchkin challenges:  a character who [inverts natural laws](https://www.reddit.com/r/changestorms/comments/3ic21z/mk_callsign_polarity_inverts_natural_laws/) and a character who [swaps momentum](https://www.reddit.com/r/changestorms/comments/3ic1ap/mk_switch_momentum/) between two objects.

I'll be doing weekly drops of new chapters as they're written; they'll go to early-release [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/davidstorrs?ty=h) backers on Monday and everyone else (other Patreon backers, Reddit, mailing list) on Tuesday. 

I'm setting up a proper website for the chapters, but there's been a tremendous amount of yak shaving involved and I decided I'd rather just get this out the door, even if it meant hosting it from Dropbox for now.
