      The aggressive Dizzy is very attractive.

      Like an open flame to the moth.

  Can I just say how much I love the  character interplay  in this series? Moody has become one of my favourite writers.
  ```

  - u/Rice_22:
    ```
    I wish there was more interaction with Fanny and Davo like before, although being relatively normal people it's natural they'll get left behind more and more when the plot starts escalating.

    Simole is my favourite, personally.
    ```

- u/Noumero:
  ```
  >Would the boy I knew give up like that, or would he come up with a way to get the result he was looking for?

  *I see.* The High Father is Nic's time-travelling future self, and this entire millennia-long alien conspiracy is merely part of his grand plot to get the girl! It all makes sense now.
