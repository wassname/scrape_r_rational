  For anyone who is curious, the publication dates for each of the six books are as follows:

  >Sunset - September 15, 2014  
  >  
  >Shadows - August 30, 2015  
  >  
  >Orb - May 30, 2016  
  >  
  >Knightfall - April 2, 2017  
  >  
  >Void - May 31, 2018  
  >  
  >Mobius - July 31, 2019

  Judging from this list, we can safely estimate that the next book in the series will come out in the late spring to summer of 2020.

  I'm not a fan of series where the main character does a bunch of dumb stuff to "save the girl" so to speak.

  Would this series be a good fit or will I be annoyed considering the aforementioned statement?

    I mean, >!the girl dies!< pretty early on.

  This series is more progression fantasy than rational, but it has its moments. The gist of it is that the main character becomes a vampire, except he's a special one with magic. The overpowered abilities the main character has are generally used to their logical extent, even if it takes five whole books for that to happen. There's a shift that happens, where the story goes from the personal level all the way up to civilization-building.

  Includes:  
  —Portals across the multiverse  
  —Apocalypse worlds  
  —Mild civilization uplift  
  —Munchkinning, and simultaneously,  
  —A frustrating lack of munchkinning  
  —AI, eventually  
  —Long books, with nice, high word counts  
  —A good fun read

  The sixth book recently came out and isn't on the linked list for some reason, and the author's website is even more out of date. If you want to try the series but aren't sure you want to commit money to it, PM me and I'll set you up.

    Tried these. The main character is given too much, too fast. He also discards obvious strategic and tactical considerations, like relocating his base of operations and making more flexible use of his finances. Not the worst progression fantasy I've seen, but I've also seen a lot better.

      > but I've also seen a lot better.

      Mind listing them? I'd love to see more that are like this but better.

        Sure. Warning that I like my progression fantasies to require more work, setback, etc. Though again, haven't read this whole series, so maybe later books look more like that.

        If you want urban fantasy, Dresden Files is probably the only thing that fits the bill.

        For universe-hopping supernatural nobles, I'd recommend Zelazny's Amber series, at least the first five books but possibly also the whole series.

        Another really decent universe-hopping (eventually) and well written progression story is the World of Prime series, which just concluded this year.

        Probably not my top recommendation here, but you might enjoy the Daniel Black series. Another wizard empire builder situation.


        Two progression-oriented web fictions that are recently popular:

        [Delve](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve), portal fantasy where the MC doesn't get a special leg up.  
        [Chrysalis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis) , MC is a giant ant, magic and colony building.
        ```

        - u/Lightwavers:
          ```
          There is indeed more of that in the later books, to the extent that >!his entire home base is eliminated, and a world is destroyed!<.

          Dresden Files is awesome, I second that recommendation.

          Haven't heard of the Amber series, I'll check it out. Same for World of Prime and Daniel Black.

          Delve is good, but when I checked out this Chrysalis I found the writing way too ... anime? Over exaggerated everything, too many exclamation points, that sort of thing. Does the writing get better?

          Dresden and Eric feel so similar!

      >relocating his base of operations and making more flexible use of his finances

      I'm confused by this complaint.

      He literally places his base of operations >!in a post-apocalyptic world where he can salvage the resources of an advanced technological civilization and no one except one person (who he trusts with his life) even knows of the world's existence.!< How can he do any better at placing his base of operations/lair?

      Furthermore, flexible use of finances? >!He scans worlds for anything he might need and gets materials and highly advanced technological resources from alternative worlds.!< What is he missing from that?
      ```

        Sorry, didn't read the whole series. I was referring to the first book. Taking the inquisitor people seriously and regrouping until he has his new situation figured out would have been the sensible thing to do, instead he camps out in his manor house where they know he is.

        Sounds like he gets handed a lot more stuff, though, ha.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          >Sounds like he gets handed a lot more stuff, though, ha.

          Eh...he gets incredible advantages, but there's a saying that Eliezer Yudkowsky posted somewhere which is very good summation for this series.

          >If you give Frodo a lightsaber, then Sauron gets a Deathstar.

          Whenever he gets anything that he didn't personally work long and hard for, then he's usually facing some crazily overpowered and deadly enemy as a result. He's generally going through a two steps forward, one step back process. Easy power-ups are always causing problems for him for a long time afterwards.

          The bit about the inquisitor is true, but I felt like it was more due to him being overconfident in his new-found abilities as a vampire against mortals and the fact that he literally has no way to find them except for letting them attack him. And the fact that the manor was his best spot to prepare for them. But it *is* a mistake and narratively he is punished for that by >!losing Sasha.!<
          ```

            That's fair. In general I'm OK with power being balanced by threatening threats. In Worth the Candle, for example, the MC is quite powerful but the world has some over-the-top threats. It did feel like too much, too fast in this case, though, at least as far as I read.

  anyone else think torte might be sasha?
