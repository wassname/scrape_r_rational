  Man I really love these cozy fire chapters, like when the woe played games. Gotta wonder when the other shoe will drop, though.
  ```

    ```
    Could be soon we still haven't had the Bard nor Vivian arrive yet, nor seen the reactions the Pilgrim will cause.
    ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      I'm wondering if something during this scene will make Cat pull Akua back into her cloak scruff.
      ```

  - u/noneo:
    ```
    Story wise. It has to be soon. Something has to ruin the nice fireside chat and bring things back to reality.
    ```

    - u/Wolydarg:
      ```
      I'm gonna write a rational webnovel series where it's all slice-of-life moments like this and nothing bad ever happens and it's wholesome and lovely and warm and fuzzy.
      ```

      - u/noneo:
        ```
        Please do, I just want to read antics.
        ```

      - u/Amagineer:
        ```
        Seconding /u/noneo. A comfy slice-of-life ratfic sounds excellent
        ```

- u/ATRDCI:
  ```
  I am curious as to Tariq's reaction when he realizes "oh, she actually *did* have someone with the requisite knowledge and Weight to use the well of Night against me had I not accepted her surrender"
  ```
