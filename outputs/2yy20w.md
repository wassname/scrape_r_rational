  He should wait 26 minutes and 53 seconds to post it.

  Pi second only comes around once every hundred years.

    Well, in 16 years we'll get the more sensible (as in, the numbers are actually in order of significance rather than the ridiculous month/day/year hour/minute/second) 31/4/15 9:26:53.

    Just before half 9 on the morning of April 15th 2031.

    EDIT: Typo

      Yeah, that's the one that I'm waiting on. I keep frowning at everyone who isn't putting date in descending order.

  This may be my favorite chapter to date. No great doings or adventures are needed just...quietness, and a fair bit of sadness, and a tiny bit of hope, as everyone tries to pick up the pieces.
