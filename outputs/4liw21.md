## Just read "Schooled in Magic" book 5!

### Post:

I just finished reading "School of Hard Knocks"--book 5 of Christopher Nutall's "Schooled in Magic" series. "Schooled in Magic" is currently my favorite rational novel series. It's a realistic take on what might happen if an ordinary girl from Earth were transported to a medieval fantasy world. The author has been part of the online alternate history community for a couple decades, and it really shows in his writing.

Unfortunately you need to actually buy the books (or get them at the library if they have them) in order to read them. Totally worth it though!

There was an earlier version of some of the series posted on spacebattles at some point, but you shouldn't read that because it's terrible.

Also, how many of you guys are fans of the "Schooled in Magic" series? I might want to start a fan subreddit for it...

  The series is not bad as YA stuff goes; main flaw IMO is that the character basically pulls out a new superpower in every book at the last minute in order to solve the plot, and then that power is immediately nerfed so it won't break the plot for the *next* book.  (It's not that there's 100% *no* foreshadowing of these powers, but it usually comes in the form of the character's random thoughts rather than any actual preparation or external actions/events, save in one book where an essential item is created and experimented with beforehand.  In another case, the power is a spell the character learned in a previous book and received no further mention between the previous book and its use at the conclusion of the later book.  And so on.)

  Secondary flaw: hand-waving the spread of industrial tech and social changes in a medieval society based on the half-remembered non-technical knowledge of a modern teenager.  We're talking maybe 4 years to go from illiterate swords & sorcery to steam & guns and a literate popular uprising!

  Still, aside from those flaws and the [morality issue another comment mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4liw21/just_read_schooled_in_magic_book_5/d3o6twp), the series is pretty decent stuff.  I'm mostly finding it lacking in comparison to e.g. [A Hero's War](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War) ( where the main character has an actual engineering degree and *still* has to abuse the heck out of magic to get an industrial revolution going), or the [Paul Twister](http://paultwister.com) novels (where the main character invests in long-term R&D to accomplish even the simplest of technology enhancements.

  By comparison, all of the tech development in the SiM series takes place off-stage, with the characters seeing only the results of successful innovations, and some of the conflicts arising therefrom.

  All that being said, I'm still going to read the next one.  ;-)

    I started reading the first book in the SiM series and got about 3/4 through before giving up.  The writing is okish, but it suffers from using common fantasy tropes to build the world.  This becomes a major issue becuase the author does not really think about how the world works in some case.  A minor point that illustrates this is that they have a analysis spell that allows a magic user to decode other spells.  Not a problem, but apparently there is also a potion detect spell that will tell you if it will kill you, with out any analysis need.  Another point that is not really important to the plot but really made me stop reading was the fact that the main character does not know the local language and instead has a translation spell cast on her.  Thats fine, but it is a major issue when another character makes an english based pun.  I believe it was about a hive of bees 'misbehaving'.  It is little things like this which really annoyed me.

      I noticed that too. I also noticed towards the end the main character turns into a rat and remarks repeatedly about how much better a rat's eyesight is. I guess the author just assumed that animals have better senses all around than humans and didn't think further than that. Lots of little things add up. There's a huge problem with lack of attention to detail.

        A lot of this has to do with the sheer pace that the books are being written. The first edition of Book 1 [came out at the end of February 2014](https://chrishanger.wordpress.com/2014/02/). So Nuttall has put out nine books in the SiM series and at least twice as many again across the other series he writes (Bookworm, Ark Royal, Royal Sorceress, etc) in just over two years. Seriously, go through that blog and there's a new book (often more) every single month.

        That's a *ridiculous* pace to maintain, essentially NaNoWriMo each month without a break. I'm not surprised that some of the lesser details end up slipping.

    This bugged the hell out of me. She's competent enough to defeat the villain taking out everyone else, including the teaching staff...and then at the beginning of the next book, she's weak again.

    Personally however, some of the later plots were the deal breakers for me. She goes to another school [](#s "Which essentially require a leyline to power all the defenses. But it was founded in the middle of nowhere instead, for basically no reason, forcing them to eat the magic of all their commoner mages, even though they need every body possible to fight the necromancers. It's an idiot plot through and through.")

    A later book is just the plot to Romeo and Juliet with the serial numbers filed off. The series also has a lot of angst/drama in general, which I personally dislike., and the writing in general isn't good enough to make up for its various flaws.

    [Wedding Hells](#s "I see your point, but actually I think at least part of it is because we only get Emily's perspective on things. She's not a reliable narrator, and she's incredibly naive... Anything that isn't a miracle making everyone happy will look like tyranny to her.")

  Much, much worse writing than most fanfiction and internet novels I've read recently. There are dozens of Patreons more deserving of your money rather than spending it on this.

  Also, it's very much not rational fiction. It really doesn't fit any of the characteristics of rational fiction any more than the average YA novel does, and the author remarks explicitly at least twice in the first book that magic isn't necessarily logical. Not gonna bother looking up an exact quote right now, but here's one from the second book: "It didn't make logical sense, but so much else about transfiguration didn't make logical sense either".

  Boy, went to look it up in the library. Not simply do they not have it, but the entirety of search Ohio and and Ohio Link don't have it. So I need somebody to tell me. Is this worth a dollar?

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    You could illegally download the book to check it out, if the dollar's really that important..

      Or you could illegally download the book because amazon's proprietary format is a pain in the ass, and even conversion with Calibre doesn't always work.

    It's worth a lot more than that. Not all great works of literature can be found at the library, you know. I've looked for rational fiction novels in the Columbus metropolitan library system and I've never been able to find any. The librarians have never even heard of the genre. I've also looked at half price books and they don't have any rational fiction either. It's kind of sad. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of notable authors in other genres, and how many does rational fiction have? Maybe about 10 or so if you exclude all the authors whose works were discontinued partway through?

      Of course librarians haven't heard about the genre. The term was invented just a few years ago and us fans number less than 5k people hanging out on an obscure subreddit. How on earth did you expect otherwise?

      Is it really rational/rationalist? Because I don't mind paying to support writers of rational/rationalist fiction (as my patreon can clearly demonstrate), but for normal fiction I have no interest in paying, since I can find so much free awesome fiction and fanfiction on the internet.

        I would say it's a bit weak on the first two premises of rational fiction.  Emily is also not always a level **1** intelligent character (as you often want to scream at her not to do various things or do other things), and fails at being a level 2: to the extent that she solves problems, the brilliance of these solutions tends to be told rather than shown, and even when we have the clues she has, we have no way to know whether any of our ideas would *work*.  There are no "aha" solutions where you realize you could have figured it out; at best they are, "oh" solutions, where you go, "ok, I guess that makes sense...  or it might if I had any more info about how magic works."

        That being said, it *does* have a consistent and logical world, and Emily is better at being a protagonist than say, canon Harry Potter.  An entertaining read in the portal fantasy/summoned hero genre, but not a super-strong example of a ratfic.

    surely a dollar is cheaper then the time you spent searching aroudn for that book around the hwole Ohio.

      Probably not. WorldCat searches libraries throughout the USA in less than a minute.
