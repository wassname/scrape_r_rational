  Given that the FLEA exists, does Drifa losing her levels really matter? 

  This chapter was excellent. Definitely one of the best. This is likely partially because I spent most of it in fits of laughter

    Well, the levels can be restored, but she's going to lose her connection to her goddess, whom Drifa has dedicated her entire life to since she was 18 years old.  She spent a century or two in the field, fighting to protect Amilsandre's people and their homes from every nasty thing that goes bump in the night.  Then she spent some time in the upper echelons of Amilsandre's church, learning the political / economic / logistical side of making sure that people have homes and safety.  Finally she became the head of the entire church, and spent all her time working to make sure that the church ran as smoothly as possible.

    Now Amilsandre is going to shun her, strip away every tangible scrap of that lifetime of service, and render her untouchable by all faithful -- from now on, no worshipper of Amilsandre may speak to, sell to, or shelter Drifa.  Ever.

    So, yeah, it kinda matters.

    Thanks!  I had a lot of fun writing Drifa's lines; I was snickering most of the way through.  I'm glad it came across as funny OUTSIDE of my head.

      Ah, so it's less to do with the loss of cleric levels and more to do with the cultural aspects of being excommunicated. Perhaps add something in the text to make this clearer? I had thought that she was just referring to the XP she had gathered when talking about her centuries of work. 

      Are there any Amilsandre followers in Grofhamr? I had thought that they'd all converted to Herrún.

        Good thought; I'll look this over.

        > Are there any Amilsandre followers in Grofhamr? I had thought that they'd all converted to Herrún. 

        Yep, there still are.  Many of the people have switched, but not everyone.  It's only been a few days so far since the ritual started; changing your primary object of worship away from your chosen god is a tough thing to do, even in a polytheistic religion where it's ok to pray to multiple gods.

  So, is Herrún based on Skitter? Horse-faced, tall for a woman, (used to be) a somber, secretive loner, [](#s "can hold her on against greater gods who ought to massively outclass her").
  ```

  - u/Zephyr1011:
    ```
    Seems more Tattletale than anything else. Given the whole secrets thing
    ```

    - u/philip1201:
      ```
      Except that Tattletale isn't horse-faced, tall, somber, or particularly secretive or loner-type. Her new behaviour does match Tattletale better, blabbering secrets to force the conversation to her hand, but that is about it. Tattletale isn't a redhead either.
      ```

      - u/Zephyr1011:
        ```
        She is a god. She can shapeshift. Her personality and powers seem more her distinguishing characteristic.
        ```

        - u/philip1201:
          ```
          Her personality explicitly changed, and her appearance explicitly stayed constant between the dream sequence and the reification.
          ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Nope. She is an original character, not based on anyone.
    ```
