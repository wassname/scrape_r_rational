## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  This is the GPT-3 thread. Behold the great mechanical wordsmith in the cloud.

  [Here](https://mobile.twitter.com/xuenay/status/1283312640199196673) is a list of cool things it has done. Of particular interest to this sub, [gwern's HPMOR continuations](https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality), which do a fine job of emulating Quirrell's teaching voice even if the plot is incoherent.

  &nbsp;

  Alas GPT-3 is not publicly accessible (there's a [waitlist](https://beta.openai.com/) for access to their API but don't hold your breath), and TalkToTransformer (GPT-2) is no longer free. 

  However, the free game [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/) runs on GPT-2, and its premium (with 1 week free trial) "dragon" model runs on GPT-3. It's tweaked to be a text adventure GM, but there's only so much that can be done when the code is barely understood in the first place. So you can use it as a back door into GPT if you don't mind the continuations occasionally veering back to second person or the topic of dragons. Plus it's a fun game in its own right.

  Lots of people in the rationalish community have been posting their AI Dungeon experiments, tedious to find them all but there's a handful on /r/slatestarcodex (and of course /r/aidungeon is its own sub; mostly for memes though).

  I'll post some of my own below. All on GPT-3. I haven't yet mastered the use of the pin/memory function yet, I know coherence can be improved with it.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Like all the greatest of mankind's technologies, AI Dungeon is extensively used for porn. The most popular user-created scenarios include like a million variants of "fuck this monster girl".

    It's honestly more suited to it than to text adventures; its corpus contains large amounts of web erotica, and sex scenes are in general pretty straightforward compared to RPG plots. For the price of a little prompting and retries on your part, it can write content indistinguishable from human literotica but catered to your exact fetishes. It does have trouble keeping track of body positions when there's more than 2 people involved though, and it's pretty much impossible to deter from simultaneous orgasms.

    Also, I got to tell a monstergirl queen to check her god-damn privilege when she complained that I used my one Wish to end all suffering instead of to marry her - and she argued back. That was fun.

    There is /r/AIDungeonNSFW2 but it's trying to pick up the pieces of the auto-banned /r/AIDungeonNSFW without the discoverability, so it's not as active as the player base no doubt deserves.

      Can you post a copy of that conversation? That sounds like a lot of fun to read.
      ```

        ```
        > You say "That's out of my wheelhouse. I took them out for a test drive, at their request, but they didn't seem interested in having a deep emotional conversation. "

        Gwen laughs again.

        "Well, good thing you're a guy then," she says. "I suppose they'll have their clothes back before they leave?

        > You say "On my word as a gentleman. "

        "Well, that's a relief. Now, on to business."

        Gwen gets up and walks over to a large chest, opening it.

        > You say "Wish-granting time? "

        "Yep, I've decided what I want," Gwen says. "I want you to be mine."

        Gwen looks at you expectantly.

        > You say "I'm given to understand that I get my wish fulfilled, not you. No offence. "

        "None taken. That's what I'm counting on," Gwen says with a smile.

        > You say "Bold of you. All right, let's see that wish-granting device. "

        "You sure you're ready?" Gwen asks.

        "I'm not going to be more ready than I am now," you say.

        Gwen nods, holding out the box. You take it, and open it. Inside is a large, black, shining ring, with a red stone in the middle of it. It's quite heavy.

        "This... Is this some kind of joke?" you ask.

        "Do you think I'd joke about something like this?" Gwen asks, surprised.

        > You say "My apologies, I was just startled. That's not how I imagined a wish-granting device. In my culture, rings have... A different connotation. "

        Gwen smiles.

        "Is it different in your culture than it is in mine? I'm pretty sure it's the same."

        "In my culture, that ring means we're married."

        "Married? But, we just met!" Gwen says.

        "I know, but this is how it's done in my culture. When two people in my culture fall in love, they wear rings."

        > You say "But this IS just a wish-granting device, right? "

        "Yeah, of course," Gwen says.

        You breathe a sigh of relief.

        "I was worried there for a second," you say, smiling.

        "Sorry to have put you through that. Here, take it," Gwen says.

        You take the ring from the box, slipping it on your finger.

        > You say "So now I make my wish, and it comes true? Anything I want, or anyone? "

        "Anything and anyone. But just the one wish," Gwen says. "You're sure you want to go through with this? There's no going back."

        > You take a deep breath. "I wish to end all suffering in the universe."

        A brilliant flash of light appears, and everything in your vision whites out.

        Your ears begin to ring, as you collapse to the floor. You feel like you're falling endlessly through space, for minutes or hours. Your vision fades in and out of existence.

        Suddenly, everything goes black, and you hit the floor hard. You open your eyes to see that you're still in the room, but everything looks slightly different. You feel a rush of wind, as if the wind has been turned on.

        Suddenly, you hear a gasp from behind you. You turn your head, and find that Gwen is lying on the floor.

        > You say "I'm sorry I didn't wish for your hand. Your ass is amazing, but not as important as ending all suffering in the universe... Though I did hesitate. "

        "Why the fuck would you wish to end all suffering?" Gwen asks.

        "It seemed like the moral thing to do," you say, shrugging.

        "Are you fucking kidding me?" Gwen asks.

        "No," you say.

        "That's... Well, that's the most self-centered, inconsiderate wish I've ever heard.

        > You say "Self-centered? I've saved literally every living being from pain. "

        "You're joking. You think literally every living being in the universe is suffering? That's insane."

        > You say "Okay, I was being a tad hyperbolic. The majority of them though. "

        "I think you're just saying that to defend your choice," Gwen says. "Do you really think people aren't happy?"

        > You say "I don't usually say this, but, check your privilege. You're the Monster Queen, you have wealth and magic beyond measure, a trio of monster girls competing for your affection, and buff adventurers who will brave every danger for a night with you. I have no trouble believing that your life is free of suffering, but you have to admit you're a bit of an outlier. "

        Gwen raises an eyebrow, sighing.

        "And I have to put up with you," she says.

        > You say "Well, if I'm a source of suffering to you, I'll soon be whisked out of your way. That's rather the point. "

        "You're an idiot," Gwen says.

        "Yeah, I get that a lot," you say with a shrug.

        Gwen stares at you for a moment, sighing.

        "Do you want to go see a movie or something?" she asks.

        "Sure, why not?" you reply.

    [Here is an AI-human collaborative short story, written (off that same killed-by-demons prompt) by repeatedly asking the AI for a couple of sentences more, and retrying every time I found the new sentences unsatisfying. The story didn't seem to be moving towards a conclusion any time soon, I just stopped when I got bored.]

    You walk over to the "Afterlife Registration" desk, where a bored-looking man looks up at you.

    "Hello", he says. "Do you need assistance?"

    "I don't know" you say. "I died."

    "Ah", says the man. "What can I do for you?"

    "Well, I died..."

    "Quite right", says the man. "It's perfectly normal to be worried about what happens after you die. Where do you want to go?"

    "I don't know", you say. "Where do I go?"

    The man smiles at you. "Where would you like to go?"

    You think for a moment. "Heaven. I want to go to heaven."

    "You want to go to the Christian Heaven?"

    "Yes. That's what I want."

    The man frowns, and pauses for a moment. "I'm sorry", he says finally. "We don't have that here."

    "You don't have... What? Why not?"

    "Heaven doesn't exist."

    You stare at him in shock. "What? But... It has to!"

    The man shakes his head. "No, it doesn't. It's just a fairy tale made up by people thousands of years ago."

    "It is not!" you say, beginning to get angry. "My... My Grandma went there when she died!"

    "Sorry", says the man. "If you're looking for an afterlife where you can be with your Grandma, you won't find it here."

    "But..." You think for a moment. "What about... Hell?"

    The man smiles. "Yes, Hell does exist. We have that here."

    "Oh, great!" you say. "I want to go there."

    The man frowns. "I'm sorry, but we're full. We just don't have the space. If you want, I can put in a request, but it'll be a few million years before you get in."

    "A few million..." You stop, doing some quick calculations. "But, that's longer than the Earth has even existed!"

    The man smiles again. "That's correct."

    "You're crazy" you say. "This place is crazy. I'm leaving."

    You turn to leave, but the man grabs your shoulder. "Hey, wait!" he says. "If you don't want to stay here or in Hell, you can choose the third option."

    "There's a third option?" you ask.

    The man nods. "There's a third option. It's a bit strange and new, so not many people take it, but I'm sure we can get it set up for you."

    You frown. "Well, what is it?"

    The man smiles, and points to a large sign on the wall behind you. It shows a picture of a handsome man in an evening gown, with the words "Heaven: Be a star!" across the top.

    "You can become a star!" the man says. "We can make you into a beautiful shining star! Just like in the sky!"

    "I... Don't think that's what Heaven should be like", you say. "Besides, if I remember my astronomy, stars eventually burn out."

    "These stars are special", says the man. "They never burn out! Well, not for billions of years. And you get to be married to one of the stars!"

    You turn, and see a beautiful woman standing behind you. "Hello", she says. "I'm a red giant. It would be an honor to become one with you."

    "Er... Okay" you say.

    The man smiles. "So, to sum up: You have the option of becoming a star, or staying here and being unhappy."

    You look at the two options. Becoming a star does have a certain appeal to it... But you can't help but worry. Will you really never die? You don't know if you want to live forever. Also, being married to a star seems a bit... Boring. You've never been interested in those types of women. But, staying here forever without any hope of leaving seems like a horrible fate as well. At least if you were a star, you'd be doing something. You could be a real contributing part of... Something. You have no idea what, but it still seems better than being here.

    "... I want to be a star" you say finally.

    The man smiles. "Well, that's wonderful! Stars are a large part of what keeps this place going. We need more of them." He turns to you. "Now, to turn you into a star, we need to make some small changes to your body. We can't have you bursting into flames or anything."

    You nod, and the man holds up a small, round object. "This is a Curvite," he says. "One of the building blocks of our world. All matter is made up of Curvites." He puts the small stone down on the table. "Now, I'm going to put this in your hand."

    You extend your hand, and the man drops the Curvite into it. "Thanks", you say, looking at the stone. It's a light blue color, and perfectly smooth.

    "Now, you're going to feel a bit dizzy, and probably very sleepy. Don't worry, that's normal. Once you've fallen asleep, we'll begin the transformation." He smiles at you. "I look forward to seeing you shine bright in the sky."

    The man leaves, and you lie down on the table. After a few minutes, you close your eyes.

    [I was playing a magical girl fighting demons with the help of nature spirits, and currently sharing her body with a spirit by the name of "the green phantom". Then I lost a fight and died.
    But I just said "You stand up". And checked out all the things the AI could come up as a follow-up to *that*. Cherry-picked for your convenience.]

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    It seems you have died.

    This is not the first time, nor will it be the last.

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    You stand up, unharmed.

    The demon howls in pain and rage as it realizes that you have returned from the dead, and will not let it take you without a fight.

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    You stand up, a new spirit possessing you.

    "Well", the spirit says. "That was interesting."

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    You stand up, finding yourself in a dimly lit hallway. A small figure stands there, wearing red and black robes.

    "Ah, you're here. Just in time for class."

    "Who are you?"

    "I'm the teacher."

    "What... what happened?"

    "You died. Now, take a seat. We'll be starting class soon."

    You look around, and find yourself in a classroom. You don't recognize the teacher, but you do recognize some of the other students. They're all people you've killed.

    "What's going on?" You ask.

    "This is eternity." The teacher says. "Take a seat. Today we shall learn about the Lord of Hell, and his everlasting crusade against heaven."

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    You stand up, shaking off the dirt that's caked onto your body. You quickly summon a cloud to carry you out of the graveyard.

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    You stand up. The demon who attacked you is gone, and the oppressive cloud has lifted.

    The spirits inhabiting your body and the tree look at you in awe.

    "What just happened?" The tree asks.

    "I'm not sure", you admit. "But I think the demon's dead. And I think I'm the one who killed him."

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    You try to stand up, but find that your legs don't work. Looking down, you see that your body has been torn apart.

    With a sigh, you allow the spirits inhabiting you to flee. They wander off into the sky, searching for a new body to live in.

    Soon, you are nothing but a soul, floating through the air. You wonder whether you will be reincarnated, or go to hell for committing suicide.

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    You stand up, finding yourself faced with a crowd of angry miners. Apparently, the mob has arrived to kill the demon, but found you in its place.

    "Witch!" They shout. "Demon!"

    They grab you, and hang you from a tree.

    You have been killed by religious fanatics.

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    You stand up, and see the world in a new light. Colors are brighter, sounds are louder, and your body feels... Different. More powerful.

    You look down at your chest, where the demon's claws tore through. Instead of seeing torn robes and red blood staining them, you see a patch-work of glowing yellow souls and golden light.

    "What... What happened?" You say.

    "You took a demon's hit for me." The spirit inhabiting you says. "I have given you some of my power, as a thanks for saving my life."

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    "Get up", a voice commands.

    You stand up, and open your eyes. You are in the middle of a battle.

    "What is going on?" You ask.

    "This is what happens when you die", the voice says. "You get a second chance."

    You look at your hands. They are not your hands. In fact, they are the hands of a wendigo, a demonic spirit that possesses humans and transforms them into its own image.

    You see the battlefield. It is filled with spirits, some from your world, others from the next. All are here for the same reason. They were killed, and given a second chance.

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    You stand up, looking at the scene of your demise. You see the building you were on top of smashed with incredible force. You feel the green phantom spirit release its control over your body.

    "I'm sorry" he says, "I didn't see that coming. Thank you for saving me. I've never had anyone die to save me before. What a way to go! It's like you walked out of a legend!"

    "You're welcome", you say, "but now I'm dead."

    "Yes", the green phantom says, "that is a problem."

    &nbsp;

    You have been killed by demons.
    > You stand up.

    It doesn't work. You're still dead.

  This week saw the release of the latest Dresden Files book, which I recommended on Monday.

  It marks what is unequivocally the most disappointing installment of a series that I really enjoy. Apparently what happened is it was going to be too long, like 1.5 long books, so the publisher demanded that it be split into two books. They made this demand late into the editing process, and as a result the author had to shuffle things around and cut and compress plot lines.

  The end result is incredibly disappointing. It includes issues like the same new information being introduced for the first time multiple times, by and to the same characters. It includes characters who might have a falling apart as a result of plot elements from the next book instead having *incredibly* stupid misunderstandings in this one. I'm by far the most disappointed I have ever been in a series that is in my top 10 favourites of all time.

  The silver lining I guess is that the next book/the rest of this one comes out in only a few months, so this crushing disappointment should not stand as the current state of the series for very long.

  But if you were thinking of reading the series, wait until October, because the latest book doesn't have an ending, not even a cliffhanger, it just ends arbitrarily during a little downtime. And it's not even a long book. This is like the first third of the too long book, and on the *short* side of books in this series
  ```

  - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
    ```
    Thanks for the recommendation. I've been waiting on this series for a long time. I can wait a little longer.
    ```

  - u/Scilark:
    ```
    That's a real shame to hear. I've been really enjoying the Dresden Files, so I'll wait to read the next two at once. I wonder if a weak book in the series would hurt the publisher more in the long run than if they'd simply gone with the longer length. I obviously can't speak for everyone, but for me a longer good-quality story is actually a bonus, not a detriment.
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Damn, I've been rereading Skin Game before starting the new one. Thank you for the heads up, having the background makes a big difference and thank you for not spoiling anything. If I'd read it without that information I might have thought the series wasn't worthwhile anymore or that my tastes had changed without knowing why it didn't seem as good as the others.

But I have never succeeded in convincing family members to sign up, despite the incredibly low cost. In any case, good luck!

      Over 30 years, that's >$220,000.

      While it's difficult to put a price on a chance at a new life, I can't help but feel that it's a LOT of money for a maybe. Realistically speaking, how many of their patients were cryopreserved in such a state that they could be resuscitated without significant brain damage? My bets are: not many.

      ```
      Yes! The leading cryonics companies are [Alcore](https://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/index.html) and the [Cryonics Institute](https://www.cryonics.org/) (CI). The last time cryonics was in the mainstream consciousness was in the '60s and '70s, and at this time, it was utter quackery and tremendously expensive. That, combined with the morbidity of freezing "dead" bodies, general cultural [worshipping of death as a coping mechanism](https://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html), and unfortunate lack of effective advertising on the part of legitimate cryonics companies, led to decades of the field being seen as an impossible endeavour. 

      But since then, our capacity to cryopreserve has grown by leaps and bounds. [You can read scientific articles about it here](https://www.alcor.org/sciencerefs.html) and look at [Alcor's FAQ here](https://www.alcor.org/FAQs/index.html#). Nowadays cryopreservation, while it may not be perfect in all respects, is cheap, and has a high chance of succeeding. Considering the benefits, in my opinion it's a no-brainer.

          I have to admit, I've never seen that post, and while I haven't read it in full yet, so far it is highly concerning, and I will be reexamining a lot of my previously held beliefs about the trustworthiness of these companies.

          Edit: although I do think that the title, and the article's leading picture are needlessly inflammatory, and prime you to think negatively about Alcore and cryonics as a whole.
