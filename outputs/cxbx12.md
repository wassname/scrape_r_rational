  ```
  *Important note, when using religious authority to stage a coup, ensure there is not a Hero who was Chosen by the Choir of Judgement with no political connections or motivations, only a fanatical zeal for the virtue, running around with a sword.
  ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:

  “For you to scream loudly enough that it will carry to our other prisoners,”

  This is when you start *yelling your head off*, eking out every erg of acting ability you have in the desperate hope that he'll honestly feel he couldn't make a big difference by actually doing it, and that he'll be impressed enough by your efforts and your cooperativeness to look more favourably on you.  Of course, chances are good he's going to kill you anyway, but at least you'll have a better chance at a quick, clean (more humane) death.  Better in any case than if you hear that clue and yet still wait there for him to start on it himself.  


  I am intrigued that Louis is awaiting Scribe; I can't imagine anyone else he could be awaiting (/controlling the hatchets), yet it turns my impressions on its head to think that Scribe isn't the one who wanted to start the fires.  Unless she was, and then she later changed her mind after being contacted..?  But no, then she could call them off, so it must indeed have been two different groups, and for Scribe to be holding things back goes completely against what Cat and Black thought she would be doing there?  But if the hatchets were cracking down on *her*, then again I'm completely bewildered about who Louis could be awaiting, unless he's awaiting Scribe and is completely wrong her about her leading the hatchets--that could be a fun (for us) surprise for him, if she really comes and he's gotten her side backwards.

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    My guess was Assassin.
    ```

    - u/MultipartiteMind:
      ```
      That would be nice!  I'm not seeing a clue in the text that he's expecting Assassin rather than Scribe, but I will be really happy if you're right in that a lot of other things will still make sense to me.

      I will be extra-amused (and happy) if he's expecting Scribe, but it's actually Assassin.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    My guess is Bard.  "She'll let herself in" really seems like a reference to her Wandering ability.
    ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  Huh. Earlier, I was thinking Cat and Black could just pretend Malicia was behind the coup. Turns out it actually was her. Or they're going all in on pinning it on her.
  ```

  - u/Mountebank:
    ```
    It could always be a double bluff by Scribe: she's behind both the coup and the attempt to stop the coup, either to buy herself credibility to back the Accords or because she got new orders from the revived Black.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  In literary terms I like seeing a situation of competing plots that's depicted realistically, with the limitations of working through agents, limited information, etc rather than the over the top hypercompetent plotters that often turn up in rational fic
  ```

  - u/secretsarebest:
    ```
    Except Scribe and bard are almost the hyper competent plotters due to their Names

    Also Cat to some extent
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Cat's more like a plotbreaker. She doesn't need to know what you were plotting if she can upset the board enough that it becomes irrelevant.
      ```

      - u/secretsarebest:
        ```
        I think that's nonsense image she wants to cultivate. Like Joker saying in TDKR he's just chaos and not a schemer and yet he perfectly outplayed everyone and got what he wanted. 

        Cat perfectly guessed what the others were planning which allowed her to counter them all.

        This was certainly true vs GP and a lesser extent for the rest.

        Edit : is like saying I beat you in chess not because I could forsee what you were doing but rather I could exploit chaos.

        Nonsense, you may steer the game towards complicated positions,  but if you win is because you can see more and outplay your opponent in those positions by understanding his strategy and using a better one to counter

        Or you just got lucky...unless you arguing cat is always lucky..
        ```

        - u/MultipartiteMind:
          ```
          First, I certainly agree that lately Cat has been more of a Chessmaster, with Tyrant closer to the 'thrives-in-chaos' role.

          Stepping away from the characters, my own internal model (which might easily be flawed/wrong) is of a difference between short-term and long-term gains, between tactics and strategy.  The Chessmaster tries to see the end goal, build an artifice that connects to it, and then either defend that artifice or build a new artifice from scratch.  The Chaotic ignores the end goal and looks for immediate opportunities.  When the Chessmaster's artifices are robust enough and the Chaotic's tactics weak enough, the Chessmaster can lead the Chaotic around by the nose and into a noose.  When the Chessmaster's artifices are fragile enough and the Chaotic's opportunity-seeing brilliant enough, the Chaotic can quickly smash the Chessmaster's artifices faster than or as fast as the Chessmaster can think of new ones.

          The question is, could a brilliant Chessmaster switch to becoming a equally-brilliant Chaotic or/and vice versa?  My suspicion is /maybe/ yes (and maybe no), but if yes then probably with a learning curve first.

          Keep in mind that both Chessmaster and Chaotic are playing styles, rather than naturally-emergent states:  an amateur can act as a really weak Chessmaster by plotting a path to victory that includes only the dumbest(?) moves and assumes the opponent's moves to be moves that only a similarly weak player would ever make.

          Hmm, I'm reminded of Jing Jiu and Yin San (Jing Yang and Taiping) in The Path Toward Heaven, regarding their Go-playing styles, Taiping plotting grand plans that Jing Yang then smashes directly in a reactive fashion because he's too lazy to think ahead.

  ```
  >Given that the conspiracy’s own soldiers were the ones on the right side of walls and gates, at the moment, even if the two princes had struck an unlikely alliance they simply did not have the strength to take the palace with steel. And even if they did, by some miracle, they could not defend it: while it might be true that the servants in the palace had been fond of Hasenbach, and some even protested her seizing, he had Silver Letters among their number that’d open secret ways into the palace if it need be retaken.

  Ominous ! I suspect Cordelia hid back in the palace (backtracking is a good way to throw off pursuers), and let that fool Balthazar go on a wild goose hunt giving her all the time needed while she purges the Letters with the help of loyal servants and guards, and gathers reinforcements. She knows all the secret passageways already.

  In fact, I suspect that right now she's sitting upon her own throne, inside the very Chamber of Assembly, waiting for them all to rush inside... so she can have them greeted with a hail of arrows.
  ```

  - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
    ```
    Called it exactly! Well, except the arrows part :P
    ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Malicia is behind the coup, pretending to be Rosala Malanza.  Black/Scribe is against the coup, they are the 'hatchets'.

  Basic purpose of the coup is to make sure Procer and Callow can't unify vs. Keter and Praesi.

  White Knight and Witch are neither for nor against coup, just wandering around judging everyone.  I bet they kill Cordelia at end of arc.

  Very interesting to wonder if Assassin is here.  Seems likely he is after Augur in the confusion.
  ```

- u/LordSwedish:
  ```
  Wow, I honestly can't tell who's behind what side anymore, or at least what Scribe's motivation is if she's not behind the coup. 

  These kind of situations really are perfect for Hanno, nobody knows what's going on and there are enemies and manipulations everywhere...so here comes instant and brutal justice-in-a-can. I feel like people (in this kind of community specifically) tends to be very cynical about paladin types and this chapter really shows that some holy fire, a big piece of sharpened metal, and a magical moral compass, added together makes for a really good crisis solution.

  The next interlude name will be Blood, remember this! 



  __Third, taken,__

  __Bone to grind,__

  __And blood to spill.__

  - u/MultipartiteMind:
    ```
    (Guess or evidence-backed?)
    ```

    - u/SeaBornIam:
      ```
      Guess, of course. Just a bet with myself.
      ```

      - u/MultipartiteMind:
        ```
        I look forward to seeing the outcome!  I''ll be the devil's advocate (?) and try betting against you, that flesh/blood would come before it if in a sequence with bone.  <looks forward to seeing the next title>
        ```
