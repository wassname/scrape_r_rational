  Contingent upon if you weren't you and were replaced with a replica of you who was identical to you in terms of intelligence, mentality, and shortcomings with the sole exception of being injected with endless motivation for maximizing the human existence...

  The overall goal is straightforward: Make lots of money and use said money to maximize human existence. Whether the money is through hiring other individuals or direct donations to organizations that align with your cause it doesn't really matter. Money makes the world go around and this includes any efforts of philanthropy. Everything requires money. I say money is the goal due to you currently not possessing any unique intelligence or specialized skills such as being a cancer researcher or once in a century intelligence.

  So, how do you go from where you start to making lots of money? Slowly and methodically over time. You have 25 hours a week and you've already budgeted time outside of this 25 hours for establishing and maintaining friendships and relationships. So spend the 25 hours to learn a skill with the $180 budget.

  Usually, time spent to maximize your primary income is the best way to maximize your income for the spent time. However, there's likely quite a hard cap on how much and how fast you can rise through the ranks as a manual laborer. So the 25 hours should be spent learning a new skill which would eventually replace your primary income source. Whether it be programming, business, or some other trained skill, you would select a profession which gives you a reasonable expectation of stable increasing trajectory of making more money.

  Eventually with said accumulated money, you would either invest it to make more money, buy real estate, or something else. But the point is to spend your 25 hours trying your hardest to maximize your income. At a certain tipping point, you would start hiring or start donating your money. It really depends on how much you can make. If you become mega-rich, then you have a personal political influence. However, this is unlikely. The more likely conclusion would be being within the realm of a millionaire. There's... not a lot a millionaire can do. But there's also a lot a millionaire could do.

  However, you've also mentioned that you suffer from "occasional crippling anxiety and self-doubt under pressure." Which would surely hinder your efforts to maximize your income. Thus you would initially spend a portion of the 25 hours attempting to fix those issues. Whether through therapy or self-help or putting yourself into uncomfortable situations where you conquer your fears. This time spent would be heavier in the beginning to more quickly put into motion your plan to maximize your income, if not all of the 25 hours and $180 budget being spent in the beginning.

    I greatly appreciate this detailed response. A few follow-up questions:

    - How do I handle the possibility of such a long-term plan to completely fail due to unexpected injury, disease or death? If I die in one year without any actual progress towards the two maximizations (which is a non-zero possibility), only self-care, my utilitarian worth under the proposed value system remains zero. This would be utter failure.

    - Any opinions on specific in-demand, scalable and marketable skills that could be self-taught or funded within my budget?

    - A great number of capitalist folk attempt to spend their lives making more and more money, whether for themselves, their descendants, or charitable giving. Following from that, a great number of people are *already* millionaires, or more. What is the opportunity cost of attempting the same long-term strategy as these people, when budget could be spent influencing those who have already done the hard part and accumulated the resources?

    If I convince even one multi-millionaire to fund humanitarian efforts to the tune of 1 million or more, I get the *entire* benefit of this strategy without as much of the above-discussed risk of early death and the general risk of failure in capitalism (which is so common it's essentially ubiquitous, and I have no reason to believe I will be more successful than average, being an average or even below-average intelligence myself).

    There are a lot more current millionaires than there are reliable opportunities for me to become one myself, in my quick estimation. It would be more scalable, and once I have one, the infusion of funds allows my efforts to convince others to grow, creating a scalable and even self-sustaining maximizing force.

This would be utter failure.

      You weigh the probabilities against expected values. What is the probability of you dying within a year? Within two years? Within 20 years? These probabilities have general answers and more specific answers for yourself. Then multiply that against the measured "good" that you can do, considering each path for your future. Then select the path with the highest expected value. Thus if you *currently had cancer* and you expected that you would die within a year, then the route of trying to learn a skill to maximize future income would be very unlikely. On the other hand, if you have no health problems and the probability of you living a long and healthy life are high, then taking the route of maximizing income means that the expected good that you can do is higher than the expected good you can do if you continued down the path of manual labor.

      I don't recall how to do the math on calculating these expected values but there's a lot of online resources on learning how to do them. And for your hypothetical self, spending the first of the 100 hours a month on learning statistics to calculate the maximized path forward such be the very first step. Planning is always the first step. Sometimes you also have to learn to even be able to plan.

      > Any opinions on specific in-demand, scalable and marketable skills that could be self-taught or funded within my budget?

      The internet is a free resource where you can learn anything. You can learn to be pretty much anything, learn *about* every field, and learn about the expected probabilities of advancement. Selecting the best possible path forward would again, fall into the initial research time.

      I personally do not know which field would give the best probabilities of advancement as this would also be highly dependent upon your own personal proclivities. As even if you had infinite motivation, a person learns and advances what they like significantly faster than what they don't like.

      The first career transition is likely to have significant impact on lifetime earnings potential. But it's also possible to have a transitory first career from which you would generate seed money to transition to a previously unobtainable career (such as learning programming, becoming a developer for 5 years to earn money to go into medical school). Again, this would fall into the initial research phase and would have to be weighed against each expected value.

      > A great number of capitalist folk attempt to spend their lives making more and more money, whether for themselves, their descendants, or charitable giving. Following from that, a great number of people are already millionaires, or more. What is the opportunity cost of attempting the same long-term strategy as these people, when budget could be spent influencing those who have already done the hard part and accumulated the resources?

      I would say, that earning money is **still** the first step. If you achieve financial freedom, or never having to work again, then you free up an additional 45 hours a week that you can spend towards convincing others to part with their money for charitable causes. Again, this goes into probabilities. If you expect to live an additional 50 years, then spending 20 years to achieve financial freedom allows you to spend 30 years at your quoted "I spend around 45 hours per week working" to "convincing others" with an additional 45 hours a week (for a total of 70 hours a week). This would overshadow the 50 consistent years of continuing your current work and spending 25 hours a week of "convincing others."

      This to nothing to say of the calculus of the situation. If your expected lifetime changes in 10 years while in the money making phase (say you develop diabetes), then your expected lifetime decreases. But at that point, you can also pivot your plan, as you can "retire" as you don't expect to live as long and don't need as much money. But again, these probabilities of events can and should be calculated at the beginning phase. I know I'm front loading a lot into research, but that's just how it is. Step 1: Learn statistics. Step 2: Apply statistics to probabilities for best expected outcomes. Even if you're not extremely good at math, it's a necessary first step to learn for maximization.

        I like you a lot. This is exactly the sort of thing I was hoping for with this post, and I once again greatly appreciate your effort in responding. 

        All I can say is that I will carefully consider these comments.

        The only thing I will mention off the cuff is that of the number of people who attempt to reach financial independence *to the level of not working for their income*, I do not think any reasonable percentage of them manage this in 20 years, even if that is their single goal and their primary expenditure of time in the range of 80 hours or more per week. 

        This could be considered a primary goal of every true capitalist, and I will still contend that that level of success in capitalism is waaaaay more based in starting from lucky circumstances or lucking into opportunities and then capitalizing on that luck with as much effort and skill as possible.

        With my meagre 25 hours and $180, there's no way I will manage financial independence in 20 years. 200 years, maybe.

          They don't reach it because of spending. [Financial independence can be roughly approximately estimated between spending and earning to years.](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/earlyRetirementGrid_CORRECT.png) The problem most people encounter is that as they earn more money, they spend more money. So called "lifestyle creep." But an individual can achieve financial independence in 20 years if they continuously cap their spending at roughly 3/5th of their take home income while saving and investing the other 2/5th. Or even faster than 20 years if they don't spend as much.

          > This could be considered a primary goal of every true capitalist, and I will still contend that that level of success in capitalism is waaaaay more based in starting from lucky circumstances or lucking into opportunities and then capitalizing on that luck with as much effort and skill as possible.

          I don't disagree that luck is the **primary factor** for determining success. Birth is the ultimate lottery. If your mother happened to live in a tiny tribal village in the rainforests of Nigeria, then I don't think you'd even know of the opportunities available, let alone be able to take advantage of them. On the other hand consider X Æ A-12, Elon Musk's son. He's already won the game as soon as he was born. Hard work is a necessary but insufficient condition for success for the majority of individuals. But it's still necessary.

          > With my meagre 25 hours and $180, there's no way I will manage financial independence in 20 years. 200 years, maybe.

          Again, I would say it's possible. It's even probable. 25 hours a week is enough to learn a skill to transition into a different higher paying career. Again, it's about transitioning and increasing your primary source of income. For a motivated individual, I don't see how they couldn't transition into a higher paying career within 5 years. Then that's 15 years of a high salary and ever increasing pay. If you have *zero* lifestyle creep, then that's financial independence.

          Consider an average manual laborer's salary of $30,000. It's literally impossible for this laborer to spend more than $30,000 a year (barring going into debt, but that's completely unsustainable). If this person transitions into a white collar job, most white collar jobs make a starting salary of ~$50,000. **Very roughly** this is already financial independence in 20 years if this individual does not increase their spending from before they transitioned jobs. Yes, they'll live like they make $30,000 for the rest of their live, but they can stop working in 20 years.

          All of this being said, I never mentioned the ease or difficulty. It's all extremely difficult as you'll be constantly putting yourself into situations that you don't want to be in and doing things you don't want to be doing and thus will take **endless motivation.** Which was the very first thing I said.

          Planning the path is not hard. Actually walking it is. Most people know what they need to do but lack the motivation to achieve it. For example, I know my path forward to be able to double my income within 5-10 years, but I lack the daily motivation required to put in the focused hours to actually achieve it.

      That is fair, I suppose I wasn't particularly clear, but I was looking for out-there fiction-ready ideas rather than necessarily real EA work.

      As in, what shenanigans can a rationalist protagonist get up to if they have an exceedingly **average** life? It's modeled after my own life for realism, and because it's interesting to me to think about what I would do as an author if I was writing my own life in an internally consistent way (maybe a bit self-indulgent of me).

      I also am not assuming that the people in this community are necessarily effective altruists themselves. It's a constrained munchkinry challenge.

        Ah, gotcha. This is just my take, but existential risk is often technical and addressing it will primarily stem from hiring a bunch of motivated technically-inclined folks to work on the problems, whether that's in health, physics, r&d, politics, or other fields. So some possible lines are:

        1. Become one of them
        2. Help educate or otherwise support these kinds of folks
        3. Draw more of the general public to seek careers in these fields
        4. Attract funding for technical organizations working on those fields
        5. Get a high-paying job to donate funding to them yourself
        6. Improve the public's appreciation for these fields
        7. Organize advocacy groups to remove political blockers that prevent the technical pipeline from flowing as quickly as it could

        You mention some limitations you've run up against, so those may help filter this list for you a bit.

        - u/GriffTheJack:

          This is a perfectly reasonable list, and I do appreciate them,  but these are still pretty bog standard options.

          Let's just take the first one. Is there anything clever or interesting that you think can be done to become one of these experts? Low-hanging fruit in education or politics that can be capitalized on? That's the sort of thing I'm looking for.

            I have no evidence to support this, but I've been thinking recently that finding some way of either reliably educating politicians in science and rational thought or encouraging scientists & rational thinkers to enter politics would be enormously beneficial in the long term.

              I think this is essentially what Daniel Kahneman is trying to do with his books. "Nudge", "Thinking, Fast and Slow", and the new one, "Noise", are concise explorations that any politician could absorb in a month of casual reading. The gravity of these books is immense, even shocking, and yet?

              Kahneman is an expert at the very highest levels of expertise, and he's only managed to just barely get the ball rolling on this front after 50 years of work in the field.

              Yikes.

              I wish him all the best. Maybe I could spend my budget buying copies of these books and mailing them to every politician and candidate in the world.

  Is this for fiction? You could try putting the 100 hours into becoming an expert in highly speculative investments or finding arbitrage opportunities for the $180. If you genuinely put 100 hours monthly into understanding something which is sort of niche you may be able become smarter than the market when making investments relating to that particular niche.

  A relatively simple, and doable plan:  

  **Monthly Hero:**  


  **Each month find ONE person that you could realistically help with their problems**. Rather than going after extremely difficult cases (ie: kids with cancer etc) find someone who's life sucks but can be un-sucked by the efforts of a motivated individual. Then sacrifice 100 hours and 180$ to fix as much about their life as you can. By the end of the month, ask the person to help you out help another person, within their capabilities. If they decline, that is alright.  


  Example:   


  June:  
  Betty lives a few blocks from you. She is a 75 year old frail bodied widow. She lives off her meager pension of a former school teacher.  
  100 hours means you have enough time to fix her leaking roof, help her clean out her yard, fix the sink, and un-clutter her phone so it is functional again. Help her connect with long lost freinds from work (if they still live). Assist her in signing off to a Book Club. Drive her to a doctor to see about that knee pain.  


  July:  


  Billie is a good kid, but he is not doing very well at school. The combination of being from a very poor home, and a clear case of ADD means he spends more time in detention than he should, and his grades are a forest of Fs.  
  You and Betty can help the kid straight out his grades. You could spend your money to get the kid to a competent doctor to have the ADD medicine prescribed.  


  August:  


  Cliff is dying, and that sucks. He has spinal cancer, and there is nothing to be done about it. But he would love it if his final few months were around people, not alone in the hospital bed. Every once in a while you and Betty and Billie can visit him. Play monopoly or something. Cliff has no close family, and a house that will be left vacant. Billie and his Mom live in a single rum slum hole. Can you connect these dots?

  You sound like a clone of me, except slightly younger and with more experience in social relationships with others.

  I personally believe that none of the problems currently destroying the biosphere we live in will or can be solved under current economic conditions. Continuing to pump carbon into the atmosphere, plastic into the oceans, and lies into people, is too profitable to a set of people who fully plan to be either dead or on Mars before the seas rise to claim us all, for humanity to stop playing Chicken with Death before it is far too late.

  Which means the only way to save humanity is to restructure society and the economy. Unionize your workplace, and have the union give an ultimatum: sell to us, or have your business sabotaged. Restructure your workplace into a democratically owned and operated enterprise (co-ops are, on top of being better at business in every way, also better at environmental stewardship). Convince others in your town to do the same. Get enough unions together that you can run your town independently of the traditional government, and be an example to others on how to do it themselves.
