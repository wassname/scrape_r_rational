  My money's on Hierarch being behind what's happening in Rochelant, maybe with his third aspect. We don't know why exactly he decided to leave Nicae to go with the League's armies, but I think this is the beginning of his play.

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Yeah, this is too similar to his general outlook on how Foreign Oligarchs should be dealt with to be entirely unconnected. Would also fit in with his objective of eventually judging a Seraph.

      ```
      Well, objective is a strong word, philosophy is more like it, he said that if a seraph wanted to deal with him then it would need to be appointed by the people, same goes for the gods below.
      ```

        > it would need to be appointed by the people

        Heirarch turning the Tyrant into a new angel confirmed.

  ```
  Man I fucking love this story. This sheer level of absolute chaos with no one knowing who's on who's side is unprecedented among the literature I've read. Reminds me a lot of the early Balkan wars.
  ```

- u/Allian42:
  ```
  If Cat meets the Tyrant, I don't think Calernia is gonna survive the sheer chaos that is bound to create. The meeting is gonna be a rollercoaster of quips and logical leaps.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Cat is forging a sword to deal with the Saint of Swords.  This is a terrible fucking idea.
  ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    I'm not so sure that what she's creating could be termed a sword, so much as an unsword.
    ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    > This is a terrible fucking idea

    Agreed, I cant wait to see it work anyway.
