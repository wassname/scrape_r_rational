  I was reminded to post this by the recent post of a [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1u4de0/the_tippyverse_a_dd_35_campaign_setting_where_the/) to the Tippyverse on this subreddit. The antagonists in this story end up basically being the Tippyverse, and it is awesome to see that in action in the hands of a talented author.

    Saw this on that other thread - good story so far!

    Edit: I'm up to the current chapter, 20, and I enjoy the story and where /u/eaglejarl is going with it, but some of the dialog is a [bit goofy and sometimes inconsistent (minor spoilers)](#s "Duncan changing between a Cockney-style voice and an R. Lee Emory voice, and using phrasing that is uniquely American/Earthican.  The narrator is really informal a lot, but maybe this is just the author's writing style. The protagonist Jake also randomly knows aikido (or at least one move from it), and is originally portrayed as a bit saggy and getting on in age, but later as in better physical shape than most Americans.").
