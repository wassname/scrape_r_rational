  I always get excited when I see this posted before I remember that I spam refresh that thread like I used to break F5 for Homestuck.

    Hell I help run the thing and I can barely keep up with the rate people post things over there. Playerbase is intensely invested.

      Hahah. It's pretty cool, honestly. I've always loved communities as... frenetic as that is. For me, even when I don't actively involve myself in discussions (I mostly just toss my two cents in from time to time), it's really cool to see the stuff the other players come up with.
