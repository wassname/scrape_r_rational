Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  The Chinese live action adaptation of the Three Body Problem (book 1) is out (16/30 episodes so far), and not only does it accurately adapt everything in the book, it drastically improves the characters, pacing, and mood, and has a pretty good soundtrack to.  The premise is that physicists around the world are committing suicide after being contacted by a mysterious organization, who then contact the protagonist, a material scientist, and torment him with seemingly supernatural powers while demanding he stop his research, while the military and a detective try to use him to figure out the truth behind it, which involves a weird VR game.  Meanwhile, in the 1960s, a college student is transferred to a remote radar station due to her "counterrevolutionary" beliefs.  Unlike the book, where the characters had very little personality, or reactions to even extreme events, even characters that were in only a couple paragraphs are made compelling, and they actively drive the plot forward instead of being passive reader-observation-platforms to be told the authors ideas. Not to be confused with the ongoing animated adaptation of the second book, which weirdly started releasing a month before the live action, and is very low quality, and also not to be confused with the Netflix adaptation also releasing this year.

    Man, I always hear *The Three Body Problem* bandied about as a "modern scifi classic" but I've avoided reading it, mostly because I don't buy the "dark forest" theory and because I've heard some very mixed reviews--in particular, people who don't read a lot of scifi seem to like it and those that do, don't (or at least that's my impression). 

    What do you people think?
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      the dark forest confuses the blackness of space for every single tree of interest being constantly lit 24/7/365 by vast nuclear floodlights for billions of years. 

      Webb launched and even now we've gotten exoplanet atmosphere data. We don't even have shit like lunar manufacturing. Literally any civilization capable of enforcing the dark forest is capable of preemptive extermination.

      As for layman vs scifi reader, the entire first book hangs on being a dumbass. The protagonist is supposedly a mathematician but doesn't understand what you can learn on a wikipedia page on the three body problem. It's unsolvable, sure, but you can also pretty easily approximate it and solve the entire "issue" they have.

      That's not getting into how the setup described is unstable and the planet would have been kicked out of the solar system before the trisolarans even evolved sentience. 

      Beyond that, it's a fun and interesting story. I liked the cultural revolution bits. But any time science is tried to be used to justify the plot it's like shoving a cheesegrater in your face.

        > The protagonist is supposedly a mathematician but doesn't understand what you can learn on a wikipedia page on the three body problem. It's unsolvable, sure, but you can also pretty easily approximate it and solve the entire "issue" they have.

        I mean, hell, calling it 'unsolvable' is a stretch. There's just no nice algebraic solution. But that's true of *almost everything* in the real world. Pretty much any model of real-world dynamics requires detailed simulation and suffers from divergence and chaotic behavior. Such is the nature of things. The three body problem is only interesting because it's a nice simple toy system that demonstrates the impossibility in finding exact algebraic solutions.
        ```

      - u/DAL59:
        ```
        He did solve the issue by approximating it, using the NPC logic gates computer. Modern Trisolaris can approximate the three body problem, and they know their planet will eventually be destroyed, and Earth is much more stable. Remember the game is just propaganda to encourage sympathy for the Trisolarans.
        ```

        - u/CreationBlues:
          ```
          Yeah, I have no problem with the trisolaran cult, we just spend half the book with the mathematically literate mc acting without the knowledge a layman can get skimming the Wikipedia article on the three body problem. 

          As for the stability that’s more of a parting shot after it burned all it’s goodwill on the page by page science failures. Having it just be a handwaved thing or whatever in the background would be fine if.
          ```

        - u/Izeinwinter:
          ```
          Given their tech level (and durability) they don't *need* life bearing worlds for anything. Seriously, way before the launch of the armada they should have transitioned to just hanging out in their home system in swarms of space stations doing station keeping with solar sails forever. 

          Or launched for the nearest singleton star with a nice collection of belts and planets. Why go someplace that might put up a fight?
          ```

          - u/DAL59:
            ```
            They are only able to expand at 1% the speed of light (before book 3). If they don't take out humanity, we might exceed their technology, expand faster and threaten them, the possibility of technological explosions is one of the two causes listed for the Dark Forest. That's why they say their invasion is the highest form of respect.
            ```

            - u/Izeinwinter:
              ```
              That indicates they didn't grasp deep time at all. Preemptively attacking everyone is a suicidal strategy, because if there are lower tech civilizations around for you to attack, the odds of you being at the actual top of that ranking is.. very low.. and it seems pretty likely that a bigger fish that was otherwise ignoring you might do something once you demonstrate that you are the worst neighbor imaginable.
              ```

    - u/CodexesEverywhere:
      ```
      I was not really a fan. A lot of the science fiction stuff is really silly >!(the aliens turn single protons into hyper-intelligent AI spaceships, and two of them are sufficient to stall all human tech development) . !< It is interesting to see some takes on the cultural revolution, but the stupidity of the sci-fi drags it down. And I feel there are way better stories to tell about "humans accidentally make first contact with hostile aliens". 

      I'd take anything by Greg Egan over TBP.
      ```

    - u/NinteenFortyFive:
      ```
      > I don't buy the "dark forest" theory

      Good, because for the most part it's actually ethno-nationalism given a sci-fi skin. Cixin said some pretty fucked up stuff about the Uyghur people and what's going on with them, and the whole thesis about cultures being inherently unable to coexist is a statement of philosophy that maps extremely well to how China treats it's own non-Han minorities. I feel like whether TBP is good or not to people mostly comes from them liking some of the concepts in the story and/or "vibing" with the very much pro-ethno-nationalist premise of the story, because everyone who reads it absolutely agree that the characters are just mouthpieces to progress the plot.

      I like to think that I am an avid sci-fi reader, and honestly *The Three Body Problem* and it’s sequels were pretty forgettable. I wouldn’t say it’s terrible, and the Dark Forest theory isn’t really a great theory, but it’s not the worst sci-fi book I’ve ever read. 

      I liked the execution of the whole >!2D and 4D ideas!< they were something I had never thought about before, but in general I can count the number of things I actually remember from that series on one hand. 

      One other thing I remember is that there was a lot  of pointless discussion of the ideas in the books by characters in the book. I can’t remember which book had this scenario but >!at one point humans and the Trisolarians were in a MAD scenario, but then the protagonist of the book gets to control the MAD weapon, and then the Trisolarians attack because there’s no way that the protagonist will use the weapon killing the Trisolarians, and she doesn’t!!< That whole scenario was debated endlessly in the book by different people, and then it happens, and the book is like “well that happened, that sucks for everyone, oh well” which was infuriating because there was a ton of buildup but no payoff. >!its like playing a D&D campaign where your DM has asked some interesting questions and the party is right about to face the big bad and answer these questions, but then your DM says “rocks fall, everyone dies” and then he leaves and never talks to you again!<


      Sorry for the rant, I didn’t think I felt that way about the books but, honestly it was a pretty forgettable series that goes nowhere interesting with its ideas.


      Edit: Upon further reflection- *The Three Body Problem* is definitely the best of the series, but ultimately forgettable in the grand scheme of sci-fi books.

    One of the best web serials I've read. I heard there was some kind of kerfuffle over how the author is monetizing it, but to be honest I'm mostly waiting for them to come out with physical books I can put on my shelf.
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      I know almost nothing, so take this with a grain of salt, but it sounded like they had signed some kind of agreement with a web serial app. I would be surprised if that deal allowed them to do regular publishing.

    - u/winteredDog:
      ```
      I only just finished Book 2 so I have a ways to go but it's one of the few works I've read that has genuinely made me laugh out loud. The depth to the characters and all of their quips is my favorite part: the actual plot I sometimes struggle to follow because the author just sort of assumes you're aware of the entire continent of Calernia and doesn't hold back. I've had to print out one of the fan-made maps to use as a reference when I read so I can keep up with all the various locations and states.

      I *still* don't understand why 
      >!the angel was forced to resurrect Catherine, what did she win and how was the Sword in the Stone connected?!<
      I'll probably need to go back and reread that part.

  This week’s request/rec thread seems pretty dead, so I’ll chip in with some obscure fandom recs.

  [An Impractical Guide to Godhood](https://archiveofourown.org/works/32339365/chapters/80167612) **by Antony444** (189k words)

  I’ll start with a *Percy Jackson x A Practical Guide to Evil* crossover, which follows the Tyrant of Helike reborn as Percy. The premise is as wacky as it sounds. Percy wreaks havoc and majorly screws with the plot. The worldbuilding is immense, and the plots and schemes are devious and dastardly.

  [Imperial Fire](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4632605/1/Imperial-Fire) **by Buddhacide** (188k words)

  A rare *Claymore x Dynasty Warriors* crossover which takes place before the Northern Campaign, where the major Claymore characters become beholden to the Kingdoms of Shu, Wu, and Wei. This is probably the most out of left field premise I’ve ever seen.

  [A Young Girl’s Guerrilla War](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-guerrilla-war-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil-x-code-geass.971950/) **by Readhead** (370k words)

  This one is a *Saga of Tanya the Evil x Code Geass* crossover. I was super excited to see this, and was not disappointed. Tanya is shuttled over to the world of Code Geass, landing in pre-invasion Japan, and has to endure the Britannian Conquest. She becomes a revolutionary and undergoes actual character development, and this fic actually breaks through her misunderstanding field. 

  [Trinity of Tokiwadai](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12120930/1/) **by Engineer4ever** (801k words)

  Another rare crossover between *A Certain Scientific Railgun and Naruto*, it follows Naru Namikaze, an orphan girl and gemstone of Academy City, ranked second among the Level 5 espers. She works as a Dark Sider on behalf of Aleister Crowley.

  [SAPR](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13052012/1/SAPR) **by ScipioSmith** (1968k words)

  A *My Little Pony and RWBY* crossover. This one is genuinely brilliant, and the prose is perfect. It’s sort of like a grand historical political fantasy, except there’s a ton of cool fights. The author is an actual accomplished author with published books, and weaves a story of a grand struggle against overwhelming odds by noble and valorous warriors. The main character, Sunset, begins as a petty person with grandiose delusions, and she gradually grows into her role and responsibilities.

  [The Pride Before](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-pride-before-pokemon-xianxia.111674/page-2#post-26360177) **by SolarFall** (32k words)

  An astonishingly well written *Pokemon x Xianxia* crossover, it blends Chinese cultivation with Pokémon. Trainers must cultivate aura and break through realms to control Pokemon, and this story follows Red, a heterogenous trainer who refuses to become a type specialist, instead cultivating all types of aura. Here’s the story’s synopsis:

  *When the Blackthorn clan turns on their vassals, the Fantasia heiress is left to scurry into Icy Path, her Pokemon taken, her cultivation shattered, and her dragon's pride cruelly humbled. There, she meets Red, a reckless trainer from Kanto with a burning ambition.*

  *When a trainer falls to the very bottom, what is there to do but climb the mountain again?*

    The Pride Before, it’s something about the writing style that just really clicks with me. It’s skippy, quick, parseable. I got a lot out of it, and I’ve actually reread it once since the most recent chapter dropped. 

    It doesn’t hurt that it’s Red (which as someone who doesn’t care for the anime styled fics is a HUGE plus) and loosely based on Cradle. +1 on that Rec.

  I've been reading AO3 founder Astolat's [Game of Thrones fanfictions](https://archiveofourown.org/users/astolat/pseuds/astolat/works?fandom_id=242462), which vary from chapter to chapter on being pretty rational to being idealistic and deus-ex-machina silly, (particularly the best one IMO, Royal Flush.) Trying to keep to a resolution of at least one dead-tree format book a month this year I've found myself drawn to rereading Stephen King's [Carrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_(novel\) ).

  In the course of daydreaming at work I've figured that the things I've liked about these are the epistolic elements (excerpts of documents such as letters and diary entries embedded in the text) and the frequent opposing viewpoints. Has anybody got any suggestions for rational or rational-adjacent works featuring these elements in a modern setting where the cast isn't mostly teenagers and/or college students?
  ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    My first thought is Piranesi, which is told almost entirely through the titular character's diary entries and notes as he goes about life in an endless labyrinth that is somehow connected to the modern world. The switching opposed viewpoints aren't so present, but I think his thoughtful perspective at least approaches rational-adjacent. It's probably my favorite of the occult liminal spaces genre, in part because it's so much more warm and upbeat than works like House of Leaves.

  Definite recommendation for **How Not to Write a Novel** by Howard Mittelmark and Sandra Newman.

  I read several "how to write" self-help books over the years, and It was always hard to put the advice into actual practice when I was "in the zone" of writing. I logically known what mistakes to avoid, but did them anyway.  


  HNtWaN is silly and irreverent, in fact often insulting to the reader, but it get the core points across, in a way that is well memorized, and thus helps you to hit the breaks and rethink what you are writing when you make a glaring fuckup.   


  While the goal of the book is to lead a writer through a process of writing a novel fit for traditional publishing, it is perhaps even more useful to writers of webnovels, who, without the constrains of actual paper, commit all the plot and characterization atrocities known to literature.
