  I'm just going to throw out that you just made Taylor the most powerful cape in the universe, possibly baring Contessa, and that it's going to be really hard to get challenges. So if you want for it to be anything other than a powertrip you gotta find other ways of creating tension. And if you want the story to be rational you have to assume that Scion have a stronger power, otherwise the entities wouldn't jeapardize their existence by giving her this strong a power, which is going to be a significant power up from canon.

    Yeah, this was pretty drastic.

    Scion has all the powers. Scion has all of *her* powers. (Edit: in this story.) Taylor's not going to be beating him even if she leverages her powerset to its fullest extent and makes literally everyone on the planet equal to her. I do have an outline of where the story will be going, though it is very flexible and has already changed multiple times so far.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:

      I am fairly confident that Scion doesn't have the powers that he have given out. If so he could just have stopped Taylor from using her mind control when they were fighting him.

      I get the feeling that this is going to be a relatively short story, what with Taylor getting the broken lord-ruler powerset. But that’s ok!  I like what you have written so far and you should tell the story you want to tell

  Just a small suggestion, the new metals and the powers associated with them are hard to keep track of. Steel and gold are well entrenched, cadmium and bronze's feruchemical uses are getting there, but the rapid-fire testing of the last chapter is a bit overwhelming. You may have already planned something similar, but spending a couple of chapters where one or two new metals are the primary focus would help with that.  This coming from someone who has read both Mistborn trilogies.

  Other than that, an enjoyable read.
  ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    Don't worry, I'm going to move the focus to individual metals soon. The testing is just an acknowledgment that these metals exist.

  Gotta say, I am a bit disappointed with how fast things have moved. I love Mistborn and one of the more compelling aspects of both Vin and Taylor's stories is watching them slowly gain knowledge in how to leverage their powersets, coming up with ways to beat more powerful opponents with strategy. I wanted to see Taylor interact with more heroes/villains having access only to a few metals, then slowly expand her repoitoire, as much in the tricks and interactions she figures out as in actual new powers. Then branching into Feruchemy and EVENTUALLY, at a climactic moment, discovering compounding and breaking the scale.

  She's been in few enough combat situations that I can count them on one hand and she's already (basically) at Lord Ruler levels. I don't see much more room for (or need for) inventiveness anymore; she's not going to waste time steelpushing Kid Win's gear, for example, or getting involved in an emotional battle with Glory Girl, or testing the interplay between Bendalloy and other temporal powers.

  There are still places for the story to go, don't get me wrong, bur there's a bunch of cool, compelling stuff that got skipped over and in my opinion, would be weird to delve into now, after Taylor can regenerate from near-death instantaneously, move faster than the speed of sound, and throw cars into the sun. And she has atium too!
  ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    Yep. She's going to be empowering others, though, and I might be exploring an arc or two from the point of view of someone with a few granted powers.

        Thanks for the criticism. Next time I’m dealing with a similar power I’ll most likely pick one of those two options. As for robo-Armsmaster, can you tell me what made you think I ran with this characterization? I’ve tried to portray him as terse, someone who doesn’t waste his time, but is aware of this and isn’t a bad person or anything. You could call him rude I guess, but I think that’s the greatest similarity I’ve allowed in the fic.

  How are things comming along? I don't hope that you were motivated by my last post here. I was just pointing out that you'd have to look for OTHER challenges than the regular cape on cape. Amelia was a fanfic that did a decent job at finding challenges for protagonists with high tier power sets and I personally love fics with MCs that tries to change bigger societal structures.

  Edit: I don't know too much about the mistborn series but someone mentioned that you could create mistborns? If so an interesting challenge could come out of Taylor trusting the wrong person and giving them powers/information that would let them challenge her.

  Just read the first two chapters. This is bad. Really bad, even by the low standards of Worm alt power fanfic (I say this having written eminently forgettable alt power fics like Logos myself).

  EDIT: Ah, I see you're the author. No offense intended. If you're open to feedback, I'll write up some in-depth feedback when I get home.

  EDIT 2: I'll take it from the downvotes that the answer's no. Good luck with it, mate.
  ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    Hmm? I’m not the one who downvoted you, mate, I went to sleep immediately after posting the latest chapter, but you’re certainly at positive votes now. Earlier feedback informed me that the first three or so chapters are pretty low quality but the story gets better after. Make of that what you will. I always accept feedback, which is why I’m posting on SpaceBattles and SufficientVelocity in the first place. And I do agree that Punctuated Equilibrium is ... well, awful, but I don’t think that even the first few chapters of this story are anywhere near that bad.

  Continuation of Lord Ruler!Taylor.

  Soon we'll be exploring the creations of devices such as the Bands of Mourning or the Scadrial medallions.
