    It's definite fav and it's good to see it back. It's definitely been posted here a couple times over the years.

      Yeah I read it after I saw it recommended (90% sure it was here) a few months back. Loved it!

  First time reading it and it was great!

  The biggest surprise is that the author also cowrote the Expanse. This is good writing, but I remember not being able to make it through the first book.

    The Dagger and the Coin is excellent.

  One thing about it that strikes me as non-rational is that the third problem was only difficult because Lord Iron asked the question in a confusing way. >!If instead of asking for the price of a soul he asked how to not go to hell, the Cambist could have answered immediately.!<

    I don't think that's true. The Cambist is shown to be good at exchanging one thing for another. If the problem were not couched in the form of finding a price, he might not be able to generate any better advice than >!"reform, spend your money on charity, don't have wild semiconsensual sex orgies and murder people"!<; which presumably Lord Iron knew perfectly well already. The relevant insight is not >!"a life of virtue and service"!<; it is >!"I happen to have one such, with which I am willing to part"!<.
    ```

    - u/archpawn:
      ```
      The insight it took him three days to figure out was >!Lord Iron was trying to buy his soul, rather than sell it.!<
      ```

      - u/King_of_Men:
        ```
        True, but if not for spending those days thinking about it in terms of a transaction, even if the wrong transaction, could he have come up with the solution?
        ```
