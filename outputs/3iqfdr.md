## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Charles Stross joked that we created artificial intelligence fifty years ago, it's just that we call them "corporations" instead of AI. This isn't really a new thought at all; "bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of an expanding bureaucracy" has been around for a while, and of course there's Scott Alexander's ["Meditations on Moloch"](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). But it's got me thinking about the extent to which organizational entities like governments, governmental institutions, corporations, etc. resemble entities with their own goals and behavioral patterns.

  It's tempting to say that corporations are profit-maximizing entities, but I don't think that's true. A corporation is made up of people, very few of whom are (in my experience) trying to maximize profits. A corporation is also made up of processes, very few of which are (in my experience) trying to maximize profits. You can make the argument corporations are in competition with each other and that "fitness" is determined by profit, which in turn means that corporations as a whole will be profit-maximizing, but I think if that's true, it's only one aspect (and just the most obvious one). I think it might be better to say that organizations in general are existence-maximizing and that profit is only one tool in the utility belt.

  I've naturally been trying to find a story somewhere in there, but haven't had much success so far.

    It's likely that none of the parts that make you up - your cells, organs, tissues, and whatnot - have goals in common with your overall self. As nearly meaningless as the phrase might be, it's the sort of situation that the term "emergent behaviour" tries to describe. Trying to work out the goals of an overall corporation based on the goals of its individual members seems to be almost exactly the same sort of thing.

    We also have nick bostroms disneyland without children: 

    >We could thus imagine, as an extreme case, a technologically highly advanced society, containing many complex structures, some of them far more intricate and intelligent than anything that exists on the planet today â€“ a society which nevertheless lacks any type of being that is conscious or whose welfare has moral significance. In a sense, this would be an uninhabited society. It would be a society of economic miracles and technological awesomeness, with nobody there to benefit. A Disneyland with no children.

  I don't know if this is necessarily off topic, but I felt I'd just play it safe.  Sherlock holmes is, as EY's pointed out many times, not rational/solvable(instead, its a story about someone pulling answers from thin air).  However, a comment I saw got me thinking--is MacGyver rational?  Or, failing that, is it a good example of munchkinism?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    MacGyver is *sometimes* rational, depending on the episode. A lot of the environments are "just so" environments which are set up with all the pieces necessary to solve a problem in a contrived way. Sometimes the inventions wouldn't actually work. But the show does have a basic respect for science and engineering that I think is admirable.

    Like Sherlock Holmes, I think it's a character that naturally lends itself to rationality in some sense; the base is already there. But is it actually rational? Not really. There are too many plot holes, implausibilities, and outright fabrications in service of plot.

  So.  Quantum immortality.  It's the idea that, provided that death is the end of existence and the many worlds interpretation holds true, you will always subjectively experience survival, no matter how improbable it becomes.  Let's say that the assumptions behind quantum immortality are valid, for this thought experiment.

  You are placed in an apparatus that, when activated, rolls a six-sided dice, shows you the result, and kills you if it comes up six; there is some tiny chance of mechanical failure that could prevent it from functioning properly.  What probability tree accurately conveys what you should subjectively expect to experience?  I have two different models for this scenario:

  1) All possibilities that end in your death are preemptively eliminated.  You should expect to see a six a tiny percentage of the time, in which case the machine will fail.

  2) Probability proceeds exactly as expected from your perspective, except that in the moment when you would otherwise die, something like a mechanical failure will stop it.  You should expect a one-in-six chance of seeing a six, and if you see a six, you should expect the normal tiny odds of mechanical failure, but *something* is always going to happen to save you in the actual moment of death - probably something crazy and improbable like the machine spontaneously vanishing because the right matter in it ceases to exist all at once, or aliens passing by, or everything suddenly turns out to be a bad dream, or something like that.

  The first model seems a lot more elegant to me, but feels deeply unsettling - it indicates that I'm essentially alive by the anthropic principle.  The second model, on the other hand, feels more out of line with everyday experience and more in line with the idea of an afterlife, which tells me that it's probably a misunderstanding of quantum immortality.   IDK how much of this makes sense; just hoping it's thought-provoking to someone.  Is quantum immortality a rationally valid idea?  It sounds provable to me, though only by an individual being and not by a civilization.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I think I must have been misunderstanding what quantum immortality was saying for a long time. I thought that it was essentially saying "some version of you will always survive". That's all well and good.

    What I don't understand is this argument that you will always subjectively survive; I must clearly be missing something, because it seems obviously false to me. I mean ... we fall asleep every night, so we know what the subjective experience of slipping away from consciousness is like, and we know that we *can* lose consciousness. Why wouldn't that be the same for death regardless of MWI or not? If you're going to argue that we never subjectively fall asleep, then I don't think it seems to matter whether MWI is true or not for the purposes of that argument.

      Well, maybe not...

      Say there is something called Quantum Insomnia in addition to Quantum Immortality. We are all oblivious to it because we are copies made this morning, but tonight we each get to (in our own separate extremely rare universe branch) experience eternal sleeplessness in addition to immortality.

      Hopefully the pain of sleep deprivation doesn't last forever. I suppose at some point it becomes probable enough that they develop a comprehensive cure for sleepiness to outweigh the chance of remaining awake naturally.

      I believed in this interpretation of sleep at first (it was intuitive to me as a child) but deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind sleep lead me to believe that sleep is not a *cessation* of consciousness, just a *dulling* of it.  The only dreams you remember are the last ones before you wake up - and I think this hints at the idea that consciousness persists through sleep, but we don't perceive it as similar to "ordinary" consciousness because memory formation is impaired.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        But there are other mechanisms leading to cessation of consciousness, like anesthesia (though I guess whether it hinders actual consciousness or just severely disrupts memory consolidation  or w/e can be disputed), and we can definitely experience it? I think I'm missing something here :/
        ```

  - u/DataPacRat:
    ```
    It may help to insert a short time delay between when the 6 is rolled and when the apparatus kills you, such as 10 seconds; and then to consider two separate questions:

    * What is the probability that, 5 seconds after the roll, you will be able to look back 5 seconds in your memory and find that a "6" was rolled?
    * What is the probability that, 60 seconds after the roll, you will be able to look back 60 seconds in your memory and find that a "6" was rolled?

  I found [an excellent 800,000-word *Naruto* story](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715). I'm not even halfway through it, but it already stands a very good chance of replacing *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* as my favorite book! It feels like a calmer counterpoint to the action of *Time Braid*, just as *[Eden](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3494886)* seemed like a calmer counterpoint to the action of *Methods of Rationality* in the *Harry Potter* fandom.

  (It doesn't feel particularly rational, though--though I am *by no means* an expert in such judgments.)

  -----

  Update: I absolutely loved the vast majority of *In the Blood*--so many twists!--but wasn't satisfied *at all* with how the author chose to end the Uchiha half of the plot. ([Spoilered opinion](#s "I think Sasuke's suicide attempt should have succeeded.")) Still, this is definitely my second-favorite *Naruto* fanfiction, displacing *[People Lie](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099)*. It's harder to say whether or not it's my second-favorite *book* of all time; for now, I'll err on the side of "no".

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      I would say pretty high as far as fanfics go. It takes place twenty years or so after the series (and this started before the series concluded, so there is some discontinuity) and references a lot of past events subtly. You can read it without too much knowledge, but there are so many parts you'll miss because you're lacking the context.
      ```

      - u/Salivanth:
        ```
        Well, I guess I have another reason to keep going through Naruto now, since I loved the shit out of Time Braid with nothing but some Googling and reading the Chunin Exam Arc synopsis to go on.

        It's weird; Naruto is the first media I've seen where I enjoy every fanfic I read more than the source material. Probably because it tends to be faster-paced, and almost never has the infuriating "fighting" which consists of about five parts talking to one part actually doing things. The only fight I've seen with major talking between opposing parties is the final battle of The Waves Arisen, and there was a very good reason for that one. (And it STILL has a higher fighting-to-talking ratio than the anime)

        Of course, it helps that I've only read a few Naruto fanfictions, and thus am still enjoying the limited supply of "best of the best" that the community has produced. 

        While I'm talking about reading Naruto for the sake of fanfictions; is it worth watching the filler episodes? Will it improve my fanfic comprehension? In the near term, I'm specifically talking about the very large filler arc at the end of the original Naruto, before Naruto Shippuden starts.
        ```

        - u/Kishoto:
          ```
          Most of  the filler stuff is useless. Some fanfics will use filler material (weapons, characters, etc.) but even when it's done, it's usually just padding to the story itself. The filler is fairly inconsequential and not all that entertaining, unless you REALLY like the other konoha genin. 

          Also, here's a contribution to your reading list: [A really well done 'Naruto is trained as a weapon' fic](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3430516/1/Lost-soul)

            Thanks very much! I'll just skip the filler then, which is good news, as I now have a lot less I need to catch up on before being caught up.

          > While I'm talking about reading Naruto for the sake of fanfictions; is it worth watching the filler episodes? Will it improve my fanfic comprehension?

          Generally, it's not very often that filler-based material is integral to the story of a fanfiction, and quite rare that material from any of the *Naruto* movies is used--though the first movie, *Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow*, seems relatively popular, with its high-tech locomotives and chakra armor, and there seems to be a post-timeskip movie that involves time travel to Minato's lifetime and back, though I haven't seen it. Still, I found several filler arcs and episodes to be enjoyable on their own merits, myself.

          The Bikouchuu Beetle arc (episodes 148-151) in particular is pretty much a must-watch--in the final episode of that arc, Hinata's original technique is presented, and it's one of the few filler-based items to more or less migrate into semi-canon status, having been featured in many of the video games and even in the spin-off *Rock Lee* series, though never in the manga itself. Even *Time Braid* made reference to it. The Kurosuki arc (episodes 152-157) is also somewhat important, as its main villain (along with his weapon) is the only actual [Canon Immigrant](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant) of the entire series. Post-timeskip, I'd say the Three-Tails arc (episodes 89-112) is probably the only good one; its main villain is also somewhat popular among fanfiction writers, I think. *Revenge of the Shadow Clones* (episode 230) is also rather hilarious.

  I've been assembling background and worldbuilding ideas for the next portion of "S.I." in the 'spoilers' document at https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bLSApEUTSzms90BtlaUUuHyQxh5PS7apDNj4mwlSMs/edit , starting a few pages from the end of it (at the comment highlighting 'Aug 11'). I could use some feedback on that, on any issues I haven't thought of or logical consequences I should take into account, before I start locking those details into the narrative proper.

  I'm bringing it up now because I've finally gotten to a core point of how I've been trying to make the story rational: laying out the main motivations of the prominent characters, which will be what I use to determine how the events of the plot proceed. As long as those motives make sense, given the worldbuilding involved, then everything should work out; so I would most appreciate constructive commentary that affects that part of the notes.

    The only thing I can think to ask is, where is the Hive located and why did they choose that spot?

    If they live underground, then knowing what they look for in a potential living site can help Bunny to check for any other possible Hives. I'd be very surprised if there is only the one Hive, since why wouldn't the Hive try to create other Hives?

    I'd recommend reading [Coalescence](http://www.amazon.com/Coalescent-Stephen-Baxter/dp/0345457854/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8) by Stephen Baxter. It does a great job of showing how on a slightly different evolutionary track, humans can form a more social, hive-like society with some personality traits in common with insects such as sacrificing the individual for the good of the hive and rigidly defined castes.

    \>NLP

    \>Not natural language processing

    Is neuro-linguistic programming a reasonable thing in any way?

    Wiki says

    >The balance of scientific evidence reveals NLP to be a largely discredited pseudoscience. Scientific reviews show it contains numerous factual errors,[14][16] and fails to produce the results asserted by Bandler & Grinder.[17][18]
    ```

      > Is neuro-linguistic programming a reasonable thing in any way?

      Given that (best I can tell) [NLP](http://nlpdocs.com/) was only ever a pretentious marketing term that meant whatever the authors wanted it to mean (at least, along the lines of "use of words and logic to affect the brain in some way"), well sure, sort of.

      I would describe it as a dated, formerly trademarked variation on terms like "mind hacking" or "brain hacking". Maybe taboo the actual term it if it distracts people (edited original comment).

      The thing I mentioned, reframing things to produce more advantageous reaction, is what many people would call common sense. (Or politics, or marketing, or journalism, or comedy, or education, etc.) The authors of the book I linked to decided to classify it as a form of NLP. Maybe someone else has written something  better on the topic and called it something else less pretentious, but I'm not familiar with it off the top of my head so perhaps we can conclude that the marketing was successful.

      Regarding the WP article, one name I noticed in the discussion and edit history is David Gerard. His edits seem fairly benign, but from past experience I know he's one of the ringleaders of a cohort of particularly arrogant knuckleheads calling itself RationalWiki. I suspect the hostility bled over from there (or somewhere similar), rather than representing the opinion of most experts actually familiar with the topic (maybe to some degree representing the opinions of neurologists, linguists, and programmers though, as the term appears calculated to offend all three of these specialties).

      Here is an older [version](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&oldid=675553343) of the quoted section:

      > It has been claimed that the balance of scientific evidence reveals NLP to be a largely discredited pseudoscience.[16] Scientific reviews show it contains numerous factual errors,[14][17] and fails to produce the results asserted by Bandler & Grinder.[18][19] However, Steve Andreas has called the relevance of much of the research into question and claimed that more recent research supports NLP methods, albeit indirectly.[20]

      The reference (which looks to have been lost in the shuffle, not removed for any particular reason) is [this article](http://realpeoplepress.com/blog/research-in-nlp-neurolinguistic-programming-science-evidence) which says the debunkery is focused on one particular non-central point suggested by the authors early on as a learning tool, which they soon afterwards corrected, called primary representational system (PRS). 

      PRS was the idea of people having a specific primary way of representing their memories such as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. So if you are a kinesthetic type of person you would learn better by doing an exercise physically, whereas a more auditory or visual person would learn faster from listening to an audiotape or videotape respectively. (YouTube, what's that? This was the 80's.) It was an appealing notion for educators seeking to educate more effectively, but the studies apparently didn't pan out.

      The article goes on to discuss evidence in support of various other topics also published under the NLP moniker, including the treatment of PTSD.

      I'm not sure that's the whole story. Bandler seems to also make some pretty grandiose claims (the wikipedia article talks about claims of curing schizophrenia) . But it definitely seems more complicated than "NLP is a debunked pseudoscience".

      In the talk section on WP, a hypnotherapist also [discusses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming#Neutrality) NLP as being a general body of knowledge -- not a specific model of the brain, not uniquely classifiable under to that term, etc.

      > Actually, no one has ever sought me out for NLP services, and I expect no one ever will. People always see me for hypnotherapy. But I found many of the concepts presented in NLP (a) helpful and (b) not unique to NLP -- for example, cognitive reframing, operant conditioning, the "parts" metaphor, ideomotor response, imaginary rehearsal, therapeutic metaphor, and so on. I've found this lack-of-uniqueness useful when bridging modalities, but it makes the vitriol a bit startling!

      A useful comparison might be CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) which probably uses a lot of the same techniques, although I haven't read up on it yet. Given the fact that it has a name that doesn't sound like it is trying to usurp three entire academic specialties (neuroscience, linguistics, and programming), my prediction would be that it is more popular among academics all else equal (i.e. assuming equally valid theoretical grounding and equal efficacy). On the other hand, due to being a far less *memorable* term (because it doesn't paint a fantastical picture of reprogramming the brain like a computer), it would tend to be less well known or widely discussed among the general public.
