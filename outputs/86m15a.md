      ELI5, how is this a jab at Pinker?

        Arguments similar to the ones made by Progress Man were made by Pinker in his recent book Enlightenment Now.

        The very last panel says that they'll remember Steven thanks to cheaper solid-state memory drives and Steven Pinker is an authoritative figure in the field of cognitive psychology who firmly believes in a *computational* theory of mind. The joke is, are they remembering him because of pictures saved on the drives or because his mind was copied and uploaded to the drives?

          Not knowing about him, I took it to mean that he contributed better flash storage designs to humanity, and that is his legacy.

      Is the icon on Progress Man's chest just a stylized P, or is it some other symbol?

      I'd have thought a Delta would be pretty thematically appropriate for that kind of superhero, after all.
