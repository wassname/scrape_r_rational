  Let’s assume, for the sake of the narrative, that nonconsensual mind-reading is not in Unsong’s repertoire(otherwise it’s game over). That being said, there are three paths available to them for getting the Vital Name out of Aaron:

  A) The Stick: Torture/torturing his friends/various other threats.

  B) The Carrot: Try to talk him into giving it up, giving reasons for how Unsong will use the name for good and offering him things he wants.

  C) The Con: Trick Aaron into revealing the word.

  Unsong is probably very good at A) if they work for Hell, but Torture is still unreliable and would probably be only used if other strategies failed. Unsong is also probably very good at B), but I’d expect Aaron to be very unpersuadable. I think Unsong’s best move is to try for a con. Speed Aaron away to a dark cell, make a show of trying to get the Vital Name out of him. Then, Aaron is suddenly “rescued”. Maybe by agents claiming to be another Unitarian cell, or perhaps some more serious rebel group. The theater plays out, and Aaron is eventually alone and speaks the Vital Name again. Unsong is of course listening in, either through magical or technological bugs, and win. If Aaron doesn’t say the name again, they recapture him and move on to strategies A) and B) in earnest.

  The scary thing is, even if Unsong doesn’t do this, if Aaron gets out of this he should be paranoid that they have.

    I really like this thought. It's basically the sort of idea of some of the best parts of *The Prisoner*. However, I get the feeling that there's probably other stuff that will be going on. Unsong are possibly super competent - is there any real evidence to suggest that they haven't through secret courts + gag orders, and other measures, forced all consumer-available OSes to keep their microphones active and to store the last ~24 hours of audio that was spoken in their presence? Because if you're boobytrapping things like Llull anyways, why not go the whole hog?

    It also doesn't seem impossible that Unsong are simply playing at another level. What if they have the word that Aaron discovered already, and are either not using it, or using it only under extremely controlled conditions, while trying to keep a lid on the situation by suppressing the word every time it arises? Or perhaps each word that does the ensouling can only be used once and Unsong constantly try to gather all ensouled equipment into their possession?

    Aaron's paranoia, clarity of thought, and skepticism has very much not been a feature of the story so far, so if they do end up trying to con him as you suggest I think it'll likely work. I could also see Unsong going for a 'join up or die' approach.

      I think that if the forces of darkness already knew the Vital Name, they wouldn't have given Aaron something so close to it to test in the magic sweatshop.

        Well, UNSONG and Countenance are two separate entities. UNSONG could have known the name without Countenance knowing it.

    He said himself he'd probably take a cushy salary with benefits and denounce those UU hippies if they offered. On the other hand, he seems like the kind of guy to spit in the face of death because it seemed like a good idea at the time, then awkwardly wipe his saliva off the reaper's skeletal face with a sleeve. Wincing and apologizing

  Has anyone started to make a list of all the names and what they do?
  ```

  - u/Darth_Hobbes:
    ```
    Well now they have. In order of appearance, by ctrl-f for "Name ":

    The Vital Name: 

    >Today at work, I accidentally discovered a Name that gives souls to non-living objects. Like, not just turns them into golems. But actual souls. Nobody knows.

    The Wakening Name: 
    > Me, the guy who had gotten a $70 fine earlier that day for using a Divine Name to wake me up because the coffee pot was empty.

    The Sentinal Name: 

    >"Whenever you use a protected Name of God,” I continued “UNSONG agents with the Sentinel Name tattooed above their ear, and the Names involve tattooed on their foreheads, can track your location."

    The Confounding Name:

    >As soon as you realize you’re in trouble, sing yourself the Confounding Name and forget all about us.

    The Vanishing Name: 
    >“What does the Vanishing Name do? It’s no less than a form of teleportation! Speak the Name, and you disappear and reappear somewhere else within a few hundred miles. According to my sources one of the test subjects in Pittsburgh ended up in Akron, and another one in Erie. The precise range is unknown, and the destination doesn’t seem to be under voluntary control. Hence the label. It’s useful for getting out of a situation, but not necessarily getting into one. Useful for, for example, underground Unitarian choir members in exactly the types of problems we’re hoping to avoid.”

    >“So what’s the catch to this seemingly astounding discovery? First, the Vanishing Name teleports you to a situation complementary to the one you were trying to get out of. Both of the testers in Pittsburgh, for example, ended up in laboratories devoted to the testing of kabbalistic Names. So there you are in a laboratory testing a kabbalistic Name in Pittsburgh, and you speak the Name, and you end up in a laboratory testing a kabbalistic Name in Akron.


    The Luminous Name:

    >The Luminous Name had been worked into various prayers and magic squares and configurations to produce lights of dizzying shapes and colors. 

    The Kinetic Name:

    >Clever inventors in self-funded workshops had incorporated the Kinetic Name into all sorts of little gadgets and doodads. 

    The Fertile Name:

    >The Fertile Name brings forth grain from the earth, speeding the growth of crops by nearly half.

    The Purifying Name:

    >The Purifying Name instantly kills eighteen species of harmful bacteria, including two that are resistant to all but the most toxic antibiotics.

    The Explicit Name:

    >Either Harold or Juan.

    SCABMOM:

    >“Sacred kabbalistic marriage of minds,” said Erica.


    The Moon-Locating-Name: 

    > A bright light appeared a couple of feet in front of my face. From the light sprung a beam, pointing up and a little to the west.

    > ...

    >“It shows the location of the moon,” I said.


    The Optometry Name:

    > "The Name was HANAPHOR-KOTA-SALUSI-NAI-AVORA-STE-KORUSA. I spoke it once, then took off my glasses. I had perfect 20-20 vision."


    The Avalanche Name: 

    >It was a simple name, the Avalanche Name, only eleven letters, not very good at hurting people but excellent for collapsing buildings. Also good at getting people’s attention. Ana was a sound sleeper. Once she’d told me she wouldn’t wake up even if the house fell down around her. I figured she was exaggerating. I guess we would find out.

    The Tenebrous Name: 

    > I spoke the Tenebrous Name and plunged the street into darkness.

    The Bulletproof Name:

    >While they were adjusting, I spoke the Bulletproof Name, which would protect me from exactly one bullet. Names must be spoken clearly and distinctly. Unless you’re the Comet King or something, you can’t get much more than eight or ten letters a second. The Bulletproof name was forty letters , which meant four to five seconds. That meant I wasn’t so much safe as “safe from anyone who couldn’t shoot me twice within a four second interval”. Once again, I did not expect UNSONG to have that problem.

    The Ascending Name:

    > So I ran to the side of the house. The Ascending Name would send me up to the balcony, but they would probably hear me, either through the Sentinel Name or the normal channels. My options were kind of limited. I spoke it anyway, fast as I could, and got hit by a bullet. It hurt. I jumped through where the front window would be if I hadn’t collapsed the front of the house and made it into the apartment above ours.

      You missed the Thunderclap name, which Aaron uses to get people to shut up and pay attention, and the Tempestuous name, which someone spoke at the incident in Colorado.

      > The Divine Name:

      > 
      >     Me, the guy who had gotten a $70 fine earlier that day for using a Divine Name to wake me up because the coffee pot was empty.

      That's Wakening Name. Divine Name is just a catch-all expression.

      You missed the Motive Name, which is an alternative to engines

      Also:
      >The Purifying Name instantly kills eighteen species of harmful bacteria, including two that are resistant to all but the most toxic antibiotics. But two-thirds of American hospitals have no one licensed to use the Purifying Name. Why not? Because they can’t afford the licensing fees demanded by Gogmagog.

    ```
    Wakening - magic coffee

    Vanishing - swap to complimentary situation

    Tenebrous - magic darkness

    Avalanche - nice building, be a shame if something happened to it

    Bulletproof - like a made-in-china toy, it does what it says on the tin, once

    Vital - like chicken soup for the soul, except the other way around

    Motive - vroooooooom

    Tempestuous - thunder and lightning, very very frightening

    Sentinel - speak no Name, for they hear. tattooed alongside the ones to watch for.

    Wrathful - a bad idea in syllabic form

    Thunderclap - tin, what it says on, boom

    Might be more, but that's all I've briefly found

  ```
  What if Unsong are the good guys, and have a very good reason for doing what they do that will be revealed now that they've captured Aaron?
  ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    Not letting Aaron use the Vital Name, or any Names, for that matter, seems like a pretty good reason already.
    ```

      ```
      Hey, what're you arresting me for? I was just trying to take over the world. Hey, hey, let me go!

  Reading this felt like a ruined orgasm.
