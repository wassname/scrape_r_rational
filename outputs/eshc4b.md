## [RT][WIP] The Elemental Arena - Chapter 18

### Post:

[Awareness](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena/chapter/448412/chapter-eighteen-awareness) is now up, covering the aftermath of the RPG turning into a 4X town builder with a side of crafting. 

The Elemental Arena is written by /u/Gilgilad7. It is a rational litRPG where players are in a game with their lives at stake. Winning will take good decisions, good teamwork, and no small amount of munchkinry.

  Well my prediction about item crafting being a wood prime skill was correct, not too surprising. Gotta say I didn't really care much for this chapter. Reading people get mad on behalf of another person's "honor" or "dignity" or whatever makes me cringe like I'm watching a particularly awkward episode of the Office. 

  Really though, there wasn't much that happened this chapter. We got one team decision (and not even the actual implementation of it, just committal), a character being berated for being dumb, then that character being dumb again in a slightly different way. It's not like I hate characterization chapters, but this one felt devoid of anything meaningful.

  It's interesting to me how they assumed that every single other action they took that net EPs would have granted them affinity, because that honestly hadn't even crossed my mind. I took for granted that only significant actions would give them anything, the only other one I can imagine them having missed would be the first to kill a monster. The rest are more fundamentally individual activities, which would conflict with the bonus being awarded to the contributing group.

    Yeah, this chapter was a conga line of humiliation for Nathan, mostly by his own hand. It was a painful read.

    I think Maya's probably wrong about the various firsts because they're all individual achievements worth 2 NPs. You'd think that the participant awards would be far weaker in this case, and that Maya herself with her high Mental stat would have stumbled upon one of these. For that matter, Nathan has a knack for uncovering skills, and he hasn't triggered such an award, either.

    The 5 NP awards we've seen were based on surviving an interval, so a first done achievement for those seems unlikely.

    I'm gonna assume you meant to type he needs to be a **Wood** 6 Prime, or I don't think he'll be able to upgrade that skill ever :P

  Ouch, Nathan grabbed the idiot ball and nearly ran an idiot touchdown in from halfway across the field. What do you think the odds are that the pending attack will be a simple encounter with Horned Beavers and Gutharks?

  I don't think so, either.

    Especially dumb since I think Harrison might have actually changed his behavior if Nathan had made it clear how inappropriate it was. Now he gets to play the victim card, which is sure to make him even more insufferable.
    ```

    - u/Brell4Evar:
      ```
      I don't feel like I know enough about Harrison to really get a grip on the guy. He's got a mouth on him, sure, but you get these moments like him comforting Emma in the last chapter.

      If the Immortal Collective's selection process can admit true sociopaths, this guy may well be one. It's also possible the guy is really stand-up and just doesn't know any better than to be an ass.

      Regardless, Nathan's attack on him was in no way the right thing to do. It was a tactical and strategic blunder. He's at best alienated a handful of people, and at worst made himself one of the most dangerous enemies possible in his situation, with no good outcome possible.

      The protagonist clearly wasn't thinking right when he did it.

      I wonder what the long term result of this situation will be for Nathan. Lilly was right to point out that he's got some great potential as a leader. He really needs to get his head in the right place, though.

        I definitely felt that him comforting Emma was just a play to wrap her even further around his finger. Unless he was just posturing to make Angelo think better of him (which is unlikely given his other behavior), it's pretty clear that he thinks of the female players as sex objects and nothing more.

        I think he's your run-of-the-mill misogynist. He might be an upstanding guy in other areas, but his treatment of women is abhorrent.

          Illiya's attraction to him looks pretty damning in light of her previous boyfriend's torture habit.

          Harisson is the jock archetype - the "Chad" guy that everyone knows that has girls fawning over him no matter how bad he treats them.

  Why would two outhouses even get some of the vote? Your life is on the line and people want it for the privacy?
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    Whatever benefit they get from the building will likely be pretty secondary to the first-in-zone reward. A vendor costs 200 NPs, or 125 NPs more than an outhouse. That's nearly 10 NPs per player, and NP distribution isn't exactly even. Once a vendor exists, players will be using NPs as currency, meaning they have to spend additional NPs to gain any real benefit aside from seeing lists of gear and maybe being able to sell items.

    Also, players with more NPs would carry the burden of purchasing a vendor disproportionately.

    * If they're close to the amount of NPs they'd need to upgrade a skill, the outhouse gets them the first in zone settlement reward and leaves them closer to purchasing their next skill upgrade.

    * Alternately, players with low NP totals such as Johanna could feel guilty about making others carry them.

    Keep in mind as well that the NP total isn't currently high enough to get any other building along with a vendor. The group can just barely afford a second medical tent and the outhouse (which is actually what I think they should do). Since the reward is time-sensitive, there's a big reason to get something immediately affordable rather than something with better innate long-term utility.

    The coming encounter could well turn all of this on its ear.

    * Players may learn something during the battle. (Admittedly, this is not likely.)

    * NP awards could get them to the threshold where a vendor and outhouse are both affordable (multiple players harvesting monsters would provide a windfall of NPs).

    * Player casualties (including unconsciousness) could net reduce available NPs.
