      An animal with a garden on its back is a recuring theme in Junipers work. It's clearly a trope that he loves. His magical toad son must have inherited it in some bullshit locus way.

      - u/ZurrgabDaVinci758:

        Also the garden on the back allows for its domain to move, in a similar way to the mother locus in the bottle. *edit* possibly indicating that this is a change to the nature of the future Locuses? Not being bound to a particular place would be a big change, which is kinda their thing.

Apologies for the different posting schedule than usual, but when better to try new things than 1.5 million words into a story?

    I legitimately adore this new posting schedule.

    Something I've been thinking about for a while, but it's often *really* hard to process and discuss 35-70k words batches, and it kind of loses some of the strengths of web-serials. Makes me feel like I have to binge an entire day of reading just to keep up.

    The way this batch was split up was much more satisfying, and allowed for breaks to theorize about and discuss each section properly. Love that!
    ```

    - u/ZurrgabDaVinci758:
      ```
      Yeah I felt like with a lot of chapter batches a bunch of really interesting stuff would happen in the first few which was then ignored in the discussion in favor of whatever happened in the final one. But I suppose this trades off against the benefit of being able to have mini arcs resolve in each bunch

  I really like that there's immediately a little bit of friction between Fenn and Juniper and that we see some of her worst traits right away. It gets back to what she said in her letter after she died, about not idolizing the dead, and it makes her feel like a more whole and complete person beyond just "comic relief" and "Juniper's love interest."

  Also, the idea of Amaryllis being on every TV show (including Aerb's version of Law & Order) is hilarious. It makes sense, it gives her an unparalleled level of control and influence over the public's views on any number of topics, but the idea of channel-surfing and seeing her face as the one constant feels like something right out of a comedy.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I kind of have to wonder how the public deals with it.

    I mean, imagine being in the timeline where your country's ruler is a reality-show actor... okay, yes, but imagine they're doing the acting as a side gig while they're still busy being the unofficial emperor of the planet.

    In the morning, you get your newspaper article about Amaryllis Smith's emergency border control procedures, and about how she's mounting an expedition to the hells to prepare for the upcoming War For Salvation...

    And in the evening you get reruns of Games of Gold where you get to watch the will-they-won't-they tension between her and the handsome lead as her character desperately tries to convince him to give up on gold magic before he does something he can't go back from, while he's preparing his one last heist.

    Aerb politics gonna be *wild*.
    ```

    - u/Don_Alverzo:
      ```
      This is Aerb, so they're probably more used to wild shit like that.

      Actually, now that I think about, the strongest precedent for her situation (i.e. one person achieving total political and cultural dominance) is probably Uther. I wouldn't be surprised if she's faced a lot of comparisons to him, especially considering her heritage. It would be sort of ironic if people started speculating that she's Uther reborn.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        Oh, there's no need to speculate, we *know* she was considered Uther reborn in a library timeline ("the Returned Queen", to be specific). Though being married with the other contender for the title probably muddies the waters a bit.

        But yeah, good point re: the precedent. That's probably the main reason she stars in so many shows, actually, to draw the parallel in people's minds.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          It's also stated in an earlier chapter that being famous was one thing that helped Uther breach into p-space:

          > “We did hundreds of impossible things,” replied Raven. “Though technically, we didn’t go to p-space, our conceptual selves went there instead. P-space interactions are common, but usually trivial, nothing more than a query about whether or not some object belongs to a certain class, or whether an object is actually an object. To get into p-space, we had to go to the extremes, those entads that allowed for definitional changes, or the creation of new definitions. It was complicated enough that only Uther really understood it. To hear him tell it, it was helpful that we were as famous as we were, because that meant that there was some foundational concept of us to work with in p-space, though that wasn’t typically how p-space worked. And after a week of preparation, away we went.”
          ```

          - u/foveros:
            ```
            I just realized something. The concept of zombie exists in Aerb. Therefore, there is an conceptual entity representing it. Therefore in Aerb there is at least one confirmed... p-zombie.

            ...This entire, millions of words long story was just an excuse for puns, wasn't it?

    I'm pretty sure that happened in the 2005 Bewitched film. The main character's love interest was a famous actor. He got scared off when he found out she really was a witch and not just playing one on TV, and then she kept seeing him when channel-surfing.

- u/foveros:
  ```
  Since there are many positive comments, let me give an alternative opinion. I loved the story, but the pacing has been very weird since after the Doris Finch and Captain Blue exclusion zones. Pretty sure an editor would have had some strong advice.

  It has basically been starting to wrap things up, dragon fight, several chapters of wrapping things up, exclusion zones off screen, nice but very short fel seed fight, very short hells "adventure" for something that has been foreshadowed to hell(heh) and back, another chapter of wrapping things up. With Amaryllis mentioning an extremely cool adventure of hers in three sentences, that we'll never get to see.

  It feels to me like a (very extended) version of a fanfic author wrapping everything up in one or two chapters to move on. Doesn't feel like the pacing of a natural end.

  One more criticism of a story I've actually enjoyed. This clicked for me on the last conversation with the DM: Nobody ever had fun in this. There was no wonder in the journey. That's obviously the story the author wanted to tell, but because of this, even the downtime wasn't "restful" to read. The entire adventure was a chore for mostly everyone in the cast. Contrast it with something like Practical Guide to Evil, which still has high stakes, but also some happy people. 

  Still, I understand that this may have been intentional. I'm mostly baffled by the pacing.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Some of this is, yes, stuff that an editor would probably fix, but the way an editor would be likely to fix it would be to hack at the upstream stuff from (literally) a million words ago. If I could make two major changes to the story, which are basically impossible to do without so much editing and rewriting it would take another year or two of my life, they would be:

    1. Less magics available to Juniper, maybe a hard cap of ... five or so. This would unfortunately preclude some stuff that I liked, including a few chapters of magical exploration, but it would cut things down to a more manageable size.
    2. More time/outside pressure to force a reason not to go on a ton of side quests.

    But a large part of the problem, which started *way* upstream of all this, is one of the core conceits of the work, which is that there's a honking big world with a vast number of magics and species and adventures to go on, a world that might not be infinite, but could be twenty seasons of a TV show. I wanted it to feel like it was dozens of D&D campaigns mashed together, or fifty splat books, or a hundred mods added onto a videogame, and while I think it largely succeeds in that feeling, it creates some problems, namely that a lot of the stuff Juniper does is stuff that Juniper would necessarily do given the facts as presented in the story. The choice then is:

    1. Skip over them, and hope the audience doesn't notice.
    2. Do them entirely off-screen.
    3. Do them on-screen, in brief.
    4. Retroactively edit them out.
    5. Do them in full, even if it screws with the pacing and you don't really have anything to "say".

    WtC does a combination of these, largely with the exception of the first one, which I think is particularly bad. The best way to handle them, in my opinion, is the retroactive edit, but in a work of serial fiction, especially one of this length, that's not really that feasible (and I don't really think that I've ever seen it done, not at the scale it would need to be done here).

    A lot of the pacing that feels like the overpowered party is going through a checklist of things they can easily do for some reward before they do what they think is the final quest is ... because that's what they're doing, in-universe. I unfortunately don't think that's really enough to justify it, though I *have* been mostly enjoying it on a scene-by-scene level ... mostly.

    (I also don't love the idea of time pressure forcing a premature end, because in my mind, part of the metanarrative is there as a counterpoint or complement to one of the central themes of suicide. They want to get to the end of it all because the thought of this going on forever is intolerable in various ways. Having the ending forced on them through outside forces is counter to that in a way that I really don't like. Even now, with the events of this chapter, at least the decision is largely as a result of one character's actions, which thematically fits better. Not that it's a *clean* theme, but I do like my messy themes.)

    **tl:dr; Mostly agree, and it's been a reason writing was slower for a bit, and I'd do it differently in the future, but I'm still more-or-less happy with the work given some of the unfortunate constraints I placed it under and some of the hard-to-execute things I've been dumb enough to try executing.**

    (This is more than I usually say about writing, hopefully it's not too much. Once WtC is done, I'll have a post mortem that goes more in-depth about what I thought worked and what I felt didn't, and why.)

      If you ever feel like talking shop here or in the eventual retrospective, there are a few editorial bits I would love to hear your thoughts on. In no particular order:

      1) Something that always stood out to me was how *awful* Juniper's adventure would be as an actual tabletop campaign. For all the early talk with the DM about Juniper acting like he'd want his players to act, there's a lot of mechanical and DM stuff that would be very aggravating or borderline toxic in the real world. I was expecting it was an intentional touch that was going to be brought up later on, but as far as I can recall it never was. Was this at all intentional, or just an unfortunate side effect of having to make the actual story engaging?

      2) Tying into the game structure and the weird power curve they followed, I always thought that soul magic would be a prime candidate for an editor to brutally execute, since with 20/20 hindsight it becomes apparent how heavily they relied on it to game the system. Are you ultimately happy with its inclusion, or would you have stripped it out entirely if the story weren't far too large to comprehensively edit?

      3) It felt like a lot of the late story's reliance on soul magic and loophole abuse stemmed from the weird, suboptimal build that Juniper committed to long before he understood the system. Was that an intentional writing decision? Did it work like you wanted it to?

      4) Probably best held for the retrospective, but I would be really curious to know which parts of the story you like and feel were really well-executed, and which if any you'd wave a magic wand and revise if you could.

        Writing like you do is nigh impossible. I've broached the subject of serialization with seasoned authors, and the only response I've gotten is a resounding "that sounds like literal hell". It's an extremely easy formula to read. Not so much to write. The fact that WtC is as good as it is just showcases your writing skills.
        ```

    - u/None:

      serialization is an order of magnitude harder than single release. always impressed when people pull it off

      and just to chime in with my usual "i would pay $200+ for a published set of wtc volumes, post-edit"
      ```

    - u/Seraphaestus:
      ```
      I'm glad that WtC is the way it is. I'm happy to accept a bit of awkward pacing and a couple wrapping-ups which fall short of completely satisfactory if the alternative would be losing some of the scope and magic (both literally and metaphorically) of Aerb

      I actually think this worked really well in Chapter 221 (Targets Of Opportunity). But I think it'd work better if burning down the checklist took up an entire arc, with the more interpersonal developments filling in the gaps. Instead the recent arcs feel more like they're composed of mini-arcs glued together, with the focus and pacing suddenly shifting to accommodate. Interleaving these pieces more, and papering over the places this could be jarring by inserting the checklist quests into scene changes, could smooth things without a full story edit.

      (And while I'm a huge fan of structural editing, I don't think a traditional full-book edit makes sense for a work that's already 15 times longer than the average paperback. Reworking things more than 20 or so chapters apart would take an entire editing team, not just an editor.)
      ```

    - u/foveros:
      ```
      Ironically, both of these two issues you mention are a common problem when DMing. Namely, giving the players too much options and power, and more importantly, managing to balance the main hook between "you have no urgency at all to proceed to with the plot and can meander for months of real time" and "you must beeline to this threat and don't have time to explore anything you find interesting".

      Nice hearing your thoughts, even when pulling back the curtain must go against your natural instincts. Since it dawns to me that the only two comments I've made to this work were critical (plus a pun) I'll add that it is a great ride and the idea space has been extremely refreshing. Particularly enjoyed memes, antimemes, Harold, couch potato, unicorn magic, the Outer Reaches, and everything in the infinite library. The list goes on.
      ```

    - u/CrystalShadow:
      ```
      I enjoyed this peak behind the curtain. I think one thing that’s hard to deal with is how in a serial, we might build up ideas of some of these plots in our head only to see them skipped. I think the Doris finch bit was one of the best, but to some degree it begs the question “oh what will glass land be like”

      Less details in the quest prompts that won’t be fulfilled might make that easier to accept.

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    This is why I categorize it as a deconstruction of a power fantasy. It has a lot of the aesthetic trappings of a shonen isekai harem etc etc, but in reality the whole thing is too high stakes, and the characters are too real, for it to really be that for any appreciable amount of time. The few times Joon seems to actually have fun he gets basically scolded for it, like after the fight with Onion.

    As for the pacing, it makes complete sense to me, and is spelled out explicitly in the narrative. The stuff that's getting skipped over just... doesn't matter. We as readers might enjoy reading about it in more detail, but the outcomes are already set and the real stakes are elsewhere. I think it works, personally.
    ```

    - u/ThatEeveeGuy:
      ```
      In particular there was that whole Earth bit with someone's high level rogue character auto-succeeding on stealing some basic object...and perhaps more to the point, the game goes the way the DM wants it to. I imagine at this point he just wants to get to the climax, so that's what's happening. You can see it being nudged that way by how infernal unification slapped on a massive sense of urgency.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    you're right. it would probably stand out quite a bit more to anyone who disagrees with you if they reread the whole thing. 

    but i think it's less a problem of pacing and more that the subplot finales don't really have anything to do with the main plot finale. (and are far less interesting to the reader, because they won't come with answers to the two outstanding mysteries). as the author says in his reply, this was largely unavoidable unless he wanted to elide a bunch of stuff or info-dump it. so instead we got vignettes.

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  I know that the "actual" reason why the Omega Portal back from the hells exists is the need to bring Juniper back and Mary's adventures in p-space, but if anyone's wondering why the demon/devils would have such a device, it's actually infernally obvious: they can get more souls by sending some back to aerb.

  Not even in the exchange itself, I mean just by bargaining with the person they send. "Look, you've seen a lot of what Hell has to offer at this point. You've been here for thousands of years. You've gotten so tired of torture on one level that you've actually killed yourself multiple times in the futile hope that it gets better. It doesn't. It never well."

  "But we can send you back to aerb. All you have to promise to do is kill people and not bottle their souls. The more souls you send, the better we'll treat you when you end up back here. Sure, you might consign yourself to oblivion instead. That's fine. But think about the odds that you might end up back here anyway, and how pissed we'll be if you don't send at least a dozen more souls down. Hell, commit some real mass murder and we'll set you up in a palace!"

  Hell cultists with these sorts of deals are something we haven't seen in the story yet, probably because this portal didn't actually exist until now, but if it did I bet the infernals would have taken great advantage of the ability to send humans back on occasion.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    That seems overly complicated, but there are definitely some ransoming schemes you could do with that gate.

    "Oh, your husband wasn't bottled in time? What a tragedy... And it looks like he's reached the Penis Bees! But you know what, there's a way you can save him. Just kill 10 people, using this contraption, and we'll bring him back!"

    (though in practice the infernals would have trouble establishing trust, especially if the Empire clamps down on anything that could lead to repeat transactions)
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Wouldn't they already be able to make these deals, simply by not torturing certain loved ones in exchange? That's actually something that confused me about the hells. That there were no souls treated decently at all. At least some of them should have been able to provide stuff that's more valuable than their suffering, even if it's just to serve as an example that hell doesn't *have* to be terrible if you are loyal enough to the Infernals in life.

      Example: The right to get one loved one (or yourself) into an isolated little village of unmolested souls who only have to content with the local hell's horrible environment, in exchange for nine thousand unbottled souls, to be delivered in your own pace.
      ```

      - u/alphanumericsprawl:
        ```
        I bet that's looked down upon like... torture is here. Imagine the common demon who'll never spend more than few hours torturing every few years hearing this. It's bad that the elite is hoarding all the mortals but this! Absolutely horrible, it would hurt them on a physiological level. Other states/fiefs would accuse eachother of selfishly refraining from torture. It'd be like Guantanamo Bay.
        ```

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          That's why I specified isolated communities that still have to grapple with the environment on their own. Not some kind of integrated hell hotel where Infernals suffer as human servants.

          Infernals know that there are billions of souls not getting tortured every day. And lately they didn't even end up tortured after death. If the mere fact of souls living a mediocre life is torture to them then they are already in constant suffering if they can't afford a human or live in weird and isolated cults that deny the existence of a beforelife.
          ```

  - u/HarryPotter5777:
    ```
    Speaking of infernal plans to get more souls: why didn't they try to get a rune magic exclusion? 

    From what we've seen of Valencia, it sounds like a devil's persuasion powers would make it quite easy to talk a rune mage into creating some terrible device via a possessed non-anima, and we know from Joon's venture into the runeforge that you can plan out an entire design without actually having magic yourself. 

    It's definitely a serious task, but given that there are literally trillions of infernals, surely someone would try - if you succeed, you'll be given all the accolades the hells can offer and thousands of mortals 24/7.
    ```

    - u/Gr_Cheese:
      ```
      I think but don't fully recall there being a lot of non-anima checks that Valencia had to bypass, which were mostly removed from play due to the soul exclusion and her companion perks.

      Plus any individual non-anima seems to have competition between devils controlling them, they are not exclusively owned. So there's an incentive for any individual devil controller to just maximize suffering in the short term to benefit themselves, rather than follow a plan with a longterm and abstract payoff.

      At least until infernal unification.

      And the rune magic antimatter bomb required a lot of research and resources in fixed and heavily regulated locations (runeforges), so creating a rune magic exclusion would have been a hard target for infernals to manage.

      Increasing the amount of total souls in the hells is valuable to all the hells. The Omega layer is most capable of making such trades, because it has the least loss of souls... Literally 0 other than through the portal.

    **BUG REPORT WTC-#3405933 - progress lock triggered by death**

    **Description:** when you die with the helldiver and diamond ironman harcore settings on, you get a GAME OVER screen. all game features are subsequently disabled.

    i triggered this by going after fel seed and getting killed. the thing is, there are still features that allow me to continue the game. a companion did a quest to get me out of hell, and now i'm back in the main game, but everything is still disabled, the interface won't load, and several progress-critical quests are locked. pls fix.

    **Steps to reproduce:**

    - turn on helldiver
    - turn on diamond ironman hardcore
    - die because of stupid gm bullshit
    - you get a game over screen, the interface is locked off, you go to hell
    - have a companion travel to the outer reach and build a gate out of hell
    - take the gate out of hell
    - you are now alive and theoretically able to complete all the quests, except the interface is still locked. you don't get messages or level ups even if you complete the quests

            There's a famous web novel called "Worm", wherein the protagonist has the superpower of controlling bugs.  She uses them creatively, to devastating effect.  Aerb has referenced other web novels (for example, there's canonically an Exclusion Zone where one person loops back in time), so it's plausible that there's one with a similar premise.

            The idea is that somebody filed a bug report saying "T used bugs to do xyz, too OP, plz nerf".  Then when that was nerf, they filed another bug report saying "T now using bugs to do abc, too OP, plz nerf".  And another.  And another.  Etc.

    Probably because every second they delay means thousands of souls going to the hells. Add to that the difficulty of trying to do a quest without the UI (they wouldn't necessarily know if they completed the quest, if the quest changed, what reward they got, etc.), and whatever marginal benefit they get likely isn't worth the time it would take. Especially considering it's Fel Seed, so one companion quest perk is unlikely to make a real difference.

      If they beat Fel Seed all those souls and many more are saved

    ```
    I think it goes back to something Joon said before to her about the first attempt: at a certain point you're fooling yourself if you think you're going to just attain enough power to beat Fel Seed that way. They aren't going back because they feel stronger. They're going back because of the combination of so many things simultaneously going bad on Aerb at once as well as feeling like it makes sense narratively. They're banking on the narrative giving them a win this time, or at least a chance to actually get through the door this time. Because if they don't have a shot through the narrative helping them, then they don't have a shot at all. Because Fel Seed cheats.

    Also, all this could be moot, because the plan hasn't actually been discussed yet, and it could start with a quick run to finish her quest before heading to Fel Seed

    Yeah.  As I was reading that I was thinking it would have made a great arc to see told from her perspective, a la the Wards arc in Worm.  It happened at the end of the timeskip so it could have gotten us fully up to speed on everything that's changed and then launched into her trip to p-space.  I would have loved to see how she's changed from the vantage point of her own headspace, how she's handled being without Juniper, her own reflections on herself, etc.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      This was *almost* how it was written. Juniper dies, then some certain number of chapters from Amaryllis and maybe the others about how they're coping and what they're thinking, some more "pushing on after the death of a loved one" stuff that would be thematically appropriate, solo or group adventures, socialization between party members of characterizing opportunities with either their own narration of things or their interactions absent Juniper (or both) ... I think I *probably* could have made it work, but it risked going against what I'd been building towards, and it would have taken a lot of words.

          Yeah, but I think you'd have to change some things around in order to make it work properly, since there's not really a point in having Juniper wondering about what's going on when the audience already knows. That might just be a matter of how it's framed/narrated though.

          It would be a much longer route to the same point though, and much more focused on the experiences of others, I think. Like, a "Raven returns to the Library" chapter, a "Grak single-handedly clears an exclusion" chapter, "Valencia decides to bring children into a world like Aerb against the advice of Amaryllis", things like that.

          (Anyone reading this should feel free to write some fanfic, if so compelled.)

  Eleven days ago when Hell Arc started I was crossing my fingers and hoping we'd get more focus on Valencia.  Valencia and Bethel are my two favorite characters, and with Bethel undergoing major development that largely wraps up her character off-screen I was really hoping we'd get to see more of Valencia.  So having her mostly removed from the story here is a bit... oof.  I'm stoked with the life she's managed to get for herself, but I wish the "camera" had been there to see it.

  - u/sibswagl:

    I don't want to put words in Wales' mouth, but it does sort of feel like he realized Bethel and/or Valencia were too powerful and removed them from the story. Valencia even says she could've soloed the Angelcyn arc, and Bethel could've beaten the dragons eazy-peazy.
    ```

  - u/Adraius:
    ```
    u/axiomsofdominion mentioned a character with similarities to Valencia - for anyone else who enjoying reading Val, let me share another character who reminds me greatly of her and whom I also greatly enjoy: Dahlia, from the Warhammer 40k quest [Suffer Not](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/suffer-not-%E2%89%A1-%E2%89%A1-40k-inquisition-quest.58591/), which is an outstanding story in its own right.

    Valencia's arc is extremely reminiscent of Tenar from Earthsea. Especially if you count Tehanu. I prefer to pretend the story stops at the first 3 myself. Granted /u/alexanderwales might not have intended the parallel but from my perspective I expected most of her arc, disliking it mildly the whole time, and it really is a strong correlation. As soon as Joon decided not to actively pursue a key for 7 locks it was clear Valencia would always remain a side character/deus ex machina. Basically as soon as the first mention of her and Jorge.

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        Abstractly?  Sure, that's possible.

        But Joon is talking about doing a real-like RPG ethically, and most definitions of ethical consent include the ability to withdraw that consent after it's given.  And most of the exceptions to that are dependant on the subject losing some of their mental capability between granting consent and an attempt to withdraw it.

        I don't think that a Joon who wants to be an ethical god would have done what the DM did to Arthur.
        ```

        - u/xXnormanborlaugXx:
          ```
          I don't think that the DM is Juniper, if only because it's too straightforward. I just wanted to point out the possible exception. It's not really decisive either way.  


          Weird ethical situations are not uncommon in WtC. If dm-layer Arthur had good reasons that Aerb Arthur would not have been allowed to remember, it wouldn't be super surprising to ban withdrawing consent.
          ```

          - u/Nimelennar:
            ```
            I still think that's unethical.  I don't think that future me should be forced to act as past-me decides he should act.  Go far enough into the past, and past-me was extremely religious; I know he would disapprove of some of who I am now, and I frankly don't give a fuck.  I have a pretty good idea about who I want to be in the future, but I don't expect future me to care about any of that.  Part of being human is the freedom to change your mind.  There are consequences, of course, but I am under no obligation to become the me that any previous version of me wanted me to be.

            Your motivations are, along with your habits, right at the deepest essence of who you are.  If Arthur consented and then the reason for giving that consent is taken away, that core motivation removed, is it really the same person giving the consent anymore?

            I think that there's a fairly strong argument (depending, of course, on **what** is removed) that it wouldn't be the same person anymore, and therefore that the consent shouldn't be considered binding.

            Don't get me wrong; I don't think that present-me should never be accountable for the actions and promises of past me, or that future-me should not be responsible for present-me's actions and promises.  There are consequences for breaking your promises.  But anyone who says that someone should never, ever break a promise should ponder that keeping promises have consequences too, and those consequences are not absolved by the promise.  And if the person I am now wouldn't have made that promise, knowing what I now know, then it's a choice of which consequences I can live with.

    >It turned out to be a story of revenge. The guy in the apartment at the start, the one who’d got shot

    They were *both* shot? Were four shots fired? But even having formed that hypothesis I am confused.

  I'm a bit disappointed. I thought Mary was going for a social solution to the Doris problem. Something like, having rules against spontaneous cloning on pain of death, permanent surveillance and enforcement through Blood God Doris, using sedatives to allow them to farm-duplicate without feeling like their life is in danger, etc.

  Having a "no more resource scarcity" ward feels like kind of a copout, even if it's plausible given the powers at the characters' disposal. I wish they'd had to solve it using the same means Doris had at her disposal, by coordinating better.

  > She nodded. “Two of them were,” she let out a breath. “Lovers. It was utter narcissism.” She blushed slightly at the memory, then paled. The muscle in her cheek went taut. “I didn’t manage to convince them. They didn’t think that I would have the same love for myself as they had for each other. They argued that they could be just as effective without merging. I just merged them anyway.”

  *Now* you're Doris Finch.

  Seriously though. Mary, what the fuck?

  That's not a yes.

  It feels like, of the companions, Mary is easily the one who suffered most from the timeskip.

  She feels closer to snapping than she ever has so far in the story.
  ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    I don't think know what Mary's snapping would look like, but she's become a literally insane narcissist outside of Juniper. Now that he's no longer a goal and has no interface that's very scary. It seems like this might be a mirror to the Fenn/Juniper we see, he worked through not putting her on a pedestal, kind of gave up on her, and is dealing with the time frame changes now. Mary/Juniper probably has much more issues without support, has a massive time frame difference of 3 yearsXclonesXdilation, and we've seen that Mary was able to be intensely focused in the library futures when less alone.

    When in moderately different short term circumstances two of HERSELF started literally loving herself enough to wage clone war against herself. That's a huge red flag, but then it's worse: "I just *merged* them anyway" meaning those experiences that pushed her over the edge didn't get lost, they got added into Mary!

    She's saying and showing throughout the chapter that she's essentially holding up the weight of the world including: shaping it, organizing it, ruling it, protecting it, and completely isolated. She doesn't seek comfort in others, doesn't make friends, and doesn't trust anyone even enough to be the main actor in her shows. She took more mantle's than useful in p-space, and produced huge amounts of suffering in part due to wanting to create beauty.

    I mean, while I sort of agree, the issue is that the problems in the DFZ were more than just "the Dorises are shitty to each other." The Dorises were shitty to each other in large part because of the extreme resource scarcity, which they could only overcome by murder-cloning. Without murder-cloning, they wouldn't even have the clothes on their backs, and cloning without murdering doesn't fix the problem, because it creates more mouths to feed to match the resources it supplies. They can't trade with the outside world to overcome this either, because they're under brutal sanctions in addition to having very little to offer in trade.

    The DFZ had severe social problems, but those problems were largely a result of the material conditions. You need to change the material conditions to actual fix things, and doing that in a purely mundane way (i.e. building infrastructure that can sustain the population without murder-cloning) would take decades.

      Yeah, Amaryllis loves to shit-talk the Dorises, but I think a lot of people would eventually crumble in a similar situation. Mary is pretty unique in how single-minded and dedicated to a cause she can be.

      Other people might not crumble as fast, or might not be as bad (less prone to back-stabbing, at least when dealing with outsiders; less slavery; etc.), but it really is something a natural consequence of the particulars of the magic. 

      They talk a bit about how a functioning person would need to have people do each role, but like, I would hate to be the clone assigned to be a doctor or firefighter or plumber. I definitely relate to those clone stories, where the clone is like "well, why do *I* have to be the one to go to school?"

    Resource scarcity was largely not the limiting factor, and in fact, Dorises are already shown being able to do something very similar, just more messy:

    > There was only a little bit of looting before we got going. One of the ways that Doris’s power was busted was that it cloned over her equipment too, but the big drawback was that the clone’s gear would disappear after twenty-four hours. The loophole was that if a clone with an hour left on the clock for their equipment made a clone, that new clone would have their clock reset. The answer then, at least some of the time, was to just make a clone, kill it, and take its stuff, keeping both sets of equipment until the timer was up, when you would find out which one had the longer timer. The clone would naturally resist that, but the Dorises had methods of clone production that would put the clone in a position to be easily murdered. Most of the equipment that was laying on the ground, if looted, would simply disappear by the next day.

    and later

    > We saw other Dorises as well, though usually only briefly, or peeking out through windows. My crown let me see through the eyes of those holed up in their ugly buildings, and I regretted looking, because I saw a Doris going about the process of butchering her clone, and another in the middle of eating raw chunks of flesh. It was no secret that this was how the Dorises kept themselves fed, but it was still disturbing to see. A few of those rooms had tiny closet-like structures, the entrances so small that you couldn’t get out. Those, I knew, were used for clone killing.

    That is to say "make a clone such that you can easily kill it and take its stuff" was the default already (though available only to those who could secure a regular murder hole), and adding in "actually, you don't need to make the clone, just make the stuff" reduces the inherent violence/murder, and some of the friction, but it's relying on a process of eliminating resource scarcity that's already present.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Huh. That's a good point.

      So the "cruelty-free cloning" stations would be important not because they'd provide new resources, but because they'd represent an easier way to access resources that isn't hoarded away or require violence, and would therefore facilitate trust between Dorises.

      On the other hand, the chapter as written says "a few factors involved in that, but the biggest thing that had happened was that resource scarcity had been virtually eliminated". That's a little odd if the takeaway is supposed to be that resource scarcity wasn't the limiting factor.

      I don't know, I kind of figured a solution to the DFEZ (beyond what was already shown) would focus on the progressive increase in trust, and the social structures Mary and BGD would put in place. But I get that you were trying to get it covered in one paragraph and you probably want to move on with the story.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Yeah, this is probably down to how it was worded. And the evolution of the DFEZ over the course of three years could have been its own book, but one of the things that I like about timeskips is that you can just do things in brief in a way that helps fire the imagination.

        Edit: A better way of saying it, or maybe thinking about it, is that when people aren't desperate for food, clothing, shelter, and safety, they do a lot better when asked to have faith in each other. Grak's wards *help* with that, in that they lower duplication costs/friction, as does flooding in entads, but a lot of it is indeed coordination problems, many of which stem from the attitude that Dorises hold toward other Dorises. (The entad thing had been tried before but largely failed, due to Dorises hoarding useful entads, using them to hold power over each other, etc.)
        ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    What you describe as social solutions involves no less a degree of magical/technological copouts than an elimination of resource scarcity, and honestly given our actual reality I'm a little tired of "solve the problem by going full fascist on it" so solving it by eliminating resource scarcity sounds GREAT.

    I thought it was fine to have the Doris exclusion zone largely solved through solving the scarcity problem - it's showing how much people's actions/personality can be a product of their environment. 

    I also don't think Mary is gonna snap. Mary often seems like this robot that is always working and rationally evaluating all her choices - and I think these scenes exist sometimes just to try and keep her human.

    I was about to be disappointed for the same reasons because I was interested in seeing what the social solution would have been, but I think removing resource scarcity makes a lot of sense as a solution to Doris' problems the same way that it helps with coordination problems with other players in other scenarios. There's something satisfying there, like being reminded that sometimes social problems can have technical solutions. It feels somehow optimistic and defeatist in equal measure.

  - u/ArgusTheCat:

    Everyone else is replying about the resource scarcity thing and I just wanna chime in that what Mary did to her clones is super fucked up.  At that point, they’re basically individuals, and she murdered them.  Or worse?  It’s very not okay. 

    It also reminds me of the book House of Suns, what with the whole “we are separated clones of someone who have fallen in love” thing.

  So, any theories on what advantage they actually gained in those three years against Fel Seed and/or opening The Door? I can't really see anything relevant that's different this time except Mary being ~~literally~~  ~~figuratively~~ conceptually The Assassin Princess plus the moment of surprise thanks to worldline teleportation.

  Are they just barging in again with the same Fel Seed Plan, expecting different results, hoping DM would just let them through?
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    That's a very good question. The initial plan was already extremely questionable, it feels like they're going at this under-prepared.

    On the other hand, they've had a look at the door now. If they can figure out the password ahead of time, they only need to survive Fel Seed for 20 seconds instead of having to solve a riddle while being butchered.

    (on a similar note, it's very unclear how going past the door and finding Uther will help them solve the threats facing Aerb; they assume that the end of the game will somehow give Joon god-like power, but it's not like Arthur/Uther will go "Hi Juniper! Here's an entad that makes you omnipotent that I've been sitting on for centuries for no reason!"; at least, there's a chance that bringing back Uther would help them fight the other threats, but there's no guarantee it'll be an automatic win aside from story logic)
    ```

    - u/Norseman2:
      ```
      Their best bet of defeating Fel Seed is probably going to p-space and creating weaknesses for it. Once they've defeated Fel Seed (and Jun has a quest for it, so it shouldn't be impossible), getting past the door should become much easier.

      Taking the stairs back to Earth might allow Jun to become the DM, allowing him to remake Aerb to be less shitty for the people living in it.

  Interesting to hear the stories of each of the different characters with Juniper away. Kind of reminds me of things like the epilogue slides in Fallout New Vegas or other rpgs, where you get to see how things turned out for people in the wider world.

  Solcace was notably absent, but I guess she's fulfilled her role to some degree, and the focus shifted to the locus. (Interesting that the DM nixed the DMPC idea). I feel kinda bad for her, she got what she wanted, with the locus being freed, but it then proceeded to reject her, keeping her sick and thinking of her as a jailer. Then its final resolution came from Juniper without her involvement. I guess this maybe shows the negative side of the Locus's nature, the inherent unpredictability and resistance to patterns means that it also won't express gratitude or consistent affection. Would be interesting to see how she feels about baby!Locus, (Junicus? Frocus?)
