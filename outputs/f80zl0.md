## Can you recommend me some particularly annoying but not completely strawman examples of deathism?

### Post:

I'm working on a story featuring a sect of rabid deathists, people who insist that death is good, death gives life meaning, death makes living sweet, death is the path to God, etc. 

However, it turns I'm not all that familiar with deathism. Can you recommend to me some particularly annoying deathist tracts, the kind that make one want to reach through the page and strangle the author? 

Actually, you know what? Strawman examples are fine. I just want my strawman to spout out things actual deathists have written, rather than things I've made up and attributed to them.

Thanks!

  Trying to channel Thomas Ligotti for a moment...

  > You speak of life extension but, for reasons which have nothing to do with life- or health-span and which you are unlikely to solve, it would be more accurate to speak of *suffering* extension. 

  But no one will be required to extend their lives, so people whose suffering is too great will not take this treatment. 

  > You assume that most people are capable of letting themselves die when the option to live longer is available to them, but the animal instinct to survive is very strong. 

  > Consider the grotesque pains which people go through in the course of cancer treatments for the sake of stretching out a few months or a slim chance of remission, in those cases where their particular brand of cancer is almost certainly going to kill them anyway. Rather than having a more peaceful time, they undergo the wretchedness of chemotherapy and other treatments, with the upshot that they will probably still not live much longer but now will do so in much greater discomfort. 

  > There is also, of course, the *cost* of life extension, which may put many an oldster in great debt, with all the attendant negativities of that condition. 

  But is life really so terrible? If death were preferable to life, then why don't haven't we killed ourselves already? 

  > Natural selection, of course. Anyone who was able to make a rational judgment of their circumstances, conclude that life too horrible to bear, and then commit suicide, would summarily remove themselves from the gene pool. As a rationalist, you are well aware of the cognitive contortions which our brains can perform, so you shouldn't be too shocked to find that there's one more to add to the list. We are necessarily descended only from those apes who, for one reason or another, failed to commit suicide at least long enough to breed. And yes, things are [really that terrible](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/24/how-bad-are-things/) for many people.

  Ligotti never addresses life extension in particular, but you can check out my notes on his nonfiction work [here](https://saltphil.wordpress.com/2017/05/14/the-conspiracy-against-the-human-race-by-thomas-ligotti/) if the above was useful.

    Well, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the USA, where it is illegal. Plus lots of people are depressed, using drugs and alcohol to be happier. 

    Evolution didn't necessarily select for happiness.
    ```

    - u/elysian_field_day:
      ```
      In addition, evolution only selects against suicide \*until\* reproduction. There is a weak extension to that due to human offspring's high maintenance, but as far as natural selection goes, that only applies to people up to their 40s or so. And yet, there is no sudden spike in suicides at that age that I know of, so there ought to be more to it.
      ```

      - u/Roneitis:
        ```
        Well, no, because you can still help your genes after reproductive age. Similarly, prior to consciousness of the level were suicide becomes a thing, you can still help your genes when you're unhappy.
        ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        During our years of evolution (we still evolve but technology changes our lives much faster than natural selection) there was no cut-off point where an elder killing themselves of their own free will regardless of environment makes sense. That said, I have anecdotally seen a much larger rate of acceptance of their own death without much (overt) care among old people.
        ```

        - u/elysian_field_day:
          ```
          literally nothing but "reproduce" makes sense regardless of environment, in an evolutionary context. But that is not quite my point, there is after all no \*sense\* when it comes to evolution, merely mutation and selection. The point is, any hypothetical mutation that triggers a sudden drive for suicide \*after\* reproductive age would not be selected against, because the reproduction has already happened. 

          You are of course right that there is a selection process on a tribal level that would probably favour people not to suddenly killing themselves at age 40, but thats a tricky thing - there are certainly environments where anyone past their physical prime was selected against. Cultures that preferred early (usually violent) death to senescence, for example. 

          What I am trying to say is that I believe when it comes to aging and deathism, evolution is a difficult basis for argument.

      Suicide is illegal as a legal hack to let police interrupt attempts. Attempting suicide is not criminalized, the "punishment" is being IDd and probably sent to an institution for a bit while they figure out what went wrong.

    OP may have in mind more traditional "deathists" of the "death is good because it's natural/traditional/useful to society/gives life meaning for people to die of old age" rather than "death is good because life is bad"(which I'm personally much more sympathetic to, but that style of deathist would probably be less inclined to *force* people to die).

    This is a very strange take indeed. "Well, you can't be immortal with an opt-out option, because then you would never really want to opt-out, even though it would definitely be the best option for you, because reasons".

    People who simply claim that their whatever philosophical or political theory allows them to determine what you yourself need and want better than you, and thus that external forces should push you along that road for your own good, allow me to no end. It's such a broken, self-justifying reasoning.

  >We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky  ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to  be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but  who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of  Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats,  scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of  possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of  actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in  our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the lottery  of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to  that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?

  \-- Richard Dawkins on coping with death by shaming yourself for being upset about it
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    That's another really broken argument. It also leads to the so-called Repugnant Conclusion - that one has a moral duty to procreate as much as possible in order to bring as many of those "unborn ghosts" in the world as can be, regardless of what this means for the happiness of those alive, because *being alive at all* is happiness enough and we should share it. It's basically the position of those extremist Christians who will use no birth control and have like 15 children. So it's a very funny thing to read *Richard Dawkins* basically giving arguments to support it.

    Subjects that don't exist are not subjects, and thus, moral reasoning does not apply to them. That gives rise to a much more consistent philosophy. Infinite quantities always break everything.

- u/vanillafog:
  ```
  Does belief in an afterlife count? In this belief system, "death" isn't the end of existence, it's just a transition from one stage of life to another. Everyone is already immortal. Here's a C.S. Lewis quote on the immortality of all human beings:

  >You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    But since the next life is eternal and you can never go back, why not postpone that transition a bit? Till, say, the heat death of the universe for instance?
    ```

    - u/vanillafog:
      ```
      As far as I know, there isn't a commonly espoused reason not to postpone it. In fact, your point is the standard answer to the question, "If the afterlife is so great, why not die and go there right now?" Though none of the authors I've read have considered postponing until the heat death of the universe to be a possibility.
      ```

  Giving back to family could be a decent argument. Ex: "I've had a good life. I don't want to keep using resources, preventing my children and my children's children from experiencing their full potential."

  The particular resources depends on your setting. Around the present day, money probably works pretty well. ("Is spending $80K on cryonics better than leaving it to my grandchildren to pay off their loans?") In the far future, we can likely only access some finite amount of the total computational capacity of the universe. ("By continuing to use server time to compute myself, I'm literally preventing my potential descendents from existing.")

  You could also generalize from "my descendents" to "any future people", but I think the family angle would seem more persuasive at first glance, especially for a story.

  Marcus Aurelius' Meditations has some, I recall.
  ```

  - u/DavidGretzschel:
    ```
    You're maybe referring to the end of Book 2?

    I'd say that's more of an "impermanence"-attitude and an admonishment to be concerned with the things you can change at at peace with those you can't. Deathist is celebrating death, this is more about making it endurable. (Marcus Aurelius saw most of his children die, plagues devastated the empire and he spent large parts of his life at war and in sickly condition)

    "Of human life the time is a point, and the substance is in a flux, and the perception dull, and the composition of the whole body subject to putrefaction, and the soul a whirl, and fortune hard to divine, and fame a thing devoid of judgement. And, to say all in a word, everything which belongs to the body is a stream, and what belongs to the soul is a dream and vapour, and life is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn, and after-fame is oblivion. What then is that which is able to conduct a man? One thing and only one, philosophy. But this consists in keeping the daemon within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man's doing or not doing anything; and besides, accepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and, finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else than a dissolution of the elements of which every living being is compounded. But if there is no harm to the elements themselves in each continually changing into another, why should a man have any apprehension about the change and dissolution of all the elements? For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which is according to nature."

  Try this [link](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1081584611) to a recent Ezra Klein podcast. It's an interview with Martin Hägglund, a Yale philosopher, who spends the first 20 minutes talking about how without death, life can have no meaning. I couldn't listen to more than that though.

  Not Ezra's usual fare, but I think exactly what you're looking for.

  Here's a few that would work for a cult that believes it's promoting the greater good by asking people to die when they grow old.

  I write RPGs, not philosophy papers. I don't know if real life people say this.

  Euphoria is the greatest emotion one can feel. If you cannot be surprised by things, everything gradually becomes muted, despairing. You are reaching for meaning where, eventually none can be found.

  Once you have felt all the euphoria you can, then a given expenditure of resources doesn't give you as much enjoyment as it would a youthful person. So you are being selfish by asking to extend your life past the point where you can find significant enjoyment from regular things.

  The other argument is one of societal norms. If the rich are the first to have access to a senescence-prevention treatment, they may conspire to keep it from everyone else, and thereby lord over an unending dynasty as gods amongst men. Because this eventuality is basically guaranteed to happen in the society we live in currently, the development senescence-prevention treatments would be negative to the greater good.

  There's always the standard religious arguments:

  * Life is a necessary trial we endure before we are allowed into the afterlife, which is way better than our mortal lives. Trying to avoid death is really just postponing the start of your true life.
  * Living is inherently suffering, and all pleasure is inherently transitory and superficial. Through death, we can achieve the only true freedom from suffering.
  ```

- u/InfernoVulpix:
  ```
  Social stratification can get way worse if the Supreme Leader/oligarchs/authorities of any kind no longer have a turnover rate.  Once all the rich and powerful are immortal they'll have all the time in the world to grow their powerbase and strangle the opposition in the crib.

  When the old leader dies the new leader may bring new vision and help guide the company/country/organization down better lines.  Or, failing that, the new leader may flounder and give competitors a chance to rise in its place.  Without death, the company founder has enough time to become best friends with the other rich immortals and collude and grab for more and more power.

  With death, any mistake can be undone.  The old man set in his ways can die and the young blood acutely aware of the failings of the old system can push for change.  Without death, our mistakes here and now may spell an eternity of failure.  The old man set in his ways never dies, and only grows more secure in his position, and the young blood can do nothing to stop him.

  And goodness knows we aren't so perfect a society that we don't have any mistakes to entrench.

  This thing is pretty incredible: https://infidels.org/kiosk/article/the-immortals-dilemma-deconstructing-eternal-life-333.html

  In which the author makes an argument against immortality using the concept of infinity.

  >Thus personal immortality poses this dilemma: without the termination option, we will face infinite periods of time when we will wish we could terminate our immortality; with the termination option, we will eventually and inevitably face a period when we will exercise the termination option and thus put the lie to our supposed immortality.

  The author apparently is unaware that infinities can be used to make nonsense of any logical construct, including mathematics and morality. Yes, infinity will include an infinite amount of everything, including an infinite amount of wishing you could die. It will also include an infinite amount of being glad at being alive, even potentially a *bigger* infinity of that, because not all infinities are equal. But the author doesn't feel the need to mention that.

  **Spoilers for the entirety of "The Good Place" below:**

  No one else here has tried to summarize the arc of a popular media plot, so this might be a bit out of scope, but this annoyed me, so here goes.

  "The Good Place" basically spends most if its 4 seasons with the main characters dead, in an afterlife, but trying to get to a better afterlife, a "heaven" analog. When they finally do, a couple episodes from the end of the show, they realize heaven is incredibly boring and unfulfilling, and after a mere couple episodes of soul searching, they declare (to triumphant music) that the solution is basically "double death", annihilating themselves from heaven. This is particularly annoying as the show legitimately and explicitly explores ethics across its duration, and even features cameos from respected philosophers, yet seems to cop out on a nuanced exploration of this, or even to realize the irony in proposing death as a solution to heaven's issues. (Also, there is this weird subplot in the show that heaven is managed by incompetent bureaucrats; so when the main characters get frustrated by heaven, it seems like the management problems should be addressed first, before leaping immediately to 2nd death as the answer.)

  The show basically argues that, for people culturally used to \~80 year lifespans, we would run out of things to do if we had, say 800 years. Our culture and our brains have equilibrated to 80 year lifespans, and one would expect a different cultural equilibrium would need to develop to accommodate 800 year lifespans, and our brains clearly also aren't literally prepared for 800 years of cognition. But the show, as opposed to admitting that 800 years is better than 80 and that the consequences of the next order of magnitude, up to 8000, are hard to predict right now, instead just says "jumping straight from 80 years to infinity years is truly terrifying and unworkable, and after a few hundred years people would probably be begging for 2nd death".

  Not my opinion, but here it goes. 

  There is no such thing as unlimited resources. Even if we were to all upload our minds into computers, that fact would still not change, as every human would require bandwidth to survive. Even if it isn't going to be a problem for a very, very long time, it will eventually. By choosing to be immortal, a person will in some way leave the next generation just a little bit bereft. Stunting their progress and taking away from everything they might be able to achieve.

  Either every immortal person agrees to not reproduce what so ever, or they can agree to trade their lives for their offspring. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

  I'd like to offer my own argument in favor of death. First, let's imagine a scenario in which a 100% guaranteed method of sustaining life, health, and body function was discovered by Leonardo da Vinci in 1,500 A.D. The method is moderately expensive, requiring some rare elements, so initially it might not have been something everyone had access to, but it would now be within our means as a civilization to provide immortality to everyone, if our civilization were like it is now. There's the first obvious problem though - civilization would be *very* different if we had discovered immortality in 1,500.

  Imagine what the world would be like if late 15th century and early 16th century monarchs had never died. First [Ludovico Sforza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Sforza) takes the technology from da Vinci (if he doesn't give up) and becomes immortal, then [Ferdinand II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon) of Aragon captures the technology from Ludovico, then [Louis XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XII_of_France#Governance) declares war on Aragon and demands the secret to immortality. By this time, Henry VIII has caught wind of what's going on and he sends the English navy with a mini-crusade's worth of soldiers to recover the secret of immortality from France/Aragon/Milan. Pretty quickly, the secret is out and people like [Ivan the Terrible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible) are becoming immortal. With the ruling class quickly becoming undying, the world becomes locked into a 15th-century level of society. Monarchy will never go away, and attempts at democracy will be crushed by the strongest reigning monarchs. It's hard for the feudal system to ever fail when its most capable and most ruthless rulers can live forever. Women will remain property, children will be exploited for manual labor by their parents, public education will never take off, and the industrial revolution will be stymied as feudal lords see upstart capitalists as a threat to their eternal rule. By 2020 A.D., maybe the Americas have been colonized, but Henry VIII will still be in charge and anyone who says otherwise is risking death. Now imagine us in 2020. If you develop immortality today, the present is what the future will be. Forever onward, we will barely progress as a society because the ruling class today will be the ruling class eternal, and anything that threatens their rule will not be tolerated. Immortality means the end of progress.

  As if that's not bad enough, now you have a population crisis too. If no one ever dies, but people keep having children, we will need to destroy the worlds' forests and rainforest even faster than we already are to make room for homes and farmland. Fairly quickly, even that won't do it anymore. We'll run out of room for humanity, and fail to progress as a society in ways that would be needed to survive beyond Earth. Soon, we're back to death being a thing, it's just being deliver by hand instead of by nature. Let the ruling class decide who lives and who dies, what could go wrong? Not only does the discovery of immortality fail to prevent death, but it makes a society where death is still treated with as much callousness as it was in the 1500s.

  In the end, is it really so bad if old people just die eventually from natural causes?
