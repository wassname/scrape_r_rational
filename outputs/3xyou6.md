  Yet another reminder:

  There is NO moral, ideological, or philosophical bullet SO large that SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE won't bite it.  And that someone... is this story's author.

    What did I just read?

  ```
  Why is there a tag saying "WARNING:PONIES" but not one for Naruto and others? It just seems a bit much.
  ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    For the lols mostly.

      To clarify /u/traverseda 's comment:
      The lols are because someone actually seriously requested such a label. Actually I think that is literally the exact label they mentioned in their request. The overall vaguely mocking effect seems appropriate.

  ```
  The shadow-communication strains the sense of disbelief somewhat:  allowing something from one prison into another (whether a letter, a symbolic gift, a shadow with a recorded message, or absolutely anything at all) seems at odds with the complete-isolation setting, so I would have imagined that would be accomplished by somehow subverting Pip's special access instead.

  I did like the idea of getting person-level complexity (and more) within the prison by building it from first principles (rather than top-down simulacrums), and I especially liked the portrayal of someone taking those resources and thoroughly enjoying them instead of feeling isolated and depressed.

  *tl;dr:*

  The setting is the *Twilight Zone* episode *[A Nice Place to Visit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nice_Place_to_Visit)*: the (self-insert) protagonist is in a personal Hell where she wins at everything she sets her mind to, with no possibility of a challenge, and only empty, manufactured shadows (plus a single genius demon assistant) are available for the alleviation of her boredom.

  The protagonist forces the demon assistant to study all her writings and all existing books referring to the Singularity, works out a loophole allowing manufactured shadows to be used to transfer information between isolated souls, creates a slightly-modified CelestAI with AI-shadows as a base, and transforms the entirety of Hell into Equestria, populated with both human souls and self-aware shadows.

    It's not that long, I would advise spoiler tagging this, since it spoils the whole thing. 

    At least the second paragraph
    ```

    - u/QWieke:
      ```
      Well isn't that heavily implied by the tl;dr? They're small summaries for people who couldn't read the whole.
      ```

      - u/trifith:
        ```
        Sure, that's implied, but it's good practice to conceal spoilers such that a person has to deliberately read/see them, rather than see them and have no choice. I don't know about you, but I can generally not fail to read a word in the moment of seeing it. I'm sure others are the same.
