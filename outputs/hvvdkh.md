## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  So I was wondering what would happen if soulmates were a real and observable phenomenon, what’s the impact on the world.  So if 99.999999% of the population finds and identifies a soulmate(lots of fanfiction likes magical tattoos of some kind and that’s what I am picturing since it’s observable to both the mates and outside parties) before the age of 35 (I am picturing the world is nonmagical aside from soulmate stuff).  I am not sure when soulmating(?) would start but I am assuming a little after the first agricultural revolution.  Also, soulmates are just stupidly compatible but not perfect, so not all soulmates work out but a vast majority of them do.

  What I was wondering was how would the world change in drastic ways.  This does not disallow childbearing or marriage outside of soulmates but I assume that those rates would be a lot lower. Does arrange marriage still exist, is being gay more acceptable if the world itself thinks it’s okay, are racial tensions worse or better, would birth rates be higher or lower in modern times, is the human species overall weaker from having the bar for spreading genes lowered?  


  Edit: Note soulmates are based on the ability to meet and the tattoo appears when the soulmates meet.  And 99% of the population meet the other soulmate before the age of 35. (So its really a magic world were the magic only applies to mates finding each other, so I guess fate is probably also a think)

    A good starting point for your research would be in modern and ancient societies where astrology and other divination was taken seriously (was it?). See how that's used, because it's a similar (though obviously less evidence-based) concept. 

    It depends how it works: the soulmate tattoo, like, with 7 billion people today, if my one soulmate could live in Nigeria just as easily as next door, I'd expect to never meet them and so wouldn't really try. You'd live your life, put your tattoo on your dating site profile, maybe go to conventions or speed dating events to find your tattoo mate (the tattoos would have broad categories, like star signs: blobs versus squares vs lines)

    So in that situation, you might not get this knowledge in antiquity. People have been spread out around the world for a very, very long time. So it would just be a fun curiosity when people have matching tattoos. 

    But if part of what makes someone a soulmate is proximity (after all, not much of a soulmate if you'll never get an opportunity to meet!), then that's more interesting. Say in the absence of anything else you have a 60% chance of finding your soulmate. Then folklore can catch up. 

    Unless it starts as a very basic part of society, it's going to be weaponised and trodden on, though, given what we know about human nature. People will be forced into marriages for family and property reasons, and great writers will write about people who see their matching tattoo in the crowd and run away with them. Sex is one of the most powerful drives most of us have, and it's been controlled forever by religions and the state. I don't think these tattoos would be treated any different: the catholic church would read a gay tattoo as saying that both have been called to serve the lord in chastity, perhaps as priests or nuns.

      I added a clearifying note to the first comment, but I agree that state and religion would abuse it, I just dont know how.

        My understanding is that marriage for love is a relatively recent invention in western society, and that standard monogamous marriage is relatively rare in the world. (That said, my source is Sex At Dawn, which I believe has a variety of problems). 

        As a poly person I'm interested in if you could get multiples; as a regular human who has been in long term relationships, I wonder if your tattoo would begin to fade as you drifted apart. But I think if it's magic and it's magic romance perfect relationship then... maybe not?

        Another interesting thought: a 40 year old man meets his friend's 15 year old niece. Their matching birthmarks appear. That sort of thing would be... interesting, and probably not unheard of. Make the 40 year old man the king (who has a wife and kids already) and the niece a tavern employee and all of a sudden the "young woman is assaulted" story writes itself.
        ```

        - u/ironistkraken:
          ```
          Thats the interesting thing about soulmates, is how would it interact with different cases.  What would happen to asexuals and aromantics?   Would poly's be just be groups of soulmates in relationships or do they all share the same tattoo?  
          I also assumed that the soulmate tattoos would only be visible on people who can consent.
          ```

          - u/MagicWeasel:
            ```
            The thing with most poly configurations it that they're branching webs: I'm not in a relationship with my husband's girlfriend or her partner, and I've only even met one of my boyfriend's like 5 different partners, so yeah. For a good 6 years there I thought I had two lifelong spousal relationships, so I'd have expected two tattoos, one for each, I guess? I'd say only getting one tattoo to appear when I expected two would make me save a lot of time, but it was 6 years well spent, so who knows.

            Regarding consent, make the tavern employee 23 years old, if you like; there's still a power imbalance and the politics of the medieval period are unlikely to be sympathetic to the difference. Unless the magic only makes you get the tattoo for someone you WILL fall in love with, and then basically you have Beauty and the Beast

    > So if 99.999999% of the population finds and identifies a soulmate

    [How would such a high percentage work out?](https://what-if.xkcd.com/9/)
    ```

    - u/ironistkraken:
      ```
      I think part of being soulmates is that you would naturally meet them in your life.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        So your soulmate is randomly selected from among the people that you will meet in life? Okay, that can work out.

        Next question: can it be forced, or faked in some way? Everyone would *love* be be the soulmate of the rich, unmarried Prince, for example. (Though that won't work out for them, because for political reasons the Prince is going to be marrying the next-door kingdom's Princess and both Kings involved are on the lookout for anyone claiming to be one of the two unlucky soulmates).

        --------------

        I imagine that one effect would be more mixing between classes - a Merchant whose soulmate is a Beggar might happen quite a lot, and people will be more inclined to marry into other walks of life if there's a soulmate involved.

        On the other hand, if someone in power wants to *keep* two classes apart, then something like Apartheid might prevent the formation of soulmates - if they never get the chance to look into each other's eyes then there will never *be* soulmates between two groups, right?
        ```

        - u/ironistkraken:
          ```
          I bet its a job to tell if a tattoo is authentic (I know nothing about tattoos but they probably would leave more damage then a random perfect soulmate tattoo). And that is why I want to know if people think racial tension would go up or down.  On one hand master and slave mates must be pretty common, but on the other hand there is stuff like apartheid.
          ```

          - u/CCC_037:
            ```
            Soulmates would both cause and defuse a lot of racial tension. I think that it could believably go either way.

            Racial tension, at the heart of it, starts with the observation "those people are (visibly) different" and than tack onto this "and therefore they are inferior". (There's a lot of people who fear that it might be the other way around - that it might be *themselves* who are inferior - and who react to this fear by insisting, loudly and repeatedly, that they are, in fact, members of the superior race).

            Now, someone might meet a soulmate of a different racial background. Let's say that they get together and marry.

            But what do their parents think? Is a young man who marries the daughter of a slave considered fully human? Is he considered *sane?* Or do his parents treat him as an embarrassment - "really no better than one of them"? Do they try to talk (or beat) him around to rejecting her and settling down with a nice, safe girl of the correct race? Do they disinherit him just so that he can't pass their wealth along to the sons and daughters of a slavegirl?

            What of his new wife's parents? What do they think? Is their daughter merely lucky, or is she selling out? Does she have any influence over the way the other slaves are treated, and is she urged to do more with this influence than is actually possible? Is their new son-in-law someone they can talk to, or someone who they have to leave the room when he enters in case he carries back reports of what they said to *his* father?
            ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    I think it'd help if you focused more on the immediate effect, before you focus on the consequences. For example, do the people for whom the tattoo appears feel when it does? Does it appear in an obvious place that would need to be hidden on purpose? Is there any effect beyond signaling that they'll be compatible? One of the commenters below interpreted that soulmating as a process selected from the people one meets throughout life and picks one with high compatibility. Did you intend that or are you aiming for something more like the two people having innate compatibility from birth?

    I'm not necessarily asking you to clarify, but rather to think about whether you can come up with answers to these questions that would make the concept more interesting, first. A lot of worldbuilding is done in a vacuum, answering questions in a way that ends up deflecting potential development instead of building on the initial idea.

  **Would humanity be able to survive, if all technology completely disappeared?**   


  Im trying to build a post-apocalypse world in which the planet was brought back to pristine state before Anthropocene, and everyone was stranded naked and tool-less.   


  But the question is, would it be even possible for enough humans to survive to keep the species going, let alone try to rebuild civilisation?
  ```

  - u/D0TheMath:
    ```
    Yes, it would be, and has happened [before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory). Even now, there are many [uncontacted peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples) who live with stone age technology. It is not hard to imagine they could live with less, and get back to their current state of living within a decade or two. Assuming they don't lose knowledge of the technology when disaster strikes. I'd bet these people expand as resources in other areas turn up, and within a few thousand years they may dominate the rest of the world. If this scenario happens, then we get normal history. If, on the other hand a state forms, made up of people who remember life before the apocalypse, it's likely they will try to replicate the successes of Science and other modern discoveries leading to an accelerated history. 

    So it's almost guaranteed that at most within at most a few million years, median 2-3 thousand years, and at minimum 100-500 years we will get back to at least Roman levels of technology, and from there it's nothing to get back to modern day technology. Much of the work was done with two major discoveries everyone knows about: the Scientific method, and the usefulness of mathematics. Other keys to the creation of the modern world lie with individual engineering breakthroughs like the steam engine, coal & other power sources, the printing press, and the realization of the benefits of industrialization. It's likely these will be written about (or at minimum talked about) in the immediate aftermath, and if even a single state cements enough power to allow for enough slack to promote science, math, and an industrialized economy it will get enormous amounts of power which it will likely use to further support Science, math, and industrialization as well as conquering or inspiring other states to do the same.

  **Is there an economist in the house?**

  I'm working on a hardish-SF novel, and could use some advice on the consequences of a few policy proposals - and on which policies would tend toward certain consequences. (I don't necessarily want to be tied to any particular model of economics - after all, life keeps throwing up new surprises - but I'd like to at least avoid any outright howlers.)

  For instance, I'm positing some fairly widespread consumer credit reform in the mid-21st century, and am thinking about some jurisdictions adapting Graeber's thoughts on a 'debt jubilee'; after an individual's debt gets so old, such as seven years, it's no longer a legally-enforceable debt. But I don't have the economic chops to work out second- and third-order effects of that, let alone how it might compare to competing proposals.

  (The setting isn't a utopia; it's just had a few decades of reasonably reasonable people in charge, who are willing to nudge policy in the direction of overwhelming evidence when that exists. Vaguely Nordic-European; sovereign wealth fund, UBI, a year or so of civilian-service conscription, and a few other "somewhat strange to many current-day eyes but still fairly recognizable" details.)

  Is there anyone here willing to bounce a few ideas around?

    Looking at mortgages in this proposal:

    Obviously you can't get a mortgage longer than 7 years anymore, an in practical terms they'll be even shorter, to prevent lendees from stopping paying when there's no longer enough time to work out a default on the loan. This makes mortgages much more expensive, to the point that most people can't afford them. On the one hand that reduces the demand for housing (in dollar terms), so you'd expect prices to go down, but on the other hand the capital that was being used to provide mortgages is still there, and the owning class still wants returns on that capital. With housing prices down and available capital up, investors move to buying properties and renting them out. So back at the consumer end, you mostly see a shift from home ownership to rent.

    And I think you'd see the same general trend elsewhere wherever possible. Business loans financed by taking an ownership stake in the company, that sort of thing.
    ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    Not an actual economist but I'm a bit of a dabbler, so take that into consideration. Second and third order effect I'd imagine to be stricter lending to consumers, lowered quality of life, and a slowdown of the economy.

    &#x200B;

    Debt is a facilitator of consumption. In economic terms it increases GDP, consumption in general and facilitates economic transactions. If you make it less desirable for businesses, banks and other institutions to issue debt reasonably they'll just avoid it, leading to an economic slowdown.

    &#x200B;

    Banks won't give people loans to buy a house as easily without an asset or backer, making it much more difficult for the average individual to acquire one. Cars and houses would become much harder for a consumer to get a hold of, because it wouldn't be the case of saving enough money to pay a down payment but actually the entirety or a much larger percentage of it as a down payment.

    &#x200B;

    PS. Most countries would not do this ever. GDP is what very important for countries, if you decrease or virtually freeze consumer spend which is one of the 3 main contributors to GDP you'll be basically taking away over a third of the GDP of most developed economies. As an emergency measure during a crisis, sure, as a predictable consistent debt nullification policy, almost impossible.
    ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    I'm not an economist, but this seems fairly problematic. Compare this to filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, for example. Under Chapter 7, you may have to give up certain non-protected assets (like money in a savings account, a non-primary residence, extra vehicles, etc.) You could also potentially be forced into a Chapter 13 bankruptcy (structured repayment) if you have a decent amount of disposable income and you could easily pay off most of the debt over the next five years.

    Historically, jubilees were started in a time when there was indentured servitude. Before jubilees, you could effectively be made a slave indefinitely if you failed to repay your debts, which obviously would decrease willingness to take on debt. Jubilees created a bit more balance between creditors and debtors, still allowing the creditor to recoup at least some of their losses, yet also allowing debtors to escape indefinite servitude if bad luck prevents them from repaying their debts. This balance is pretty similar in effect to what we have now with the Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy system. If you just have jubilees without indentured servitude (or other repayment options), you'll obviously make people much less willing to provide loans, skewing the system too far in favor of debtors.

    An interesting alternative to these is the concept of mutual-credit banks in [mutualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_\(economic_theory\)). For a hard SF novel, you could possibly have something like an international credit union with its policies established through a [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy). The credit union would deal in one or more cryptocurrencies, serving as both a broker and a creditor. Any person who wants to be eligible to vote or to receive loans from it must have had an investment account with it for at least the last ten years, and must have been contributing at least 1% of their income without taking it out. This credit union would create a somewhat interesting political force, since the democratic control over it means it generally would not issue loans to authoritarian governments or unethical/unpopular businesses, making it one of very few businesses that push would governments towards being good for their people. It would be one of the most cost-effective ethical investments available.
