  Not really a topic for this forum, i would say? So i wont go into it overmuch, i would just say that many "taboo" accusations are pretty overblown, and this would be one of them; you will find a ton of research by policy and nutrition experts discussing culture and income problems and the way they relate to diet. Many of those authors will also address things like ethnic/genetic components of obesity and the like.

  So happy hunting! tons of great (well, as great as this field can be) studies on this topic.
