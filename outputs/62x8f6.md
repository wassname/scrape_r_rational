## [BST] Rational punk?

### Post:

I've been thinking about writing a rational rocketpunk story. Anything I ought to watch out for while doing so? What about other punk subgeneres like Steam, Cyber, or Clock?

  The principal factor in -punk is radical politics and aesthetics.

  You need to push an agenda with your entire world:

  - Cyberpunk has the archetypical establishment/anarchist angle of the free market neo-liberal Corporations and the anonymous hacker collective underdogs.
  - Steampunk has a lot of plots you can lift directly from pre-WWI era politics, such as communism (the haves vs the have-nots), secularism (progressives vs conservatives), and good old us vs them intrigue.

  Rocket/Atompunk is inspired by Cold-War era, so you need to investigate the conflict of US-style liberalism and USSR communism.

  Plots to consider:

  - US union busting b/c red scare.
  - Disestablishment of the corrupt communist state from within leading to the fall of the USSR.
  - Destruction of social trust within USSR.
  - Propaganda.
  - Espionage.
  - Nuclear arms race, balancing the world on a knife's-edge of destruction every day.

  Ideas to consider:

  - Don't base your story in US or USSR. Base it in a sattelite state of either — less power ⇒ more restriction. Sandersonian! The best Cold-War era spy thrillers take place in Europe.
  - The space race was a show of force: if we can put a rocket on the moon, we can put a rocket in Moscow.
  - The US is not the good guys. The USSR is not the bad guys. This is two extremist ideologies clashing because humans are dumb.

  Aesthetic-wise, you should really focus on all the little things that make then different from now. Slowness of computation comes to mind; bulkiness of technological equipment. Criticise society, but not to draw parallels to the real world; the reader will draw their own parallels.

  That's about it.
