    Thanks, really, but no :D. I read The Metropolitan Man and frankly the comparison is very flattering - I'd say he's much better than me!

      It's just we already have Alexander Wales writing a great story anonymously on the sub (Worth the Candle).

      Great chapter BTW. Never watched Dragon ball, but still enjoying it so far.

  >"See, I can guarantee you that in a few seconds he will intervene, and he will either kick your ass to the Moon and back, or talk you into thinking everything you've ever believed is wrong. Not sure which one is worse yet."

  Pretty much this story in a nutshell, once again I had a great time.

  Also neat reference to the original material with the moon thing

  Chapter 3 is up! This time it took a bit longer. To make it clear, my workflow is as follows - I tend to post one chapter when I finish writing the next one. So I've just finished Chapter 4, and now will polish it while I write Chapter 5, etc. This time I've been slowed down partly because of my work, but also because Chapter 4 was growing longer and longer, and I ended up just splitting it into two. Anyway, hope that you will like it! Here begin the real divergences from the original DB, and they're only going to get bigger from now on.

  It feels a little "Already knew the answer" for oolong. 
  Shouldn't a sane first guess for a non magic believer is holograms?
  Considering that she has in her pockets a device that can become a car, or a house Capsules would be another good answer.
  Good story: as a typo goku said "So.Much.People." not sure if intentional or not.
  thanks for the story.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    The periods are intentional, it's just to mean that the sentence is pronounced in awe, with the words well separated :). I've seen it used various times in that way.

    As for Oolong... yeah, may have been a bit rushed in a way. I guess that's what happens when you want to get something done with because the bits after that are what you really care about... 
    Though if you consider it Bulma doesn't *exclude* he might be using holograms either - she just takes precautions for the case in which he can actually transform. Also what the people describe seems a bit too much for holograms. She *does* somewhat believe already in magic, at this point, necessarily, she's seen Goku's stick. This just seals the deal.
    ```

    - u/Rouninscholar:
      ```
      I meant that it shouldn't be "so much people" It should be "So many people" :P

      And that is fair, although even with the stick that is inconsistent with magic, as the stick keeps it's strength and increases mass, where if I remember oolong doesn't. Can't wait for the next chapter either way though.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Oh, sorry :D. I didn't get it. I would need to check, how to deal with countable and uncountable nouns in all circumstances might indeed have gone over my non-native speaker head :/.

        Well, not all magic has to work exactly the same. Plus Bulma didn't weigh the stick, but even then, it's made clear even in the original DB that Oolong is *bad* at magic. Puar is better at doing the same things (though he/she has limits too). I really don't think I can make it completely consistent while adhering close enough to the original Dragon Ball lore, it's really totally over the place. The Nyoibo is also effectively a unique relic of special potency (it comes from Kami's Lookout after all), while Oolong just learned some stuff at magic school.
        ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    Maybe.  Except hat the foremost expert on capsule tech is RIGHT THERE and she doesn't immediately jump to the conclusion that it's some form of tech she is familiar with.  RGoku can tell that just by looking at her, so it rather quickly rules out that option.
    ```

  - u/JulianWyvern:
    ```
    To be fair, the first part of the plan, surrounding him, would work even if it was holograms.
    ```

- u/GriffinJ:
  ```
  Great chapter dude! Keep it up!


  Btw, the line "Yeah, you can say it out loud!" sounds pretty awkward. I assume you meant something more like: "Yeah, you can say that again!" ?
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    That was the intended meaning, yes. I'm now worrying that might have been just me awkwardly translating in English an Italian idiom :D.
    ```

    - u/GriffinJ:
      ```
      Thought so. There were a couple other things that stuck out, but it was mostly just the fact that a couple sentences here or there seemed jumbled. I assume Italian has some different grammar rules that didn't translate well.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Yeah, of course I try avoiding that but sometimes something slips. Good chance for me to learn I guess :D, and I will go about fixing these things.
        ```

- u/SatelliteFool:
  ```
  Okay yea, this just went from *curiosity* to *watched*.

  Never thought I'd see a rational DB fic. Let alone a good one. Yet, here it is. Well done. Keep it up.
  ```

- u/rationalidurr:
  ```
  Definitely enjoying the story so far.
  A bit risk on guessing how carrot magic works but in line with all magic so far.
  This goes on my reading and daily refresh list.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Well, Goku himself admits it, it was a risk.

    There was also a slightly more convoluted reasoning behind that, that I left out to avoid slowing down the pace of the very tense scene. I could imagine a sustained magic version of the enchantment as well as a one-time version. However the one-time version would mean transforming Bulma into a perfectly "normal" carrot. And since I can't see how that could hold a human soul, that should mean killing her. Transforming it back should only mean getting a dead body, and she'd be in the afterlife. Instead her soul is still somewhat bound to the carrot, which means it's sort of magical, which made me lean towards the "sustained magic" explanation.

    As an additional thought, Majin Bu displays similar abilities by turning people into candy, much later on. And the same seems to hold. In fact, when he turns Vegito into candy, the latter is *so strong*, he manages to overcome some effects of the magic and still fight. Which suggests the transformation does indeed leave the soul still bound to the object.
