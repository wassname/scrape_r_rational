  There is nothing to get me interested enough to continue reading past the first couple of chapters.

    Ah thanks so much for the support let alone stopping by to read it! I've noted the awkward Japanese too (remnants of first drafts), and my recent editing purge is hopefully remedying the worst of it! Props to you for bearing with it though!! Glad I offered some semblance of an entertaining plot!
