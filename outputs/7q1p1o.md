  *Sigh* At this point, while I love the story and will continue to read the manga, it has lost even the slight shade of rationality it previously had.

  It made sense for there to plausibly be a human village if the founders were from a whole group of people breaking out of the stone, but not from the people who survived the petrification 3,700 years prior. Human civilization established themselves within two to three thousand years and you're telling me that a group of people starting over with all of the knowledge of science at their finger tips (due to being astronauts!) were stuck at prehistoric levels for 3,700 years!?! They shouldn't even have the same language anymore! Plus their biology might've warped and changed over time due to evolution.

    Think of it as "More rational than average" fiction. Or at least more rational than your average American comic book.

      Yeah, it still uses rational themes and (usually) seems to have rational principles behind things even if on their surface they're a dumb trope.  

      IE: The one guy seeming to bust out of his shell due to THE POWER OF LOVE, but it was really the scientist dragging him to the cave for the correct chemicals to drip on him which, not coincidentally, became a huge plot point for the story.

      So maybe the village has a dumb reason for existing, or maybe there's more meat to it. At the end of the day we're reading a fic about a guy making sulfa-antibiotics from complete scratch, but also has "Peak Neanderthal Highschooler" who can somehow snatch an arrow out of mid-air.

    It could very easily be that there's more information that we're missing here. Maybe they did get turned to stone but were able to break out due to it being a lower dose of plot rays. Maybe there was a setback that prevented them from properly passing on their knowledge, like a successful version of Tsukasa or something.

    It's a manga. The author is a forty year old Japanese guy who's most well known work is a manga about football. He most likely does not have a clue what rational fiction is or why her should abide by it.

      None of that has any bearing on whether its a rational manga or not....which it is clearly not. Doesnt mean its bad, just means its no longer rational and there's no need for further chapters to be posted here.

        Personally, I would still like further chapters to be posted here.
