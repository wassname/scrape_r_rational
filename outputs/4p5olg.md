## Want to major in Global Catastrophic Risk Mitigation. What classes should I take?[D][Q]

### Post:

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, but I needed to post this somewhere enough people would see it and respond to it. It's been recommended to me that I design my own major, and I've decided to try majoring in Global Catastrophic Risk Mitigation. I'm thinking there would be a few different specializations available for GCRM students: AGI, Nanotech, Climate and Ecological, and Political. Maybe a specialization in Late and Low Probability GCRs (like meteors aliens and simulation shutdown) could be available as a minor.

I think that GCRM should have 3 Main Focus Areas:

**Critical thinking and Decision-making**--how to think critically and make good decisions; rationality

**Public Relations, Education and Finance**--how to raise money and support for a cause, how to educate people, how to effectively communicate with individuals and the general public

**Research and Development**--systematic investigation of GCR issues and the design and development of risk-mitigation technologies


What kinds of classes would you recommend for GCRM students overall, and what kinds of classes would you recommend specifically for each specialization? I want a decent list that gives a good general idea of what students going into the major should expect. I need this before I meet with my general adviser, so if you guys can respond fairly soon that would be much appreciated.

My university's course catalog can be found here: https://registrar.osu.edu/courses/

Thanks!

  To answer this, consider your goals.  There are 3 most likely goals I can think of:

  1) You find this an interesting area and want to be a jack of all trades in this field.  In this case, you'd want a selection of courses covering a number of the areas you mention.  This could be tricky because there are so many distinct fields that are related.  Philosophy, varying sciences, politics, education, business, finance, and more.  You can't become an expert in all of these.

  2) You want to be a technical expert who can help develop solutions to one or more of these problems.  In this case, I'd say you should change your plans and focus on the hard sciences specific to one particular problem.  For example, chemistry and climatology to develop an otherwise-harmless chemical we can release into the atmosphere to raise our albedo and counteract global warming.

  3) You want to have decision-making power to actually select and implement good ideas developed by the #2s.  In this case, you either need to go into politics or become so wealthy that you can substantially influence important politicians.  The selection and implementation of key ideas will have only a passing connection to their technical merits.

  I don't think this subreddit is a good place for this topic. I'd suggest /r/ExistentialRisk, but it doesn't seem very active. Maybe /r/EffectiveAltruism,  /r/Futurology, or LessWrong.

  As for the question itself, do you expect other students to also follow the major you design? If not, it might make sense to just design the major around what you want to do and what you can get approved, instead of worrying about what the hypothetical other students would do. If you know of specific other students who are interested in such a thing, you could consult them. If you are planning on getting other students interested in global catastrophic risk, then that's great, but I'd guess that designing a major around it and hoping people take it isn't a good way to do that, since there probably aren't any classes that are directly about GCRs anyway, even though there are a wide variety of classes that are useful for people interested in reducing GCRs. Since there are so many subjects that are relevant to GCRs, I'd suggest not worrying too much about people's specific majors and what classes they're taking when doing outreach.

  As for what you should take yourself, that's also hard to answer, and largely depends on what you're interested in, since again, there are so many subjects that relate to GCRs.

  If you're not already familiar with it, there appears to be a [LessWrong meetup group in Columbus, OH](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Columbus.2C_OH), which may have other people at Ohio State interested in GCR, who you could consult for advice specific to the university. I'd contact them before showing up at the meetup location, because LW wiki descriptions of meetup groups are often out of date.
