## [WIP] Sideways in Hyperspace will return on December 18th

### Post:

Hey guys!

So this hiatus ended up being way longer than I'd intended, real life can be a female dog at times. But, you won't have to wait much longer. I'm happy to announce that I've finally got my backlog into a place I'm pleased with, and regular weekly updates will be resuming in three weeks. 

For those of you who are unfamiliar with SiH, here's the basic premise:

>It’s 2219. Just 20 years ago, humanity unlocked the secrets to faster than light travel, and a new rush to the stars began. As the human race takes its first tentative steps in interstellar exploration, an ancient galaxy-spanning conflict threatens to swallow up the young species.

>Mission Commander Ivy Cazininsky has stumbled into first contact with intelligent alien life just 12 light years from Earth, and this shocking discovery will send ripples throughout Sol, and beyond. As the full implications of this meeting are felt, Nations will be rise and fall, and the future course of humanity will be altered forever.

>Mining Foreman Owen McGregor just wants to keep his somewhat estranged family safe from the deadly harms of deep space, a prospect that becomes much harder when enormous alien mining ships begin taking their world apart at the seams.

>This is the story of humanity’s first steps onto the galactic stage.

You can catch up on already posted chapters [here](https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/index/) and new chapters will be posted on Sundays starting on December 18th. 

As a sort of apology for taking so long, and to wet people's appetites, I've polished up one of my backend info pages and made it public as a [Ship Specification Page](https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/vessel-specifications/). It currently only has two entries, but I have another two almost finished which will be added to it at some point soon. 

I'm also still taking applications for beta readers, so PM me if you have any interest in that.
