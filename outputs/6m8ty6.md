  Poor Nic. Seems like he gets accosted by unpleasant individuals every other chapter these days.

  I'm curious what Nic will do about this new character. On one hand, having a subordinate with powerful magics at his disposal could be useful, especially if this person is sneaky enough to skirt around secret service agents. On the other hand, demons.

  If Nic goes to the Archmage or Delcroix for help they may decide the tether needs to be cut, or that Nic himself is a flight risk. Keeping quiet about it could be a temporary solution, but I'm sure the others would find out eventually, and he certainly can't sit on his hands waiting for the Lady of Shadows to appear. An interesting predicament.

  I enjoyed this chapter - I liked the transition from Nic focusing on book learning to Nic applying that knowledge to people (analysing his classmates). It's a nice bit of character growth.
