  Learning how to lose? oh no it's Quirrel all over again
  ```

  - u/Aqua-dabbing:
    ```
    What's up with this in rationalist fiction? Is this a thing that people normally need to learn?

    Normal children usually "lose" in public a large amount of times before they become old enough to make larger decisions. Is it because of speculation that special children like HJPEV or Blue Oak don't, and therefore need to be explicitly taught to lose?
    ```

    - u/Redditor76394:
      ```
      Needing to learn to lose isn't unique to special children. Children that lose in public don't always take away the right lesson. 

      It's sadly common to find adults that shift the blame onto anyone but themselves when they fail. It's an instinctive and rational defense that protects the ego. 

      I mean sure, Blue is a talented kid that wouldn't lose out to his peers often and therefore hasn't had the chance. But regular people can be prideful and mentally defensive too.
      ```

      - u/Aqua-dabbing:
        ```
        Fair point. Kids assigning blame to others instead of oneself for things that are your own fault happens all the time, most famously in League of Legends matches. However, the appropriate HPMOR lesson here is [Heroic responsibility](http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/75), that when you do lose, everything is your fault.

        Quirrell-style getting beaten up in public seems like a cure for very specific HJPEV quirks only (cannot fathom losing, keeps escalating, "intent to kill").

        There's another failure of accepting the loss, which is learning to accept when you are wrong; but again the cure for this is the Litany of Tarski and not getting beaten up in public.
        ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      In my experience, most children, including "normal children," actually have a lot of trouble learning how to lose. A large part of my work with kids in therapy was helping them understand things like this:

      http://daystareld.com/arguing-with-adults/
      ```

      - u/Aqua-dabbing:
        ```
        Very interesting, I concede. It feels to me like "don't mess with adults, they have all the power" was something I knew from a very early age, but I can see spoiled children having trouble with it.

        The cure for that is not a Quirrell-style public beating, though... But who knows what you have for us in the future of the story.
        ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      Do people ever lose outside of the context of games as adults? I think when people "lose" arguments most people don't react well or rationally.
      ```

    - u/--MCMC--:
      ```
      something something participation trophies? Millenials are ones whose parents insisted on these, right? and I'd expect most writers on here to be of that generation

      see also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_Therapy, I hear this is popular among guys e.g. first starting to date or apply for jobs and such, though not so much for "hiding your power level from stronger foes who would crush you" or whatever contrived motivations may be found in *rational* protagonists, but rather as a way of overcoming a variety of learned helplessness where you never try to do anything remotely challenging for fear of loss / failure / rejection
      ```

- u/netstack_:
  ```
  So Blue gets a perfunctory meeting with the Gym Leader, then turns around and goes to an underground ~~Gym~~ dojo with ties to the ousted former Leader...and he's not worrying about the optics?

  I see no way this could possibly backfire.


  Also, loving the reasoning for Red to pickup all 3 starters despite the impracticality of it in the game. I always thought it was odd that such strong and distinctive critters were basically limited to you and your rival. It speaks to the quality of this fic that I can think of several reasons you wouldn't see them in Gyms in this universe, though!
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Would *you* turn down an invitation to join Dragon Army, though?
    ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      Literal Dragon army?

      I suppose it depends on how much I like trampolines.

      Speaking of which, was that part of the TK17 cameo specifically, or just the beginning of an in-universe Rationalist Technological Revolution^TM centered around the trampoline?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Not sure if people know, but I literally ran a group housing experiment called [Dragon Army](https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/dragon-army-theory-charter-8192dc64ea22) (named after the Ender's Game reference, not HPMOR).
        ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    I vaguely remember at least one Lass in pokemon leaf green who had like to Ivysaurs but I'm not about to go through every route's trainer encounters to check.

    It's also kind of debatable whether say all of the trade exclusive pokemon from the first generation or the two gifts not including the fossils are actually native to the region considering that they aren't actually able to be encountered in the wild. That list is Far'fetched, Jynx, and Mr. Mime for in-game trade exclusives. Then the gifted pokemon which are the three starters, Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, Eevee, and Lapras kind of counts there's only encounters for it in the Sevii islands.

    That's only if you're not counting like the safari zones or the fact that most of the previous pokemon are made much more available in the Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee remakes. 

    The overall rarity of the starters is kind of explained by their unbalanced gender ratios, which with such an unbalanced male to female ratio with only in-game procreation would mean that the 1 female would have to not only survive and be able to reproduce, but that they'd have to do so a bunch more than a comparable species that had a fifty/fifty split  or the in game 50.2/49.8 would have to. They would however probably be good for overall gene survival if there's anywhere near the in game intergenetic compatibility, but even with a fraction of it having males that pass their genes down more often than say the normal coin flip gender ratio might lead to certain populations kind of breeding themselves out of existence and into a broader expanded recessive type existence.
    ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      This is actually the first I've heard of the gender imbalance. Imagine my surprise when I looked at Bulbapedia, which has a page category just for [Pokémon with a 7:1 male to female ratio](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Pok%C3%A9mon_with_a_gender_ratio_of_seven_males_to_one_female). Why is this? Is it one of the weird Gen 1 bugs that just became a fixture??

      Edit: the rabbit hole of pokemon gender goes much deeper than i thought.
      ```

      - u/KnickersInAKnit:
        ```
        Gender and breeding only showed up in Gen 2. Probably to keep it rare - species passes on from the female parent. Having a high male ratio forces you to get a Ditto if you want more.

        As to why 7:1? Lots of things in the games revolve around a base 2 number probably due to coding and space on the cartridge reasons. Examples include IVs (32) and EVs (256)
        ```

        - u/netstack_:
          ```
          This makes sense to me. Bulbapedia seems to agree that rarity was the goal. No explanation is ventured for why one and only one Pokémon achieves this with the opposite 1:7 ratio, though.

          As a side note, you may have seen it, but my favorite abuse of data limitations in the games is the [system for Pokémon cries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDLpbFXnpeY). It's a case study in clever ways to do procedural generation.
          ```

          - u/Electric999999:
            ```
            That one pokemon is meant to be a lion, so they probably went with that ratio as a reference to real life lion prides being primarily made of lionesses.
            ```

          - u/KiritosWings:
            ```
            The opposite ratio would make something more common. Species breeds down the mother's side 100% of the time (with the only exception being if the "mother" is a ditto). Having a 7 to 1 ratio of females to males would make that species a significantly more prolific one.
            ```

      - u/Electric999999:
        ```
        It's because eggs are always the same species as the mother, so having a pokemon be mostly male makes it harder to breed more.  You can get a ditto of course, but dittos don't let you pass down egg moves and egg moves are a major way of getting pokemon to have good movepools in the games. (Less so in the games with lots of tutors, but there's always some good moves you can't get any other way)
        ```

- u/jtolmar:
  ```
  I see you sneakily coming up with reasons for Red and Blue to justify ending up with their canon teams. Now Pikachu is Red's emotional support animal, he has an eevee (->Espeon) from Aiko, he's getting copies of his friends' starters so he has an extra tie to them, soon you'll come up with a reason for him to be emotionally attached to a snorlax, and [oh look there's an entry on this in Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Red_(game\)#Pok.C3.A9mon_Gold.2C_Silver.2C_and_Crystal). In conclusion, I find this very amusing.

  As for the current chapter, I feel like the new character sees through Blue a little too much, too fast, to be believable. Though the surrounding culture of the gym is believable, I've seen this exact same mentality at parkour gyms before.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    The Eevee was given to Blue actually ;)
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      Whoops! For some reason I remembered everyone getting one.
      ```

      - u/KiritosWings:
        ```
        He's also a bit more well known for Lapras instead of Espeon though. (Originally it was Espeon but in all the future depictions it was Lapras in that slot) so that's a decent chance!
        ```

        - u/diggerda:
          ```
          Surely picking one up when they have the upcoming silph building raid.
          ```

  - u/thereisnojellyworld:
    ```
    you do realize that Blue is famous in this story's universe right? Duncan probably has pretty decent social/emotional sensitivity, and he just had to look at Blue's public posturing and think something like "he feels larger than life on the screen, and real people aren't larger than life. what would I be thinking or feeling if I were in his shoes, having his particular life experiences and background, without being larger than life?"

    Duncan also could have talked to other people who saw through him. there are probably a lot of psychics who are familiar enough with how human beings think and feel in general that they can read his face and body language even though they can't read his mind.
    ```

  - u/Electric999999:
    ```
    In that case I'll be very interested to see how he ends up with a Snorlax and a Lapras, particularly Lapras.   
    Lapras is both very rare and fairly redundant with a Blastoise, meaning he's unlikely to actually want one.   
    Snorlax is pretty rare, but it's certainly something anyone would want for the power and bulk.

  Pretty strong MoR reference at the end, an actual Dragon Army doing parkour - more references in this chapter than just the one in the AN.

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  Hey everyone! For those who somehow still haven't read it, the cameo in this chapter is based on the author of the Animorphs rational fiction, [Animorphs: The Reckoning](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046). It's absolutely amazing in more ways than I can succinctly describe; if you like this story, you will almost certainly like that one, unless you're literally just here because it's pokemon. Even if you're not an Animorphs fan, it's definitely worth checking out, and best of all, it's in the final stretch to the ending :)
  ```

  - u/cimbalino:
    ```
    I notice Animorphs's chapter threads go high up, though I never tried it because I've never heard of the source material. Do I need to know anything about it to understand the fanfic?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Nope; you'll miss references and jokes, of course, but in a way you get a more pure experience for not having any canon to spoil certain surprises.
      ```

      - u/Slinkinator:
        ```
        Based on the fake geek girls podcast, and my experience reading the first ~30 chapters of the fanfic, I'm not sure the fic surpasses the source material.

        Whether or not you have any experience with animorphs, the authors post script letter is deeply moving and affective.

        ```

        - u/TK17Studios:
          ```
          Note that there's a difference between surpassing the curated best-twenty-books of the source material, and surpassing the whole gestalt.

          The latter, I think, isn't that hard.  The former ... well, if I even managed to come *close* to "as good as the upper quartile of what original canon had to offer, minus all the dead weight" then I feel proud.
          ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          *shrugs* In my experience r!animorphs does everything the original wanted to do but better, but that's not to say the original was bad. It was just clearly a YA series in a number of ways, and also clearly not written with the intention of comprehensive and consistent worldbuilding in mind, and also not written by someone trying to teach actual improved thinking or problem solving, and so on. All the things that make rational fiction good, rational*ist* fiction good, r!animorphs accomplishes.
          ```

        - u/thereisnojellyworld:
          ```
          All stories teach their readers what to expect from them over the course of reading them. That so many of her readers disliked the final chapter so much tells me that it probably came out of left field with no foreshadowing whatsoever, that it broke from established style and thematic patterns in the story she was writing. i haven't read the original animorphs, but that's my impression from reading the letter from its author.

          It sounds kinda like what J.K. Rowling did with the Harry Potter series in reverse. Where Applegate seems to have taken her readers by surprise by pulling an unhappy ending out of thin air without sufficient in-story buildup to it, J.K. Rowling took her readers by surprise with a neat wrapped up happy ending out of thin air without sufficient in-story buildup to it.

          I haven't read the original animorphs, but the fact that its author even felt the need to write this letter feels a bit damning. Unless its ideas and themes are culturally taboo, a story should be able to stand on its own without the help of clarifying author's notes to explain what the author really meant. A novel is a form of expression meaning communication. If your story's main ideas and themes require an author's note for the reader to understand, that means you failed to tell the story that you were trying to tell, that what the readers saw was very different from what you thought they were seeing. Meaning you failed at communication.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            I can't recall the series, particularly the later books, clearly enough to be sure, but this is my impression, yeah. She wrote a YA series in a time when that meant something closer to "Hardy Boys" than "Hunger Games." 

            It wasn't all super light hearted fluff, of course, it dealt with death and enslavement and so on, but readers got used to the characters having plot armor and the villains being beaten by a band of plucky teenagers over the course of dozens of books, such that having them suddenly face real consequences was a very abrupt change of tone.

    I just got caught up on Animorphs.  Seriously one of the best things I've read online.  We are just about up to the climax.

    I'll need to find something else to replace it...and maybe The Origin of Species is it.  Yes, I'm in this comments thread despite not reading a single word of this fanfic so far.  But I saw a mentioning of the reckoning so I had to drop in :P

    Not sure if this counts, but i think I might be able to correct your French. "Être" means "be" in the sense "to be". In a motto it's more likely you want the imperative version, something like "you should be", which would be "sous" if you're addressing one person or "soyez" if several.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Thanks, but the motto is a real one by a real historical figure which as far as I can tell is used in this form by the parkour community, so I just used that :)

  This was a fun chapter. I'm glad we get to deal with the Glen situation a bit since it was apparent that he'd eventually fall behind Blue, and Blue has to figure out how to tackle that situation when it occurs. Both Red and Duncan emphasizing that Blue has to learn how to lose in the public eye sometimes is an important lesson and necessary if he wants to be the best Champion. 

  Fun cameos from Kiyo and Koichi, both named trainers from the actual [Dojo in the games](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fighting_Dojo). I usually head over to the Bulbapedia page whenever new character names are given to see if anybody of that name is from there and there are usually these great surprises there too.

  One interesting thing for me is that you've chosen for Blue to do Fuchsia first and then Saffron rather than the other way around. Most people tend to do Saffron first since we already need to be in that city anyways. 

  Also Hitmonchan/lee incoming next chapter I guess, but looking at Blue's teams from HGSS it might be a Machoke as well. Either way, it's great seeing them slowly building up their in-game teams.
  ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  Well, that's an explicit MoR shout-out at the end if there ever was one. I assume Duncan is the cameo character, and not Koichi? It's not actually clear. 

  You're right about one thing, and that's that I need to get onto reading animorphs the reconing. I read as much of it as was available some time ago, but fell behind on updates after a while. As an animorphs fan I feel I owe it to myself to catch up again, especially if it's ending soon.
  ```

  - u/netstack_:

    Correct on all counts.

    I do believe Koichi is established from when Sabrina's Gym was first introduced, though I don't remember exactly how that went down.

  - u/KiritosWings:

    Saving the time of getting them as Bulbasaur and Squirtle and having to train them fully up.
