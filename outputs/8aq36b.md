## Exploit the rules of my technologies. Object fabrication, time dilation, alternate earths, respawning, consensual telepathy

### Post:

Someone invents a technology, and uses it to reshape the world in a single moment into Utopia as they see it.

I and a group of other people are writing an anthology about how the world reacts in the wake of someone unilaterally introducing new technologies worldwide that fundamentally break the way society has functioned so far, but result in a much higher standard of living for almost everyone.

In-story, populations of millions will doubtless be trying to exploit and subvert the new world and its toys. So I thought you guys might have fun identifying a few of those exploits. And then I can either patch them or put them in the story.

.

There are a few fundamental technologies in play. Spatial distortion, brain interface, a functionally indestructible material, and arbitrarily powerful computing. But the first, spatial distortion, is used by the technologies in widely varied ways.

It can create portals. It can create isolated spatial pockets of indefinite size, that can be accessed with portals. When those pockets are isolated, they can be time-dilated to operate on a faster or slower timescale. Isolated regions of space can also be duplicated, including any objects within.

Even the brain interface is actually just a very fine-tuned application of the same principle, using tiny distortions to observe and, when so desired, interact with, every individual cell in the brain and nervous system simultaneously.

.

Noon GMT on Christmas Day, a little over twelve thousand objects appear in an isometric grid covering the entire land area of the earth. Each is around 123 kilometers from its six neighbors, at whatever altitude is most easily and publicly accessible. They are hexagonal pillars with each of the six sides measuring 3 meters wide by six meters tall.

They come to be known as "workshops", and the unknown entity that created them as Santa Claus. The workshops read intent, and any of the six sides will open for people to a room "inside" that is much bigger, with all six walls 48x48 meters, with five gateways per wall. When not open to the outside world, 144 times as much time will pass on the inside as on earth.

The four interior gateways will connect to any other workshop anywhere, so they can be used as a transit hub. No gateway will let through, however, anyone who currently intends to harm another person or their body in any way. In the middle of the workshop are 32 hexagonal booths, 32 table-like surfaces, and 3 large platforms.

The tables are fabricators. These will create for you almost any object you want, with a few exceptions. Nothing still alive, no manufactured currencies, and anything radioactive or explosive will be excessively contained. It also won't make anything at all that the person intends to use to harm another person, even hypothetically or in self-defense. Things placed on the fabricator instead can also be disposed of and retrieved later. Although again, nothing alive and no currency can be stowed this way.

The booths are respawn chambers. Whenever anyone's body dies, A copy of their mind from just before their brain was irrevocably injured is transferred into a fabricated clone body that is in optimal health conditions. People can also enter respawn chambers with intent to modify their biology, be it structure, sex, age, or even species. But again, no modification can be made with the intent to harm another person.

The three platforms are telepathy arrays. If a group of people all stand on it and all mentally consent to it, it will form a telepathic link that gives all of them full, unhindered access to all the other's thoughts, opinions, memories, and feelings. Afterward, if any member of the group ever has intent to sever the link, they are immediately unbonded from the group. The telepathy array will not bond anyone with someone they intend to harm, and if ill-intent emerges within a group the person is immediately unbonded.

.

The interior gateways can also open to personal rooms. These can be up to as big as the workshop interior, and by default have one respawn chamber, one fabricator, and a telepathy array. If someone has opened a personal room, they will respawn there instead of in the public workshop. The gateway in a personal room can connect to any workshop. When the gateway isn't open, the room owner can time-dilate it in factors of 144 anywhere from earth standard timescale to almost 3 million times faster.

Other people can only enter a personal room with the consent of the room owner, and can be forcibly respawned out at any time if the room owner so decides. People can open more than one room. Room gateways can connect directly to each other if both room owners are allowed in each other's rooms.

Finally, from their personal room people can open gateways to workshops in new duplicate earths. These earths come in several templates modeled off the state the original earth was in at various times in its history. No new earths contain humans, and the state of things have been modified just enough to ensure no disasters will result from their absence. No reactors will go critical. No driverless moving vehicles. Alternate earths can operate on any of the same timescales as personal rooms.

.

All workshops and their amenities are made of a functionally indestructible material, and are effectively not modifiable by anyone except Santa Claus. The assumption of the story will also be that no-one else can or will figure out how to create similar technologies of their own, so everyone is operating equally within the rules of the system.

Now please proceed to find the loopholes, wreak mayhem, etc. I'll respond to everyone and say if their exploit would work in the rules as they stand, and if it will remain allowed in the story itself.

  Governments limiting access to these portals is the first plot token I can think of. You ought to read at least the first Riverworld novel for some toxic societies that can form around cornucopia devices.

  There's already places where internal borders or even external borders will limit access to that loose a grid.
  ```

  - u/forrestib:
    ```
    But if people are willing they can just die and respawn inside the workshop, bypassing whatever walls the governments might put up.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      At first, nobody will know that. And you have to be willing to accept that the copy is you, and not:

      1. just a copy who remembers being you.
      2. some kind of soulless monstrosity.
      3. a malicious agent (demon, alien, robot, whatever) pretending to be you.
      4. #3, plus you actually get reborn as a bodiless oracle for the demon, aware all the time and helpless to actually communicate.

      And even if you've worked through your own existential dilemma, you have to have the faith and courage to pull the trigger.

      Centuries later there will still be people (whole societies of people) who refuse to accept "respawning" as anything but a terrible trick.
      ```

      - u/forrestib:
        ```
        Centuries later, everyone who was around before will have respawned themselves. Even if grandpa raises you telling you how evil respawning is, when grandpa dies and respawns himself, you're probably going to question how evil it is. Especially if you and grandpa have a telepathy link so you can actually directly feel that he's the same ol' grandpa with the same ol' thoughts after. And eventually the skeptics will become so vastly outnumbered that it's just not practical to believe everyone else is evil zombies anymore.
        ```

          > Centuries later, everyone who was around before will have respawned themselves.

          Who are you going to believe, a demon pretending to be your grandfather or your real live human father?

          > Especially if you and grandpa have a telepathy link

          We know that telepathy link thing is part of the masquerade.

          > And eventually the skeptics will become so vastly outnumbered

          What, off in their private True Christian worlds?

          And none of that applies during the period you say you're going to write about.
          ```

            History makes it pretty clear that convenience eventually wins. If a rule forces people to act in a way that they can recognize is unnecessarily difficult, most people will either just break the rule, or move to change the rule.

            So with that in mind, how long are societies going to last that tell people to forgo the easily accessible thing that can provide them endless food, shelter, video games, heal any sickness, mental illness, or injury instantly, cure body dysphoria, reverse the aging process, travel to see the sights of the world, etc.?

            In traditionalist cultures, teenagers rebel by holding seances or having unprotected sex or watching violent movies. They do these things often no matter how much their parents tell them they'll burn in Hell for it. In the culture you're talking about, teenagers rebel by opening personal rooms where they can form telepathy bonds and kill themselves.

            You're right that a lot of people would be highly skeptical of one or another of the toys during the early time the story takes place. I'll bring up the idea with the rest of the writers.

      > But if people are willing they can just die

      And how can they find this out if the governments are the first one to reach the workshop and limit the information outbreak/access as much as possible? From what you are saying, people need to be in the room at least once before any of the abilities are accessible.
      ```

      - u/forrestib:
        ```
        Well unless every government worldwide manages 100% containment, some dead people are going to leak out and be able to tell the news and internet. So they delay people gaining the information by a matter of days, maybe weeks at most. More propaganda-heavy states that regulate internet access like China maybe a little longer, but people in those places may also be more desperate and less skeptical when they hear the news.
        ```

  ```
  So let’s say person A really hates personal B.  They hire Person C to commission parts fabrication for a taser (or even the taser themselves). Person A then tases the shit out of person B and then abducts them for a week of bonding time (aka torture) before sending them back to the respawn chamber with a fractured psyche. 

  Also time diliation and viruses make a dozen new super bugs that spread through the population. 

  New earths are used by cult leaders to brainwash and control their flock in isolation without consequences.  As a symbol of their faith they have to go alter their biology to be more trusting. 

  Also there doesn’t seem to be any challenges left in this society, everything is provided for them, and it’s rxplicity stated that they will never be able to compete in technology with this othe race.  I think people would los anything resembling humanity without significant brain modifications to the motivation centers.
  ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    At least one and probably several of those New Earths are going to be populated by people who are afraid of exactly those consequences. They're going to select people who _don't_ alter their biology.

    And people are going to dismiss them as cults.

  Use the fabricator to create a fabricator that does the same things as the original just without the limitations. If that isn't possible, create a seed that grows into a fabricator. If that isn't possible, create a document that details the steps needed to create a fabricator. If that isn't possible, modify yourself to have a fabricator built into your body. If that isn't possible, modify yourself to have knowledge of the theory behind this technology, and develop fabricators from there. If that isn't possible, just create tools that let you analyse technology and study the workshop. There are probably many more ways, point is to use the technology provided to be able to create more of it. In a location more convenient for you and without the pesky limitations.

  Then create versions of the respawn-platform and the telepathy without limitations, and from there move on to more advanced technologies. You'll want to make yourself basically immortal more so than the technology does. See below for some of the things to guard yourself against. You'll also want to make yourself a lot smarter, which is tricky because it can change what you want on a very basic level. You'll need to be careful. Ask the machine for documents with a proper theory of Friendliness (the AI safety version, not human social friendliness) and then make sure you adhere to that while modifying yourself. Also make sure your modified machines adhere to that - it's a much more sensible restriction than the original ones. Heck, it might be a good idea to hack all the workshops and change the restrictions there too. And while you're at it, modify all humans to adhere to basic Friendliness as well (though it is possible that your theory of Friendliness won't let you do that, depending on the details. In that case, you can do this first, before changing yourself. It does modify everybody against their will, but it makes the world safe. And with quite dangerous technology suddenly introduced that is essential).

  But first, how can you get something that allows you to harm somebody (such as a fabricator without limitations) without wanting to harm somebody? Simple, you don't think through what you'll want to use that thing for. It's just intent based, not whether the item is dangerous (because everything is technically dangerous with enough creativity).

  And finally, what threats are there to you? (aka how to take out somebody protected by the technology mentioned above with the technology mentioned above) The first thing to note is that killing them is counter productive. The machine will just fix that. So you need to stop just short of killing them. As long as they don't die, they won't respawn. You'll need some technology to keep people alive - which the fabricators in the workshops should be happy to provide, since it helps people and you intend to heal people with them. If fact, you don't even need to hurt people - just keep them in stasis or constantly knocked out. Anything where they are still alive but unable to act will do. This would also allow governments or other large organisations to control the workshops. Keep people out, and drag away anybody who just respawned to suspend them like this.

  Other than this physical attack, there are mental and social options. If you manage to give somebody trauma, they will respawn with it. Make sure to create a self-sustaining network of mental problems, so that they don't want to fix these problems but rather want to retain or even expand them. How to do this? Well, let the fabricator give you detailed information about your target, detailed papers about trauma and its treatment, how to change somebody's mind, how to influence people... and then change your body to help with all that, emitting pheromones to be more convincing or something. I don't really know what would be useful, none of this is really my area of expertise. Which means that you could probably do a lot more than I've described here. For instance, I don't know how practically useful memetics can be, but in the extreme case you can just show them a specially prepared picture which implants whatever you want in this mind. Getting all of this could be a problem since you do intend to harm somebody - but there are ways around that. From the description, it seems to work on current intent. So just convince yourself to not want to harm them while you get the stuff. If that isn't enough, get the pod to change you into a version of yourself that doesn't want to harm them - having previously left notes to yourself about what you want to do and why. You may need a couple more layers of self-deception, but at some point you should be able to fool the workshop.

  Alright, so how to defend against all of this? Well, have a version of yourself as a backup, and let the backup check your state of mind every hour or so. If the backup is okay with your state of mind, keep going. Otherwise reset. This works against somebody changing your mind, through memetics or otherwise. Give your mind an option to transport yourself to a safe location. The extreme version being to kill yourself and respawn, if you can't figure something else out. Then you should have a deadmind switch - if your mind does not respond for a certain period of time, trigger the transport to a safe location. That covers people keeping you unconscious. Oh, and basics like making sure your body is stronger, faster, regenerates, more resilient, and can change at will.

  That should cover the basics for how to exploit things, I think?

  ```
  People living in personal rooms at maximum dilation and reproducing with each other could replicate beyond the number of particles in our observable universe in an objective day, which could for example clog up Earth Prime with tourists who don't exactly have space to turn back around once they step through the portal as the influx doubles every 3-4 minutes.
  ```

- u/sparr:
  ```
  I don't think you can cover a globe with points in a hexagonal lattice. At least some of the points will have fewer than six neighbors; between 3 and 5 depending on the basic shape of the meta-cells of your network.

  Maybe the 20 pentagonal workshops are special in some way?

  Sorry for lack of munchkinry, just trying to contribute a detail to the story.

- u/Ozimandius:
  ```
  Well, obviously there should be some abuse in regards to self-modification.  People will explore the limits of modifying their bodies and you will end up with quite a few 48 cubic meter monsters of various types with various abilities.  

  The amount of shenanigans that can be achieved by a 48 cubic meter sized brain working at 3millionX speed that has total control and access to each and every brain cell is pretty extreme.  

  There will be no unsolveable scientific problem, and anything that can be invented will be invented.  Cabals working with these room sized brains as masterminds can advance technology at a rate completely inconceivable to us, allowing them to create the technology and software to quickly bring us past the singularity and expand the thinking power beyond the capacities of even a bunch of 48 cubic meter brains.

  Edit: initial understanding of size of rooms were off.  redid math.
  ```

  - u/forrestib:
    ```
    The respawn chambers are only maybe double human-size, so you couldn't really make yourself into anything bigger than that. There are also a ton of safeties to ensure you're going to come out a functional creature with mobility, a digestive system, the whole shebang. And the brain can really only be deliberately changed to the extent that it'll let you control whatever body it's giving you. And it's all biological, there's no magic powers or anything.

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  Space travel is going to become easier and more pointless. Sure, you can use perfect tooling to create flawless rockets made from impossible materials. You can probably even fabricate a skyhook. But why bother, with a million million New Earths one step away?
  ```

  - u/forrestib:
    ```
    Most people who get into the space business don't do it for the mining or colonization itself. They do it for the scientific discoveries that await from finding and observing new things that don't even exist on earth. And those million million new earths are all very similar, duplicates off a few mundane templates. There's nothing to explore, there. No discoveries to be made.
