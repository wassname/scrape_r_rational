  This is a "Friendship is Optimal" recursive fanfic, but you needn't have a familiarity with FiO, My Little Pony, or really anything.

  It's a story that deals with transhumanism in an interesting way. It's very short (11,000 words) and raises some interesting thoughts.

    I really dislike optimal-verse stories... once the forced uploads start happening, its just a horror story. but a lot of the fanboy authors dont really grock that and tend to write it like having your body killed as your brain was uploaded by an AI that would edit your mind in the process was a GOOD thing. 

    mostly i get annoyed at how much potential the setting idea has, when they inevitably squander all of that for a subpar singularity that destroys the world.

      The outcome you mention is suboptimal according to my utility function, yet acceptable and even good compared to many of the likely outcomes of SAI.

      Edit: also, that horror is the *point*. It's intentional, and expanded upon when the AI finds aliens. Some are human enough, others aren't. Some are uploaded, and others have their bodies torn apart for raw material.

      Did you read it, out of curiosity? It's by the legendary Chatoyance; it's an interesting and kind of leans into the horror. 

      She also wrote one called Implacable (which I'll post a link to in a week or so just to give some buffer between discussion of FiO stories) which is even more horrifying.

    I've read this before, a very chilling story indeed. What other post-cryostasis stories do you know of? (I know of just one other, called *We Are Legion (We Are Bob)*.)

    Does "recursive" mean "fanfic of fanfic", or does it mean "turtles all the way down man"?
    ```

  I find it hard to immerse in post-singularity FiO stories, since at that point *everything* is theatre. 

  The protagonist (xor one other person in the room) is the only authentic born human. Everybody else is a zombie or artificial person that was created solely to manipulate the human towards making whatever choice will maximise CelestAI's utility function.

  It's hard to care about emotions that have been so carefully engineered (if they exist at all).
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:

    Honestly I found that really compelling: the white supremacist guy was (IMO) clearly a construct made to make the threat of death/deletion seem credible, and the little girl was a construct to indicate the opposite. The rest of the people could go either way. It's the sort of thing you don't realise immediately but upon reflection you realise it, and it makes you appreciate how, as you put it, "everything is theatre".
    ```

      It also has no stakes.  You don't really get deleted in this scenario, merely a few adjustments are made - possibly making you smarter or more rational in the process - so that you would have said yes.  99 percent of whatever fraction of you survived cryo is left.  

      You could think of this process as an integration test, one of many, performed by Celestia in the process of repairing heavily damaged cryo patients.
      ```

- u/I_Probably_Think:
  ```
  It was a bit intrusive, but I enjoyed the direct encouragements the author offered to reflect on the nature of "one's self in the moment"; taking the setting's conceit and exploring it as an extreme metaphor is quite thought-provoking.

  Also wait this is from last year?
