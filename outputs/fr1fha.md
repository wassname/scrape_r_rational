  Ooooooooh fuck. I was not expecting that incredibly sharp look into Charlie's entire being, followed by Keerthi, the real protagonist, stumbling upon the horrifying truth. The simple moral tale of naughty children being punished, and good children being rewarded, but you pull the curtain back and think about exactly what themes that implicitly pushes, the worldview that each child *deserved* their misfortune. God, this story is a brilliant interrogation of the original story. The transition into the horror genre doesn't even feel unnatural.

      However he has been a little jerk in large part because of what has been happening to him, perhaps the world is fair but in an arbitrary and self-fulfilling manner. Which is rather scary.

    Seconded.

  Oh no, it's my least favorite moral outlook, and someone gave it godlike powers.
  ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Ah, crap, just world reasoning?  'We can tell he is bad because he was punished, good because he was rewarded', that kind of thing?

  Leave the factory.  Leave the factory.  Leave the factory.

      Is there a way of doing that? Unless Urkeldelphia is evidence of other of major super-scientists, Wonkaland might be a hyperpower alone. Having bubblegum brain backups and milk chocolate clones would be the simplest of possibilities, not counting that the factory itself might be the size of Britain/The US in volume.

      On the other hand, Wonkaland is the exact sort of place to have a self-destruct button. Bucket is that exact level of mad.
      ```

      - u/gryfft:
        ```
        I don't know, if you're going to run a place like Wonkaland a self-destruct strikes me as a *sensible precaution,* so I have no faith that one exists.
        ```

  >Mint reminds people of tasty dinners!

  Didn't get it until my second reading, oh my goodness. 

  Lim was razor-sharp this chapter. He is truly well-conveyed.
  ```

    ```
    I've stared at that for a while and can't see it, what's the joke?

      >An average meal in the Bucket household during Charlie's childhood consisted of cabbage, grass, and expired toothpaste.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        You know it occurs to me that given his background Bucket might not actually know what most people eat. There's either cabbage soup and expired toothpaste, or chocolate. He might not even know what to do with a potato.
        ```

        - u/GeeJo:
          ```
          You put it in the Potato Room, obviously. That was laid out this chapter.
          ```

          - u/IICVX:
            ```
            aka the pantry in his childhood home, which rarely contained a single potato in pride of place.
            ```

        ```
        Ah! Thanks
        ```

- u/DeepTundra:
  ```
  I told you all that Wonkaland might as well be a hell dimension, and apparently I was right. This chapter was even more chilling that Chili’s exit. 

  Ha.
  ```

- u/immortal_lurker:

  This story is a very pleasant blend of the utterly bizarre and the emotionally real.

  I think the story is going to shift here. Previously, it was a group of people on a tour, and they were sort of competing to win the factory. The kids were playing against eachother, and Charlie was the judge. 

  Now, the kids are on the same side, and they are trying to get out of this before they get killed. Winning would be a nice bonus. And a nice temptation...

  So, I think Tide, Keerthi, Lim, and Mahhuaki work together to keep each other safe, with Charlie growing increasingly frustrated, because this is a game with one winner, and these naughty children refuse to die. At the end, Lim sees an opportunity to betray the group and win the factory, but I don't know if he takes it or not.

    This would be a fun game to make

  Wow, how does each chapter keep surpassing the high standard of the chapters before it?

  Only now have I made a connection between this version of Charlie/Wonka and The Warden of Superjail, a tv show that I never watched but was morbidly curious enough about to read the Wikipedia article for. Basically he's a Wonka-inspired reality-bending magic user that punishes/tortures/kills the inmates of the eponymous Superjail. Am I associating things that aren't really that similar, or do you think that was an influence? Or is there a wider trope that Superjail was also pulling from of a whimsical, colorful, eccentric, super-powerful being which is either alternately or simultaneously very cruel and very cheery?

  Small typo that technically isn't incorrect: I'm betting the store which Charlie purchased the chocolate bar from was indeed not moving (at least relative to the rest of England or the United States), but if it sold paper products, it would be a station**e**ry store rather than station**a**ry. Though I'm not sure why a paper store also sells chocolate? Unless that's just an oddity of the original book that I don't remember/was overwritten in my memories with the scenes from the films where Charlie buys the bar from a candy store.
  ```

  - u/thefran:
    ```
    There's no shortage of zany but (borderline?) insane business-owners in real life and in fiction, but Warden is definitely a direct Wonka parody, purple clothes and all.
    ```

  - u/Roneitis:
    ```
    Nah, all sorts of paper goods stores have a candy rack. I always assumed it was just the nearest place that Charlie could get food when he found the money.
    ```

  - u/general_enthusiast:
    ```
    It depends on the focus of the store: in my experience a lot of stores which mainly do stationery also have other sections (e.g. newspapers, birthday cards and sweets), such as WH Smith in the UK.
    ```

- u/JesradSeraph:
  ```
  Dayym that’s some dark, dark chocolate.

  Definitely a better sequel than Snowpiercer.
  ```

  - u/josephwdye:
    ```
    For a good time watch this https://youtu.be/jEX52h1TvuA
    ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  Reminded me of this exchange from HPMOR:

  > “Hm?” McGonagall said, sounding a bit surprised; perhaps she hadn’t expected that question either. “That was Professor Quirrell. He’ll be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts this year at Hogwarts.”

  > “I had the strangest feeling that I knew him…” Harry rubbed his forehead. “And that I shouldn’t ought to shake his hand.” Like meeting someone who had been a friend, once, before something went drastically wrong… that wasn’t really it at all, but Harry couldn’t find words. 

  It almost doesn't make Charlie seem like a moral actor at all anymore, to see him this completely broken of humanity.
  ```

- u/tjhance:
  ```
  this was a fantastic chapter
  ```

- u/MilesSand:
  ```
  The world is fair. Good people get rewarded, bad people get punished. 

  This implies those who get punished were bad, those who get rewarded were good. 

  Which in turn implies, the one who deals out punishments is the absolute moral authority. 

  In other words, might makes right. 

  Bud also, to win the factory one must defeat Charlie, and become the new absolute authority. 

  It's a vicious cycle.
  ```

  - u/MultipartiteMind:
    ```
    That though is the absolute moral authority in Charlie's mind--they don't have to be the absolute moral authority in their own mind, even if the wresting-through-power is similar.  You might though be able to trick him, in that if it feels the world is fair, then whatever the outcome of any (unequal) challenge the outcome will be fair and so appropriate to follow it?  Of course, there's that difference between what you actually believe and what you just believe you believe...
    ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      I think in practice they have to knock him down a peg before he can knock them down first,  and successfully evade his retaliation in order to survive, at the bare minimum
      ```
