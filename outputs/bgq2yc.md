  The last few chapters have been amazing, but if the goat dies I might have to take a break from the series.
  ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    there was a goat in this chapter?, the only animal i read about was a glorious white steed of equine origins.
    ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    She could make it Zombie the 4th
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Fifth. Zombie the fourth got her chest caved in by an unknown hoofed assailant.
      ```

      - u/dyxsst:
        ```
        I believe the fifth was created after the poor 4th's demise, so as not to boon the 3rd with being used after commiting murder. Remurder? Something.

        So, Zombie the sixth!
        ```

        - u/JulianWyvern:
          ```
          Next one is the Fifth. Zombie the First and Second were both normal horses, Third was the pegasus, Fourth was one Cat acquired in the Underdark. When she returned, Third destroyed Fourth, and Third's been the current Zombie. Understandable, as it does have wings
          ```

          - u/dyxsst:
            ```
            Didn't Cat turn a helikean horse to a zombie too, after 3rd killed 4th?
            ```

            - u/panchoadrenalina:
              ```
              the helikean horse was still alive
              ```

              - u/Trezzie:
                ```
                Still called Zombie the Fifth if I recall correctly.
                ```

              - u/dyxsst:
                ```
                Ooooh OK my bad
                ```

  ```
  >“This is humorous, for you imply romantic feeling when in truth referencing grievous bodily harm,” Andronike said, tone smug. “I have mastered your ways, shade.”

  the best
  ```

  - u/Frankenlich:
    ```
    Andronike is best goddess.
    ```

- u/sparkc:
  ```
  Reminder that Prince Arnaud acts as a loud mouthed buffoon but when the Pilgrim put on his choir glasses and looked at Prince Arnaud he saw naught but cold emptiness and when Catherine was using her Winter senses she noted the man as a perfect actor who's heartbeat remained steady while he was outwardly raving and ranting. (I would find citations but afaik there is no easy way to search the entire work of PGtE). 

  There's clearly more to the man than you would guess (it's been suggested that he is the Assassin though i'm not sure you could justify him remaining in the role of Prince Arnaud for so long) and this seems like a moment when such a reveal may occur.
  ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    IMO he's just a sociopath, one of those hardcases that is both incapable of emotional attachment and very intelligent.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      I hope that's all he is.

      Because it sure would be scary if the Dead King made a new kind of Undead that for all intents and purposes looked alive.  Necromantically programmed to appear to breathe, its heart beat at a steady rate, etc.  Because it would functionally look no different than this.

      Unless you tried to use healing or anti-Undead magic on it, or it received a grievous wound and just kept going, you wouldn't really know until it was too late...
      ```

      - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
        ```
        Oh shit, spooky as fuck.

        Also hes not just a necromancer, hes the most powerful sorceror on the continent. He could have just vacuumed out the real Arnaud's brain and implanted a magic relay/control system, or something.
        ```

- u/BaggyOz:
  ```
  Given what Cat said, I'm guessing Hierophant has really lost it in Arcadia. What if Cat gets Black back by convincing the heroes that after loss of his fathers Amadeus, his last remaining father figure, is the only one who can talk him down.
  ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    I'm still not convinced its Hierophant, IMO it sounds more like it's the Dead King.
    ```

  - u/Schuano:
    ```
    That's smart... but it sort of relies on them accepting her explanation that Heirophant is the one messing up Arcadia.  Pilgrim and the Tyrant know that... but the rest of the army does not,
    ```

    - u/BaggyOz:
      ```
      Black's soul, Arcadia and all that really seems like it's the domain of Named not the normal people running things. Most of the heros would be able to pick up the narrative thread that's there.
      ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    Well, Tyrant mentions that it's more than just her 'old friend' there.

    I bet good odds that Archer is there already.  Her last 'mission' via Cat was to go find Masego and bring him back.  If Tyrant isn't referring to her (instead, maybe the Hierarch), then she could show up at the wrong moment to ruin his plan.
    ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  We've got three heroes facing off against the Tyrant, and that's two short of the customary five. You'd expect Pilgrim to be more prepared than that.

  It's a shame that Cat is going to turn this whole encounter sideways, but I'd be interested in how a villain of the old type like Tyrant would deal with heroes on the level of Pilgrim and Saint (how strong is the Rogue Sorcerer?). Cat has been concocting literal plot armor in order to deal with these two, but that's not a route that's available to Tyrant.

  Anyway, all the crowns have been gathered, seven Proceran Princes and the Queen of Callow, so the stage is set for the Prince's Graveyard. The question now is whether or not that "graveyard" part is meant literally, and which of the powers (Cat most likely) will collect them and for what purpose. Actually, all seven Proceran are currently being hanged (by their feet), so in a sense most of the work is already done.
  ```

  - u/calmingRespirator:
    ```
    Depends how you want to count it I think. Could be 3 heroes (Pilgrim, Saint and Sorcerer) against 3 villains (Tyrant, Cat and Hakram). Or could be 5 heroes (the heroes, Cat and Hakram) against the Tyrant. Or could be the expected 1 vs 2 vs 3.  

    I reckon who is against who will be a malleable thing that Cat uses to her advantage. And I look forwards to seeing that play out.
    ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    Pilgrim just blew his load making a *False Dawn*, and probably scrambled just to get the Sorcerer and Saint of Swords to him in time to go after Tyrant.
    ```

  - u/TristanTheViking:
    ```
    Tyrant is comic relief, he'll have an escape plan ready that'll get him free while he shakes his fist back at the heroes, swearing to get them next time. Probably riding a gargoyle away into the sunset. The heroes are too involved in the rest of the story to bother with finishing off the Tyrant.
    ```

- u/windg0d:
  ```
  “It will be a mercy to put an end to you, lunatic,” the Saint of Swords said.

  “I bet you didn’t even make that one on purpose,” the Damned laughed.

  &#x200B;

  ....is there a goat pun somewhere in the saint's statement?
  ```

  - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
    ```
    Distraction, I think. Stab them while they're trying to figure out where the pun is.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Moon pun.
    ```

  - u/dyxsst:
    ```
    I've reread everything 4 times and still don't get not only the goat pun, but any pun.
    ```

    - u/zombieking26:
      ```
      A kid is a baby goat, which is why "just kidding" is a pun, albeit a terrible one
      ```

- u/NZPIEFACE:
  ```
  Instead of both winning, or both losing, she decided to have a situation where all three get totally fucked unless they come to a proper agreement.

  Amazing.
  ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    Looking back, this is about the only way she could pull it off.  As long as each was looking out for its own interests and plans, they'd always disagree and bicker.

    Point out that they've got an hour to do whatever before *they all die horribly and are raised as Undead*, however, tends to make them drop all the unimportant crap.
    ```

- u/Menolith:
  ```
  How did everyone get around in Arcadia, again? When Cat poked her head in with the full force of the Sisters giving her cover, she still got chewed and spat out by the dust storm.

  Is it a really localized/variable environment so that everyone else can traipse about if they're lucky enough?
  ```

  - u/Gr_Cheese:
    ```
    We've seen into Arcadia 3x recently: 1) Cat dive-bombing its Fae denizens on her way to block the cavalry charge into the Army of Callow remnants led by Juniper, 2) Cat attempting to open a gate to have the Army of Callow retreat through and being brimstone'd, and 3) Adjutant travelling through the empty space to deliver Cat's message to the Tyrant.

    So the brimstone problem seems to be localized to an area randomly aligned with Creation. Is that logical? Who knows. But it is what's happened.
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      I suppose there's narrative weight behind an impassable gate opening to corner Catherine's army into a confrontation with the good guys when everything was coming to a point.
      ```
