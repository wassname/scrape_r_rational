## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Are there any other crossover fans of r/rational and r/HFY? 

  HFY "Humanity Fuck Yeah" is short science fiction (mostly) focusing on humans as a species kicking ass (generally alien). It's and when you're down like a warm mug of coffee on a cold autumn morning.

    I like HFY content in general, but I think HFY the subreddit has a disappointingly repepetive take on it. Their near-exclusive focus on sci-fi leaves them writing "human" factions that are basically just aliens themselves, what with the implausible technology. Meanwhile, their aliens are nowhere near properly alien enough.

    In my opinion, an HFY story is at its best when:

    - Its human(s) are from the modern age or before, and have corresponding capabilities. No sci-fi.  
    - In a story set in an original sci-fi universe, to the extent that humans are special, it should be because humans are weird even compared to most of earths' species (bipedal? endurance hunting? domesticators? what?) or because *all* of earth's life is weird for well justified reason (and not just the cliche "most sapients are herbivores") like "planets in the outer rim of the galaxy receive less cosmic radiation, so life forms evolved there tend to have weird characteristics."  
    - In a story set in a derivative universe, the specific aim of the story should be to lampoon the misanthropic nature of the author(s) the universe is derived from, or at least the misanthropic way people interpret the original work. For example, there are a few truly excellent HFY stories in the My Little Pony fanfiction community because they're recursively derivative works of the incredibly misanthropic "conversion bureau" sub-universe.

    You'll notice I've avoided mentioning original fantasy universes. This is due to their incredible rarity-- for whatever reason, HFY writers much prefer to create original nonhumans for space opera settings, rather than fantasy settings. The one exception I know of, [Retreat, hell!](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/bfrj07/retreat_hell/) is notably better than most of the stuff on /r/HFY.

      My problem with HFY is that almost no one is able to think of a take on the concept that isn't "Aliens are all mind bogglingly incompetent". I much MUCH prefer stories where humanity is less overwhelmingly badass but the aliens are believably capable themselves. It's actually kind of insulting when the authors are basically saying "Humans only kick ass if the rest of universe has trouble stringing two sentences together".

      This comment reminds me of some web fiction, democratically written if I recall (popular original story line and lots of people contributed their own stories, so fan fiction I guess).

      It was where humans were exceptionally strong and violent compared to the rest of the galaxy and a normal human could just kick alien special forces ass. Turns out Earth is a particularly harsh environment compared to all the other planets intelligent life developed on. 

      Now, of course, I can't remember the title or find it anywhere. I'd love to find it again.

        I mean, you just described about half the stories on HFY. They have a whole bunch of stories based on the concept that earth is a "deathworld", and humans are correspondingly physically capable. At this point, it's kind of played out and boring in my opinion, just because it's been done so often.  

        But, if you are interested in those kind of stories, you should probably check out the sub.

        -edit- just realized you are the one who posted the top level comment, so are probably familiar with the hfy sub. Carry on.

        That might've been the [Deathworlders](https://deathworlders.com/) universe by Hambone. Early on he accepted any popular fan works that received more than 100(?) upvotes into his own canon. Not sure if he still does that. Several of the most popular characters originate from other writers, not to mention he only started writing it again a few years after posting the original chapters on 4chan, when someone picked up the story and massively expanded the universe. A reading order can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/essential_reading_order). It's a humongous serial, I think the main story approaches Worm in terms of wordcount, and the necessary side stories add as much again.

          Yes! I remember reading a few chapters years ago, then getting lost in the spinoffs vs original author and losing track. Today I learn it's ongoing and a foundation of r/HFY. Cool and thanks.

      Ah, that was some good roflstomping.

    ```
    [Post-Human](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human/) was fairly decent. It's about an AI with human memories who lives in an asteroid and fights against genocidal aliens.

  Hey everyone - sent this to the mods last week, got permission to post it in general - tl;dr looking for a post/comment chain concerning rational Avatar:TLA fiction where each nation represents a different focus/area of rationality.

  I believe it was held in this subreddit several years back, sometime most likely between the years of 2013-2017. It involved a group of people discussing a rationalist take on avatar: The Last Airbender, and specifically that each of the four nations in the series would focus on either a method or process in rational thinking (ex Fire Nation on instrumental rationality, air Nomads on value-based rationality) or perhaps on philosophical/economic beliefs (Water Nation are utilitarians, etc), and the main character Aang would travel to each nation learning these techniques to become fully developed.

  I've tried extensively searching through Google, the reddit search bar, etc, but cannot find the discussion, and don't seem to have had it saved anywhere.

  Was wondering if anybody recalls this conversation, knows where to find it, or the people who might have been involved? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

    I recall the conversation, but not enough that I'm having any luck with a Google search. [This is the closest one,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/23c5d2/bst_im_working_on_an_avatar_the_last_airbender/) but I don't *think* that's it.
    ```

      Hey, thanks for replying!

      Well, I'm glad to hear I haven't hallucinated anything and that I'm searching in the right place. And yeah, I found that thread as well, but it wasn't it. Thanks for the effort, though.

      For context, and now fully assuming no one has taken up that project, I thought I would either write an Avatar storyline surrounding it or invent something wholly independent using 6 elements instead, as a form of the history and different topics in rationality. It had a lot of great information and context to it.
