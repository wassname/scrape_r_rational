## Review- Animorphs: The Reckoning

### Post:

On Monday, I read the first chapter of 
*Animorphs: The Reckoning* by u/TK17Studios. I have just finished the current chapter and I have several thoughts, which I’d like to set down in words.

***

If you can’t tell from the fact that I just read several hundred thousand words in less than 4 days, I like this.
Let me elaborate. What exactly do I like about it?


1. It's good, *readable* writing. The fundamental English spelling/grammar/syntax is all there 100%. Beyond that, the quality of the prose is actually good, beyond most fanfiction and amateur writing, in a way that keeps you interested while reading. You might have the best worldbuilding in the, er, world, but if your sentences don't get much more exciting than 'Name1 was an adjective1 and adjective2 person. He came down the stairs now, holding an item1 in front of him adverbly,' I'm not going to be very invested in your work (sorry, *Mother of Learning* fans).


2. Its characters are intelligent. *Really* intelligent. All the Animorphs  think much, much better than me, and probably you as well, which means reading this will hopefully make something rub off on you. Visser Three is bar none, the smartest antagonist I've seen put on paper, smarter even than 
*HPMoR's* Voldemort. If you liked the desperate scenes of Harry trying to analyze, outwit, and outmaneuver his foes in real time, this story is like that, but *all the time*.

3. It's a page-turner. The previous two points combine to make a hell of a gripping story, which you just can't put down. There are serious ethical and philosophical debates that are brought up in the course of the narrative which, in a lesser story might be the crux or central thesis of the whole work, but here get thrown on an ever-growing pile to be dealt with later, after the alien invasion threat is handled. It's setting is epic, in the literal sense of the word. Its scale is grand, the stakes start raised and only get higher from there. 



4. It's a good standalone work that also rewards canon knowledge. Unfortunately, having already read the original Animorphs, I cannot give a fair view, but from what I can tell a reader will benefit from but not require previous exposure to the source material. As with the best alternate universe fanfiction, canon knowledge is reserved for Easter Eggs and in-jokes non-vital to the main plot. Unlike HPMoR, which was criticized, not unfairly, for being rather mean to the source canon at times, There's none of that going on here, if only because the characters are too busy trying to win a galactic war to make jokes about original canon. Along those lines, the deviations from canon make sense, so that when you read about them your mind goes *ah, I guess it* would *be that way in real life*. Just one example: Andalites have a base 7 system because their hands have 7 digits, and their thoughts reflect that, with 7, 49, and 7^7 being used where a human might use 10, 50, or a million. There a lots of little things like this that just make sense, and they're always a joy to read, whether or not you're familiar with the original.

***

So if all this is true, and I think that *The Reckoning* is one of the greatest works of literature of our time, then why isn't it already on the New York Times' bestsellers list? 

1. It's not for everyone. Between the the events and themes covered, not to mention the language, this work is easily M for Mature audiences only (which is not remotely the same thing as adults only; there are plenty of mature pre-teens and immature adults). Thankfully, the dense and heavy nature of the prose helpfully self-censor the work; only those mature enough to handle the themes are mature enough to understand the text in the first place.

2. It's fanfiction. Most fanfiction is crap. Ergo, your prior on this particular piece of work being crap is very high. The main goal of writing this is to change this assumption. 

3. It's *Animorphs* fanfiction, which, while possessing a cult following, is nobody's *Harry Potter*. This is unfortunate, because as outlined above, you don't really need to be familiar with the source to enjoy this, and because the *Animorphs* universe is an excellent setting for *HPMoR's* rational-izing. This is exemplary two-alien-races-fight-over-a-magical-cube-on-an-unsuspecting-Earth genre, which is bigger than you might expect. This is what *Transformers* could have been, if they had fought with their brains instead of their guns.

4. It has some legitimate (but ultimately really minor) style issues, which I'll discuss in more detail in the comments.

***
TL;DR- On par with HPMoR, exceeds it in some aspects. The following is a list of my favorite related works, which should be interpreted as: You will probably enjoy Reckoning if you liked these works/Reckoning fans will probably enjoy these works: 

HPMoR by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Unsong by Scott Alexander

Ra by qntm

SCP Antimemetics Division by qntm

Worm by wildbow

  Great review, including the suggestions in the comment :) 

  >This is exemplary two-alien-races-fight-over-a-magical-cube-on-an-unsuspecting-Earth genre, which is bigger than you might expect. This is what Transformers could have been, if they had fought with their brains instead of their guns.

  Seriously, if the whole "Slug-aliens taking over bodies + alien tech that lets you change into other animals" thing wasn't so identifiable, I would say this could very easily just be published as its own series without being slapped by a lawsuit, and should be. I loved the original Animorphs but, like HPMOR, Reckoning takes everything good about it and elevates it to a whole new level to such a degree that my anger over copyright law gets stoked every time I think about it.

  That the Transformers brand has been used to greenlight half a dozen shitty movies, not to mention the FTL-starshipwreck that is the Disney Star Wars trilogy, while this fanfic will (probably) never have any, is an absurd failure mode of our society.

  WARNING: MILD SPOILERS

  First of all, don't get me wrong here, these are just minor quibbles, really. Some of it is subjective suggestion, but some I really think would take the quality of the whole thing up another notch.

  Much like with Worm, which this work is explicitly influenced by, my main gripes with it are editing issues. This is already a very *dense* work, which asks a reader to keep a lot in mind at all times. The editor has the difficult job of making it so that stylistic choices highlight rather than distract from the key points the text is trying to make. I AM aware that criticisms like these are meant for the final pdf/printed version of the work, as opposed to WIP updates on fanfiction.net or ao3, but I can’t help but think of it as something that’s eventually going to sit on my shelf one day and so bring up now. Besides, the best time to do something about the final version of the story is now, before it’s actually finished.

  For example, Andalites can carry out three or four simultaneous trains of thought, currently represented by varying degrees of nested parentheses. Unfortunately, humans can only tell the difference between (((three))) and ((((four)))) nested parentheses with effort, which is a precious resource that should not be wasted on counting parentheses. I think later chapters do in fact take this into account, and use other stylistic choices such as *italics* and <angle brackets> but as italics and especially the angle brackets are already being used for other purposes, it might be better to show the different trains of thought via different fonts or text colors.

  Speaking of different fonts, when making the final publishable edition, it might be worth looking into (just a suggestion, mind) making all the POVs have distinct fonts/colors. A large theme of the work is how different minds see the world in different ways. If the work was edited such that Cassie’s thoughts were in Helvetica, and and Rachel’s in Arial, long thought-speak conversations would be much easier to follow. Garrett’s not the only one with cause to complain about long identical lines of dialogue with no easily distinguishable features.

  A particularly egregious example, when it feels like the book is making it *difficult on purpose*, is with the numbers, which are often spelled out in full. For example, the Chee are given names like six-three-four-eight-one, when 63481 would do just fine and is easier to recognise. Another  example, where the POV character is multiplying in their head:

  >Thirty-two.

  >Sixty-four.

  >One-twenty-eight.

  >Two-fifty-six.

  >Five hundred twelve.

  >One thousand twenty-four.

  >Two thousand forty-eight.

  >Four thousand ninety-six.

  >Eight thousand one hundred ninety-two.

  >Sixteen thousand three hundred eighty four.

  >Thirty two thousand six hundred—seven?—seven hundred and—

  I get that you’re trying to convey stream-of-consciousness and the effort of calculation here, *but there is a reason why the convention is to write numbers greater than 20 with digits*. For example, 

  >32

  >64

  >128

  >256

  >512

  >1,024

  >2,048

  >4,096

  >8,192

  >16,384

  >32,6- 7?- 32,7-

  gets the point across a lot faster and a lot more efficiently.

  Later on, there are sub-chapter headings like —34359738368— and —134217728—. 
  These numbers are important and plot-relevant and should therefore be made easier to comprehend, even if it’s just putting down commas (like -34,359,738,368- and 134,217,728-), or, even better, 2^35 and 2^27, or, best of all- 2^35 : 34,359,738,368 and 2^27 : 134,217,728. The way it is currently, I couldn't even tell that they had different numbers of digits, let alone recognise when one number showed up later.

  When you see long numbers like that in books, they put the reader’s mind in a certain mood, the one that you get when you are reading a technical document (eg. SCP database entries). It’s like a director showing an important, plot-relevant headline in small green matrix code rain letters on a blurry screen in the background, instead of a lingering, well lit closeup of a newspaper. If not highlighted properly, these things will become part of the background.


  That’s the general principle, but I have one final concrete suggestion on the Garrett chapters, whose CAPITAL LETTERS help highlight IMPORTANT CONCEPTS and which I think in general are a GREAT IDEA but can be IMPROVED UPON. How? I’ve seen the idea of highlighting important nouns and phrases once before. If- no, *when* a finalized, cleaned up, edition of this work shows up, I would kill to have Garrett’s chapters done up [like this](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sAaEmq-wZGY/W0B3uO_XsmI/AAAAAAAAbZI/fnRdcnFcFsA7mjP3_I1KwWmM4kM-OL6VgCEwYBhgL/s1600/9780545227728_alt1.gif) because I don’t think I’m gonna see phrases like FREAKING RIGHT THE FUCK OUT in the original Geronimo Stilton books anytime soon.

    I agree (and if /u/tk17studios feels similarly but, understandably, doesn't want to get into that kind of intensive-but-boring overhaul, I'd be willing to make all the necessary HTML edits and pretty it up for AO3)

  - u/nytelios:

    I disagree; none of these cosmetic gripes detracted from my reading experience. Rather I liked all of these stylistic/semiotics/typesetting choices as workarounds or implementations of in-story concepts and voices, especially given considerations like limits and uniformity of formatting across fanfiction platforms (AO3/FF).

    Specific counterarguments:

    1. Any nested parentheses (>2) only occur sequentially, so I don't feel like it takes any more effort to distinguish.

    2. The number convention mainly applies to academic/technical writing. Prose has exceptions and only consistency really matters. I think you've made the case for why those numbers are written out. Digit-form would have a different effect (albeit easier to process).

    3. I don't think a print edition is likely coming out. Anyway the caps have the desired effect, given formatting limitations. Also I read the story via EPUB/MOBI and I don't think fancy markup shows up after the conversion process.
    ```

    - u/Quibbloboy:
      ```
      I agree with you completely. Stylistic things are very subjective, and subjectively, I like all the things OP dislikes, especially when it comes to the *difficulty* of this story.

      I can't think of another piece of fiction that's challenged me like The Reckoning. And I know this might sound silly, but I *really enjoy* when this story throws in an element that's so confusing it's almost incomprehensible. It's like I get to solve a puzzle before moving on with the text. Even stuff like not identifying who's talking in thought-speak, I have *fun* figuring out who said what based on who it sounds like.

      I will lavish praise upon this story until the day I die. I agree 100% with all the compliments OP gave it, and my criticisms are almost infinitesimal. I also don't want the author second-guessing himself and compromising his established, rock-solid, nearly perfect (subjectively, to me) style of storytelling because of reader criticism.

      I do actually plan to make a print edition at least for myself, and I have vague dreams of something like "hey, such-and-such printer has all the files available, I've set it up so that if you send them $X0 they will print you up a copy."  I've got seven book covers *almost* done except that each of two excellent artists has gotten busy before being able to finish alien renders.

    I'm not someone who'll slow down while reading. Instead of puzzling things out, I'll just move ahead at my accustomed reading speed having only fuzzy comprehension. I believe many people are like that.

  Nice, this fic deserves deep review

  1. It's good, *readable* writing. The fundamental English spelling/grammar/syntax is all there 100%. Beyond that, the quality of the prose is actually good

  Absolutely. This is perhaps the biggest mechanical flaw of HPMoR and as you say, much of fanfiction. Yet the strength of fanfiction is a venue for voices that lack fundamental cogency yet have specific qualities or developmental backgrounds that make them unique. Yudkowsy's essaying certainly reverberated through Methods even as he never quite found himself adept at prosework, and we see in Reckoning how TK17 Studios relentless analysis of Magic: The Gathering metagaming seen from his Reddit history has paid off in the depth of modeling modeling people modeling people modeling the models of the others.

  >It's *Animorphs* fanfiction, which, while possessing a cult following, is nobody's *Harry Potter*. This is unfortunate, because as outlined above, you don't really need to be familiar with the source to enjoy this, and because the *Animorphs* universe is an excellent setting for *HPMoR's* rational-izing.

  That tension is so fascinating at the idea of taking disparate fanfics and bundling them into a "rationalist" genre. If you don't have any connection to Willy Wonka and missed GazeMaize's Chili and the Chocolate Factory then are you going to appreciate the building intertext when I brush its influences into my Banjo-Kazooie work?

  But Reckoning, as you identify, seems like it would be very good presented as an introductory telling of the story in a way you could never say about Methods that's down to both the congruency with the themes of the source material and TK17's skill as a writer. Perhaps when it's all over as part of his massive readjustment project that he will absolutely never finish he can think about making sure the intro works for uninitiated readers

  Hi, Brassica, I've been trying to come up with an appropriate response and sort of failing, so I'll just bluntly say THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME and also I'm really glad you (mostly) like it and this review and people's comments (including the constructively critical) have made my previous 24h a lot better.  <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
  ```

- u/--MCMC--:
  ```
  How far into it should one get before determining that it's not for them? I've given it a shot a few times, but have always dropped it after a couple chapters out of lack of connection to the plot / characters (having never read the original source material). Would you say it "picks up" at any point, or do the first chapters give a sufficient impression of the rest of the work?
  ```

  - u/Quibbloboy:
    ```
    I would say around chapter three or four is where it hits the ground running. In one you're reeling the whole time, and two is largely a reaction to the shock of one. In three they're juuust starting to think about working proactively, and in four the plot takes off.

    Fair warning, the characters are still *majorly* inexperienced around this point in the story. They make a lot of really dumb, avoidable mistakes as they find their footing and start to comprehend the magnitude of what they're up against. Don't let that put you off; they get much much smarter.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I'd say the story really picks up the first time they get into the yeerk pool. If you're not invested by the time they leave, you're not going to like the story.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I really got into it at the end of chapter 11/beginning of chapter 12 when they discovered >!a morph was a complete copy of the original without short-term memory, meaning it contains the original mind, with a mind-suppression system placed on top of it (so that the person in Z-space could control the construct body)!<.
    ```

- u/greenskye:
  ```
  Since you compared it to Worm, would you say the story is 'bleak' or 'grimdark'? I've never gotten into worm even though the plot sounds like something I'd enjoy because it's always been described as a dark and heavy story where there is little light to be found. My attempts to read it largely confirmed this impression.

  Frankly speaking I'm not in a good enough headspace right now to handle that kind of thing. 2020 isn't helping either.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's fairly dark.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Worm has lots of named character deaths, body horror, mind rape, and Umbridge-like institutional horror. The only trigger warnings it doesn't carry are for physical rape. Reckoning has elements of existential horror, but most of it is couched in the form of, "what even is a person anyway," rather than "it doesn't matter because they're all going to die and/or be brutally injured/tortured anyway."

    The world of Reckoning is far more hopeful than that of Worm. There is tons more cooperation between people of different backgrounds, social class, and cognitive structure. A major theme of the work is learning how to cooperate with people with entirely alien cognition. There are no characters who go about spreading horror for the sake of horror, and though the primary villain definitely fits all useful definitions of the word evil, it's only because of a Thanos-like obsession, rather than due to enjoying the pain of others.

    If you're concerned about events in the story being comparable to those in real life, I would say don't be. Though there's a superficial theme of infected vs. clean, the Yeerk infestation is an out-of-context problem, rather than a clearly avoidable tragedy. Leadership in this story tends to be competent and not corrupt, and politics is not a theme at all.

    Reckoning is definitely safer to read than Worm from the perspective of current event exacerbated mental health issues.
    ```

      ```
      Thank you for the very detailed breakdown. That helps a lot
      ```

    - u/EsquilaxM:
      ```
      Physical rape happens offscreen, though without struggle due to mindrape.

  ```

  I absolutely despise the Marco/Rachel pairing.
  ```

  - u/GrecklePrime:
    ```
    Any particular reason? Is it because of canon concerns or more stuff fanfic specific?
    ```

- u/Asviloka:
  ```
  I'm in the never-read-the-originals camp and can confirm that canon knowledge is 100% not required. I never felt confused or lost by any assumptions that I'd be already familiar with things.
