## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  [Here's the Waldo Wiki](http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Waldo_Wiki), which I should have known existed. The details are quite thin, as one might expect, but the world as laid out has a number of features that I think are intriguing:

  1. Waldo wanders all through time and space with [a magic walking stick](http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Waldo%27s_walking_stick) given to him by Wizard Whitebeard.
  2. Waldo isn't just Waldo, he's *a* Waldo, one of many. He goes to the [Land of Waldos](http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/The_Land_of_Waldos) and meets exact (?) duplicates of himself.
  3. Waldo has a villain, [Odlaw](http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Odlaw), who is after Waldo's magic staff. Canonically, he wants to use this to steal gold from Fort Knox, which is stupid.
  4. Odlaw isn't just Odlaw, he's *an* Odlaw, one of many, from [the Odlaw Swamp](http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/The_Odlaw_Swamp).

  I have so many questions that need to be answered here.

  Does the land of Waldos imply that there's a land of every other sort of person? Does Waldo not feel any existential dread at meeting people identical to himself? Is there a reason that Waldo and Odlaw exist as opposites to each other? Are Odlaw's plans for the magical staff so simple as he claims? And if Odlaw isn't able to travel through time and space (because he doesn't have the staff) how does he keep ending up where Waldo is? What's Whitebeard's role in all this? Is there some reason behind why Waldo is traveling around beyond just tourism? Is this a Quantum Leap style "he goes where he's needed" thing?

        Including information from the TV series (I watched recordings of it when I was kid, and feel I have useful if not perfectly accurate memory of it), I would propose that, as is often the case in these sorts of situations, everything started with the Wizard.

        Whitebeard is magical, both in the sense that he can craft magical items of great power (such as the walking cane, and his own staff), but also in a way inherent to his nature. Whitebeard is unique across all of the worlds (which may be why he is so powerful, have the entirety of essence concentrated in a single instance of himself).

        Being both a somewhat human being, and in a place of significant personal power, Whitebeard sees that there is a great amount of suffering across reality, desires to replace it with joy.

        Waldo, the one who possesses the cane, is special in his own way. Ordinarily, a person's image is scattered across the multitude. Some, however, such as Waldo, are (/part of) a collective. He was taken from that collective (by his own future self, through temporal shenanigans) to the conventional world we see in the earlier books. This disturbs the balance that a collective requires to be stable, and so the World of Waldos was split in two, half being perverted into the Odlaw Swamp. Due to this imbalance, an Odlaw (though not necessarily the same one each time) is forcefully pushed into any world which Waldo w/ Cane enters, and forcefully removed when he leaves. 

        Whitebeard grants the estranged Waldo the cane for two reasons. The first, is simply that, through happenstance, Waldo came to interact with Wenda, another being akin to Whitebeard (although she was initially split unevenly in two, the other part going by the name Wilma, Whitebeard rectified this through the use of a magical artifact), who he was planning on recruiting as an apprentice of sorts. Waldo shows himself (and thus his collective) to be trustworthy and good-hearted to Wenda, and so to Whitebeard as well. The other reason is that, as a member of a collective who has been removed from them by circumstance, Waldo is in fact distinctly prepared to handle the existence of multiple worlds, and the multitudes of people within and across them, as his history has shown him both of these things.

        Whitebeard desires help in his endeavor, as, while he is immensely powerful, he is still ultimately unique, singular, a trait which he cannot rectify without losing the power he possesses.

  I got married recently! It was great!

      I don't think marriage is a remotely good institution to claim ethical injunction status on. Why do you?
      ```

      - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
        ```
        The value of marriage for society exists primarily in its status as a precommitment.  The apparent benefits of dissolving any given marriage are outweighed by the damage done to the precommitment.  Hasty marriages are a much more serious individual-level problem where hasty divorces are a much more serious society-level problem, and both feed each other.  A society where divorce is easy (and common) will not take marriage seriously, and people will make the ill-advised decision to rush into marriage.  People who rush into marriage are more likely to have a bad marriage that begs for an easy divorce, damaging society's views of marriage.
        ```

        - u/Transfuturist:
          ```
          I'm more inclined to believe that easy marriages cause easy divorces, and not the other way around, particularly as marriage becomes detached from its developmental status as an institution of lineage and property exchange between families. I don't see much value in marriage's status as a precommitment, either. When a bad marriage ends, that's a good thing. I'm also more inclined to believe that large rates of divorce are likely to *discourage* marriage, not encourage it. If they know the commitment is likely to end, and that the end of the commitment is one of the most stressful life events people experience, then people are less willing to commit.

          Marriage rates are declining, to the point that it's been called a "problem" by W. Wilcox in The Federalist and a "crisis" by Aja Gabel in UVA. How does this gel with your theory that easy divorce => rushing into marriage?

            I guess I don't really see a causal effect at all? Easy marriages and easy divorces could both be symptoms of people not taking marriage seriously, rather than one causing the other. This would also contribute to declining marriage rates.

            Edit: Or, there are a few feedback loops involved. People see quick, meaningless marriages and start to take marriage less seriously. They see quick, simple divorces and start to take marriage less seriously. They see people living together without marrying and take marriage less seriously. But all these things that weaken the institution of marriage also contribute to the symptoms of a weak institution, so the effects become the causes, leading to further and further decline of marriage as an institution as time goes on.

              The link I posted on the divorce rate makes me think all our models are built under the assumption of high+rising divorce and a unipolar distribution. I don't even want to talk about trends anymore unless they're backed up by data and analysis, because 'marriage' and 'divorce' can already be broken up into more informative distributions and correlations. Too many confounders, not enough evidence, too much conjecture.

  It would be cool to have a game with smart enemies. The main complaint is that it would be too hard, but you can manage that by making them weaker. I'd rather face smarter enemies on higher difficulty settings than ones that just have more hitpoints.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    The solution I've found to this is competitive multiplayer games. Counter Strike, Company of Heroes, and Starcraft are examples of games where I'm regularly put through my mental paces. All involve some level of manual dexterity, but all also involve tactics, strategy, and (in Counter Strike) teamwork.
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      Indeeed. I personally play different games, but the only way I've found to have an enemy that seems like another player playing the same game with the same goals as myself, is to actually have that other player. My particular vices are Dominions 4 and DotA 2 - the former is entirely thinking with zero execution requirements, and can be played solo or with designated allies, and diplomacy/betrayal/cunning/alliance-making etc are important but so are planning and combat tactics, while the latter is a combination of executing well and dexterity tests with some planning/thinking and working well with teammates and allies. 

      I find games against AI to be less fun, these days. Even if the AI is given a material advantage and the game is not 'even', it is most often very predictable and therefore exploitable.
      ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    > The main complaint is that it would be too hard

    Too hard, or too frustrating. There's a reason why FPS enemies pop out of cover every now and then: firefights where you spend most of your time missing aren't much fun. This remains true even if the enemies are weak and fragile.

    I too would like to see smarter game AI, but it's a difficult AI problem *and* a difficult game design problem.
    ```

  - u/Salivanth:
    ```
    Apart from multiplayer games as Blazinghand says, there's a small roguelike game called Smart Kobolds that is all about this. The enemies are very weak, but they have numbers on their side and they fight quite intelligently.
    ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    I've been on the "idle fantasizing" stage of making a game like this for quite a while now, and I might start something for the Seven Day Roguelike challenge starting in March.  The core ideas I had were (some will probably be cut):

    Simultaneous turns, with glorified rock-paper-scissors style combat.  

    Enemies value different goals: delaying you, surviving, escaping, maximizing damage to you, minimizing damage to themselves, etc.

    Separation of the true state of the game and the player's knowledge.  If your sword does 5-15 damage and you hit an enemy with 100 HP, it will display (85-95) HP, not the exact value.  If you get a critical hit and deal 30 damage, it will *still* display (85-95) HP, despite it truly being 70 HP.

    Illusions.  The enemies know about the existence of illusion spells, which can limit their effectiveness.  For example, if you cast "all opponents are invisible to each other" then they might each think that you cast "teleport all enemies except one away" instead.  Also, vice versa.  If you teleport everyone else away, then the one remaining enemy might think they're just unseen, and expect backup when attacking you.  Enemies can do this as well.

    Mind control.  Pretty simple, you swap out their AI for a different, less useful one.  Make their tanks cower in fear, and their archers charge you head on.  Usable by the player only.

    Reputation/memory.  If you are wearing glowy robes and carrying a staff, they will expect you to cast spells.  If you are wearing armor and holding a mace, they will expect you to fight physically.  If you previously chose "rock" 90% of the time in combat, they will expect you to choose "rock".
    ```

    - u/TimTravel:
      ```
      Beware that telling people your plans can make you less likely to succeed in implementing them. The act of talking about it feels like progress and makes you less likely to make real progress.
      ```

      - u/Iconochasm:
        ```
        I've also seem people claim that telling people plans creates a social obligation to carry through, to avoid embarrassing conversations about why you haven't done X yet.

        I wonder if there's any evidence for which is the stronger impulse.  I'd assume it would vary between people and situations, and that isolating genuinely relevant factors would be very difficult.
        ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    [Here](http://www.zincland.com/7drl/kobold/) is an example of a roguelike game with very weak but smart enemies. (They will try to stay out of reach of your melee attacks, deny you the chance to pick up ranged weapons, and retreat to return later as an overwhelming mob.) It also demonstrates how hugely frustrating this can be.

  CMV: Crowdfunding is stupid.  

  Why do people crowdfund things? It is the most inefficient use of your money. You're handing over risk-free, costless capital to someone else over nothing more than a flashy video.  

  Look at the Oculus Rift backers, they essentially purchased shares in the company which would have been quite the amount after the Facebook acquisition. Instead all they got was a 600$ headset. Look at Pebble, they now have a product line and probably turn a good profit too. Only because a few people were dumb enough to give them free money at a return of 0%. The failure that Ouya was would not have been tolerated if again it wasn't disposable capital.  

  There are successes too like Pillars of Eternity, or Star Citizen. But why crowdfund them, just buy them on release. Invest your money in places that actually give you good return.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Crowdfunding makes the least amount of sense when you're thinking about return on investment.

    It makes the *most* sense when you think of it like a donation.

    In the middle ground are those times when this logic:

    > But why crowdfund them, just buy them on release. 

    Fails completely because without crowdfunding they'll never secure the capital necessary to make it to release. So if you wait to buy them on release, you end up not buying them because the product never gets made.
    ```

    - u/Magodo:
      ```
      > Fails completely because without crowdfunding they'll never secure the capital necessary to make it to release.  

      This is exactly the problem. Financing isn't impossible. Loans, mortgages, savings. All of these modes involve risk and actual cost. If a person was really super interested in making and selling something, capital isn't impossible to find.  

      Crowd funding is just the lazy approach. With the added benefit of it being perceived as a donation. And the presentation in a way that convinces the viewer that, yes, I'm making this for you.

            Well, you're initial comment did start off with 'Crowdfunding is stupid,' which certainly sounds like you're saying there's something explicitly stupid about it, but all of your points so far have shown is that you don't think that crowdfunding is worth your time and money.

            So, I suppose a better way for me to have phrased my question is, what is it that makes crowdfunding *stupid*, rather than just something you're not personally interested in?

        Crowdfunding is a way to pool risk. Instead of a few people spending a lot of money, a lot of people spend very little money. Because of the way people treat risk and return, this allows riskier ventures to gain capital they need to succeed.

        Crowdfunding is not 'lazy.' If you do not have a dedicated campaign, you will not succeed.
        ```

        - u/Magodo:
          ```
          A dedicated campaign is a sunk-cost. You need it if you're crowdfunding or if you're going by other approaches of financing.
          ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    The point I viewed is that it's essentially a pre-purchase with a risk. The point is not to invest, the point is to get the thing made.

    The return is not the funds, the return is the product/service you want to exist in the first place.

    It's not really the same model.

    Crowdfunding has more in common with building a cathedral or a community work then with investment in a company for a return on investment.
    ```

    - u/Sparkwitch:
      ```
      Yes. There are people who just want a cool thing that isn't currently made, crowdfunding taps that market.

      SEC rules make the investment equivalent (put in a little money towards a respectable chunk of venture capital, receive an equivalent amount of that chunk's shares in the company) legally complex.
      ```

  - u/captainNematode:
    ```
    To date, the only Kickstarter (or similar thing) I've given money to has been ["Yooka-Laylee"](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playtonic/yooka-laylee-a-3d-platformer-rare-vival/description), mostly because I REALLY loved the spiritual predecessors as a kid and wanted to express my nostalgia as a cash donation. Additionally, it marginally improved the probability of the thing getting made and achieving its stretch goals, and brought me pleasure in the form of anticipation for the finished product (which is more intense given that I've more concretely committed myself towards receiving it). If you trust the makers decently well (given prior knowledge or decent evidence in the form of a prototype, proof of concept, tech demo, etc.), then it's not terribly risky to give them money, and you usually get the product at a discount relative to whatever it would cost on release.

    It's not an "efficient" use of money, certainly, in the sense of being a lucrative financial investment that will provide you with some high ROI. Neither is, say, buying a beer, or a flower, or fancy underwear. It's a luxury purchase made for personal pleasure.

  - u/trifith:
    ```
    On crowdfunding, or any question where things in the economy are proceding in a non-intuitive manner, I tend to look for what restrictions are in place that prevent more intuitive behavior.

    In the case of crowdfunding, what prevents a person from raising capital through traditional stock offers with returns, rather than the crowdfunding method. 

    The short answer is government regulations. SEC filings for a public stock offering requires significant capital outlays for lawyers and regulatory compliance paperwork. Crowdfunding requires an idea, an internet connection, and a little bit of marketing savvy. 

    While SEC regulations on IPO's purportedly exist to prevent fraud, they have the unintended side effect of restricting legitimate, if under-capitalized, entrepreneurs from entering the space.

    Crowdfunding is *not (primarily) a transaction*.  It's a donation, or at most a grey area between a donation and a transaction if there are any "donor benefits" provided.  If you choose to believe that the "donation" concept is just a pretense for what's actually a transaction, then sure, it's irrational, but at that point, you are bending over so far backwards to ignore the straightforward that Occam's Razor is angling to slit your throat.

    And of fucking course smart people are going to seek out donations rather than investors if possible, because you don't need to pay anything back on donations.

    EDIT:  Oh wow, this ended up as a wall'o'text.  Well, summary:  crowdfunding is useful for market research, and people are allowed to do their own risk/reward calculations.

    -----

    Obviously, I can't answer for the entire crowdfunding industry, but I can answer for myself.   Having actually done crowdfunding, I can tell you how it looks from my perspective, and what I'm guessing was going on in the heads of the people who donated.

    I was considering making a change from programming to writing as a career, and I needed to know if it was even remotely feasible for me to do that.  I needed a way to do some basic market research -- were there people who actually liked my writing enough that they would spend money on it?  If so, it was at least possible that I could actually sell enough stuff to live.

    Under the traditional model I would have written something and then flogged it to publishers.  That's measuring the wrong thing, though -- that's measuring "can I convince one person [the purchasing agent for a publisher] to give me money for my writing on one occasion."  That doesn't tell me if it's feasible for me to keep doing this.  There's also an EXTREMELY long delay on getting that feedback -- weeks or months.  Not exactly a great method for making decisions.

    I could also have epublished and measured the income directly, but that had high startup costs; I'd need to find out how to do that, I'd need to do a lot of research on marketing a book, I'd need to pay someone to make a cover for me, etc.  I wasn't willing to do what is, frankly, a lot of work without a little more assurance that it wouldn't be a waste that left me feeling like a failure.

    I could have just run a survey "Would you pay money for my writing, Y/N?"  That didn't see like a viable strategy for reasons that should be obvious.

    A much better metric would be to run a Kickstarter for a modest amount of money and simply list it in the online fora where I'm already known.  The startup costs are extremely low and it would let me see:

    * How many people funded?  [tells me market size]
    * What amount they were willing to fund for on average? [tells me about pricing]
    * How many of them were *not* friends and family members?
    * How quickly did they go in?  [suggestive of how much first-degree marketing I need]
    * What sort of rewards were they most interested in? [ideas for ancillary items]

    Now, obviously I don't know what was actually going on in the heads of the people who funded, but I suspect it was some combination of the following:

    * This guy has given us a lot of free content, I'll throw a buck in the kitty as a thank you
    * This story sounds interesting and I'd like to read it.  If it already existed I'd throw $3 at it, so I'll throw that in.  [There might have been a "...but there's a chance he'll run off to Aruba with my $3 without delivering; I judge there is a <= 33% of that happening, so I'll only throw in $2."]
    * I don't care too much about this guy personally, and I don't care too much about the specific story he's describing, but I do usually like his stuff and want to see more people making the kind of content I want to read, so I'll throw a couple bucks in.
    * Ooh, shiny!  I get to be the protagonist of / have a cameo in / have a hand in shaping the plot of a rational horror story!  Shut up and take my money!

    Kickstarter has (or had, when I did it) a required section of their template "what are the risks that might cause your project to fail and how will you manage them?"  It's possible that people didn't read that, but it's not like it's hidden.  There's also a reasonable amount of media attention to the fact that Kickstarter projects could end up failing or being a gyp.  I think it's pretty fair to say that everyone who funded me -- or who funds any Kickstarter -- can reasonably be assumed to have known the risks.


    The bottom line is that people gave money for something they wanted with the full understanding that it might not happen.  Clearly, the perceived risk / return calculation  was worth it to them.

  I bought a new laptop two weeks ago. I find myself unwilling to remove the see through plastic that covers the screen. Why? It *feels* like it will keep the laptop new and sparkly longer. Here's the thing, though. It doesn't even cover the screen. Just the frame around it. So it does nothing at all. But I'm not taking it off.

      >  Is systematically trying to apply rationality down to the lowest level of your life necessary to help train good patterns into your System 1 reactions?

      My response to this would be that rationality is the science of winning -- i.e., of achieving whatever your goals are, and determining what to do when goals conflict.  Most of us have "be happy" as one of our goals; in this case, leaving the plastic on makes /u/Rhamni happy and almost certainly does not conflict with any other of his/her goals.  To my mind, it would be irrational to *remove* the plastic.

        That's what I was trying to convey in my first paragraph, sorry if I didn't do that well. My concern is it might be a short term gain for a long-term loss... Giving up small irrational happiness for a better position in life that ultimately is more satisfying. 

        Although with happiness in general, I feel like it's a commonly bandied-about fact that people tend to have a happiness "norm" that they always return to eventually, so ultimately it may not make that much of a difference.

          No, I got it.  I was just responding to your question about self-training.

          > Although with happiness in general, I feel like it's a commonly bandied-about fact that people tend to have a happiness "norm" that they always return to eventually, so ultimately it may not make that much of a difference.

          That's true, but it's happiness per se is caused by a deviation from the norm, and whatever circumstances we are in eventually become the norm.  There's no reason not to enjoy the happiness-boost while it's still available.

  I have developed an aesthetic love for gabe the dog remixes. Where by clips of this one dog barking, snorting, howling and otherwise producing noise is adjusted in pitch and tempo to act as the instruments in musical covers.

  I kind of want the same idea but with better range of original samples to help reduce the auto tune twaing.

    Have a look at "Loops" by the band Topology - famous radio snippets looped and musicified. 

    Edit:  album is actually titled "Airwaves", a collaboration by "Loops + Topology" (and not particularly googleable...)  See http://www.jonathandimond.com/discography-airwaves.html

  Anyone want to talk about this market action? Traditional markets or bitcoin?

  Worst start to a year for US indices ever. China's growth is slowing. Recession looms in many countries. Oil is below $30 now. Bond rates are negative for many places. Interest rates are negative in some places.

  To me it seems like the economic game is breaking.

    I'll continue to gradually invest money in the market as I always do. If things are bad, that means my money buys more stocks per dollar. If things are going permanently bad in some kind of "revolution" style way, things will be chaotic enough it's not like I'll be able to outmaneuver the market. I have valuable skills so no matter what I'll make it. In a situation where computer programming is no longer useful, things are bad enough there's no real way to prepare. I'm certainly not digging a bomb shelter and buying canned food.

    If we have another Great Depression or something like the subprime mortgage crisis, I think gradually investing money into the market will continue to be the right strategy.
