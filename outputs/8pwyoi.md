  I think it's fun to think about how someone finding the golden record might react.

  A glimpse into a foreign world. A legacy that may yet survive the species that created it.

   A single statement: Remember us.

  A little hokey, but thought provoking none the less

  I kinda like this. I felt a little ashamed, thought, hearing what kind and pleasant things aliens might think of us.
