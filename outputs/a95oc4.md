## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  What's the rationalist days of celebration? I remember one for a russian guy who refused an order to fire nuclear missiles during the cold war but I forgot what the name was. Any others?

        Yes, there's a few similar things. A sample path: (of wikipedia links)

        (the man) [Stanislav\_Petrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov) (the event) -> [1983\_Soviet\_nuclear\_false\_alarm\_incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident) (see also) ->

        * [World\_War\_III#Historical\_close\_calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III#Historical_close_calls)
        * [List\_of\_nuclear\_close\_calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls)\*

        \*There are 10 dates on this list, running from 1950 to 1995.

        One example: 

        >[Vasili Arkhipov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov) â€“ a Soviet Naval officer who refused to launch a nuclear torpedo during the 1962 [Cuban Missile Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis).

    There are a bunch of people trying to make Secular Solstice a thing, it's essentially Christmas without the religious angle.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I went to the most recent Secular Solstice. It did a pretty good job of capturing the spirituality without any religion involved.
      ```

      - u/Sonderjye:
        ```
        I'd love to hear more details on that one.

        Also, and I asked Silver as well, do you know why Solstice in particular was chosen?
        ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      I've seen that. Do you know why Solstice in particular was chosen? Pegan inspired? Shelling day? As a replacement since this season is advertised as one in which we come together?
      ```

      - u/Silver_Swift:
        ```
        >As a replacement since this season is advertised as one in which we come together?

        That one, I believe. The winter is (at least in large parts of Europe and North America) a dark and cold time when people have a stronger need for social connections. 

        Religious holidays (used to) fill that need, if we want to stop this whole religion business then we'd have to find some replacement for those holidays.

        Personally, while the whole thing is cool as hell, I think Christmas is already becoming plenty secular for a lot of people, so it's more practical to just push to continue that trend.

    25th of december is technically Isaac Newton's birthday, so that's an alternative if you want to celebrate something on that day that is not linked to any religion. Which is nice ;P

      This day many years ago, a very special man was born.  While he was wrong on more points that I could possibly count his words inspired generations and radically changed the world.  His single greatest observation was that fundemental laws really are fundemental.  I am, of course, talking about Isaac Netwon.

  I always had some version or another of this concept in mind and today I found somebody who phrased it in a better way.

  >Experts and teachers have an implied self interest in making people think learning their fields takes more time / is harder than it actually is.

  &#x200B;

  Not a direct quote btw. This means you can, actually learn things with less effort, and time than your professors / teachers would have you believe if you use a method more compatible with your own learning strengths and weaknesses. While focusing on the important points while not diving as deep into unimportant specifics.

  &#x200B;

  This is the kind of thing I'd like to see more in Good Student sometimes, instead of just being the guy that works harder than everybody else and studies more, it'd be nice to see him studying smarter, focusing on learning the more important things first, using different methods, optimizing in different ways, combining unrelated subjects into new ideas, reasoning from first principles etc..
  ```

  - u/hh26:
    ```
    I can see this going the other way as well.  Experts and teachers are more likely to have a significantly higher than average interest and talent in their particular field, which is why they chose to go into that field in the first place, and also they're someone who succeeded rather than someone who dropped out because they found it to be too difficult.  As such, they are likely to have had an easier time learning it than someone without the same interest and talent and suvivorship bias in their field.

    Both of these effects will pull portrayals in opposite directions.  I'm extremely good at math, but even if I have some implied self interest in making people think math is hard, I definitely perceive it and portray it as being easier than everyone else seems to think it is.  I actually struggle to figure out why most other people don't get it the same way that I do, even if I know due to experience that they don't.

    Now, there probably are different learning strategies that work for different kinds of people, so the sorts of techniques and metaphors that I encountered and invented when learning math for the first time and use to teach it won't be the same techniques and metaphors that work for every one of my students.  So some students could benefit by learning from techniques more suited to their own learning style, but that's more of a compatability thing, and isn't related to any sort of prestige bias.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      I don't disagree with you on that. My point was different and more related to application and skills, rather than to classroom scenarios and abstract knowledge.

      For instance, learning a language can be faster and easier than a language school would have you believe..
      ```

    ```
    >Experts and teachers have an implied self interest in making people think learning their fields takes more time / is harder than it actually is.

    I understand the theoretical point here, but I think this statement might be too cynical. 

    At least in my experience, the kinds of people that become teachers or experts in technical fields are the people that are super enthusiastic about it and those people tend to want nothing more than to share their love for their field with others.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      I don't disagree with you on that. 

      Just remember, enthusiasm doesn't equal good at teaching, or good at prioritizing, or good at picking important points while leaving unimportant facts for later if the student wants to dive deeper or become an expert at said subject.
      ```

    - u/GeneralExtension:
      ```
      >I think this statement might be too cynical.

      There are subjects without practice. The only use in learning it, is so you can teach it.

      But yes, this ("an implied self interest") attributes too much effect to one cause.

      Teachers and students both have different priorities, and different ways of operating.

      For a student, "X MUST BE DONE *THIS* WAY" is the worst way to teach - The method is irrelevant, only the answers matter. 

      There is a big difference between an student who is interested and one who isn't.

      Some students learn best one way, others another. (In math, some people are great with geometry, others algebra, and still others with some other method neither you nor I have ever heard of.)

      I love math, and know it well. Math classes are garbage.
