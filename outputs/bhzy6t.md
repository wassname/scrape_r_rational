## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You live in a world where soulmates exist and everyone is born with a tattoo-like birthmark somewhere on their bodies which reads out the first seven words of what your soulmate will say when you first meet them (assuming the individual in question isn't mute for some reason).

  Yes, destiny is a thing and everyone is guaranteed to meet their soulmates someday.

  What can you or society do to speed up this process to ensure everyone meets their soulmates as early as possible in life?

    Wait, no. Hold on. I question the premise. We have seven words per person of *reliable communication from the future* and we're using it to try to optimize online dating?

    Messages from the future can be used to solve computational problems: see, e.g., [https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec19.html](https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec19.html) or [https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/17](https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/17). Just collect all the tattoos from newborns every year, assign those people messages they have to say upon greeting every single person they meet, and exploit the closed timelike curves that result.

      Forget the time loop, there's something even crazier you can do:

      > Yes, destiny is a thing and everyone is guaranteed to meet their soulmates someday. 

      GUARANTEED.

      In other words, as long as you haven't met your soulmate, **YOU CANNOT DIE.**

      You take all kinds of crazy risks without fear of death. Conduct all kinds of mad science experiments, explore all dangerous areas, etc. People who haven't met their soulmates would have incredible value because they provide guarantees that nothing will go horribly wrong. Stick one in a rocket and it can't explode. Stick one on a plane and it can't crash. Stick one in a city and it can't be nuked. Stick one in a nuclear power plant and it can't meltdown. The possibilities are ENDLESS. You can even deliberately engineer elaborate deathtraps where unless the outcome you wish for happens, a bunch of people who have never met their soulmates will die, thus bending the universe to your will.

      The only problem would be making sure these people never meet anyone who could be their soulmate and thus cause them to lose their immortality. Which ironically, means the world will be looking for shut-in NEETs: people who willingly shut themselves in a room and never ever go out. Just carry their room around and periodically throw in supplies without meeting the NEET inside. You don't need them to do work or anything, you just need them to sit there and be your good luck charm.

You don't need them to do work or anything, you just need them to sit there and be your good luck charm.

        ... unfortunately for this strategy, once people reach about age 30 without meeting their soulmate, they begin to develop insight into the workings of time, space and fate. These so-called "wizards" tend to develop the ability to accurately predict theoretically random events (the roll of a fair die, the order of a shuffled deck of cards), which has obvious national security implications. 

        Wizards often describe this with reference to translucent "strings of fate", which also allow them to locate their soulmates. Few wizards develop their abilities beyond this point, because finding their soulmate is generally both trivial and their highest priority.

        In rare cases wizards are either unable or unwilling to find their soulmate, which can lead to strange and destabilizing occurrences. Possibly the best-known of these events was the 1982 "mass-marriage" in New York, wherein several thousand people suddenly realized that their soulmate was, in fact, the person closest to them at the time, despite documented evidence to the contrary (including birth certificates and prison records). This event is believed to be related to the asteroid strike on Times Square, which happened a few moments later.

        You are basically using an outcome pump tht ensures you met someone to try to  get something you want in a nice way , it will end badly.

        The more you do risky stuff the more optimization pressure there is to destroy   your efforts to avoid meeting your soulmate. 

        That's if you get to exist, you probably won't, the same way people that are going to kill their grandparents whith a time machine don't get to exist,  depending on how things work you might be  making yourself less likely by eliminating most posible futures where your crazy risks don't have consecuences.
        ```

        - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:

          There's actually a rather significant difference here from normal outcome pumping scenarios. Usually we are given some kind of destiny to personally munchkin, which could prompt the universe to destroy us if we push it towards too improbable scenarios.

          But in this case its the entirety of humanity that is given a destiny. Every time anyone does anything that goes against increasing their odds of meeting their soul mate (like going towards increasing their odds of death before meeting their soulmate), they are effectively outcome pumping. That means every soldier, every police officer, every firefighter, every doctor, and pretty much every human is outcome pumping because they all take dangerous actions from time to time. So the universe is being outcome pumped not just by you, but pretty much every human on earth. And while sure, the outcome pumping you do is probably greater than the average because you are deliberately trying to do that, the combined outcome pumping of the other 7 billion people will dwarf yours by far provided you're not pumping something crazy like winning all lotteries or wanting something that goes against the very laws of physics.

          Effectively, if the universe would destroy you for outcome pumping, it would also destroy the existence of the rest of humanity to stop their soul mate destiny shenanigans. Which, err, would explain why this is merely a hypothetical scenario that doesn't exist instead of the world we live in.

            Well yeah you are right , I guess that if humanity still exists it can't be that bad .
            You can probably increase your probabilities of survival without much problem , its just that you should be careful and not go around taking crazy risks, and you aren't guaranteed to survive stuff that would be really unlikely for you to survive(although thinking abut it you would be less likely to end up in those kinds of situations so dunno , this kind of destiny causal loop thing is very complicated and hard to have a good  mental model of  ).

            It might  be a bad idea for civilization as a whole to start exploiting it massively though , in fact it would be a good idea to ensure people meets their soulmates asap (as op intended) to avoid weirdness happening to get them together( or in fact the weirdness can cause people deciding to ensure everyone meets their soulmates)  or even being retroactively erased from existence( well is more of an acausal trade kind of thing instead of retroactively I think ).
            I mean its not imposible to do it right and be careful , but our civilization or something like it isn't competent enough for that yet.

        Rocket explodes; designated survivor miraculously survives.

        > Stick one on a plane and it can't crash.

        You've heard the story of the flight attendant who survived a fall from 40,000 feet?

        > Stick one in a city and it can't be nuked.

        The survivors of Nagasaki and Hiroshima are a good counterexample.

        > Stick one in a nuclear power plant and it can't meltdown.

        I'm pretty sure that Three Mile Island has survivors, too.

        In a setting where hubris is a major narrative tendency, you're just begging for adversarial miracles.

        Not dying doesn't guarantee good quality of life. 

        "yes, this guy tried to skydive without a parachute", turns out that after a month lying in the desert with every bone broken and his flesh being eaten by wildlife he was still alive.  

        his intensive care nurse turned out to be his soulmate. briefly.

        First, create the message you want to send into the past. With the technique I describe below, it can be any length up to about 184,530 words long, though shorter will be less work for you.

        Next, choose three words that would be rare, not grammatically correct, and unthinkable to use as first words when meeting someone. Something like Immunodeficiency Tenochtitlan Petrichor. This clearly flags a tattoo as being a message from the future because there's no way it would occur randomly. It also allows you to cluster messages so that multiple tattoos with these three initial words can be associated together.

        Next, add a word to act as a numeral, since you'll need many tattoos and have to be able to rearrange them in order. For this, use the 20-volume 2nd Ed. Oxford English Dictionary (with 615,100 words in it). If you pick the 50,000th word from it for example, the numeral word would equate in value to 50,000.

        Now break your original message up into three-word chunks. You'll take the first chunk and combine it with the flag and numeral to get something like "Immunodeficiency Tenochtitlan petrichor a cold fusion requires", and the second chunk would end up something like "Immunodeficiency Tenochtitlan petrichor A&E magnetoinertial confinement via." Once you've chunked it up like that, repeat the message to a total of 10 times while continuing to use new sequential numeral words. You now have multiple redundant messages that will say the same thing to help ensure reliability against human error.

        Next, get a large group of volunteers who are single, interested in finding their soulmate, and 12-16 years old (old enough to follow directions, young enough to probably not have met their soulmate yet). Assign your messages among them. Tell them that if they promise to always say their own unique set of seven words first to every person they meet, it will be possible to locate their soulmate via tattoo registry and match them up, and then do so.

        You have now introduced information about a decade into the past. 10 years earlier, younger you would be able to pull up data from the tattoo registry and filter the tattoos to the ones that start with Immunodeficiency Tenochtitlan Petrichor (which you previously selected as a planned flag in case you wish to deliver information to yourself). You could then sort them based on numerical order and reconstruct the message, allowing you access to technology that won't be developed for 10 more years. You can also choose to push this information even further into the past using recursion, allowing access to technology from hundreds or thousands of years in the future.

        Edit: Fixed a math error at the top. Previously said it work for up to 61,510 words, but neglected that each message is actually a three-word chunk.

    First make sure everybody has a unique name. Also make sure it's tradition that whenever 2 people meet, they always lead with their own name.
    ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      Mmm, so people will have public and private GUIDs: public for greetings, private for administrivia. Then you just have to worry about GUID conflicts.
      ```

  - u/SpeakKindly:
    ```
    Make sure everyone or almost everyone lives in extremely isolated communities so that they only interact with around 100 people over the course of their life, and meet these people early on in life.

    If destiny guarantees that you meet your soulmate eventually, but you never meet anyone outside your home town, then destiny will guarantee that your soulmate is born in your home town.
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:

    The obvious thing is that you get a very strong norm that all first greetings be unique. 
    The easiest is, as per tjhance, insisting on globally unique names, and leading all introductions with them. 

    This should be doable with first, middle, last, but requires a data base of everyone to arrange meetups, and avoid name space collisions. Since the norms for this will probably long predate states with the bureaucratic power to do this, the full greeting ritual will likely be name, middle-name, kin-name, village or neighbourhood, town or city name, nation then vocation.

    Every morning people should agree to say an important 6 word phrase localized to districts of \~1000 people - the seventh word would be the name of the district.  Some of the words could be maybe an important chemical name, either because investigating the chemical would yield scientific breakthroughs or just as a method of encoding information in long words.  Dividing the world into a 100 million districts with unique names shouldn't be too difficult.

    World leaders and scientists could confer to figure out the best possible method to express the most important information from the previous day and split that message up over the districts so that information could be transmitted back in time to greatly accelerate humanities progress.  You also would know the approximate location of where you would meet your sig other because you would share the district name and there would only be about 1000 people to search through to find the one that shared your tattoo.

    Edit: Honestly, it might be too easy to find your significant other if we used this method, giving us a shorter view into the future.  People who held back from going to their 'district' to find their future love would be valuable towards seeing further into the future.  Maybe the district name shouldn't be used at all but I was trying to work within the boundaries of trying to accelerate finding your significant other.

    Is this the "one weird weight loss trick" I keep seeing ads for?

    Anyway imo this is not a particularly useful power for you personally (unless you wanna lose weight real fast thru suicide). 

    The extra thinking isn't going to be very useful, because it sounds like the new heads all fork off your current state, which means that they're going to spend most of their time thinking the same thoughts as the main head. You could probably train yourself out of that habit, but it would be hard.

    Fundamentally though, there's few problems that suddenly become tractable if you think about them for 4x longer - even just getting four other people's opinions would probably work better, because they're _other people_.

    Probably the optimal use of this power would be to execute the world's best brain science. You've got disposable heads that can be created at will (biomass permitting), so the research proposals nearly write themselves. You can train neurosurgeons without danger, and generate brains that can be ethically turned into Swiss cheese as long as they're chopped off afterwards. You can test every form of brain imaging known to man for consistency, since now there's a universally standard brain. Probably you'll be the first person uploaded to the cloud, just because it's suddenly feasible to test all sorts of new, destructive scans on you.

    Hmm, there are a lot of drawbacks here... for example if I am reading this right I will need \~18.75 hours of sleep every day (my normal 8 plus 2\*5.25) if I have 4 extra heads since they are automatically reabsorbed when I fall asleep.  Pretty inconvenient.

    My strategies would first be on minimizing drawbacks.  I am assuming since the heads are perfect duplicates they will share my personality, so I will focus on trying to maximize my ability to work with like-minded people and learn everything I can about how to work in teams.  Minimizing my sleep needs and maximizing my ability to work while sleepy will be key to success.  Studying meditation so that my main head can rest while conscious would be a good strategy, and the rules say nothing of the extra heads needing rest.  Also it should help me be mindful and ignore distractions which will be key to the 'contests of wills' drawback. One head would be assigned to physically improving our body, eating and exercising as much as possible.  Physical exertion will not be much of a danger for increasing tiredness when we are getting somewhere in the range of 12 hours of sleep a day at the very least even operating at minimum sleep.

    Still, this will allow us a potential for 8-10 hours of exercise a day (with some hours dedicated to helping the other heads setup the things they need to do other activities, as well as eat and take care of other bodily needs), 36 hours of studying (mostly by listening to audiobooks or possibily by using vr goggles of some kind) and 12 hours of meditation and focusing on growing my abilities to ignore external stimulus and become comfortable in my new shared body.  That's a lot of extra hours to dedicate to self improvement.  Obviously it will become important to actually get stuff done and I am ignoring all of that - this would be the schedule for self improvement days.  Trying to obtain or set up some system, hopefully utilizing vr goggles, similar to the one Hawkings used to communicate and interact with computers through eye and facial movement would be important to allow the heads autonomy without calling on the main body too much.

    But definitely a lot of drawbacks here that are hard to work around.

    Of course, the actual ability, in this world, would make me a really fantastic ventriloquist, magician, or circus act.  Could definitely make a fair amount of money utilizing my powers in this way.

  Somehow you acquire a seemingly ordinary rock in which you can "inscribe" your will. The will is a clone of the inscribed and can't move by itself. The inscription works by letting a drop of blood fall on the surface of the rock and only works once. If the rock breaks.

  The will can speak to anyone touching the rock telepathically. It also cannot sense anything (apart from you speaking back to it). This rock easily fits in your hand and will probably live on longer than you. What would you do with it?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    If the rock breaks, what?

    Can only I inscribe it?

    How do I know this? I'll assume I also know answers to my other questions.

    What happens if I melt it? Can I slow down its thought processes by making it very cold?

    When you take a brain and remove all sensory inputs, afair it... degenerates. Is this prevented here?
    ```

    - u/Redeemable_Incense:
      ```
      To answer your questions.

      The will dies if the rock breaks.

      No, anyone can inscribe it. It doesn't need your blood. You could even inscribe the will of animals as long as they have blood.

      By touching the rock for the first time, all information about the rock gets sent to your mind.

      Hmmmm. Didn't think about that one. The more harm the rock takes the less coherent the will becomes.

      Yes, if it isn't being interacted with it can choose to hibernate.

          Why the evil requirement? It can be used to communicate with anyone - even someone who is dead. You could use it to solve a murder. (Though there isn't a legal precedent for having dead people testify in court.)
