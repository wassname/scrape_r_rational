## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  I'm looking for a work of fiction that explores what happens when half the population disappears in some supernatural way (e.g. a Rapture type scenario). Ideally the focus would be on the logistical, political, or economic aspects, rather than being a meditation on loss or about personal stories.

  Similarly, and I doubt this exists on the scale that I would want, I'd like a story about those people coming back years later, all at once.

  ("Global phenomena happens" is one of my favorite scifi genres, but it's very often just about the individuals with little pagespace given over to the larger questions of how governments, media, etc. deal with these kinds of things, other than some vague allusions.)

    Funny you should mention that...

    Can you wait like, one more week?

    E: A more serious answer- this is actually partially what I'm exploring in the story I'm working on right now. Though the time scale is such that the logistics and politics probably won't enter into the picture until like, the second year's worth of stuff. In the short term, a lot of people disappearing is probably the most survivable type of apocalypse (depending on *why* of course). Infrastructure is still in place, but your population is vastly reduced, so you aren't in *immediate* danger unless you depend on services (gas, in-home care, etc) that might not be available to you. I imagine that the mid to long term effects would largely resemble the aftermath of a severe war or great plague- a gradual contraction and period of social reshuffling followed by an enormous uptick in births. If anything, the overall effects re/inertia in societal change and impacts on global climate would probably be extremely healthy for humanity as a species. Pretty unfortunate about the half that has to go, though.

        actually that would be pretty interesting. You have the earth split and you follow both timelines (slightly different things happens, like the president survives in one and not in the other and other such things, which maybe have cascading effects so they look very different in 5 years).

        Then after they've both adapted... merge them back together again!

        ("After half the people disappeared, we put together a new governmental branch for sudden supernatural event response! They came up with these general protocols."

        "Well we put together a response team too, and they came up with *these* protocols...")
        ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          See, that's how you get merge conflicts. If my time with git has taught me anything, that would be an absolute nightmare to resolve.

    Semi-related but it sounds like you'd enjoy works such as [The Island in the Sea of Time] (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99702.Island_in_the_Sea_of_Time) or Weber's [Safehold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safehold) series?

    If you haven't, I'd trawl through Novelupdates' books tagged with [Apocalypse](https://www.novelupdates.com/stag/apocalypse/), [Kingdom Building](https://www.novelupdates.com/stag/kingdom-building/), and [Returning From Another World](https://www.novelupdates.com/stag/returning-from-another-world/). But webnovels are sadly almost all universally shallow when it comes to the things you're after in such a story.

    I wish the tagging system on royalroadl had reader voting, but you can do something similar to novelupdates with the [apocalypse tag](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/search?tagsAdd=post_apocalyptic&minPages=300&maxPages=20000&minRating=3.5)

    ```
    I'm told Michael Grant's *Gone* is about very similar themes? It's about a small city that gets surrounded in a forcefield, and everyone in it who's above a certain age disappears.

    On the other hand, it's meant for kids, so I don't know deep the writing will be. On the gripping hand, it's by the same couple who managed to sell a war story about shape-shifting teens fighting mind-control aliens to 10-12 years olds, so who knows.

    [The Disappearance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347397.The_Disappearance) by Philip Wylie. Maybe not exactly what you are looking for, but half the population disappears (twice!).

    From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wylie):
    > He applied engineering principles and the scientific method quite broadly in his work. His novel The Disappearance (1951) is about what happens when everyone suddenly finds that all members of the opposite sex are missing (all the men have to get along without women, and vice versa). The book delves into the double standards between men and women that existed prior the woman's movement of the 1970s, exploring the nature of the relationship between men and women and the issues of women's rights and homosexuality.

    >(...) Some people have accused Generation of Vipers of being misogynistic. The Disappearance shows his thinking on the subject is very complex.

    Disclaimer: I was reading it ~15 years ago, and I can't remember finishing it ;)

    [Purple Days](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PurpleDays) \[A Game of Thrones\] - Unlike a lot of other time loop stories where the protagonist is constantly dying in a loop to some disaster that they have to live past to escape (Time Braid, Mother of Learning), Joffrey is simply repeating the loop every time he dies. There is no obvious threat or reason that he can come up with for why this is happening to him. It's very reminiscent of *Groundhog Day* where the protagonist is taking the time to grow and develop as a person.

    [Getting the Hang of Thursdays](http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6501) \[Harry Potter\] - Hermione and Snape are stuck in a day-long time loop where Hermione is fated to die at the end of the day no matter what.

    [Sisyphus](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651) \[Harry Potter\] - Harry gets another chance - and another and another. At some point, they stop feeling like chances at all.

    [Being Harry Potter](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6753546/1/) \[Harry Potter\] - Sequel to *Sisyphus* above.

    [Eternal Return](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/Eternal-Return) \[Harry Potter\] - For the Greater Good. Harry understands this.

    [Eleven Days in the Life of Gene Hunt (and one in Sam Tyler's)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3234158/chapters/7043759) \[Ashes to Ashes / Life on Mars\] -  Every day, Gene Hunt wakes up to the tape-recorded sound of Alex Drake wondering what he represents... until he starts wondering that, himself.

    [Tea with the Hatter](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15348900/chapters/35614746) \[The Avengers\] - It's seven a.m., Thursday fourteenth November, 2013. It always is.

    [The Loop](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7647419/1/) \[The Amazing World of Gumball\] - Gumball is having the worst day ever, and it's not ending there. In fact, it's not ending at all! Gumball is stuck in a time loop and if he ever wants tomorrow to come he has to get to the bottom of what's causing it.

    [Hard Reset](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset) \[MLP:FiM\] - Twilight Sparkle relives the changeling invasion of Canterlot repeatedly. First in a series.

    [Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder) \[MLP:FiM\] - A fanfic of the above series where Twilight Sparkle *isn't* the only time looper.

    [The Best Night Ever](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/the-best-night-ever) \[MLP:FiM\] - Prince Blueblood thought the Grand Galloping Gala was over. He thought he could just go to sleep and put it behind him. He never expected to be reliving the same disaster of a day, over and over... and over.

  Just discovered the manga [Hyakuman-jou Labyrinth](https://myanimelist.net/manga/87922/Hyakuman-jou_Labyrinth) Evidently it's completed, but the sketchy manga reading website I use is only up to chapter 9. So far it's been a pretty engrossing read, as the characters try to discover the rules of the world around them. Except they're videogame QA, so they do so by trying to *break* the world, which is pretty funny.

    [Siren Song](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/siren-song-worm-x-the-gamer-oc.633613/) is *okay*, though the main character doesn't grab me the same as A Bad Name's.  
    [The Paragamer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-paragamer-worm-the-gamer-w-ocs.496126/) is an even harder sell, but has a nice "Life in a post-Endbringer city" arc in the beginning.

    Very clever and rational.
    ```

      El-Ahrairah goes for the optimal rationalization experience at the expense of character.  I don't think I've ever seen a Taylor written to be as unlikeable as the one in that fic. The amount of condescending dialogue where she lectures adults twice her age... Man, it just took me out of the story and made me recognize that cool powers and rational protagonists are good and all, but investment in the characters requires a sympathetic protagonist.

      This is what I mean by the dialogue: 

      > "It's true, Shadow Stalker," I said. "Incidentally, your actions against me earlier this month were a violation of your probation. Doubly so, in light of the fact that those actions induced a Trigger Event. The Protectorate was quite eager to score points with me by sacrificing you." I met her eyes; my power told me where they were, despite the mask. "But I plead your case, on the condition that you be watched more closely. You're scum, but your power is useful, and if I'm being honest I'm rather grateful that a cape was involved--the academic literature suggests that that's what made me a partial Trump. Still, make no mistake, Sophia Hess: you remain free only so long as I want you free. Now sit down and shut up."

    My story on royalroad has almost 4000 followers. I got them by doing basically nothing other than writing the story and adding cover art. There are lots of hungry readers out there looking for stories. "Build it and they will come" is pretty fitting advice.

    Look at Mother of Learning as an example. Before it was added to royalroad the story had basically zero find-ability unless you already knew what you were looking for. Yet it had a huge fanbase.

    As both a reader and a (sort of) author I'd recommend that you just focus on writing the story. If you can output consistently and often that will be enough of an advertisement. I'll at least try out most stories on royalroad that are over a hunded pages, sound vaguely interesting, and seem to update at least once a week.

            I've never really thought of it as a rational story, so I've never posted it around here. The main character isn't stupid, but he definitely isn't a genius either. The world is only slowly becoming internally consistent as I write more. I make up limitations on myself as I go.

            The MC gains 'perks' based on how they've lived their past lives. I've never really had the MC munchkin the perk system.

            I do avoid Deus Ex Machina when it comes to saving my MC's life. Reincarnating is part of the story, so if he gets into an unwinnable situation he tends to either die or successfully run away.

  You know, I don't think I've ever seen Larry Dahners or his [Ell Donsaii](https://www.goodreads.com/series/96454-ell-donsaii) books mentioned on this sub. They are pure popcorn literature - Mary Sue OP protagonist, wish fulfillment, action heavy, highly repetitive, and honestly not terribly rational.

  But, they scratch a very nice itch for mutchkining a random piece science without going too deep into things (which almost always bogs down a story for me). It's what I imagine you would get if you tried to hollywoodize a hard scifi book. Each book is an exploration into what you could do if X technology were real (mini wormholes, harnessing quantum entanglement, gene manipulation, etc.).

  Looking for any and all zombie stories.

  Preferred: Action focused, written in the first person, or a clear showcasing and breakdown of critical thinking.

  Hard Avoid: Flowery language, romance-centric, and short stories.

  The Walking Dead, The Enemy, Day by Day Armageddon, and The Forest of Hands and Teeth are some of my favorites. I'm not asking for the best of the best, instead, I'm wanting to find hidden gems you might know about so I don't have to spend hours scrolling through romance fanfiction.  If any are rational, even deconstructions, I'm doubly excited to read it.

      That was a sample chapter in an anthology book called The New Dead I read years ago, but I think it was called family business or something then.  I didn't realize it was more than a short story and am picking it up now! 

      Funny enough, that book and The Living Dead were the reason I specifically asked for anything but short stories. When they came out, most of the short stories were professionally written but it was easy to tell that the authors were forced to adhere to the editors standards. That usually led to abrupt or unsatisfying endings, with the concepts just interesting enough to look into more of their work.

      Fun bit of information, George R.R Martin had a short story about zombie prostitutes in one of them as some of his early work.

  I'm looking for a web serial I read some time ago to see if it has been updated since. Plot points that I remember:

  * A person from the "ordinary world" ends up in a magical world,
  * The magical world has late middle ages / 18th century technology,
  * There are multiple provinces or countries or something fighting each other,
  * He starts introducing technology based on more modern ideas, and combining magic with it, kind of like a substitute for steam,
  * Magic can be encoded in circuits, he builds tools and weapons that allow ordinary people to use it without training,
  * Builds a mana power grid for the city.
  * Much of the plot focuses on the technical and social effects of introducing new technology.

  I've looked through the top lists of of popular stories, but none of them seem to be it.
  ```

  - u/Random_Cheerio:
    ```
    That's a pretty generic description, do you remember any names or keywords? My best guess would have to be A Hero's War. It focuses on one of the protagonists raising demi-humans up to help them combat zombies and humans.  It starts off by breaking the world down around him and gaining a better understanding of magic, but eventually shifts to the social and economic ramifications of what he's doing.
