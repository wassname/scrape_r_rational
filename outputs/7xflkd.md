  Well, we have a proper shitpost on the sub. It was a good ride everyone.

    I believe the honor of the first shitpost goes to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7ixx0p/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_78_grinding_stone/dr28ga3/)

  In hindsight it was pretty obvious.  Still, finding out that /u/cthulhuraejepsen was secretly [](#s "/u/alexanderwales") was the highlight of my day.

    I dunno. I don't think it was that obvious. There are some similarities in writing style, but there were differences as well. It does well explain why /u/alexanderwales was so slow with the writing lately, though. lol

      There's one thing that really ought to have tipped me off, but didn't: in that "Piss off r/rational in one sentence" thread, he says,

      >"You can suspend your disbelief about dragons but not inconsistent travel times?"

      And this reminded me of a post I'd seen by Wales where he discussed that being a pet peeve of his at great length. So I thought to myself,

      >Oh, what a coincidence, cthulhuraejepsen and alexanderwales have the exact same complaint. But maybe it's not a coincidence. Aha! Clearly, the former is making a reference to the post made by the latter, and everyone else has noticed this clever in-joke and upvoted accordingly.

      Whereupon I dismissed the matter and never thought about it again, until the reveal in the most recent chapter thread.
      ```
