## Beatrix Potter and the Methods of Rationality

### Post:

I have no story here, just a meme that wormed its way into my head after reading a comment in another sub. The Tale of Mister Tod seems particularly appropriate.

  Went back and read [the original](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19805/19805-h/19805-h.htm)... and more than ever want a rational version of Mister Tod, where the protagonists actually win through their own efforts rather than lucking out because the predators were channeling the Three Stooges.

    But that's the essence of Beatrix Potter's stories.

      Hence the need to subvert them.

    I've noticed this is a repeated theme in many stories...predator is super hungry, captures someone to go eat them....and then locks them away and takes a nap or some other _extremely_ drawn out lead up to actually eating.  At least in the Hobbit, Gandalf got the trolls arguing about how to cook the dwarves, justifying the drawn out wait.

    Actually, there's your hook, maybe.  Baby bunnies get snatched, protagonists get the badger all tided up trying to figure out how to best eat them, while another lures back the fox to enable grabbing the babies when both predators are distracted with each other.

    I also want to see Mr Fisher's aquaculture system, to avoid dangerous fishing trips out on the open water.

      The forest version of killing James Bond by leaving him alone locked up in an elaborate Heath Robinson gadget using lasers and sharks.

    Uh.  Let's start with the opening part.

    1. A rabbit is speaking with a badger, who is known to eat rabbits when hungry.

    2. The badger complains of extreme hunger.

    3. The rabbit invites the badger inside, where his children are sleeping.

    4. Then smokes a lot and falls asleep.

    5. The baby rabbits are taken as a snack.

    (I don't have enough emphasis tags to express my opinion of this... idiocy)

    Fundamentally, a rational story is going to work a **lot** harder to set up #1 through #4 than to justify a fight between the fox and the badger.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      Step #4 explains steps #1-#3, depending on what he's smoking. Of course when Benjamin Bunny arrives, he discovers a pile of gnawed rabbit bones instead of a sleeping rabbit.

      Alternatively, the old rabbit is nudge nudge wink wink offering Tommy Brock something a bit tastier so he doesn't get eaten instead. Protection racket woodlands style.
      ```
