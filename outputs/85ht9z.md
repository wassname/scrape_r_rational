## Rational self-insert fanfiction?

  Probably best to look on forums like SB and SV. Here's two:

  **With This Ring** is probably the closest fit: it has a somewhat rational SI who transmigrates to the DC universe, but he loses his memories of the future for the particular universe he ends up in. He does keep memories of what happens in alternate DC universes and extrapolates from there, but it isn't technically "future knowledge". (Updates DAILY!)

  **Cruel to be Kind** is another, but here the SI gains the power to transmigrate to and from different fictional worlds, and so isn't forced to stick around for the conflicts or play by their universe rules. For example, he can grab high tech spaceships from Star Wars and use them to fight Kromagg aliens from Sliders. He ultimately picks a normal universe with an unpopulated Earth and builds an empire there, only going to other story universes for trade and war. (Abandoned, I think. Still, 600+ chapters before that happens.)

  **Worth the Candle** on AO3 is the first one that comes to mind, where a teenager from Kansas is transported to an amalgamation of narrative fantasy worlds in a tabletop style. It's one I got into recently, and is very highly followed on this site. Updates fairly frequently.

  **Marked for Death** is a Naruto quest on SV, where the participating posters create plans of action to guide a custom character and his team through the world. Less of a straight story, since it uses a variety of tabletop mechanics. Was paused for a little while due to a system transition, but I think it's back on now. Updates at least once a week.

  **Sleeping with the Girls** is on FFnet, which follows an average Joe through several different anime universes, and almost getting killed several times in the process. Slowed down in recent years, but still gets some sporadic updates.

    Worth the Candle and marked for death is not really a self insert fanfiction since the former is an original work and the ladder MC is playing a character of the naruto universe. But I will check out sleeping with the girls!

  In addition to "With this Ring" let me recommend [Sleeping with Girls](https://www.google.ee/url?q=https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality) about rational anime worlds jumper.
