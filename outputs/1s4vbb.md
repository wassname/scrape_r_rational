  Okay, this is testing the ground because these stories have the same problems as Ender's Shadow - The author giving Sherlock the answers directly. But the data that Holmes uses to make deductions are occasionally available in the text to the reader - the reader's challenge is to make Holmes's inference in advance. The Sherlock Holmes stories are intended to be exercises in attention to detail, which is surely a useful skill for a rationalist.

  It's not puritan rationalist fiction, I can admit that.

    I dunno, I'd say the signal-to-noise ratio is too low, which is to say that the number of times we are actually given the data instead of just believing what Mr. Holmes says is minimal. Mr. Holmes suffers too much of Deus Ex Machina inferences.
