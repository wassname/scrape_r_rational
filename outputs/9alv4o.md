  On a side note, given that the Crusaders negotiated the treaty with the Queen in Callow and not the Kingdom, that means the treaty was made with a fae.

  Which means that Pilgrim breaking the terms of the truce, means he's broken it with a Fae. Which should mean that Pilgrim has fucked himself over in regards to Cat.

  People in story make a bit of Catherine being reactive instead of proactive as the source of her problems, but everytime she tries to be proactive something stomps along to kick her teeth in. She's always going to be on the backfoot purely from being in the same arena as people who were moving years before she started. Every attempt to build something that might survive her is smothered in the crib. Hell, in interlude chapters people like Warlock and Malicia look on her as an incipient corpse. Or maybe this is just the start of the purification process the dead king talked about.

  And despite her stroke against Callow, Malicia seems to have abandoned her original objective with Black and moved away from calcifying Praes into something less obscene and more into a functional nation. The truebloods are gone, but far from forgotten. Those institutions are beholden to the calamities, who are loyal to Black - who has lost faith in her. She's riding a tiger that's trying to buck her and short all the tools she had before, with new threats to replace the old ones.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I think Catherine still has a fighting chance to build a lasting nation, even with the latest setbacks.

    Her court was decapitated, but the assassins targeting her army were intercepted, which shows that the Jacks (and Black's men) are a match for Malicia's spies. She just needs to get better at defensive warfare: covering all fronts, hunting harder for enemy spies, making examples of anyone she finds, etc.
    ```

  How are there people left in Callow to fight? It seems the place churns our endless legions. The crash of too-few farmers is going to suck.
  ```

  - u/panchoadrenalina:
    ```
    Medieval style armies are tiny compared to the potential manpower pool. Imagining callow population to be in the few millions and there have been raised something like a few thousands soldiers. The previous army of callow had a large core of wastelander soldiers. 

    Calernian armies have an even bigger manpower pool because girl powah lets girls fight. Cats bottle neck has always been in the money department.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      The populations probably not as high as you might think, given that food from Callow is limited by the terrible farming practices the gnomes keep people using, and also how they have to feed Praes and Praes' armies. There was that slight issue of a hundred thousand people plus being wiped out at Liesse, which is generally just not great for the entire south of Callow, or it's economic and agricultural situation. and then all the people Praes has killed over the years of its occupation (which, IIRC, is *also* in the six digits).

      This becomes an issue when Callow routinely does things like get its soldiers stranded in hell, or explicitly use the Callowan soldiers as meat shields to keep the Praesi alive. They've lost half their army several times in a row now.

      And now there are new mouths being sent by Malicia for Callow to feed. And the southern farms were essentially bombed.

      But even ignoring that, think about what Ratface  (may he rest in peace) says:

      >"I understand the Hellhound is riding you about funding for the army, but another thousand men will make no difference if we can’t pay those soldiers.”

      Callow is, as we've been told over and over again is all but broke. There were concerns about just maintaining the army as it was, let alone rebuilding one, or making an army that can "shake the continent". Like, it's all well and good for Cat to order the treasury emptied, but we've been told many times that it already *is* empty. And Callow has no trade, no one it can borrow money from. How are they going to pay and provision soldiers?

      This is something of a huge deal. I'm hoping that this is the main focus of the next book, and not something glossed over while Cat runs around stabbing people.
      ```

      - u/Gr_Cheese:
        ```
        > How are they going to pay and provision soldiers?

        I think there was an argument about Callow minting their own currency, which fell on the side of not because it would be seen as antagonistic to the Tower. I can't find that tidbit at the moment. I think it involved Ratface.

        As for provisioning soldiers? If by "the southern farms were essentially bombed" you mean the Summer Fae incursion, then that was not explicitly stated, was it? The Fae were targeting people, presumably in population centers like small towns or cities, not torching land. Land doesn't scream. The Fae can't hunt land. So, the crops in the south were not necessarily lost. And rural farmers probably avoided death by dint of being too sparse to bother with.

        Money is the most immediate problem for Callow's war machine. If the army doesn't pay, people desert, but Callowan patriotism might mitigate desertion. Anyway, the money problem can be addressed by Callow minting their own currency, then pushing the problem on into the future where spoils of war or land grants or militarily enforced foreign trade could make up the difference. As you've mentioned, Callow does not have any foreign trade now that the Tower has cut them off, so they can pull all sorts of monetary shenanigans without making themselves worse off right off the bat. If they can manage the transition between foreign coin and Callowan coin then avoid military induced inflation in the local prices of necessities, they're golden.

        Hell, without foreign trade siphoning it away, Callow probably has a surplus of food.

        The less immediate problem for Callow's war machine is acquiring the materials with which to wage war, which off the top of my head I classify as: 1) food, 2) shelter, 3) armaments, 4) supply train, 5) siege machines, 6) goblin munitions. 

        1. Food is something that Callow has in abundance, this is cannon from the Black Knight's little black book.

        2. Shelter is presumably not a today problem, because it's not winter and they're still in Callow--so they may rely on existing garrison infrastructure. 

        3. **Armaments are a problem.** Gotta get that good steel. Probably from the Goblins or the Deoraithe. I don't remember Callow proper being described as having mines. This is doubly important for the Drow plan Cat is going with, since the Drow were described as low tech. This needs to be addressed in-universe in my opinion.

        4. Expanding supply trains is not a today problem either. Callow is raising armies, likely near garrisons and cities. This only becomes an issue for new mobilization, which occurs after training.

        5. Siege machines! Pickler's were nuked. This is a concern for the next armed conflict, but that next conflict might still be a ways off. There's nothing to suggest that these require anything scarcer than time to build--timber and rope are common.

        6. Goblin munitions are being addressed, re: the envoy mentioned in this chapter.

        I think it would have been better had Cat said 'Well, time to print our own currency' than 'Empty the treasury'. And also addressed armaments as well as munitions with the emissary. Otherwise we're on point for a huge army... and Callow as a failed state if that army is not successful enough.
        ```

        - u/werafdsaew:
          ```
          They're already minting their own coins (which requires precious metal), and paper money is not popular at this tech level.

            You're right.

            > “Our own coin is slowly displacing the others,” Baroness Kendall pointed out. “Patience might be the wisest answer.”

            > The Taghreb shook his head.

            > “We’re replacing old Callowan coinages,” he said. “We barely touched the Wasteland portion. The Carrion Lord spent decades making certain Callow was dependent on Imperial coin for trade, it is not work that can be undone in a few years’ span. Not unless we plan and invest.” - Chapter 1: Observatory

            It's a shame they don't have paper money.

            Are war bonds that far fetched of an idea? Exchangeable for Callowan gold at a later date? I feel like some economic fuckery is necessary here, Callow isn't supposed to be able to afford this.
            ```

        - u/Agnoman:

          >I think there was an argument about Callow minting their own currency, which fell on the side of not because it would be seen as antagonistic to the Tower. I can't find that tidbit at the moment. I think it involved Ratface.

          As Werafdsaew pointed out, this is something they're already trying to do, with already existing issues. And Ratface is gone, unfortunately for Cat and Callow.

          >As for provisioning soldiers? If by "the southern farms were essentially bombed" you mean the Summer Fae incursion, then that was not explicitly stated, was it? The Fae were targeting people, presumably in population centers like small towns or cities, not torching land. Land doesn't scream. The Fae can't hunt land. >So, the crops in the south were not necessarily lost. And rural farmers probably avoided death by dint of being too sparse to bother with.

          Not so, unfortunately for Callow. Back in between Summer and the Diabolist, and before the latest round of slaughter (and before Malicia started sending refugees specifically to be a problem) Cat said:

          >Ahead of us lay plains that had once been green, before Summer came to own them. Now half the land was scorched black and the rest lusher than was possible in Creation. Orchards bore fruits regardless of the season, fields already harvested grew again tall and golden wheat. **There would be food shortages, in the coming months.** My homeland had seen war twice in three years, this one even more devastating than the last. **Even if the blackened earth was made cultivable again, how many of those fields would lack men to till them?** Summer had killed many, harmed more and I knew Akua would bring deeper wounds still. 

          *Chapter 39 Exposition*

          And now they've pulled out farmers from Fields.

          >As you've mentioned, Callow does not have any foreign trade now that the Tower has cut them off, so they can pull all sorts of monetary shenanigans without making themselves worse off right off the bat. If they can manage the transition between foreign coin and Callowan coin then avoid military induced inflation in the local prices of necessities, they're golden.

          I'm sure there are lots of clever options available, but the book has stressed many times how difficult this is going to be for Callow, and now most of the experts who would have dealt with these problems are dead, and there are major issues with replacing them. 

          This is a storm of critical issues that Cat needs to deal with, and I think she needs to do it on screen.
          ```

          - u/Gr_Cheese:
            ```
            Between what you and Werafdsaew have brought up, I am absolutely convinced. Saying "Empty the treasury!" does not magically solve these problems. Callow is not in good shape, and it's stretching plausibility for the Hellhound to have enough runway in coin, food, and equipment to raise her continent shaking army.
            ```

        - u/Mountebank:
          ```
          As for armaments, I remember it being mentioned that everyone in Callow kept weapons, swords and such, they've inherited hidden solely for occasions just like this. It's a tradition. Whenever things get bad enough in Callow the common folk grab their family's sword and go fight back.

          And presumably they've scavenged a lot of armaments from their battle against the crusade as well.
          ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            > I remember it being mentioned that everyone in Callow kept weapons, swords and such, they've inherited hidden solely for occasions just like this.

            And even if those aren't enough, Catherine could simply decree "Everyone who isn't going to war, give your weapons to your neighbor who is!", and melt the surplus equipment.

            > And presumably they've scavenged a lot of armaments from their battle against the crusade as well.

            I'm not quite sure. Most of the crusaders either drowned in a lake that became a marsh, or ran away. I don't think there was much lootable gear to be found, especially since most of the crusaders were under-equipped. I guess Catherine should have requested for all their weapons to be confiscated when she made the ceasefire treaty. (although if she'd done that, now they'd be defenseless against the Dead King)
            ```

            - u/Gr_Cheese:
              ```
              Don't the Legions wear chain and/or plate? Don't their enemies use inferior metal armors? This strikes me as a problem that needs to be addressed. I don't think peasants have chain or plate lying around.

              But sure, Callow could melt down all of their spare metal. Kind of like Mao Zedong during the Great Leap Forward. 

              > Twenty-two thousand soldiers had come to these plains, and now less than fifteen thousand remained fighting fit. - Interlude: Kaleidoscope V

              A maximum of 7,000 invaders dead before Cat wakes up from her lake induced coma. Scavenge armaments? Maybe. We don't have granular details on the treaty, but assuming Cat retained ownership of leftovers then you're still counting on a salvage operation that involves some degree of lake.

              That's stretching it a bit.
              ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I was thinking, we're getting increasingly close to the "regular hero Catherine" alternate universe where Callow becomes a super-militarized country that is inevitably going to turn to invasion and pillage to make up for its collapsing infrastructure and lack of farming.
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  > "The highest-ranking officer in the city was a Senior Tribune by the name of Abigail."

  Calling it now: all shall hail Abigail! All hail Dream Empress Irritated, The Inexplicably Successful!

  > “Pull back all the people in the Fields to Summerholm,” I finally said. “Have them bring every bag of grain and herd of cattle back with them while they do. The refugees won’t keep coming if there’s nothing to be had.”

  Not cool, Cat. Refugees are people too. :(
  ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  So if Juniper could build an army within six months, why do they need the drow? Pull back to Callow, reinforce and recruit, and invade Praes in half a year. Sure, Procer's gonna be brutalized, but they have their entire army + 30,000 Levantines to stall The Dead King for months. And with his invasion of Procer, the need for an army immediately disappears, no? Ashur will keep Praesi forces divided on defense and unable to invade Callow. Hell, the best plan might be for Cat to try and recruit and extract Black. She already knows him, his spies stopped Malicia from gutting Cat's officers, and I doubt he'll be too thrilled with TDK joining Malicia. He knows the narrative implications of such an act, after all.

    ```
    Also, strictly speaking, didn't Cat get just about everything she set out to gain from the Dead King? Her goal was to use his invasion to take the threat off of Callow, while maintaining plausible deniability. This is exactly what she currently has, save that she was not able to negotiate a delay that would let civilians.

    On the other hand, scrying is not necessarily secure. We've been told this on any number of occasions, and explicitly in this chapter. Whether or not she is headed for the drow lands, I suspect that she said this meaning for it to be overheard. Just as likely, it's a bit of misdirection before she heads somewhere else. Or maybe even the whole gang will go to Thalassina to see Warlock.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      >Also, strictly speaking, didn't Cat get just about everything she set out to gain from the Dead King?

      That's just what I was thinking. She needed an army to stop Procer from invading again, and now that Procer is going to be invaded instead, Cat doesn't have an immediate need for an army. The only real danger is TDK and Praes turning on her after Procer is destroyed. Or, y'know, TDK taking over the world. Which is a legitimate concern, but I'm not sure if trying to get the drow on board is going to be much better, if it's even possible.
      ```

      - u/ricree:
        ```
        She didn't even really "need an army". Her plan at the start was explicitly *not* to ally with Keter in any public way, but instead to use his "completely independent" invasion as a counterpoint that would strengthen her own position.
        ```

      Malicia keeps kicking Cat, and some parts of Callow are described as poor for farming. What's to stop her having written in a provision about the King getting a chunk of Callow? One of the bits Malicia doesn't want, of course.
      ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    They don't have half a year. They had four months befor Papenhein would have digged a pass through Red Flower mountains, and they already spent over a half of that.

    Also, the Levantines are to the south of the Iserran lake and will have to move either against the Black Knight or the Tyrant, which means that the only force that's going to be in Dead King's path for now are twenty five thousand beaten and half-starved crusaders, eleven heroes that had trouble holding back Cat, much less Revenants, and whatever garrisons that will be left in Cleves and Hainaut by the time they arrive.

      They have to stop digging now or the DK is going to murder-rape their entire kingdom, Callow is safe from Procer until that war is over which could take years.
