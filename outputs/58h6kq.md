  Some of you may remember the recommendation of the novel, *Forty Millenniums of Cultivation*, posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/) which did a great job of hyping up the novel but with no English translations available (*grumble, grumble* people should go to jail for tormenting me like that!) it was a teaser like only seeing the trailer of an amazing movie coming out in 50 years from now.

  However, I just happened to check on /r/noveltranslations today out of random curiosity and found announcement posts of [Chapter 1,2](https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/5689mw/cn_forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_chapter_1/) and [Chapter 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/57dfvs/cn_forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_chapter_3/).

  It appears to be updating at a slow rate of roughly a chapter every week, so it's slow compared to other wuxia novels online which update daily. Therefore, I would recommend bookmarking it and waiting until there are more chapters. But at the very least leave a comment on the website to encourage the noble and valiant translator, Strivon! S/he doesn't seem to be an alternate account of /u/Drazelic according to this [page](https://friendshipispower.wordpress.com/about/).

    ahahahaahhaaaaa oh my god I was *just* about to start the translation of it myself *today* actually!

    I'm betting that this was elicited by the fact that someone in the FMoC reviews section said something along the lines of 'man all the other big novels have english fandoms, when are WE going to get an english translation?'

    I mean, *that* was my impetus for deciding to finally start the translation today. But Cakefleet is doing a damn good job of it so far!

      Heh, heh. You could collaborate with the guy if you want. He even mentions on the site's about page trying to message you about it, but didn't get a reply [here](https://friendshipispower.wordpress.com/about/):

        My typing is a little jilted because *eeeeeeee* i am filled with VISCERAL excitement and uncontrollable joy. It's finally happening! God, if this translation goes all the way, with a bit of spit-polish I fully expect this story to become one of the great works of the r/Rational canon.

        *so excited*

      I'm too lazy to copy and paste the direct quotes from Drazelic's original post recommending the story, but he says that the author of FMoC was inspired by both franchises so the references are likely not a coincidence.

    ```

- u/Drazelic:

  One thing that I feel like I really actually have to mention, right now:

  One of my friends suggested that I start a wiki to sort of crowdsource the translation; this is probably going to be necessary to get this translation finished on any sort of timely basis. Let me explain why.

  Cultivation40k currently has 1500 chapters, and the author has said they plan on another year or so of writing before the story's wrapped up. They update with anywhere from two to four updates, every day. Best case scenario, this means another thousand or so chapters, making the book's total length somewhere around 2500 chapters- and I fully expect it to stretch on to 3000 chapters, because you never know when the author's creative genius is going to act up and he's going to toss in ANOTHER planetary-scale plot-arc just because he can.

  Now, to do the math: 

  The current translator's schedule is, I've been told, to update with one chapter per week. *One chapter per week.* Do the math, and it turns out that, working alone, Strivon will be finished with Cultivation40k in, oh... *fifty years or so!*

  (1 update per week = 50-ish updates per year. 2500 chapters divided by 50 chapters per year equals 50 years.)

  *Fifty.*

  *Years.*

  (And that's the optimistic guess for if the author writes the *least amount possible*. I have too much faith in the author to believe that something like this would actually happen.)

  It would be easier for most non-Chinese speakers to *just learn Chinese* over the next fifty years rather than wait for this translation to be finished.

  I tried doing some translation tonight. Over the course of six hours or so, I translated three chapters to my own satisfaction and got most of the way through a fourth. Let's just round that up to four chapters in a single day for the purposes of our calculations.

  I cannot be this productive and translate this much every day, obviously. I have other things in my life, after all, so let's make the (slightly optimistic) assumption that I can do four chapters per *week* on a regular basis indefinitely.

  Even if you add my translation rate in, assuming I can match the productivity I had tonight, and round it up to 4 chapters, five chapters a week would still mean *twelve years* before the translation is fully finished.

  *This is not a task doable by any single human being.* If Cultivation40k is to be fully translated into english on any sort of sane timeframe, it's gonna have to be a really, really, really big team effort. Six or seven people working simultaneously at the very least (and honestly more than that would probably be a good idea) with a shared vocabulary base defined on a wiki page beforehand so people don't make up different translations for the same term without each other's knowledge.

  So- yeah, um. I'm not really sure what to do about this either. This is kind of above my pay grade. (Which, since none of us are getting paid here, is really essentially *nothing*, after all.) I just figured I'd let you guys know about the numbers and statistics, here.

  Plus, don't forget- the story's 1500+ chapters long right now, right? The *really good stuff*, the r/rational-relevant stuff about piercing the heavens, doing the impossible, and the themes about trust and betrayal and geopolitics and clever slytherin plotting and the question of whether human society can escape from the molochian deathtrap and the struggle for muggle rights in a world run by immortal wizards and the relative merits of darwinism and egalitarianism- all that only gradually starts to appear around chapter 100 or so.

  I dunno about you guys, but chapter 100 feels very, *very* far away to me right now.

  :(

  -------

  Other fun facts: My translation of 3.75 chapters had about 8,000 words in it. Using that as a benchmark, assuming chapter lengths remain constant, we can extrapolate the whole length of Cultivation40k at this time of posting as around 3,300,000 words, and its projected length upon completion to be anywhere from 6,000,000 words to 7,000,000 words.

  That's a lot of words.

  The original Harry Potter series altogether was somewhere around 1,000,000 words, if I remember correctly. HPMOR was somewhere in the vicinity of 600,000 to 700,000. Worm was 1,680,000 words, according to a cursory google search I just did.

  This story is *already* five times as long as HPMOR.

  *This story will be ten times as long as HPMOR.*

  *This story will be four to five times as long as Worm.*

  Think about that for a moment.

  I really wanted to take the task of translating this whole thing onto my own shoulders- I really did. Then I did the math, and... I don't think I can do it alone, and Strivon- well, brave, poor soul that they are, I don't think anybody can buckle down and keep translating something for fifty years. At that sort of timescale we're talking a crapshoot whether they're even going to *live long enough to finish.*

    It would be faster to improve current machine translation programs to decent quality!

    The only solution I can think of is to recommend it to wuxiaworld.com and hope they pick it up. For example, one of the longer stories is *I Shall Seal the Heavens* which clocks in at ~1,650 chapters total. Deathblade has been translating it at roughly a year and is up ~1,050 chapters. I also think the chapter lengths are roughly equivalent between it and *Forty Millenniums of Cultivation* so they are capable of translating it in a short time span which is reasonable since for many of them, translating is literally a full-time job.

    So you're saying we need some kind of AI to translate this.

    I'm psyched to read this story even though I've never read a Chinese novel, but the sheer length of it has me worried about pacing. How can a story go on without padding itself out? This has got to be a record for longest continuous narrative written by a single author, but can he really maintain a consistent level of quality throughout? I don't want Sturgeon's Law to apply to a single work.

    I probably shouldn't be worried considering that I've enjoyed webcomics like Sluggy Freelance, Freefall, and El Goonish Shive with extremely long and slow story arcs, but those had the advantage of all being comedies first and foremost. The story is good, even great at times, but because every page has a punchline it remains consistently entertaining even when it plods.

      Well, I mean, it's subjective, your mileage may vary, this is just my opinion, etc. etc.

      After 1500+ chapters, I haven't even *remotely* begun to get sick of the story. Quite the opposite- I'm more excited *now* than ever! It's just gotten better and better and more and more engaging, and the author's never let me down yet. The sheer volume is mostly generated by the crazy amount of worldbuilding and character-building introspection. It's long, but it's long because it's detailed and rich. There are no 'filler' arcs, as far as I can tell; every arc deals with a meaningful social, political, or economic commentary, throwing revelation after revelation at you in chains of intelligent analysis that just keeps building on each other.

      *(In case you cant tell, I think this story is basically perfect in every single way- so take my reviews with a grain of salt! Not going to try and sugarcoat it- I am a diehard fan of this serial in every single way. I haven't enjoyed a story this much in a very, very long time.*

  ... is there a reason this isn't 'millennia'?

  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Paging /u/Drazelic, since s/he was the one to originally translate the title this way, then maybe Drazelic can explain?

    When I looked on [OED](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118508?redirectedFrom=millennium#eid) to see the proper pluralization of millennium, they are both valid spellings with millennia being the more common variant. I would guess the reason for the two different spellings to be valid is because the millennia version is due to millennium's heritage as a borrowed Latin word (and the -a stem in Latin indicates pluralization), but millenniums is also valid since millennium is (now) an English word.

    Oxford English Dictionary:

    > Inflections: Plural *millennia, millenniums.*

    Languages can be very messy.
    ```

    - u/Drazelic:
      ```
      I picked millenniums because I didn't like the two-consecutive-vowels sound of 'millennia of'. It bled together into 'millenniof' when I said it out loud.

      The chinese format of the title is literally 'Cultivation 40k' in an isomorphic format to 'Warhammer 40k'. If you like Millennia better, that's your prerogative, whatevs!

      I might go with 'Cultivation in the 40th Millennium' for my own version, actually- I have several significant points of dis-satisfaction with the existing translation, which are systematic issues that I feel like would be easier to address with a flat-out rewrite rather than with suggestions and edits.

      Competition is good for economics, right?

        > Competition is good for economics, right?

        That depends and is not something I want to get into without a semester long course in Game Theory....

        > The chinese format of the title is literally 'Cultivation 40k' in an isomorphic format to 'Warhammer 40k'.

        Why not just name it that: Cultivation 40K? Also I personally found *Forty Millenniums of Cultivation* to be a **very** catchy title that stands out from other Xianxia titles which can be very generic.

        > I have several significant points of dis-satisfaction with the existing translation

        I'm actually curious, what are the issues that stand out to you? Also have you been in contact with Strivon?
        ```

        - u/Drazelic:
          ```
          Also, this is my parallel attempt at translating the first 3.75 chapters, if you're curious to compare and contrast. I say 3.75 because I took a break during the 4th chapter.

          https://www.dropbox.com/s/i4m4k24k324uz9s/Ch1.docx?dl=0

          My philosophy of translation tries to emphasize the spirit of the reading experience over the literal wording, which is an issue that honestly bothers me a lot about the whole literalist translation paradigm over at noveltranslations. Like, look, I don't care how *literally accurate* the definition is, if one is translating the mystic elixirs, tinctures, and medicines concocted by Cultivator alchemists with ancient magic as mere *pills*, then something has gone very very wrong with that translation's ability to *actually deliver an immersive experience with proper awe and grandeur.* When I read Xianxia, I want a sense of mysticism and grandeur. I do not want my goddamn kung fu wizards popping *pills* every time they get hurt.

          (Luckily, nothing like that has happened in this translation, yet. But that's pretty much the first thing that comes to mind when I think about the 'average' level of translation most xianxia novels get, and it's a fate I'd much love to avoid for Cultivation40k.)

          I'm not sure myself on whether this is a significant enough improvement on the experience- if it's an improvement at all- to warrant me, well, basically doing the dick thing of pushing my way in and being all like 'outta the way, i've got this'. Because that *would* be a dick move, but the alternative is to just sit there and stew in my own personal dissatisfaction that the translation doesn't deliver the experience I feel it ought to, right? Be the change you want to see and all that. I'd like to avoid being presumptuous here, if I could.

            You're definitely good enough to have made it a more immerse reading experience, yeah.

          - u/BlueSigil:
            ```
            Personally, I would love it if you and Strivon partnered up. Two people means that we get to read chapters twice as fast. :)
            ```

        - u/Drazelic:
          ```
          Overal literalism, for the most part, and that's a systematic issue that's just not something that can be edited out, because it comes directly from the stylistic preferences and technical limitations of the translator themselves. There's also some grammatical issues and at least one case of total mistranslation, but those can be corrected without total rewrites. 

          Literalism is an easy issue to fall into with translation, because the original text is *right there* and the natural urge is to trace the original text as closely as possible, but a lot of the things from the translation seem to be trying too hard to retain perfect fidelity down to the sentence structure. This doesn't work very well when translating between languages with different grammatical rules. A lot of sentence structures that sound totally fine in Chinese sound awfully janky and riddles with passive voice in English, and the translator either didn't take the liberty of editing their translation for flow, or they just didn't realize they'd slipped into passive voice. 

          Also, there are some literal translations of idioms that seem really out of place, but that might be subjective. I'm mostly thinking of 'jade tree in the wind' right now. There's such a concept as a weirdness tolerance, where one wants to translate terms with approximately the same level of exoticness in both the original and translated texts, because people pay attention to things that stand out and this can be used to tell readers 'hey this concept is important'. When one translates foreign idioms literally without any forewarning it stands out in stark contrast to the rest of the translation, like a painting where somebody's face is purple for no reason at all; the divergence from the norm demands attention even if the object being depicted is totally reasonable.

          I know that all these issues sound dumb and nitpicky individually, but translation is really about the small things. It's like paving a road- people expect a smooth experience from their ride and notice any bump that shows up, even if it's not all that significant in the long run, because roads are supposed to be smooth, right? I feel like reading experiences are much the same. You expect the translation to run smoothly, and inelegant translation creates frictional costs that reduces the potential readerbase's size down to people who can tolerate the bumpy road.

          I guess I'm a bit harsh on it because I really love the source material and want to see it presented in nothing but the bestest light possible!

          (And, no, I haven't contacted Strivon yet. No real reason, just, I got distracted for a few hours and forgot to do it.)

  Have you guys tried [*Reincarnator*?](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/) It’s not as good as how you’re describing FMoC to be, but it has its interesting moments too (though some plot devices eventually get repetitive).

  On this story itself, I think I’ll at least wait until it’s finished arc-by-arc and read it like that. Because otherwise keeping up with these updates is more frustrating than fun.

  Also, I don’t know what’s the procedure, but maybe it can be arranged for this story to be included in the list of parsed stories on [lnmtl?](http://lnmtl.com/novel) It may work, depending on the difficulty of Chinese used in this story.
