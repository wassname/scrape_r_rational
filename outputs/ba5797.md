## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have the power of Deadspeak (from Lumley's Necroscope series). You can converse with the dead and learn knowledge and skills from them (including paranormal abilities and skills that would otherwise require physical practice, like martial arts).

  Bonus round: you are in the world of Harry Potter.
  ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Honestly I think this ability is incredibly strong. I would predict that most dead people are willing to let you learn their most important skills since they would be interested in leaving a legacy and doubly so when there is no risk of them being outcompeted by an apprentice.

    This does seem to be really powerful in any supernatural framework, however it really shines in the HPMOR universe since it can circumvent the interdict of Merlin and thus be abble to creat say more Deathly Hollows.

    The ability to speak with the dead, even without the skill gain, has lots of useful benefits. You might want to take a look at [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a03yc/pushing_daisies/) about Pushing Daisies for ideas. 

    * Sell "afterlife insurance" once your abilities are public: people can bank up funds pre-death, or dedicate them in their will, which buys your time helping them out after their death at some hourly fixed rate. That could involve sorting out unfinished business, transcribing their novel, identifying their murderer, or simply relaying messages to loved ones. The main issue here might be locating their ghost.
    * If the ghosts have any ability to influence or observe the world, you could parlay this into effective telekinesis or clairvoyance, respectively.
    * You could earn a lot of money from companies with low [Bus factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor): how much would they be willing to pay to regain the expertise of a departed employee who failed to train up a successor, or even just to ask the sysadmin for the root password?
    * Retrieving cryptocurrency keys would also prove very lucrative.
    * Necrojournalism could also be popular, asking what dead authors think of how their work is interpreted, or getting deceased presidents to weigh in on the political issues of the day.

    Learning paranormal abilities seems particularly valuable in the world of Harry Potter. Could you learn a Veela's allure? Are there magical abilities that are costly and harmful to acquire under normal circumstances that you could access with much greater ease? The only one that comes to mind is being able to see Thestrals, which comes with seeing death, but that seems like a given with this particular power.
    ```

    - u/BrilliantShard:
      ```
      I like these ideas! In my fanfic AU you must undergo an abominable ritual to be able to cast the Unforgivables, but I hadn't thought about being able to learn them directly from a shade. A Veela's allure might be stretching it, since that might not work cross species, but a metamorphmagus should be able to gift that ability methinks.
      ```

  - u/BoojumG:
    ```
    I'm unfamiliar with the Necroscope series. What is required to find specific dead people, and how rare is the ability?

    When you say you can "learn" skills that would require practice but without practice, how easy is that? Can I become a master chef by pressing the "learn" button on a dead master chef?
    ```

    - u/BrilliantShard:
      ```
      They linger where their remains are still thinking of what occupied them in life (mathematicians continue solving problems, architects continue designing buildings, authors continue creating stories). The power is unique in the original story. In HP, consider it a power of the Resurrection Stone.
      ```

        Sorry if my ninja edit was too late:

        >When you say you can "learn" skills that would require practice but without practice, how easy is that? Can I become a master chef by pressing the "learn" button on a dead master chef?
        ```

        - u/BrilliantShard:
          ```
          Lol, no worries. The person basically just has to agree to it, and they "give" it to you. You need to converse with them, but they don't need to teach it to you like they learned it. They can't be coerced into giving anything to you, though. You need to be polite. Most are willing to help you out, living vicariously through your accomplishments, though.
          ```

    Could a dead wizard or witch not just gift you their ability at spellcraft and you quickly become a super-mage? What's to stop that from trivialising things?
    ```

    - u/BrilliantShard:
      ```
      Deadspeak doesn't grant physical strength with which to fight, even though the instincts are given, for example. In canon and in my AU, magical strength is determined by a host of factors revolving around maturity and knowledge and social status among other things. Gaining knowledge is a huge factor, so learning from the dead would boost your power, but it's still your power. You wouldn't be able to just download the sum total of the magical might of all the dead of wizardkind. That would definitely be broke and trivialize things. Do you think that's a sufficient limitation?
      ```

      - u/dinoseen:
        ```
        Honestly, I don't think it is. Even with just your own power, supreme skill would be OP. And with all that knowledge, you can probably bootstrap your way to more power if it's at all possible.
        ```

- u/Palmolive3x90g:
  ```
  You have the power to portion off sections of you consciousness at the cost of each section running more slowly. You emotions and memory are effected and experience collectivey by all your consciousnesses so all the yous all still you. You can merge your section together.

  So you could split you consciousness into two sections with each section running at half the speed, in effect experienceing time twise as fast. Or you could split into a hundred sections each with a 1/100 of your total processing power, experienceing time a hundred times as fast. You could also split your mind into two with one section running with 99/100 of you processing power and the other running with 1/100.

  How can you use this?
  ```

  - u/orthernLight:
    ```
    When I want to memorize something, I can create a bunch of sections running at almost no speed, and merge one when I want to remember it - for the slowed section, it seems as if the event I want to remember just happened.

    Also, there are a bunch of cases where it'd be useful to be able to consider two different ideas or possibilities, without my interpretation of the second being biased by having heard the first. So splitting is useful for that.

  So this isn't a problem to be munchkinned or solved, but rather an amusing exploit someone thought up in response to a challenge posted to r/AskReddit that I wanted to share. I wouldn't say that this is rational, but it's the sort of thing that I think people here would appreciate.

  Here's is the link to the thread with this disgusting hypothetical scenario: [How long would you let someone pee on you for $300 a day?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14uee5/how_long_would_you_let_someone_pee_on_you_for_300/?sort=top)

  And here is the link to an interesting way to maximize money earned that someone came up with: [Clean and sell the dirty sheets for even more money.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14uee5/how_long_would_you_let_someone_pee_on_you_for_300/c7gjvip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

  It wasn't a realistic way to do it, but it was so funny that I wanted to share it.

  You have the ability to permanently delete words from a person's vocabulary. Specifically, your ability works by picking a word X, and picking a target person Y from within your memories. If Y does not think the word X in the next 24 hours, Y will have X permanently deleted from their vocabulary and cannot relearn X no matter what. Your ability can be used as often as you want, on as many people as you want, but a person cannot be targeted twice within 24 hours. So each person you target can lose at most one word per day from their vocabulary.

  What can you do with this ability?
  ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    The restriction that they can't think the word in the 24 hours after targeting them seems like the main obstacle, but you might be able to get around that by drugging your targets. If they're unconscious for the full 24 hours, could they still think the word?

    Another way to get around it would be to target babies, or people with a different native language.

    Removing "the", or similar extremely common words, would probably be the most harmful. You might be able to extort people that way, if you can inflict it on enough public figures for it to become a known phenomenon. They could always switch to a different language to get around it, but that could still pose a significant impediment.

    Similarly, you could make babies forget their name before they learn it and use that for blackmail.

    Another approach would be to choose words that are uncommon, then introduce them to the target yourself. For example, being able to set up "What is Aleppo?" incidents with politicians might be enough to sustain a career as a journalist.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      > Removing "the", or similar extremely common words, would probably be the most harmful. 

      I don't know if "the" would be that harmful, depending on exactly how it works: plenty of languages get by without having an equivalent of "the". 

      It'd be a mindfuck as you become completely unable to learn the meaning of an apparently very common word that all your friends and family insist you used all the time, but eventually someone would get frustrated trying to teach you and say "look, it doesn't actually mean anything all that important, just ignore it and you'll still be able to understand what other people are saying". You'd waste money going to neurologists to try to work out what the heck happened,  and you'd not be able to do public speaking, and your writing would be poor quality and have to be edited by other people... but you'd get used to it. 

      Then again, after writing out all the above, I'm guessing that you were talking about that level of inhibition rather than "literally becoming a snivelling nincompoop"? Because the above does sound pretty bad.
      ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:

      > The restriction that they can't think the word in the 24 hours after targeting them seems like the main obstacle, but you might be able to get around that by drugging your targets. If they're unconscious for the full 24 hours, could they still think the word? 

      Yeah that would work, assuming you can find some way to do that safely without being caught.

      > Another way to get around it would be to target babies, or people with a different native language.   
      >  
      > Similarly, you could make babies forget their name before they learn it and use that for blackmail. 

      Wouldn't work. The word must first be in their vocabulary in order to be deleted from it.

      > Another approach would be to choose words that are uncommon, then introduce them to the target yourself. For example, being able to set up "What is Aleppo?" incidents with politicians might be enough to sustain a career as a journalist. 

      This would work to some extent. Your ability deletes the word from their vocabulary, so they will forget what the word "Aleppo" means. But they wouldn't forget the existence of the city itself, nor what has happened there. They just wouldn't know what the name of the city is and can't relearn it.

      And in saying this I just realized your blackmail idea would work wonders on celebrities and companies. Simply threaten to erase their names from tons of people. Most of them aren't famous enough to have people thinking of their names every day, yet plenty are famous enough to have their names been learned, so your ability would work on a significant fraction of people you target. Which can be a huge amount of people since you can just look down from a tall building or wander around a shopping mall and target everyone in sight. And while forgetting the name of a celebrity or company won't make people forget the existence of them, it would make getting any news or advertisements from them a huge inconvenience. An ad could be like "Come down to store X to find massive discounts!" and the viewers would be like "Where?" when you erase X from their vocabularies. And you could ruin actors' careers since any movie advertisement going "Starring Actor Y" would just have viewers going "Who?" once you erase Y from their vocabularies.
      ```

    - u/hh26:
      ```
      Removal of common words that would require drugging your targets will probably be useless, given that if your goal is to cause harm to someone and you already have them drugged and unconscious for 24 hours you can basically do whatever harm you want, including killing them.  There's not much you could do with removal of common words that you couldn't do via other means if you can reliably get people into this situation.

      You either need to pick obscure words that nevertheless are noticeable when absent (the names of certain nations?), or if you get someone who is bilingual and swaps to thinking in a certain language when in a nation that speaks it, you can sabotage their use of the other language.  You could perhaps remove the English "the" from them while they're in France, and then remove "le" from them while they're in England or the U.S.
      ```

      - u/Radioterrill:
        ```
        Those are good points, thanks! With regards to the drugging, one way around that is that you don't need to have access to them yourself. If you've got a long list of public targets, you'd just need to set up alerts for if they become hospitalised for any reason, and attempt the removal on them in case they'll be under anaesthetic for long enough.

    It feels like there should be a way to make money by deleting trademarks from people's vocabulary, but a specific implementation eludes me.

    &#x200B;

    Since loss of ability to comprehend a specific word is a subset of aphasia and relatively easy to diagnose, you could probably start any number of medical malpractice panics just by getting a job as a receptionist in a doctor's office and deleting semi-common words from select patients (think vaccines causing autism), which you could probably leverage into some sort of protection racket on phamacitical companies.

  You are tasked to win a game of *Diplomacy* with a power, against others with other powers and are experienced players.
  The format will be face-to-face in a typical Bar, 15 minutes phases.

  Pick one option:

  * [Detect Thoughts](https://5etools.com/spells.html#detect%20thoughts_phb) from DnD 5e. You can use it however many times you want at once. Any ability check is replaced with a 10% chance to fail. You get the 2nd pick of countries.

  * [Lelouch vi Britannia's Geass](https://codegeass.fandom.com/wiki/Lelouch_vi_Britannia#Geass). You get the 5th pick of countries.

  * [Contessa's Path to Victory](https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Contessa#Abilities_and_Powers). You get the last pick of countries.

  * [Mystique's transformation abilities.](https://x-men.fandom.com/wiki/Mystique#Powers_and_Abilities) You get the 3rd pick of countries.

  * [Sosuke Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu.](https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/S%C5%8Dsuke_Aizen#Zanpakut.C5.8D) You get the 6th pick of countries.

  * [Kamijou Touma's Imagine Breaker.](https://toarumajutsunoindex.fandom.com/wiki/Imagine_Breaker) You can safely assume every other power on this list can be negated. Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu can be ignored and can be permanently dispelled for everyone by touching the activator(eyes/blade), Path to Victory does not know how to deal with you, you are immune to detect thoughts and can temporarily end the spell for others by touching the victim/suppress the spell for everyone by touching the caster, and can temporarily dispell Mystique's transformation by touching her. You get the 4th pick of countries.

  * The ability to obtain any ability whose player is eliminated by you, defined by controlling their last or one of their last supply center in a build phase. You get the 1st pick of countries.

  Additional rules include:

  * Any players caught using their power by the GM is immediately forfeit. Their country goes NMR. Criteria for catching includes perceiving the verbal or somatic component for detect thoughts, witnessing an activation of Geass or Kyoka Suigetsu, or witnessing a transformation of Mystique. The activation of Imagine Breaker does not count as evidence against anybody. Edit: GM is immune to everybody's abilities.

  * No players can harm a player or using their ability to cause any players harm. Edit: This rule applies to GM as well. This is magically enforced.

  * Every player knows every player's abilities from the start on a surface level. Details that would be considered a secret of their power is not known initially. The exception is that the player with Imagine Breaker knows how to disable others' power from the start.

  Which power do you pick, what countries do you pick, and how do you win the game?
  ```

  - u/a_guy_from_finland:
    ```
    Path to Victory will win pretty easily barring EXTREME imagine breaker shenanigans as it can counter all other powers.

    You can almost do nothing personally and let the path play for you. You don't even have to know your own strategy so detect thoughts is useless.

    To counter Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu you merely need to close your eyes as both require visuals to activate.

    Imagine Breaker is the trickiest, but you don't have to model the person to ask "Path to making optimal moves based solely on board state"

    You can also ensure other players turn on IB during negotiations

    You can also feed the moves IB makes to a predictive algorithm to make an increasingly accurate model of them throughout the game: "Path to knowing the probable next move of a person who has done moves x, y and z"

    You can also be dick and use "Path to setting up other people to get caught using their powers"
    ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      Finding a "path to making optimal moves based solely on board state" doesn't seem sufficient. If the optimal move is (speaking broadly) to attack where your opponent is not defending, then you need to predict your opponent to do that.

      As the game goes on, you can get better at countering Imagine Breaker by asking for a path to defeat some model of them, of course. On the other hand, as the game goes on, other people can piggyback on Imagine Breaker to counter Path to Victory; if my strategy depends on Imagine Breaker's decision, then you shouldn't be able to predict my strategy, either.

      (At the very least, I can make random decisions that Path to Victory can't predict by deciding "I will ally with France next turn if this unpredictable player blinks an odd number of times.")
      ```

      - u/CreationBlues:
        ```
        Path to victory is incredibly powerful, though. It is more "intelligent" than basically everyone in the room combined. It has full knowledge of external state of everyone in the building, which means that it can collect things like sound, heart rate, breathing, eye movement, etc. It can track every single person's external tells. Just with that alone it will be capable of outperforming any human player. It knows what moves people write down, which means you need to be forced to write them down first. Etc. It's basically local omniscience with the worlds best supercomputer sussing out the future.

        Edit: To belabor the point, ptv can bring about any victory it wants on a short timescale, as long as it's around to shepherd the target. Contessa remarks as much when she talks about how she can PTV eidelon. Considering the fact that Diplomacy is all about that, I don't see any problem for ptv winning.
        ```

      - u/mcherm:
        ```
        If I understand it correctly, the "path to victory" power explorers all possible future timelines (except possibly those that involve interaction with someone whose power overrides this) and then selects the actions which will lead to a successful future timeline.
        ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    I don't know what game that you're referring to but I would Contessa's ability. The ability to just know how to win, even if there's a single mostly unpowered person who your power doesn't work on, is beyond competition.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Diplomacy is Risk minus RNG. Kinda. Actual gameplay is more complicated than that, and all combat moves resolve at the same time rather than going by turns, but that's a very simplistic explanation of the game.

  I'm following a most excellent quest, [Dragon Ball: After The End](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/), and was hoping to pick /r/rational's brains for some ideas on the latest challenge (with the author's permission!)

  Avoiding spoilers, the players have finally gotten started on a long-planned research project to recreate the lost art of the Perfect Multiform - a technique which splits the user into multiple identical bodies as strong as the original, far superior to the currently-known Multiform which splits the user's strength as well. The challenge is in deciding how to achieve this.

  >Premise 1: Multiform, as a technique, functions by using one's energy to split into multiple physical forms, all of which draw from the same energy pool when determining their own. Naturally, this splits one's energy pool into equal parts (historically, two to four).

  >Premise 2: It is a matter of historical record that achieving a four-way ["perfect"] multiform with each clone being at the full power of the original is possible. Furthermore, this historical instance appeared to be without serious intrinsic drawbacks, although it was certainly far less decisive than one might expect.

  >Premise 3: It is not theoretically impossible to outright demand that one's energy duplicate itself, although practically speaking it has never been done, and it would likely involve a significant up-front expenditure of energy.

  >Premise 4: Similarly, there exist plentiful techniques to boost one's energy level beyond its default maximum, and thus the clones resulting from a multiform could artificially boost their energy levels to, "base," at the cost of significant ongoing strain.

  The default options are:

  * To simply split the user's Ki reserves and avoid losing potency, which would leave each body with 1/4 of the stamina.

  * To investigate stretching out the clones' ki with techniques that boost the user's strength for brief periods, which would leave them at "full" strength - but such techniques invariably cause great strain on the body, drastically reducing the time the clone survives for.

  There was some discussion around making use of the [Banach-Tarski Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox), but after investigation the author ruled that this was not compatible with their model of ki.
  The author has outright invited the players to try and game this system if we can, but we're stumped. Admittedly it might just be that no better solution exists, but does anyone here have any ideas? To again quote the author:
  > The moving part in question [given the above premises, which are assumed to be true given the information available to the thread] is that multiform intrinsically involves splitting off new physical forms from an existing ki source. Is there some other way you can think of to game that system?

  (I originally posted this in the [Friday thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b9sbqi/d_friday_open_thread/ek823rc/), but it probably fits better here.)
  ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    Ideas:

    * What happens if each of the clones eats a senzu bean? Could this be used to overcome the power cap? This would be expensive if you need to do it every time you split.
    * How do transformations like Oozaru affect the clones if you perform them after splitting?
    * The fusion dance hasn't been mentioned in the quest, but looking at doing that in reverse might be informative for an alternative method of splitting.
    * Similarly, the sealing and unsealing might provide insights in terms of how they affected Jaffur's ki reserves.
    * Could seer powers be applied to the problem? Use future-sight to see if or how you manage it in the future?
    * What about using mental projection while you have a multiform running? Do all the copies project?
    ```
