    >! That’s annoying. That means Rain’s new maximum level is one below where he would need to be to get his class upgrade. I stopped reading a while back and decided that I wouldn’t pick it up until his level cap was at least 25. How much longer do you think it will take for that to happen? !<

      Your spoiler tags aren’t working because you put spaces between them. It should be like `>!this!<` not `>! this !<`

  A very numbers and mechanics chapter, setting some more limits on the benefits of accolades.

  Rain's being a little harsh on himself in the first half of the chapter, what with taking on like four melee-specialist characters in melee while handicapping himself with not using his primary spellset, and then being disappointed at how much they're kicking him around.

  And tinfoil hats really are good protection from mind-control rays. Wonder if aluminium's strength in that regard will come up at all with there being a major player with mind control powers running around. Maybe a long way down the line.

    He's disappointed with how bad he is at using his accolades, not that he gets hit. Or at least that's how I read it.

    I actually requested it get put up. If you hate the story so much, feel free to say as much. I just still felt the story should be posted here.

      Yeah, When I saw it removed I thought: "That's like expelling the bullied kid from school because half year is bullying them".

      Getting frustrated with a story is fine, but in the end its completely free content with no obligation on you to read it. Going to the extent of wanting to remove it from the sub is  the height of entitlement IMO, and mods encouraging that is like exact opposite of the job description.

      EDIT: Its was auto-removed, not by mods. Good to know.

          What off-topic posts? Delve (whether successful or not) is trying to be a rational and fairly rationalist fiction. 

          That is THE topic of the sub?

              I wouldn't really define it as  rationalist myself but, it absolutely is trying to be more so than most fiction: Most fiction does not have an MC who tries to apply the scientific method, math and reasoning to their magic system. <- This is what rationalist means (right?) and Delve does it more than the vast majority of fiction, hence I would absolutely include in the sub along those grounds.
              ```

  - u/ArgusTheCat:
    ```
    I don’t get why this story in particular would get removed, is there a meta reason for it?

    Like, it’s not the best high art out there, but it’s competent enough, and way closer to being rational than some of the fanfic that gets shared here.  So I assume there’s some weird fandom issue in the background?

      I think it’s because of disappointment. Delve used to be quite popular here, little more than a year ago you’d be hard pressed to see people complaining it shouldn’t be in the sub, even though it wasn’t universally liked. The simple reason being that those who didn’t like it wouldn’t read it and that was that. But then the quality declined, some of the people who liked it before, now hate it and argue that’s it’s not even rational to begin with and shouldn’t be here. 

      Delve didn’t loose the characteristics that make it rational, there’s still a lot of time spent on analyzing things, reasoning and justifying actions, even when people make mistakes, it’s in character, not something that can only be attributed to an idiot ball. The story has many other failings however, the glacial pacing being the worst in my opinion, the MC’s personality isn’t very appealing to many people (the constant memes and idioms that no one else understands are very grating imo) and overall the characterization has always been the weakest part of the story. Add to that the fact that since he has been capped for a long time, the exploration of the system, a part that I imagine many people here find very interesting, has taken a back seat to other things like the mystical mumbo jumbo of fixing his soul. 

      So overall I think what’s happened is that people got frustrated that something they liked declined in quality and “got bad”. Some might even have been patrons at some point which probably adds to the frustration. 

      ps: obviously that’s just my opinion based on external observation and I’m no expert on what each person is thinking, but I don’t think I’m too far off, considering the level of “hate” some people have demonstrated in the past threads, not to mention the whole report to get the thread removed thing.

        I agree completely, I'm really taken aback how someone can post "I really hate this story!" If you hate it why would you read it in the first place? 

        The only answer seem to be that these people felt (or actually did) get "bait-n-switched", pulled in by an awesome concept and then kept reading on the hope it would improve but being disappointed each time.

        In this case it was more that it got removed by automod from all the reports and we didn't get around to restoring it until a user pointed it out.  If you see future Delve threads taken out, that's probably what happened.
        ```

        - u/Dragfie:

          Thanks for the clarification ketura! 

          Good to see/know.

        That's like expelling the bullied kid from school because half the year is bullying them.

        Frustration aside, it is an attempt (whether successful or not) at rational fiction, that is worth more than 50% of what is normally posted here and exactly what the sub is for. 

        Delve is 100% free and given to you with no obligation. If you don't like it don't read it, and especially don't try and bully it off a platform it belongs where at least half the people like it. 

        Personally though I actually LIKE the criticisms people write on these threads, and would rather have them here then not.

            So in the 25 most recent posts I see about new chapters:

            The daily grind

            Pith

            Animorphs

            WtC

            New humans

            dear spellbook

            Hermine and the silent country

            Out of those, the only ones which are without a doubt better quality than delve is Pith, Animorphs, WtC and Hermine, while the ones which are more rationalist (again, whether it succeeds/does it well or not is irrelevant) is Animorphs, Wtc and Hermine.So yeah, about half those are just as good or more off-topic than Delve.

            >Quite a few of us *don’t* feel that Delve is "exactly what the sub is for"

            And "quite a few of us" don't like some of the other works mentioned above, and the mature ones "of us" don't try and remove posts about them because they don't like something about the story.

            Instead they just ignore them, or post a comment if the criticism is particularly interesting or would like to share their opinion.
            ```
