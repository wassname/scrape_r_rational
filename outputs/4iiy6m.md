  ```
  I find this video to be very poor quality. Very few of the major sweeping assertions are backed up at all with reason and logic. There certainly are ways to make the same arguments that lead to the same conclusions, but they're not being presented well by the video.

  Exceptional video, and it looks like the rest of the channel is similarly awesome.

- u/None:
  ```
  All sentient mammals self preserve. But sentience has little to do with that.
