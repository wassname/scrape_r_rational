  I am God of Death? I give no-one any punishment on the condition that the people I judge guilty pretend to be under unimaginable torment if anyone actually ever summons them up to talk, on pain of... pain. Being omnipresent, I can pro-actively punish (or otherwise influence) future defectors until they play along. There's no point actually torturing people on the other side, so long as the people on earth believe that I will.

  As for what I think of his actions? I judge him based on the results his actions were most likely to have, not the bizarre stroke of luck that he somehow actually to have happen. If 4/10 times his conscious choice would lead to the death of his charge, and 5/10 would lead to his injury, he doesn't get off innocent just because he lucked into being in the 1/10.

  The whole Triwizard thing just makes less sense the more closely you look at it.

  Not only was there no obligation for Harry to actually compete instead of forfeiting (it wasn't even his school on the line, since Hogwarts was represented by Cedric) or for the teachers to encourage him to, but it was also one of the *least practical* ways imaginable of getting Harry to touch a portkey. Why not just Portus his toothbrush?

  As I remember EY put multiple lampshades on it.

  Ugh. This whole conversation has been done to death in so many fanfictions (often terribly) that just mentioning it anymore is enough for me to roll my eyes. The whole "Dumbledore is evil/stupid/abusive" interpretation clearly isn't what the author intended, doesn't add anything other than cynical shock value to the text, and isn't even novel anymore. Can we *please* just accept Dumbledore's actions as one of the many things in the series that doesn't quite add up and *move on for Christ's sake?*

  All that being said, Dumbledore seems almost entirely irrelevant to the question ultimately being asked, said question being, "Should we judge people by their actions or their intentions?" And that is a question which I feel goes beyond the scope of this subreddit.

  (Yes, I'm aware that the OP says we don't know his intentions. This is utterly silly, as it leaves us with nothing but his results to go off of, in which case you're judging a person's morality by their competence)
