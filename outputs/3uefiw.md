Audio version of the early 90's award-winning short story by Ted Chiang. It's about an hour in total and really really good.

    I liked it.  Didn't care for the ending though.

    Oh neat, I haven't read all of that. Thanks!

    *The Merchant and the Alchemists Gate* has been taken down though.

  I like the story, and I like the reading too. Rashan Stone, the narrator, is very, very good at sounding smugly detached.
