  Since you asked for constructive criticism: the beginning feels a bit choppy and exaggerated. It's obvious later that the Professor is being purposefully extravagant, but it still felt offputting to me.  Maybe smooth the narration out a bit, with more scene setting so it's not quite so sharp.

  Other than that, seems like an interesting start :) Definitely going to keep an eye out for more.

    I misread the opening at first too - thought he was genuinely pissed off and being a *gigantic* asshole. Then they were just kidding around... took a second read with the addition of context to 'get it'.

    That said, once I was armed with that context it was all really rather good, definite success in the "picturing the scene" stakes. Added to my reading list.

    Hi!

    Looking through with that in mind, I definitely see what you mean. Reads more like...well, just badly written anger. I'll revise this in the next edit. I appreciate the feedback!

    (currently devouring The Origin of Species, by the way.)

      No prob, I think you'll nail it with some edits, since your writing was overall enjoyable :)

      Random question I just remembered: "The guy had traps of steel?" Is that a colloquialism in their world?

  Ahhhahahah, that first bit with Oak had me cracking up. Great job there!

  Made me feel more than 2 emotions and made me sad when there wasn't more to read. Added to my regular reading list.

  I like the beginning (just to provide a counterpoint). You're *supposed* to be tricked for a second when someone's pretending.

  Interesting that red says dad, but blue says grampa. So Oak adopted Red as a son, but Red is younger than blue?

  >"I sexually identify as a Nidoran."

  what.

  >"Kinda hurt you don't remember, Dad," I added.

  What?!

  >"Red Oak, sir."

  ...

  Interesting.

    Why are you discriminating against nidoran-kin?
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      I'm just a shitlord in general, honestly.
      ```

      - u/Cariyaga:
        ```
        Don't worry, we're accepting of all sorts; even those that identify as shitlords.
        ```

          uwuwu

- u/Bowbreaker:

  I found only a single typo.

  >ageing

  Should be 'aging'.
  ```
