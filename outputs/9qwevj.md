  God*damn* but that's awesome.

  It does occur to me that this is not only an excellent way to evacuate the Drow, but also what remains of their ancient culture. Imagine taking the entire column, perhaps chunk by chunk, Tower of Hanoi style, into Arcadia. Save the remnants of a once-great civilization, while you save their descendants, too.

  >A warning about the dwarves invading ought to do the trick.

  I'm worried that this plan of banding the drow against the dwarves might have the side effect of *pissing of the dwarves*. You know, the continental power house that sinks cities if people piss them off?

  >Which did explain, at least in part, why the Everdark didn’t currently consist of half a dozen lesser gods sitting in their own city with the rest of the race long gone. 

  It does, but I'm still not quite sure why some of the Mighty haven't wondered out of the Everdark and been lesser gods on the rest of the continent. There's only a very select group of people who could deal with even the weakest of them, and they could probably achieve a better lifestyle.

  >“The Sve speaks when it wishes,” Mighty Nodoi said. “That is custom. To request words is to beg for a curse.”

  After what happened to Black I'm kind of jumpy about the stories of other cultures. Cat's running a big risk running around the Drow homeland - who knows what kind of stories they tell? (Well, Ivah does, but thus far there's been no evidence that Cat is looking in that direction. She only just walked out what a cabal is.)

  >“- have commanded armies larger in number than this entire city,” I flatly replied. “I’ve slain heroes and tricked fae, walked the streets of Keter as a guest and pried life out of the hands of the Hashmallim. You’re just a rat in a hole, Orelik, and if you try my patience once more I swear on all the Gods I will feed you your own fucking limbs.”

  That's one hell of a boast. It'd sound lot less impressive if the Drow knew the full details of it all, but thankfully for Cat they don't.

  >The moment the shiver had been felt the gate had opened. Akua and I were not without cleverness, and so we’d planned to have it unfold right under the ceiling of the floor below. Unfelt until it cut through the walls

  Wait just a moment. Cat's portals can cut through stone?!? Since when? That's a huge deal. Could she cut an enemy in half? Open a mile wide portal that cuts through a city, or an army? Cut through things thy otherwise could not conventionally be cut? That's a hell of a thing to gloss over.

  >I’d been controlling and left them to stand alone in the outskirts of Winter.

  Well that's a power move and a half.

  A few things I'm worried about here. One is that the Drow find a faerie to eat, because a Drow with portals is not a fun idea (especially if portals can be used offensively now). Two is that she's really playing into a story here where the Drow are becoming her unwilling army of monsters held in place by mind control - how long until they free themselves and turn on their master? Three is that the Drow might wander off and conquer Arcadia (Urulan gave the faerie queen a good fight, after all, and these guys are stronger than it was). Four is that these guys have now got a great reason to form a little cabal and attack Cat next time she shows up.

  But still, this was a very ballsy move.

  Also, there was a reminder in this chapter of how time flows differently in Arcadia. If Cat waits a day in the Underdark, I wonder how long that'll be over in faerie land?

    I think there are three reasons for this:

    1. It's cultural. To the Drow, status comes from being closer to Sve. Leaving the Everdark is a punishment reserved for the lowest of Drow.
    2. It's hard to get out. Remember, they're surrounded by the Chain of Hunger, the Golden Bloom, and the Kingdom of the Dead. A few exiles won't draw much notice, but a powerful Mighty trying to leave risks annoying the Dead King, and we all know how that ends.
    3. Even if one of them successfully reached the southern lands, there is approximately a 0% chance that they wouldn't be killed by a Hero tailor-made to defeat them within a few months or years at the longest. Outside of the Everdark, even the Mighty have to play by everyone else's rules.

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      I feel like to an extent these are more important for explaining why Drow as a society are where they are, but a few powerful individuals could probably slip out if they wanted.

      As for heroes, I don't think there are many who could take on Mighty Urulan, and it wasn't even very powerful in the grand scheme of things. Hell, you'd think a few junior heroes would have some nice Secrets.

          Die? Heroes don't have a great track record from what we've seen on screen, except for two times with Black, involving Pilgrim or Bard.

          Or at least you'd figure they make waves before being killed, instead of never having being heard from again. The Drow seem to have the kind of power that if one of the serious players ever left the realm, then they'd do a lot of damage before being put down, and killing them would be serious business. It wouldn't be swept under the rug to the point where nobody has ever heard from them.

          There's clearly a reason individual powerful Drow have never left the Everdark, but I don't think it's the heroes
          ```

            >Die? Heroes don't have a great track record from what we've seen on screen, except for two times with Black, involving Pilgrim or Bard.

            You get this impression because both Cat and Black are very, very good at manipulating the narrative and avoiding dangerous stories. The Drow would not be, to say the least. Remember this quote from Black:

            *"It doesn't matter how flawless the scheme was, how impregnable the fortress or powerful the magical weapon, it always ends with a band of adolescents shouting utter platitudes as they tear it all down. The game is rigged so that we lose, every single time: half the world, turned into a prop for the glory of the other half."*

            It literally does not matter what the actual objective power levels of two opponents are if one of them is fated to defeat the other. Remember the time Cat killed a minor god with nothing but a bullshit prophecy, back when she was still only the Squire?
            ```

            - u/Agnoman:
              ```
              I'm being a little glib there, my main point is the two paragraphs below.

              Personally I'm just finding it hard to feat the heroes when they've yet to accomplish anything significant on-screen with meaningful consequences outside of those two instances. Here's to hoping that the Pilgrim stays on a roll after what we saw from the last set of interludes.
              ```

      So, they’ll meet pilgrim? Or is there another effective hero these days?

      - u/derivative_of_life:
        ```
        Remember how narrative works. When William was fated to defeat Cat, he was able to just keep healing himself over and over again even when she kept beating the shit out of him. The Exalted Champion was able to kill the Captain because of the narrative even though she was objectively vastly more powerful. The Stalwart Paladin was given an ability specifically to counter Cat's glamours right when he needed it, although he still couldn't beat her even with that. But a Might would be completely helpless compared to Cat, because they would have no idea how narrative works or how to manipulate it. They would stumble into a story ensuring their defeat pretty much instantly.

      Also, there's no Night to harvest outside the Everdark. Sure, they might be able to acquire luxuries in the outside world, but what the Mighty want the most is to kill each other and harvest each others' Night to become even more powerful. Maybe they can kill Named outside and harvest their powers, but the majority of Named are probably too weak for them to care about if Urulan was already at Cat's level.

    > One is that the Drow find a faerie to eat, because a Drow with portals is not a fun idea

    Drow can absorb knowledge and secrets via the night. I don't think they'd be able to do the same with non-drow.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      We know that killing non-Drow grows the Night:

      >Killing cattle,” I said. “Taking it. What does it do for you?”

      >“The Night grows,” Ivah smiled. “To do such sacred act would redeem any disgrace.”

      >“I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

      >“That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

      >I sucked at my lip.

      >“Killing undead,” I said. “Would it also grow the Night?”

      >The drow paled.

      >“Speak not of the Hidden Horror,” Ivah whispered. “For its crown is dawn, and that pale light is the end of all things. Only the mad would enter the eye of the Host of Death.”

      >“It does, doesn’t it,” I said. “The necromancy that keeps its army walking, you can claim it for the Night.


      We know that the Night encompasses knowledge:

      >“You make it sound like there is more to the Night than the shadow tricks,” I said.

      >“That is so,” Ivah said, then touched its lips. “Shapeless and shaped, encompassing all. The worthy take. The worthy rise.”

      >It’s knowledge too, I realized.

      It seems pretty open and shut to me. And we know that the Night can contain some pretty esoteric Secrets. See the Secret of Many Lives, or most of what Mighty Urulan did.
      ```

      - u/SirEvilMoustache:
        ```
        "Make the night grow" seems rather vague to me. It might refer to a general growth within the night-holder rather than a 1-1 transfusion of power. If the drow could just take some of the stronger powers and techniques from other beings they wouldn't be this low on the proverbial totem pole.
        ```

        - u/Agnoman:
          ```
          We've been told it grows the night and we've been told what the night *is*. It's nature is to encompass knowledge.

          And the Drow aren't that low on the totem pole considering that the weakest Mighty in a weak city nearly killed Cat, herself one of the most powerful and dangerous figures in the continent. Some random dude had the powers to kill Cat, the Faerie Queen with a creationally fixed body powered by the full mantle of Winter.
          ```

            He threatened Cat after ambushing her with the help of his bodyguards in a coordinated attack when she was severly underestimating her opponents. Additionally, she herself admits that she let herself go skillwise. (Also, he is the weakest sigil holder, not the weakest Mighty. Big difference.)

            Additionally, we haven't really seen any powers that are not somewhat night-flavoured. I can't help but feel that Cat would already have encountered hero-like Light constructs or similar tricks from the above if direct power stealing was a possibility.
            ```

            - u/Agnoman:
              ```
              >He threatened Cat after ambushing her with the help of his bodyguards in a coordinated attack when she was severly underestimating her opponents

              I'm not sure how much you can call it an ambush after Cat was the one the one who sort out Urulan and picked the fight.  And even after the opening salvo, Urulan was holding the upper hand for a while.

              >Additionally, she herself admits that she let herself go skillwise. 

              Because she was engaging in direct fights instead of trying for tricky schemes? Remember, Cat in a direct fight outmatched over a half dozen heroes this book alone. Her skills haven't degraded overly from then till now.

              >(Also, he is the weakest sigil hodler, not the weakest Mighty. Big difference.)

              That's fair. I got turned around by how the sigil holder was referred to as Mighty Urulan. But he's still the weakest player in a city at the edges of the map, as far as the Drow are concerned.

              >Additionally, we haven't really seen any powers that are not somewhat night-flavoured

              Without moving the conversation too far away, I'm concerned that the Drow will gain access to portals. We know that Winter and Night are very similar to one another, to the point where tricks in each can be copied over to the other and techniques to defeat Night regeneration beat out healing from the Winter mantle itself, so it seems reasonable to assume that Night could open a portal.

              Actually, given the Night-Winter interaction, there are a whole lot of interesting things that could happen with the Drow in Arcadia.
              ```

            >We've been told it grows the night and we've been told what the night is. It's nature is to encompass knowledge.

            It doesn't necessarily follow that growing the night and stealing knowledge also allows the drow to steal new powers outside their own species. The Mighty can gain new tricks and powers from killing other drow because ultimately they're all using the same magic system and simply applying it in many different ways. Replicating something like a fae gate or a hero's aspect would require the drow to gain access to entirely different types of magical energy (Winter, Light, etc.) which they haven't actually shown themselves to be capable of. 

            In my opinion it's likely that the drow could ape *some* tricks used by other magic systems, in the same way Cat is trying to reverse-engineer the night with winter, but they can probably only achieve a pale imitation of most powers they encounter.
            ```

            - u/Agnoman:
              ```
              We've been told that the Drow can steal the necromancy of the undead, but as a culture they're all quaking in their boots at the mention of the Dead King.

              The issue I'm looking at here is whether they can get a far gate. I think this is particularly concerning because of the parallels that we've been shown so many times between Winter and Night - tricks with the Night can be converted into tricks with Winter, and Night techniques designed to interfere with Night-based healing can mess with the regeneration of Cat's body constructed by the full Winter mantle. If the Drow struggle with outside systems, then Winter is probably what they're going to struggle least with.

                We've been told that killing undead grows the night, not that they can steal necromantic magic. 

                >If the Drow struggle with outside systems, then Winter is probably what they're going to struggle least with.

                I agree, as I said in my post, but I'd put the odds on a drow successfully imitating a faerie gate *very* low, seeing as the only ones with the ability are fae princes and princesses, and even then Catherine implies you need a full mantle to be capable of entering Arcadia.

                  We've been told that the Drow can claim the necromancy that keep undead walking for the Night, and we've been told what the Night is and what it encompasses.

                  >seeing as the only ones with the ability are fae princes and princesses,

                  We've literally seem others with the ability to do so.

                    >We've been told that the Drow can claim the necromancy that keep undead walking for the Night, and we've been told what the Night is and what it encompasses.

                    We've been told that the drow can *grow the night* by killing undead, not that they can gain the ability to use necromancy by doing so. What the night encompasses, so far as we know, is the ability to steal knowledge and grow the night by killing people, living or dead. But simply having knowledge is not enough to grant you new magics, you need the proper power to use those abilities, and the drow have not shown that they can steal that. Even if the drow steal the secret of gate making, there's no proof that they would actually be capable of using it, anymore than someone born without the Gift would be able to cast spells if they were given the knowledge of an experienced mage. 

                    >We've literally seem others with the ability to do so.

                    Mages, sure, but there aren't exactly a lot of those in Arcadia.

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  This was a pretty smart move- even if the Mighty as a group are strong enough to fight off any curious fae or strange creatures that might be roaming Arcadia, they have no food or water and clothes designed for a much milder climate. Even if there are edible plants in the land that's actually named Winter, the drow probably won't be able to identify them. The likelihood is that they won't last more than a day, maybe two or three for the longest hold-outs, and once one goes the others will start caving faster and faster.

  I don't see the story going this way, but considering the drow are supposed to be all about backstabbing and cruelty and cunning... and Winter is pretty much the same... I'd find it hilarious if Cat came back tomorrow and found that the two had allied against her.

  Just so I'm clear, what happened was Ubua set up a portal under the 11th floor, Cat's army/Archer severed the chains keeping the tower up, and the floor itself fell in Arcadia? Is that right? If so... dang, what the heck is going to happen to the rest of the column and the city itself when it all falls down?

  I'm curious about how Cat picked the Arcadian destination for the portal (or how it was determined). If the Everdark, or at least Great Lotow, is on the outskirts of Winter in relation to Arcadia, where is Winter/Summer proper in relation to the geography of Calernia? I'm wondering if Winter overlaps Callow now. Or perhaps I'm thinking too literally of the connections between the two planes. 

  Also, I was a little surprised that Cat's portal opened to sunlight. Duchess of Moonless Night is what she is, and the edge of Winter is where she sent them. I'd have expected cold and dark on the other side, not midday sun and a cold breeze.
  ```

  - u/zehguga:
    ```
    Regarding the portal placement: as far as I'm aware, only the floor of the room they were in was cut and fell through the gate. Whether the floor was cut by Archer and/or Ubua, or the gate itself is a bit unclear to me.

    I think the connections to Arcadia are more metaphorical/metaphysical than geographical. The Everdark, with the culture being so similar to Winter, would logically be connected to somewhere in Arcadia like that. Opening a gate in Ater should also lead to somewhere similarly bleak/dreadful, I imagine. And the location's connection would explain the outcome of the portal better than Cat's fae title (she's now Sovereign of Moonless Night, not Duchess).

  I didn't see the possibility before, but I halfway expect the cabal to work now. She finds the Sve, and is provided a perfectly plausible way to fend off the dwaves and preserve drow culture. Then she's not saving them from certain death by subjugating them, she's just subjugating them.
  ```

- u/Sonderjye:
  ```
  I see a lot of comments expressing consern that some of the drow is going to find and harvest fae. IIRC the reason that Kat is queen of Winter at all, despite only being dutches formally, is that all of the winter fae ditched Winter and moved into the new place, so there's noone to contest her claim. Winter was dead before and now even more, no matter how strong the drow are what is their chances of running across food?
