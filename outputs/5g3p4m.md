## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [Handy discussion links and previous threads here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing).


  ----


  Hooo-ee.  I *feel* like a lot of strides have been made this week; not sure if that is a false feeling or not.  Let’s see…


  /u/Dwood15 and /u/Xavion have both been very helpful lately with their efforts in architecting the monster engine and codifying the species JSON, respectively.  Both of these projects have forced us to take much more concrete looks at the designs of various systems.  


  In doing so, Bill’s PC is now almost utterly obsolete--most of the stat definitions, names, and purposes have played musical chairs with one another, with tons of new additions and paradigm shifts.  For instance -- and I kind of assumed I would hit this eventually, curse you, foresight! -- types will almost certainly be data-driven and moddable.  Not just the numbers, but how many types, and what their names are, etc, will be part of the moddable data backbone, and so you will be free to whimsically add your beloved Fart type.


  Things in general, code-wise, have shifted to be super-moddable.  This was always the intent, but it’s interesting seeing just how abstract everything has become.


  ----


  The HP system was more or less finalized in design.  HP is now mostly equivalent to pain--or it’s inverse, you might say, as HP goes down as Pain would go up, but conceptually they are exactly the same system.  When a pokemon is damaged, it loses HP in the affected limb, which leaves it open to a higher chance of injury.  Death occurs through the accumulation of certain injuries on certain appendages, and a slew of nonlethal but crippling injuries can bog you down as well.


  While identifying this system, I drew up a [Mock Battle sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aT7Oa0F35Y_9rEJgEkE5pTwT7ckBR9nHA3wGdvINgTs/edit) which shows the process of a Machop helpfully getting beaten to death.  This model is slightly incomplete; in particular it doesn’t include Endurance as a factor, but it shows the general mechanics of how I see fights going.


  ----


  A breakthrough was also made with the Initiative system, (which is getting relabeled, I think, but I’ll refer to it as INIT for now).  Basically, we are now adding two variables to each move: a “compressible” and “incompressible” time factor.  As the names suggest, the compressible time can be reduced or eliminated through both proficiency with the move and, as we’ve decided, INIT; incompressible, however, can’t be affected by stats and is the absolute minimum time it takes to perform the move.


  Solar Beam, for instance, (as it exists in canon) has a very large incompressible time factor and little to no compressible.  Fury Swipes, however, is the opposite, with perhaps only the smallest of incompressible time.  This means that a Slowpoke using Fury Swipes might only get one or so hits in per round, but Rattata will of course get quite a few more in.

  This (I think) helps alleviate the issues with the INIT system significantly, permitting those with a large INIT to get more done per round, without just completely, absolutely stonewalling somebody with less.  It’s still a *huge advantage*, but more damage and application based, rather than simply “block until you run out of init, then hit you with free moves”.


  ----


  One of the fiddly problems with the Elite Four was solved in a rather deft manner.  See, the problem was, how do we have a world where A: The Elite Four are the most powerful around, B: the Elite Four have enough power to drive a Stormbird away from civilization, C: the Elite Four want to kill the birds, but D: the Four don’t have the firepower to do so, and yet E: the Four *plus* the player are potentially enough to kill one or more of them.

  You see the problem?  Making them badass, willing to kill things, and yet not able to do so without help from the player is an extremely fine line to walk.  Well, instead we decided that the Four *can’t* drive off the Stormbirds: instead, they play cat-and-mouse.  The Four are among the only individuals daring, brave, quick, and powerful enough to run up to Zapdos, punch it in the face, lead it on a merry goose chase (away from civilization), and live to tell the tale.  As a day job.  It’s a small change, but one that completely erased one of the lingering balance issues that plagued my mind.


  ----


  OMG YOU GUIS.  There’s a project on TVTropes called [The Pokedex: Extended Fanon Edition](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/ThePokedexExtendedFanonEdition) and it’s *amazing*.  In-depth articles that try to portray knowledge about a species from a pseudoscientific and, more importantly, in-universe minimal-bullshit manner as possible.  It’s mostly canon facing, but I’ve already decided we’re using this as a base for the pokedex entries.  We’ll have to modify them, of course, but this is like 80% of the work right there.  I’m excited.


  ----


  I finally, finally, *finally* got something to show for the movement stuff.  I got my grid library of choice working (it recently had a major version update which broke everything), and now I have hex grids spawning in Unity.  Yay!

  2D test grid:

  3D test grid (this is what we will use eventually, but I am forgoing it while figuring out the movement system):

  And a little Red on the 2D test grid, why not:

  Over this next weekend I hope to have the basics of movement down, but we’ll see.


  ----


  Last and least, we have decided to include pokemon faeces.  That’s right, folks, poop for everyone.  It’s likely not going to be anything huge--maybe you can use it while tracking something down, etc.  But after finding out that Dwarf Fortress doesn’t have any, we just had to jump on the opportunity to be able to say “We’ve Got More Shit Than Dwarf Fortress.”

  Also, it leads a bit of credence to the proliferation of Ditto.  That’s right folks: Ditto, at its core, is *really*...Mew*poo*.

    As the other side of the HP debate, I have a bit of extra clarification on the HP system.

    Specifically, HP/Pain no longer represents *damage*.  Mechanically, each body part will have a stat tracking HP/Pain, and will also have a list of injuries.  Previously, injuries were considered semi-permanent damage, such as a broken bone or a severe burn, up to and including an amputation.  In effect, they were damage that persisted no matter how long you rested afterwards, and needed specific treatment to fix.  Now, on top of that, regular damage like bruises and cuts will be listed as injuries too, except these ones will be able to heal over hours or days like normal.

    In battle, taking a hit with, say, your leg, will raise pain in the leg and use the RNG to figure out how much of a bruise or equivalent injury to add.  The pain will mean that if you use a kicking move, the amount of force you can put behind it is decreased, and the injuries make it so that abusing the leg by doing things like kicking with it or taking another hit cause more pain because of the preexisting injuries.  At the same time, the more in pain a body part is, the more likely it is to sustain injuries from attacks, because the body part's already being stressed.  The pain will recede over the course of a few turns, but the injuries you have will cap it at a minimum amount, something like a constant ache or, if it's bad, a persistent agony.  If you don't get those few turns of breather, though, the pain becomes a vicious cycle that can easily render a body part useless.

    Terminology-wise, I tend to think pain works more smoothly conceptually, but mechanically it's all the same and ketura likes the familiarity of HP.  So your body part's HP will drop when you get hit, regen to their cap over the course of a few turns, and injuries will limit the cap for that body part.  Having low HP on a body part amplifies the HP loss and injury gain from new attacks, and the lower your HP is the less useful the body part is.

    Are you sure that you can use the TvTropes dex in your game? Just make sure that you are not doing some plagiarizing that people will get upset over. I doubt anyone would be able to call you out on it, but stealing a creative works that doesn't have explicit permission to be used is a dick move, so I'm just warning you of a potential mistake.

    Congrats on getting this far!

  I am considering a plotline for a writing project at least two books in the future.  Superhero genre, detective fiction, where the detective is a postcog, able to see the past in the area they are currently located in.

  There are clearly highly successful, but eventually run into a big problem.  One of the crimes they are called on to investigate was performed by a precog.

  Precog vs postcog.  Cat and mouse between people who can see each other across time.  One critical aspect is that tie passes as a constant between them, meaning they can see and hear each other in real time.  The crime was committed three days before the postcog first discovered the guilt of the precog, so the precog has three days in their time to silence the postcog, before the knowledge of their guilt leads to their becoming a fugitive.

  The precog knows that the postcog will be able to testify against them, and tries to kill the postcog before the trial date using traps of various types, from explosives to poisons.

  The postcog just has to stay alive long enough that the precog is taken into police custody.

  I already have lots of ideas, but this seems like something that might be of interest to r/rational, so if you want to point out interesting scenarios, I'd love to hear them.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    > The precog knows that the postcog will be able to testify against them, and tries to kill the postcog before the trial date using traps of various types, from explosives to poisons.

    How does the postcog not die instantly (to, say, a gun)? 

    Their power may be very useful in a police investigation, but seems to have limited defensive capabilities, while reliable precog is OP.
    ```

    - u/Farmerbob1:
      ```
      The postcog can follow the precog in realtime, and see what they were doing three days prior, and react to it.

      So, if the precog wants to set up an ambush for the postcog, they have to do it in a way that the postcog doesn't realize is a ambush.

      One critical part of this is that the two powers become entwined with one another after their first interaction at the crime scene.  Neither of them can break free of the timeframe.  The entwining limits both parties.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        Here's the confusing part, if the precog can set up an ambush for the postcog and see that it's a failure, what stops them from changing the set up or undoing the ambush to take account for how the postcog survived?

        For example, precog walks to a room where he left his explosive devices hidden, secretly sets up the bomb for it to explode three days in the future while postcog is watching, and the postcog avoids it by noticing a clue and getting out of the room before it explodes. Precog notices that the postcog was in the room for five minutes before ducking out within ten seconds of the bomb exploding. So he resets the timer (in full view of the postcog) to make it explode about three minutes earlier. How can the postcog survive then?

        Basically, while you are giving the illusion that the postcog and precog are interacting directly, the precog can change his actions in advance once he learns of how the postcog acted during a certain timeframe. Or are you going with something like the future is set in stone once observed? Meaning if the precog sees something happen, it has to occur?
        ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        Precog sits in an ambush spot with a gun. Postcog wanders in their respective powers' range. They notice each other.

        Precog knows exactly how postcog is going to try to dodge / flee / counterattack, and aims accordingly. Worst case scenario, if it turns out postcog brought a surprise ace-in-the-hole, precog just flees (while dodging unerringly) and tries again later.

        Meanwhile, postcog's power is doing jack shit. All it's showing is precog sitting on their ass for a few hours, which is no help at all to actually survive the ambush.

        e: at best postcog might stumble onto precog's trail before hitting the ambush point, IF they luck out on which direction they enter the ambush zone form. But that's easily countered (if nothing else, just by staying in the ambush spot for three days).
        ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    I think you've also missed the important point that _the precog can't have any actual limit on how far they can theoretically see into the future_.        
    If you've read "...And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes" then it's immediately obvious that the precog can see their future actions _which are influenced by things they can see in the future that they currently can't_.       Just write what you see in the future (in code so the postcog can't read it) then look at what you've written 3 days in the future. There's no real way to get around this without postulating that they are actually seeing a alternate reality where they lost their powers in the next second, however if you go that route then the precog is pretty impotent because the future where he lost his powers has very little resemblance to the _actual_ future.
    ```

  For those of you who haven't played Dishonored 2 yet (and have the specs to run it), I heavily recommend it. While the game isn't really rational, more on that later, it features great story-telling in a way that will probably appeal to people who like rational fiction.

  Everything in the world of Dishonored 2 feels alive, makes sense, and reinforces the narratives of the game. Reading / watching / listening to its stories feels like playing a video game while reading a dozen very clever fanfictions deconstructing its universe.

  You have big picture stuff, people discussing recent events and backstory elements, and newspapers dropping hints about your next missions. But you also have little details that make everything alive, connected and consistent: an overseer in deep cover who booby-trapped his front door; in the middle of a bloodfly-infested building, a journal about a club of occultists who thought tripping on bloodfly venom was a great idea; a black market vendor who sells you weapons, whose shop you can break into to take all his stuff and his money (that one blew my mind); or guards who worry they're going to be replaced by the deadly killer robots the duke is buying.

  All these things make the world seem incredibly rich, and consistent. I'd still say it's not rational, because the protagonist basically deals with every single problem through either violence or creative violence; and while the villains are mostly compelling, they're all varying degrees of pure evil: the Crown Killer is a sadistic murderer, Jindosh is an arrogant scientist, Ashworth is a cruel witch, etc.

  Also, my only complaint about this game: the heart kind of sucks. In the first game, it was that mysterious, omniscient commentator who gave you another angle on the people who you met and killed; in this one, it spends most of its lines complaining or telling you about how every single person you meet is a sociopath who gave their uncle fake medicine or something (although I do like what it has to say about named characters).

  Please be aware that [the structure recently erected over the Chernobyl power plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_New_Safe_Confinement) should be called, not an [*arch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch) (and *definitely* not a [*dome*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome)), but a [*vault*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_\(architecture\)). The meanings of `arch` and `vault`, though they must inevitably overlap ([how far must an arch be extruded before it should be called a vault?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox)), should be kept as separate as possible (presumably, based on the ratio of the volume enclosed by the 3D structure to the area enclosed by the 2D arc), in order to avoid ambiguity--and, in my opinion, the Chernobyl structure falls *firmly* on the `vault` side of this blurry line. (See, e.g., [this photograph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/New_Safe_Confinement.jpg), which clearly shows how half of the structure comprises four linked *arches*--any one of which could stand on its own--that combine to form a *vault*.)

    Geography minor here - the problem is less about any particular map projection than the twin fact that many mapmakers these days don't know how to choose a projection, and most readers don't even know what a map projection is!

    For instance, the Mercator is great if you want to preserve angles, useful for navigation, but so bad for general use or political maps that many geographic societies have recommended that it's use be banned. 

    Personally, I tend to use the Plate Caree if it must be rectangular, [a globe](https://xkcd.com/977) if at all possible - and the geostationary and orthographic projections make this surprisingly practical even without interactive stuff, or simply whatever projection the data comes in. But I tend to deal more in remote sensing and earth observation than political chloropleths, so take that with a grain of salt :)

  Remember how I praised the Flash tv show not long ago? I hereby restrict my complements to season one and parts of season two. I'm nearly caught up on season three and it seems to be going down the drain like Arrow did at roughly the same rate, for pretty much the same reasons, and it won't be coming back up. The characters keep making stupid decisions, the plot is contrived and drawn out, and the themes the story explores don't make any sense. What happened to such a fun, if cheesy, superhero series?

  The best I can figure is that the writers, for both Arrow and Flash, had a great season-long arc for the first year that also acted as a great framing device for episodic crimefighting. After that arc wrapped up, though, they didn't seem to know what to do with the story. The second season for both shows are padded out with bland one-off arcs and the Big Bad for the season fails to be as compelling. Then the third season comes around and the plot completely loses focus of what it's about yet still ends up being formulaic.

  I also want to blame the executives at CW for seemingly boxing the writers in. Tons of new characters kept getting introduced for the sake of it and shoehorned into the plot. I'm convinced Legends of Tomorrow was made to compensate for this by taking all the excess side characters away to a different story, but they also ended up taking compelling villains and side characters too. If Flash is so desperate for plot, why deny the show access to Captain Cold and, by extension, the Rouges? They're Flash's signature villains!

    I've watched one episode of Flash, and it was the one in season 2 where velocity 9 was introduced.

    What a shitshow. Why is Flash jumping across the broken bridge at the end when he knew he couldn't do that at the beginning a mere day earlier? Why was the V9 user able to break the bridge with resonance when she had no strength boosts? Why had they never bothered to use the precog guy on the hat before that moment? Why was V9 even *able* to close and lock the power suppression chamber? Haven't they ever heard of operational security? 

    It was just completely terrible!

  I've been doing some rereading of stories I read a long time ago, and I have to recommend [Skulduggery Pleasant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VIWNSU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) for those who are craving something about Harry Dresden. It's like a Dresden-lite, but while it's similar in feel and tone, it's not a knock-off copy. The magic system's well-explained (at least the parts that our protagonist uses) and there are a lot of interesting characterization going on.

  I don't know if it's really worth recommending by itself because it's a story written about a Dresden-like character, but through the eyes of a sidekick. I had fun reading it, but I'm not sure if it was more because of how much it soothed my Dresden-itch or because of the book on it's own merits. I've only read the first book so far and for some reason only the first 3 books in a 9 book series have a Kindle edition for me to read.

  The [Goodreads reviews](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/284440.Skulduggery_Pleasant) should help decide if you want to read it.

  I'm having an un-rational moment, and despite knowing that, it's still affecting my behaviour.

  Earlier today, my newsfeed included the datum discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/5g7118/what_does_trumps_phone_conversation_with_the/), of Trump having a phone call with the President of Taiwan; and the item discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5g2yc4/the_law_that_could_allow_trump_to_shut_down_the/), about Trump talking about 'shutting down' the Internet. And later, while listening to my music playlist of the Merry Wives of Windsor, one of the tunes that popped up was "Green Fields of France", one version of which can be heard [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFunhlWJiok). And I started wondering whether I was prepared for politics to go in an even more negative direction than I'd thought it might back during the American elections, faster than I thought it might.

  Specifically, I have the question stuck in my head: "Have I made the appropriate level of preparations, in case of significant military conflict within the year?". There are a variety of possibilities, from America's Congress passing laws that I find abhorrent, to China engaging in cyberwar against North American network infrastructure, to a minor US/Canadian dispute blowing up to the point Trump convinces some portion of the US military across the border to ensure the continued flow of "vital resources", to worse.

  Put another way - I've just finished figuring out what I would want to have done this month if, some time next year, many websites I find valuable become permanently deleted and unrecoverable (in spite of the Internet Archive's efforts). (Part of the answer: the program [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html) and an [archival Blu-Ray burner](https://store.mdisc.com/).)

  The thing is, from inside my own head, I can't tell whether my thoughts have been doing this particular set of planning because I'm currently in the middle of one of my bouts of depression, or if it's actually a perfectly reasonable response to modern life and current events. So I'm looking for some external auditing, here where the sanity waterline is reasonably high:

  How crazy do I sound to you?

    Only crazy in that you seem to be focusing on the apex of Mazlows hierarchy.  I'm not sure if your allready prepped or just focusing on what seems important at the moment.  Lets leave the question of if your concerns are valid aside for a second.  If we see significant disruption, logistics are going to go first, and most analysis I've read have grocery stores in urban areas empty in well under 7 days.

    So how much food and water and electrical generating capacity do you have set aside?

      Without revealing any particular details that I might one day wish I'd never shared: my physical library still has a set of Y2K prepping books next to the ones on camping, and I've long had my sets of plans in place for both hunkering down or bugging out. There are a few pieces of gear that I could wish for, like a [100 watt solar panel](http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/coleman-100-watt-12-volt-crystalline-panel-0112099p.html) and relevant accessories, or a decent ham radio base station and antenna instead of my handheld portable transceiver (VA3BOS at your service), but given that I'm on a fixed income and that Life Happens, I've never quite been able to scrape together the couple hundred bucks needed at any given time for either of those items.

      But hey, I've got a handheld computer with copies of Wikipedia and Wikivoyage and a few other things, a folding solar panel that just barely fits in an oversized coat pocket to power it, and a microfiber towel that fits in my other oversized coat pocket, so I Don't have to Panic, right? :)

    As a point of interest: as of when I woke up, the votes were: [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/o69/open_thread_nov_28_dec_04_2016/diqb), two votes for paranoid; [/r/rational](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5g3p4m/d_friday_offtopic_thread/daqck7b/), two votes for not particularly crazy.

    Emotionally, I'm not feeling the particular "I'm going to hate myself in January 2018 if I haven't mailed copies of my archival Blu-Ray discs to certain members of my extended family stretching halfway across the continent by then, and the Net gets taken down" urgency that I did when I posted, but it still seems like a good idea to nudge my plans in the direction of being able to handle that particular scenario with minimal losses of what I find valuable.

    Eh, I wouldn't call it paranoid, but I don't think your fears are really founded. The Internet is mostly centralized around American infrastructures, but it still exists in the rest of the world, and back ups are a thing. The government has strong incentives to take down sites like The Pirate Bay or MEGA and haven't managed to do so definitively yet; Wikipedia is probably going to be fine.

      I find this arguable. In this case, what you refer to as 'The government', I would reduce to 'That portion of the government under the influence of the lobbyists of the Movie And Film Industry Associations of America', which, while willing to throw its not-completely-insignificant weight around, can't leverage the weight of the whole American government. I'm thinking of scenarios such as 'It turns out China put secret backdoors into all sorts of hardware chips, and in a fit of self-righteous pique (which they think will play well to their red-state base), the war-monger side of the American Congress doesn't see any downsides to making a demand that everyone in the world shut down their supposedly Chinese-controlled hardware under threat that if they don't, they'll send the American military to shut it down'. As far as I can tell, several versions of just this one particular scenario don't obviously break the sociological law of every political actor having to act in what they perceive to be their own self-interest.

      However, I no longer trust my sense of calibration for the odds of large-scale politics, given that I was willing to go along with the predicted odds of 88% for Hillary winning the election, and didn't update nearly as much as I should have by the time of the election itself. And said lack of calibration puts a sharp limit on how rationally I can act as I decide how much effort to put into preparing for the more unpleasant scenarios.

  I've been writing an autobiographical 21st century historical nonfiction serial novel, and was wondering if anybody might like to help beta read it? It's called Earthlings: People of the Dawn--Seeker's Quest. I've only written the first three "episodes" so far, but they're all kinda long.

  Thanks!

  Are cheap [Orbital Ring Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQLDwY-LT_o) possible? I was reading [Paul Birch's](http://orionsarm.com/fm_store/Paul Birch's Page.htm) papers on the topic, and noticed he only bothered to consider really huge versions of the project. This seems to have spawned a myth that it would cost at least trillions of dollars for even a small one.

  Part of this is based on misinterpreting his paper (for example, the 31 trillion dollar figure mentioned in paper II is based on an inflated mass number since he quickly changes to a 1/1000th sized project for the next section, which would be launchable for 31 billion by the same math), but another issue is that he doesn't even consider smaller ones in the mass range of the ISS and other comparable space projects. The two scales he considers are 180 thousand ton and 180 million ton. Why not a 180 ton version?

  This strikes me as a big omission because ORS's have really fast minimal bootstrapping rates. Any business or government seriously trying to do it in real life would start with the smallest possible and work their way up to the desired scale by using it to launch the mass for successively larger versions.
