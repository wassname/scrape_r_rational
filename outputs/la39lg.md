  Hey all! Sadly, I have lost my most excellent beta reader /u/4t0m to that most dreaded of all our enemies: real life. This is unfortunate because not only is it very helpful for me to have an idea of how people who are not me might react to a given scene, getting feedback also helps me to, uh, write. Which I tend to not do as much if people don't tell me to.

  I mean sure, I realize on an intellectual level that people are probably waiting for new chapters even if nobody tells me, but it's still hard to keep focussed unless I'm actually talking to someone about the stuff that's coming up. So if anyone here wants to apply for the position, just send me a message or post a reply here! You'll get early access to new chapters for the small price of having to read them and then tell me what you think.

  (There are no qualifications required for beta-reading other than the strangely-rare ability to resist the urge to filter observations through the standard socially accepted filter. It's literally better to just write down the first thing that pops in your head as you read rather than transcribing it into "constructive criticism." Seriously, you wouldn't have to read it any differently than you would normally. Stream of consciousness is the way to go.)

    Hi, I'm waiting for new chapters. 

    I'd apply to beta-read, but I'm not responsible enough to keep up an indefinite commitment like that. I'm also probably not neurotypical enough to serve as a good beta reader anyways. 

    I quite enjoyed the chapter, using the >!summoning tug as morse code is the kind of cleverness I love to see. !<

    Do you have a discord server? Another author I'm following had the same problem, but he says that having a discord server to talk to readers helps him.

    Yeah, the Morse doesn't really mean anything. I considered making it a meaningful message, but I figured it was more important to have it \*look\* like Morse code to casual readers by being recognizably long-short-long. Originally I was going to make the message "hi" but then I realized the code for that was "short short short short -pause- short short" and uh... that would've just been confusing.

    If you can think of a short message that is both meaningful and easily recognizable as Morse, please do let me know!

      How about “com” to establish it as a com line?

      That’s

      I think it actually kind of makes sense as-is lmao  
      also, there's nothing to say their morse is the same as ours

  I suppose if you are looking for a beta. I am quite good at stream of consciousness. Although I have already read this chapter. I can attempt to give my thoughts on it if you'd like.
