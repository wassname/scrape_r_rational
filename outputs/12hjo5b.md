## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4) just recently came out of hiatus! The author posted a big batch yesterday, and will be posting more over the next few weeks. 

  The story's about a westerner who is a huge xianxia fan who is transmigrated into the body of a stereotypical "Arrogant Young Master". If you're not familiar with the genre, this is like being a black guy in an 80's slasher film, or a red shirt on an away mission in Star Trek TOS. You're fucked, basically. So the story is about him trying desperately to change the perception of himself while also not causing any suspicion to the family of the guy whose body he high-jacked. 

  It's an amazing pastiche/satire of xianxia and also a damn good story. It plays up all the coolest xianxia tropes(my favourites being the ginormous sense of scale, the exaggerated power levels, the panache, and the epic moments of awesome) and none of the shitty parts(of which there are so many you might as well write off the entire genre, honestly). You might need some experience with xianxia to catch all the humor and references, but you don't need it to appreciate it as a great story.

  I reread this five page comic from 2005 or so and it reminded me of dath ilan and stuff, so I'm posting it here. It's titled Ultimate Crisis of the Justice League. It was part of these Bizarro Comics anthologies that DC used to publish, where they'd get a lot of people from the world of indie small-press comics and elsewhere to write and draw short goofy comics. They did one called Bizarro Comics and one called Bizarro World, and then in 2021 they put out a compilation that collects both.

  (Most bizarrely of all, almost all of the comics in the anthologies were, in my opinion, good. Which is not usually the case with anthologies of any sort that draw in a lot of different creators, in my experience.)

      > Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb 

      This film is dark comedy about the absurdity of the Cold War. It's one of the greatest films of all time in my opinion, but I would not describe it as political intrigue, and I especially wouldn't describe it as "political operating done right."
      ```

      - u/DomesticatedDungeon:
        ```
        I think it still features a certain brand of political intrigue. 

        It's not court politics but inter-state politics. And rather than the relevant interactions happening on-screen, the film features a branch outcome of such interactions that have already happened in the past â€” before the point of the film's first scene (game theory, precommitment, nuclear proliferation, MAD, doomsday devices, etc). Also, however mentally ill, Jack Ripper leverages his position to force entire countries into achieving a (dubious) goal he's set in front of himself.

        It's not "political operating done right", but it's a study case of what "political operating" (and use of the tools the field offers) can potentially lead to. It's like if GoT wasn't an entire series, but only a short work about the destruction of the Baelor sept, and an outline of the circumstances that have led to it.

        Though admittedly I shouldn't have put it so high up on the list.
        ```

        - u/chiruochiba:
          ```
          I see your point, but in my view rather than being a case study of political operating, *Dr. Strangelove* starts with the hypothetical premise that both the USA and USSR choose the stupidest possible stratagems for distribution of command power over The Bomb. Thus, their attempts to implement the fool-proof deterrent of "mutually assured destruction" actually have the opposite effect of sparking the War to End All Wars.

          In the case of the USA, they decided to have a fail-safe protocol in the event that all supreme military authorities of the USA are annihilated in a first strike by the enemy. >!Their solution is to give individual Generals sole authority to initiate a retaliatory nuclear strike. The problem is that there are no checks and balances to prevent a General from using this authority to initiate  a preemptive strike instead a retaliatory one. This proves to be a fatal error when General Jack Ripper, driven by anti-communist conspiracy theories, goes rogue ("Do you realize that fluoridation is the most monstrously conceived and dangerous Communist plot we have ever had to face?").!<

          In the case of the USSR, >!they created and implemented a "Doomsday Weapon" that will automatically launch overwhelming retaliatory strikes the instant that a single nuclear impact is detected on USSR soil, regardless of any human authorization on any level. This measure was meant to be a deterrent per the Cold War strategy of mutually assured destruction, but they made the mistake of implementing this technology without first announcing it to the world, which, as one character notes, defeated the entire purpose of the stratagem.!<

          The rest of the movie is a comedy of errors as well-meaning but ultimately inept people try and fail to save the day. >!Once The Bombs are already en-route to Russia both the USA government and USSR government are completely impotent to deescalate the events that unfold. Diplomatic tools such as the putative 'red telephone' hotline between Moscow and Washington are rendered irrelevant. The phone call between the president and USSR leader proceeds more like an attempt to placate a jilted lover than a discussion of a potentially world ending threat ("I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri. Don't say that you are more sorry than I am, because I am capable of being just as sorry as you are. So we're both sorry, alright?") An ambassador delivers his intel too late to prevent escalation. A scuffle breaks out in The War Room ("Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is The War Room!"). A British exchange officer stationed in the rogue base is incapable of reasoning with or stopping the general who will doom the entire world. At one point, his attempt to share the code that will turn back the bombers is stymied by lack of coins for a payphone. In the end scene of the movie the political big-wigs in Washington get distracted by a discussion of who gets priority in the proposed mine-shaft nuclear shelters and are enthusiastic about the theoretical 10 to 1, female to male ratio ("Mr. President, we cannot afford to have a mine-shaft gap!"). Meanwhile the Russian ambassador covertly snaps pictures of the strategic map in The War Room.!<

          ... and that just wasn't as fun to read about. It recovers by the second half of Book 3, though, and concludes satisfyingly; and it was never outright *bad*, in my opinion; it's just that Book 1 set very high expectations.

    ```
    If ChatGPT can add grammar fixes to translations, Iâ€™d expect it to improve the grammar of web fiction thatâ€™s in English. There have been a few with interesting ideas which Iâ€™ve dropped because of spelling and grammar issues.
    ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    I guess with the paid version? The symbol limit of ~1000 makes it a real hassle to translate anything larger. I translated the first chapter of Worm into German and it took ages.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Paid ChatGPT "Plus" (GPT4) can handle inputs up to 2500-3500 words, so with the average Worm chapter being maybe 6000 words, it should take only three to five calls to translate the whole thing. The bigger probablem is that it's inconsistent in how much it will output. Sometimes it just keeps going, but sometimes it stops after 600 words or so. Maybe depends on server load?

      The non-chatgpt version of GPT4 in the dev playground can allegedly process up to 25000 words at a time. Since German and English word lingual density are roughly similar (German is a bit longer), you'd probably be able to process chunks 10000 words at a time, basically whole chapters.

      Interestingly, I think GPT4 is a better translator than DeepL. The immediately obvious example is that after putting Worm CH1 through both, GPT decided to translate "Capes" to "Capes" while DeepL changed it to "UmhÃ¤nge". It's not... wrong, but it sounds stupid.

      **EDIT:**

      I made GPT4 analyse the differences between translation samples in a fresh instance. Sample 1 is DeepL and Sample 2 is GPT4. Here's what ChatGPT says about the differences between the two versions:

      >Both translations effectively convey the original text's meaning, but there are some differences between the two samples in terms of word choice, phrasing, and overall flow. Here's a comparison of the two translations:

      > Sample 1:

      > - Utilizes more literal translations of some phrases, which can make the text feel slightly less natural in German.
      > - Uses "UmhÃ¤nge" for "capes," which is a more general term for a type of cloak and might not be the best match for the context.
      > - Refers to Mr. Gladly as "Mr. Gladly" throughout the text, maintaining consistency with the original text.

      > Sample 2:

      > - Uses more idiomatic phrasing and natural-sounding German expressions, which can make the text flow better for German readers.
      > - Uses "Capes" for "capes," which may be a better match for the context, as it is closer to the superhero connotation in the original text.
      > - Refers to Mr. Gladly as "Herr Gladly" and "Herr G," which is a more culturally appropriate adaptation for a German audience.

      > Overall, Sample 2 appears to be the better translation. It maintains the original meaning while adapting the text to sound more natural and idiomatic in German. This helps create a smoother reading experience and better captures the tone and style of the original text. However, Sample 1 is still an accurate translation that effectively conveys the content, despite some minor shortcomings in terms of naturalness and word choice.

    * Stitched Worlds - 4 completed books, and possible more to come. 
    * Soulmonger - ending is kind of rushed, but overall a good story.
    * Wake of the Ravager - Currently being re-written for publication. 
    * Industrial Strange Magic - His latest project and also the sloppiest in terms of plot and structure, imo. Still pretty good.
    * The Outer Sphere - his first major project, up to chapter ~100 it was pretty good, after that there's a timeskip and it becomes fucking terrible.

      >Stitched Worlds

      I had to look that one up. Did what'shisface finally win a lawsuit or something? I remember it being called Systems of the Apocalypse.
      ```

        There was no lawsuit as far as I know, the guy just claimed trademark infringement through Amazon and nobody challenged him, they either changed the name or got their stuff taken down. He got blacklisted off of the relevant subreddits because of it, so probably not a big win for him.

    Perilous Waif & Daniel Black by E William Brown

      Loved Perilous Waif and loved/hated Daniel Black. It was a bit too sexual for my taste so I dropped it in the middle of the 2nd book, the power fantasy parts were really fun though!

        Yeah I just skim those bits typically. If you can push through I'd recommend it because there definitely is more good stuff later in the series.

        *The Stork Tower* series by Tony Corden is kind of similar to Perilous Waif but not as good IMO. There's a lot of it though so that's always nice.

          Could you say a bit more about the Stork Tower? Sounds interesting.
          ```

            It's a VRMMO type story, though the MC isn't trapped inside or anything -- there's also a good deal of IRL content. She has what basically amounts to a superpower and is borderline Mary-Sueish in her character, intelligence, etc. But it's fun reading and there's 8 (rather hefty) books out.

            Stork Tower is okay. I read the first couple books a while back when I was sick, had KU, and was in the mood for popcorn lit. 

            It's not terrible. The protagonist is definitely a Mary Sue and the best at everything and succeeds because she does things that nobody else does (like being nice to NPCs or whatever). It's entertaining, however I felt that it eventually lost the plot a bit, because there is an overarching real world plot with eventual life-or-death stakes (shootouts, kidnappings, etc) but meanwhile these low stakes slices of "the protagonist fucks around in steampunk world to complete a questline" are kinda jarring. 

            Eventually all the different settings got too difficult for me to care about and keep straight in my head, so I started just skipping the steampunk-world chapters entirely... And then when I realized the story was just as legible, I decided to drop it entirely.

        Perilous waif is much higher effort.
        ```

        ```
        The Daniel Black series also includes some borderline pedophilia and strong overtones of /r/theredpill, such as all women desiring to be sexually submissive to a man and rape as a cure for sexual trauma.

      Anything more in that vein? Brown has not written anything in a long time. The worldbuilding and the power fantasy elements were quite nice, even if not that original. Perfect for a relaxing literature.

        He actually just released a new book on Amazon, but from the description it seems like it's almost pure smut

          Jungles of Alabama? I haven't read the published version, only when it was on QQ, but from what I remember it was pretty much on par with DB.
          ```

        - u/vorpal_potato:
          ```
          I just finished Jungles of Alabama, and thereâ€™s remarkably little smut in the published version (though there definitely is some). It was a fun popcorn read, and a refreshingly well-done take on the System Apocalypse genre.

  Looks like planecrash / project lawful is ending/ended, with the last(?) thread being [https://www.projectlawful.com/posts/6827](https://www.projectlawful.com/posts/6827).

  I rather liked the ending, >!although it feels a bit anticlimactic after 100s of pages of leadup to resolve it so quickly. But it makes sense and is satisfactory.!<

  - u/eggsyntax:
    ```
    Definitely seems like the ending to me, although who knows, maybe there will be an epilogue or something. I thought it was pretty solid. And at least we got a real ending! With EY so busy these days (for good reasons! Right now feels like a crucial opportunity to shift the Overton window on AI) I feared it would be abandoned.
