## [Meta] Crowdfunding rational audiobooks

### Post:

Unfortunately, I have little time to do any real reading, so I am very dependent on audiobooks. I love the work that the [Methods of Rationality Podcast](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/) and the [Worm Project](http://audioworm.rein-online.org/) have done, but there are too few people out there who do what they do.

Would people be interested in using crowdfunding to have people create audio recordings of finished works? I am thinking that an author could submit their work they would like recorded, and if there are enough people willing to throw a few bucks that way then a lower tier professional could be hired to create the recording with the stipulation that the audio recordings are to stay free.

Note 1: This would almost certainly only work for shorter works. If we were to hire an actor for Worm that would cost about $50k, but Metropolitan Man would only cost about $2.5k. (One author I found asks for $0.03/word, others charge by finished hour.)

Note 2: I am not at all suggesting that people give me money. This is just an idea, and if it turns out there is interest than we can see what can be done from there.

What are your thoughts on this? Can anybody tell me why this is a bad idea?

  Free audiobooks sound pretty awesome, but even $2.5k per project seems fairly hefty unless there's a large amount of people pooling money.

    Thanks for a critical response. I have not done much price estimates. I think we would want to stay with somebody freelance though as companies like [ACX](https://www.acx.com/) would likely have terms that are not favorable to the community. People who are getting started in narration would also be able to give much more favorable pricing.

    Something that could be done is a bounty where a person could get the money after completion of the work (this could be split if there is say person 1 working on Ch1-5 and person 2 working on Ch6-20). There would have to be some rule in place though so somebody couldn't just crap out a Text-to-speech and call it good though. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puxnkz5HZ6Q&list=PL8FUZfnC--scCq2spqHEtF3v56Aq7rdoL) is an example of something I would consider perfectly acceptable. The narrator makes a few mistakes, but nothing that takes away from the story.

    A concern I have, however, with a bounty program (if it is released in the HPMOR Podcast style) is that people might start strong with a story and then the work fizzles out. [Example](https://soundcloud.com/user-598992923) This would be a good place for a second person/group to take over and split the bounty.

  Can someone that listens to more audiobooks than me weigh in on automated TTS systems? Because with the quality that  TTS systems are approaching (see [2. from here](https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/text_predicting_global_style_tokens/index.html#singlespeaker.unsupervised_prediction.tpcw)) it seems to me that in a few months (or as soon as google publishes their recent work as an API) this will largely be a problem that solves itself.

    Holy crap those are amazing. I knew we have moved on from Microsoft Sam, but I had no idea the technology has gotten that far.
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Are there any online platforms that can be used for this?
    I normally use the inbuilt text to talk software in Microsoft Edge but the TPCW-GST seems to be in higher quality.

      Not yet. Google has an API, but it doesn't include their latest research (no speaking style stuff afaik). So far, no one has been able to reproduce the quality of Google's results (they don't publish their code on this and noone has their dataset). There is a open source implementation by some guy on github + nvidia ([this](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) + [this](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-wavenet)). You can hear the quality of those models [here](https://nv-adlr.github.io/WaveGlow). I've managed to make that run on my local machine, and it works just as well the above examples. 

      What's still missing from the above implementation afaik is (a) a better pretrained model (_should_ be possible to train using commercial audiobooks instead of the LibreVox dataset) and (b) the style inference engine from text (so emphasis and pauses sound more natural).

    Yeah Tacotron is some crazy shit. Super impressive style transfer.

  TTS systems are very useful and only likely to keep getting better, but they do have flaws. It’s impossible (currently) for them to provide inflection and tone that is appropriate to the pacing of the story, and every character voice is the same. 
  For some people, of course, that’s a plus. It depends on what you’re looking to get from the experience. TTS is also very compatible with increased listening speeds, something that normal audiobooks have issues with for the same reasons described above. 

  Coincidentally, I happen to do some voice over work on the side for various things. If people are interested, I could start recording some samples of popular fictions that are posted here, and we can see how that goes. I don’t know how suited people would find my voice for audiobooks (haven’t tried that before), but I’m perfectly willing to give it a shot. 
  For free, of course, and only with the permissions of the authors. If people do end up liking it and it becomes a more time intensive thing then I might set up a Patreon or some such, but I wouldn’t worry about it. 
  Happy to serve the community.

    That's what Google is working on, btw. See [here](https://google.github.io/tacotron/), esp. the papers from March and July.

    In my experience, it takes about a year of TTS "reading" to stop noticing the lack of inflection, that said I've listened to TTS for relaxation and study since 2000 with a few hiatuses.

  I'm interested in getting involved in voice acting and audio narration. What books/stories do you want done? I can try out recording for everyone here

    It would be nice to see the audio of Pokemon: The Origin of Species completed. Thoughts /u/DaystarEld ?

    It would also be nice to have an audiobook for Ra, but in the above estimates that would come out to about $7k. Thoughts /u/sam512 ?

    Edit: All that said, if you wanted to start narrating then you can do whatever you very well please.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Yes! I need the origin of species!
      ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I agree, obviously, though /u/marsfilms would be the better person to collaborate with for that as of now :)
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I think it's a great idea!
  ```
