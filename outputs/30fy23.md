## Nazis and racism

### Post:

Ok, so I was taking a dump and I thought about the whole Nazi business.  So if Hitler really believed in what he did like on the TV, shouldn't he have chosen the Greeks since they are the most influential on modern societies? Or at least choose his own race to be the best?  So I thought that the plot goes like this:
Germany was in trouble, with high inflation and people sleeping on the streets.  A young man with strong nationalism(Hitler) is angered by the terrifying reality of his nation and the ignorance and cruelty of Germany's neighbors who punished Germany far beyond the line.  He saw that the Jews, like the modern days, have been just living their unproductive lives of making money to make more money while not contributing anything to the country.  He stands up with bunch of other young nationalist people to set up the Nazis and try to save the country.  He sets the master race as the majority race of Germany, targets the Jews who may have had bad reputations in Germany(only rich guy in poor neighborhood), and advocates revenge towards the merciless neighbors to gain popularity.  Huge success.  Am I right or am I right? dam, I shoulda gone political science major.

    I think he's satirizing rationalist stories and lampooning the rationalist mindset as immoral. Never mind the orthogonality thesis.
