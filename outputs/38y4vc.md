## Religion. Better safe than sorry? [D]

### Post:

Ok. This post is mostly a question for the athiests among us. Based on what I've seen, the rational community is overwhelmingly athiest (as am I)

I just wanted to bring up a point, for the sake of discussion, and getting others' opinion on the subject.

While, rationally, it does appear that we live in a universe where there is no involved creator(whereas quite a few major religions insist there is a deity constantly influencing our day-to-day existence) what if we are incorrect? I'm not saying whether we are or aren't, but what if there is a creator?

For the sake of the example, let's take the Christian faith. By their beliefs, you need to believe in Jesus and accept him into your life honestly, and boom, free ticket to heaven. Eternal afterlife of joy, happiness, etc. whereas, if you don't, eternal afterlife of burning and torment. 

Considering your finite earth life (let's optimistically say you can hit 150, assuming for advances in medicine) compared to an infinite afterlife, doesn't the math suggest it's best you take the super small chance of believing in a religion, because the tradeoff is of infinite length? 

Some obvious counterarguments are "how do you choose which one to believe in?" and "the religion's beliefs go against my current beliefs too heavily". For the first one, I agree, but having none at all isn't exactly a soultion there. For the second, I would say just pick one that closely aligned. Most religions (outside of cults) won't have you doing anything too outrageous.

Again, this is just a discussion point. I'm curious to hear what you guys have to say.

  This is better known as Pascal's Wager, and it's essentially been argued to death. Dawkins has a far better overview of the arguments in chapter 3 of *The God Delusion* than anyone will probably give you here:

  > The great French mathematician Blaise Pascal reckoned that, however
  long the odds against God's existence might be, there is an even
  larger asymmetry in the penalty for guessing wrong. You'd better
  believe in God, because if you are right you stand to gain eternal
  bliss and if you are wrong it won't make any difference anyway. On
  the other hand, if you don't believe in God and you turn out to be
  wrong you get eternal damnation, whereas if you are right it makes
  no difference. On the face of it the decision is a no-brainer. Believe
  in God.

  > There is something distinctly odd about the argument, however. Believing is not something you can decide to do as a matter of
  policy. At least, it is not something I can decide to do as an act
  of will. I can decide to go to church and I can decide to recite the
  Nicene Creed, and I can decide to swear on a stack of bibles that I
  believe every word inside them. But none of that can make me
  actually believe it if I don't. Pascal's wager could only ever be
  an argument for feigning belief in God. And the God that you claim
  to believe in had better not be of the omniscient kind or he'd
  see through the deception. The ludicrous idea that believing is
  something you can decide to do is deliciously mocked by Douglas
  Adams in Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, where we
  meet the robotic Electric Monk, a labour-saving device that you
  buy 'to do your believing for you'. The de luxe model is advertised
  as 'Capable of believing things they wouldn't believe in Salt
  Lake City'.

  > But why, in any case, do we so readily accept the idea that the
  one thing you must do if you want to please God is believe in him?
  What's so special about believing? Isn't it just as likely that God
  would reward kindness, or generosity, or humility? Or sincerity?
  What if God is a scientist who regards honest seeking after truth as
  the supreme virtue? Indeed, wouldn't the designer of the universe
  have to be a scientist? Bertrand Russell was asked what he would
  say if he died and found himself confronted by God, demanding to
  know why Russell had not believed in him. 'Not enough evidence,
  God, not enough evidence,' was Russell's (I almost said immortal)
  reply. Mightn't God respect Russell for his courageous scepticism
  (let alone for the courageous pacifism that landed him in prison in
  the First World War) far more than he would respect Pascal for his
  cowardly bet-hedging? And, while we cannot know which way
  God would jump, we don't need to know in order to refute Pascal's
  Wager. We are talking about a bet, remember, and Pascal wasn't
  claiming that his wager enjoyed anything but very long odds.
  Would you bet on God's valuing dishonestly faked belief (or even
  honest belief) over honest scepticism?

  > Then again, suppose the god who confronts you when you die
  turns out to be Baal, and suppose Baal is just as jealous as his old
  rival Yahweh was said to be. Mightn't Pascal have been better off
  wagering on no god at all rather than on the wrong god? Indeed, doesn't the sheer number of potential gods and goddesses on whom
  one might bet vitiate Pascal's whole logic? Pascal was probably
  joking when he promoted his wager, just as I am joking in my dismissal
  of it. But I have encountered people, for example in the
  question session after a lecture, who have seriously advanced
  Pascal's Wager as an argument in favour of believing in God, so it
  was right to give it a brief airing here.

  > Is it possible, finally, to argue for a sort of anti-Pascal wager?
  Suppose we grant that there is indeed some small chance that God
  exists. Nevertheless, it could be said that you will lead a better, fuller life if you bet on his not existing, than if you bet on his existing and therefore squander your precious time on worshipping him, sacrificing to him, fighting and dying for him, etc. I won't pursue the question here, but readers might like to bear it in mind when we come to later chapters on the evil consequences that can flow from religious belief and observance.

  (It would be my tendency to assume that you've heard of Pascal's Wager before, but this is the sort of thing that people routinely invent independently, so perhaps not.)

  The answer to your question is mu.

  The argument you are referencing supposes a great deal many things for which there is no evidence, or even contradictory evidence. To single this idea out in conceptspace is privileging the hypothesis on an absurd level. One must discount an outcome by its probability, and by any reasonable standard, the probabilities in question are so small as to not warrant consideration. The only reason this idea has been thought, and why it is consuming your attention rather than some other harmful meme, is due to the particular defects of the system which generates the idea.

  Even if that were not so, one must realise the sheer magnitude of competing, mutually exclusive possibilities (and I am reluctant to use the word "possibilities" here, as it presupposes these sorts of ideas are coherent). For every benevolent god who would grant you eternal bliss conditional your belief, there is a malevolent god -- identical in all respects, but who would reverse the outcomes; belief gets you eternal damnation, whereas disbelief gets you admittence to heaven. Even presupposing the possibility of existence for such beings and the validity of such scenarios, there is no optimal criteria for decision.

  Do not worry overmuch; modern reductionism has done all the work for us. You can be about as certain in the falsity of supernatural claims as it is possible to be.

    I'd like to counter that with my religion, Dualcosuperchristianity!  According to my religion, anyone who says the words "I believe in Superchristianity" will be duplicated and will go to Superhell twice.  Also, if you don't say those words, you will spend your next life as a completely satisfied duck.

    Obviously, it's better to be a Dualcosuperchristian than a Superchristian, and by transitivity, than anything else.  I look forward to never seeing you again!

      Actually Superchristianity seems superior to me. Superheaven seems preferable to being a completely satisfied duck (mostly because the former is more vague and I thus can assign my own values to it easier.

          So essentially I'm still just one person but with double the surface area available for eternal Superhell torture? I must admit that that sounds worse.

          >Superheaven isn't vague at all, it's just the state of being an imperfectly satisfied goose.

          Here I have to object. Nowhere in the extensive holy scripture of Superchristianity (all 76 words of it) is there any mention of imperfectly satisfied goose. You can describe your own religion's dogma in comparison to other religions but you can't just nilly willy add to the texts of other religions in question without creating your own denomination. Your explanation for what Superheaven is is just one interpretation of many. Only the rightful authorities can do that. In this case the Superchristian Superprophet /u/topiary_quail.

          All I know now is that Orthodox Dualcosuperchristianity is better than Jesyspan Superchristianity. If I happen to value perfect satisfaction more than the superiority of being a goose that is.

            I'm afraid that according to Metasuperchristianity (which I *am* the prophet of) all interpretations of Superchristianity are metaphors for the Jesyspan Superchristianity interpretation.  Now of course, you are free to not be a Metasuperchristianity follower, but such people are doomed to being an eternally unsatisfied platypus burning in a thousand Superhells.  I advise, therefore, that you follow Metasuperchristinity, which then proves that Dualcosuperchristianity is superior to any interpretation of Superchristianity.

        There's a decision-theoretic problem if you assume rationality must be computationally unbounded.

      There's quite a lot of parallels between Christian beliefs and the rationalist mythos.

      1. Do good in the world by helping the needy, and convert others to Christianity. When Judgement Day comes, you will be rewarded with eternal life and happiness.

      2. Do good in the world by working on x-risk, and spread awareness of the Friendly AI problem. When the Singularity comes, you will be rewarded with eternal life and happiness.

      There are attractors in meme space that pull beliefs in and fit them into a story. This is one of them. We know that our beliefs are shaped by our biases, and that many biases are shared by all humans. Is it surprising that the same biases affect rationalists and Christians in the same way?

      Oh, and there's a particular detail that I like better about the rational take: Instead of the good going to Heaven and the wicked going to Hell, everyone goes to the same place and it's a matter of determining what that place will be like. I think that's a much better story. Changing that detail back gives you Roko's Basilisk.

  One could imagine an infinite amount of gods, each with their own rules for reward/punishment. Maybe god punishes you for unjustified beliefs, and accepting Pascal's wager actually sends you to hell forever.

  The math doesn't support Pascal's wager once you consider more possibilities. Some Christians think that unbelief results in endless time spent in pain and misery. Well, suppose Religion X threatens a fractal super-hell, where every uncountably divisible moment of time produces a new timeline with a new, recursive fractal hell contained within it. Religion X's hell is not only worse than Christian hell, it is infinitely worse, in a higher order of infinity.

  So, gambling with expectation values doesn't work, unless you think you can assign a zero probability to every imaginable high-consequence religion besides those that are currently popular. Pascal evidently thought you could, but that seems presumptuous to me. It would reduce the wager to, "If you already think Religion Y is your best shot, you should go with it," which isn't saying much.

  Excuse me, but this bears saying in capital letters.

  WHY SHOULD YOU BELIEVE MORE IN BELIEF-ORIENTED MYSTICISM THAN IN THE POWER OF YOUR OWN HANDS AND YOUR OWN MIND!?

  Everything in the natural world plays a part in cause and effect.  If you are sufficiently capable, all of it, every last quark, can be turned to a purpose *you* deem fit, although I will kick you around if you try it with *people*.  Nonetheless, simply as a living creature in the natural world, you possess a foundation for ultimate freedom.

  Why should you respect a being who holds Himself back and refuses to interact in the common, causal fashion of two living beings, Who instead sits "outside" the universe of cause and effect, and demands that you pervert your thought processes away from what is useful *in all other circumstances* just for *His* sake?  Why should you cripple yourself for the sake of Someone who won't reach out His hand to help you as a few people *claim* He did for a group of a million Jewish slaves -- a deed for which He, *of course*, left no evidence!

  What an ego this God of yours has!

  Sure, you can go the "philosopher of religion" route, and start whittling down your God to be unable to do much anything other than provide a philosophical foundation.  That *does* get you away from the nasty old issue of evidence.  Then, however, you've got a philosophical foundation based on nothing you can think about, talk to, or handle in any way -- a God every bit as impersonal and uncaring as the atheist's empty space, but with more philosophy-of-religion books.    What good is that?

  Besides which, His eternity is cheap and shabby.  You wouldn't like it very much.

  There's not much point in discussing Pascal's wager unless you're *already* a believer. A quick look at the argument reveals that it's not really about whether you should believe. It just lays out the possible consequences of particular beliefs. But that does sod-all for changing anyone's mind. People can't really choose what they believe -- various pieces go into your brain, it does its thing, and then you're either convinced or not. You have some control over it, but by and large belief is sorta involuntary, and certainly not as simple as deciding to believe in god one fine day.

  Telling an atheist about Pascal's wager is a waste of time -- if they didn't believe in god earlier, they won't believe in god after the argument. If they accept it, the most they'll do is go through the motions of believing in god, something that any omniscient being will immediately see through. So what use is Pascal's wager anyway?

  It's for religious people to tell other religious people.

  There's an important unspoken filter you must run all religious arguments through -- namely, who is the audience? With a handful of exceptions, all religious arguments are directed by believers at fellow believers. They're preaching to the choir, because it's a community ritual that everyone gains from. The person who makes the argument seems pious and knowledgeable about their religion, and the people listening affirm their religiosity by nodding and agreeing. They can also get bonus brownie points by quibbling over tiny details while still agreeing overall. Everybody wins. 

  It's not even an uncommon pattern. As far as I can tell it's just some sort of naturally occurring ingroup dynamic where people almost ritually say certain things they all agree with. Reddit knows this pattern well. I believe the technical term is 'circlejerk'. :P 


  For such things, I always try to remember that humans beings are deeply political creatures, but they're not quite consciously aware of this. Politics is basically the art of advancing a personal agenda under the guise of a public one. You make things look a certain way (because that form is socially acceptable) even though it is something quite different. But such trickery goes *really* deep into our brains, to the point that we think we're making a rational argument, even though we're really just setting up a circlejerk. You think your allegiance is to truth and reason, but your brain is more interested in advancing the cause of social cohesion and scoring you tribal brownie points.

  **Tl;dr:** Pascal's wager is fine if you're a religious person who wants to reaffirm their belief or strengthen a religious community's social bonds. If you're an atheist, it's a complete waste of your time. Unless you're pretending to be religious or starting a cult or something.

  Speaking as an actual Christian - yes, we exist on /r/rational - we *don't* believe that Christianity is a "free ticket to heaven".

  There are a few ways of wording this, and it comes at different strengths, but pretty much everyone agrees that you have to lead a good life to count - as, obviously, anyone who actually believed Jesus was the Son of God *would* rationally do. Quite a lot of people also agree that, if you're good regardless, you'll still get in.

  So why believe at all? Well, firstly, 'cos it's true. But more in line with the OP, Christianity has had a bunch of thought put into ways to *be more virtuous* - which, obviously, is useful for fulfilling human values as long as you believe human values exist, regardless of their origin. (For example, the Catholic Church was very good at predicting slavery would ... not be looked on kindly by anyone outside that particular cluster****.)

  Oh, and I'm planning to live a lot more than 150 years, obviously ;) And then I'm gonna do it again, God willing.

  Anyway - this comment is a little rambling, but I get the impression most religions consider roughly-similar codes of ethical behavior to be necessary, if not sufficient, for salvation. Believing helps with that, but I wouldn't consider it necessary.

    Could you explain this please? The Catholic Church has been behind some major, egregiously harmful movements, behaviors and beliefs, not the least of which currently is the teaching that contraception is so sinful that not even people living in a country with epidemic HIV/AIDS should use it.

    It seems to me that saying they've put thought into being "more virtuous" is only of value if you take for granted that their virtues are correct, despite them having shifted on a number of issues over the centuries, and often lagging behind secular-humanist ethical thought.

      They waver pretty heavily on that, actually. But yeah.

      The contraception thing ... well, I don't agree with the metaethical justification behind it, but I can't deny that their predictions regarding the effects it was going to have on society seem to have panned out.

      Other than that, it's hard to think of other examples. Probably the Inquisition, although that's substantially misrepresented in popular culture. Maybe the crusades. But both of those are heavily characterized by the Church being influenced by society/politics around it, rather than the other way around.

      And ... I'm sorry, but secular-humanist ethical thought seems exceptionally prone to taking a massive simplification of ethics and running with it so far that millions of people die. I'm a humanist myself (albeit not particularly secular), but there's nothing there with a track record anywhere near that of any major religion. If you can't be your own ethicist, then you're better off trusting the Church than your local atheist.

  From the wikipedia article on pascal's wager.

  >However, as noted above, nowhere in the establishment of the wager does Pascal appeal to feigned belief; God, being omniscient, would not succumb to such trickery and unwittingly reward the disingenuous. Rather, in the passage following the establishment of the wager, Pascal addresses a hypothetical person who has already weighed the rationality of believing in God through the wager and is convinced by it, but remains unable to sincerely believe. Again, as noted above, Pascal offers this person a way to escape the irrational sentiment that compels him to withhold belief in God after the validity of the wager has been rationally conceded. This way consists of applying oneself to spiritual discipline, study, and community.

  If you rationally believe that god doesn't exist then you have minimal reason for accepting the wager, and Pascal would agree with that. Pascal first sought to disprove other religions and prove his own religion. This argument was just the final capping stone to his ideas.
