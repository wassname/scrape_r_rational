  I guess at this point the use of the name Juniper is just a calling card for rational fiction.

  *Ninja Edit*: Ah, I just double checked the post about it from a few days ago and see that this was deliberate. I feel like Juniper is now the [0451](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAtAyycx-uY) of rational fiction.

  I kind of like that Hector appears to be about to do a phenomenally stupid thing over a hook-up. Characters in fiction too often struggle with deep, emotionally fraught flaws that define who they are. Real people more often seem to struggle because of doing stupid things based on momentary circumstance.

  Despite falling behind 3 days this week, I still plan to publish either Chapter 11 or an Interlude as normal this coming Monday.

  I suppose this befuddles the telepath argument a little bit.

  There is still that scene from the last chapter where she noticed the mental viewing of the power outlet. 

  Different personality this morning to. Potentially personality/mood dependent powerset?
