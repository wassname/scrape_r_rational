## [WIP][D][BST] National Novel Writing Month: Week 3

### Post:

This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/), which starts November 1st.

* Want to check in on making some progress?
* Want to talk about what you're writing?
* Out of ideas and want some help?
* Just need to vent about your story?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

  Oh hey, it's november again, totally missed it. Good thing I'm already writing.

  I'm actually doing a sequel to Scar's Samsara. Yeah, I know, I said I wouldn't, but then I started writing something just for fun and here we are. Already 55 pages in. The main challenge is to hold everyone's attention despite the fact that it features mainly characters from the Lion Guard, which uh, I don't expect most people to have watched. 

  I'll also be working to see if I can start updating NTBS again. It's tricky though, keeping two entirely seperate stories in my head, and shifting mood and tone like that as I write. Still, I'll try to get back to doing weekly updates starting tomorow.

  (I'm also having to work until after midnight several times a week, which isn't making things any easier.)
