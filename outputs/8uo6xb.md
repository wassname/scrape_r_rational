## What exactly is munchkinry and the best examples of it?

### Post:

I see the term thrown around alot and a google search doesnâ€™t satisfy why the term came about.

  On this subreddit at least, it usually refers to exposing and/or abusing loopholes in a given set of rules, in creative and interesting ways


  My personal favourite example is from Harry Potter and the Natural 20, wherein a character points out that if one follows the exact rules of D&D 3.5 to their logical conclusion, then any character wielding a tower shield is completely invisible (as they and their equipment cannot be seen through full cover, and the tower shield is part of their equipment).

    i love that one. and i love how bad the karmic recoil is for abusing that exploit ;p

    D&D 3.5 is particularly bad for how many hilarious rules dysfunctions it has. From drowning a person to prevent them from bleeding out, to peoples eyesight and hearing getting better with age (rather than worse) and it being literally impossible to see the moon at night.

      "unwritten but commonly understood rule that the game master can override published game rules for any reason"

      The for a good game master, the reasons include "my players don't like the rule".

  Examples of munchkinry? There are plenty in [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/).  

  Imagine you have a superpower that allows you to control bugs and insects. Pretty damn creepy, and boring, right?     However! If you have *really* good control, like the protagonist of that story, you can use that to great effect. For starters, and that's not spoiling a lot, she uses her creepy crawlies to fabricate a damn great costume that can stand up to knives and small arms fire, because spider silk is fucking badass.  


  Or if you're a guy whose touch can stop things and people in time. Great for crime fighting, just put a dude in time-out then slap handcuffs on his immobile form. Easy, right? But there's more! How about you start carrying a stack of paper, so you can build staircases wherever you go? Or bring an inflatable tent, giving you instant access to an inviolable shield! There are some neat tricks with ultra-thin wires later on, but that would be spoilers.  

  Seriously, I could rave for hours and hours on how cleverly superpowers are used in that book, and that's not even its best feature; an honor belonging to its many well-developed characters.

  Just... don't be like me and put the book down after the second chapter because of the bullying, okay? It really doesn't last long at all, and while it's an important part of the main character and forms many of her traits, it isn't focussed on a lot.

    I put it down about halfway through. I tried, I really did, with all the recommendations it gets, but grimdark just isn't my preferred genre.

      Pity, but yea, the world is definitely dark and bleak as fuck. There are people who'll get pretty riled up when you call Worm Grimdark - that should be reserved for entirely crapsack universes with totally crapsack people like Warhammer 40k where there *are* no good guys - but I understand that it's still not easy to stomach.  
      If you read past Arc 8 and still didn't like it, chances are you won't like the rest either.

        Hmm, [this guy](http://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2015/07/what-is-grimdark.html) defines it more broadly than that... anyway, Worm, [as I understand it,](#s " doesn't exactly have a *happy* ending, just a world-isn't-dead ending") which is an issue for me.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          So he literally defines it as "Gritty, adult, dark science fiction and fantasy."? That's pretty broad, and yea, under that definition Worm is grimdark - and so is practically any superhero movie besides Spiderman. At that point the word just... kinda loses its meaning.  
          Like, yea, Worm is a shithole of a world, and every superpowered human has a tragic backstory by default. But there are still decent people, in fact even most villains have *some* decency or less shitty traits, even some of the literal Nazis. 

          Contrast that with WH40k, a universe where reality itself is close to coming apart at the seams due to Chaos gods, where a galaxy-devouring tide of bio-horror-monsters is about to overwhelm every major power, and where even the "good" guys are literal fascists that make North Korea look like a democratical first-world country.

          No, these two aren't even in the same ballpark as far as shittyness is concerned. We shouldn't use the same word to describe both.

            How so? Almost the entire MCU is basically action-adventure romps with the occasional emotional moment whose consequences aren't mused about too much before going back to the heroes mindlessly quipping their way to victory.

            Now if we're talking about the DC universe, or most of the pre-MCU superhero movies, like Singer's X-Men or the original Daredevil, then it's a different story.

  A munchkin is someone who would take a bite out of their family member if it gave them a power-up.

  [This TVTropes article](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin) does a good job explaining what the term means. According to that article:

  >The name "munchkin" refers to the tendency of younger players to adopt this play style. Munchkins are, more than anything else, immature. They tend to grow out of it. An old, possibly apocryphal, story states that they were originally called "muchkins" on Use NET, due to their tendency to try and acquire as "much" as they possibly can

  Munchkinry is taking maximal advantage of the rules as written, often in a way that was never intended by the writer.

  Perhaps the most extreme example is [Pun-Pun](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Pun-Pun_\(3.5e_Optimized_Character_Build\)), a kobold with a viper familiar who uses an unexpected combination of monster abilities to obtain arbitrarily high values for all his character stats and every other number on his character sheet.

  ```
  In pen&paper RPG munchkin is a player that minmaxes his stats, abuses rules, fucks over other party members on loot and xp, and does everything he can to get more powerful, to the detriment of the story and fun. Basically treats rpg like it's a competive game.

  When the people in your party jump in the way of your arrows because getting damaged/critted gives them (good) XP in MERP, that's pretty much the worst case I've personally experienced.
