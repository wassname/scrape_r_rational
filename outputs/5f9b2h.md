  Horray!

  You've got better prose than most, and I think you're doing a good job of nailing the speech patterns in One Piece.

  That said - One nit to pick, and two large issues. 

  Nit: Part of a rational work is that *everyone else* also get smarter. Why would r!Shanks use his *hand* to block a sword, when there's a lot around to use, or he could push the blade into a miss?

  And two bigger issues:
  First: Why not have Luffy eat, say, the Think-Think fruit? Work *within* the universe to give him his rationality "powers".

  Second: Motivation. Cannon Luffy wants to be pirate king, for Reasons, and just goes off to do it. r!Luffy would need to have a deeper reason for wanting to become pirate king. He'd also need to have a reason why becoming a pirate is the best way to get those underlying reasons, since his adoptive dad is one of the marine's top admirals. What are r!Luffy's goals, and why does he think this course of action will get him those?

    Not everyone else needs to be smarter. Notably, in HPMOR most characters didn't.
    I do agree that it would make more sense for Luffy's intelligence to be justified within the universe's rules. Actually the way his thoughts are written, which makes them seem almost invasive or external made me think something was going on.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Not all characters were necessarily smarter (though to be honest the Weasly family is the only one to come to mind that definitely wasn't) but at least the idiot balls should be removed. As in, characters should never just do this dumb thing that people of their level of competence simply couldn't do and still get away with.

        Fred and George were a *little* better!
        ```

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          They were. But not by all that much since they weren't dumb in the original story to begin with. Managed to turn their hobby into a believable business after all.

          Arthur on the other hand *definitely* wasn't, to the point of being an idiot-ball joke of canon-levels of incompetence at his job.

          Ron was the dumb self he was in his pre-teen years in the books but without the story focusing on any of his redeeming features and the rest of the Weasleys didn't really make an appearance.
          ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    To make a specific version of that critique, what I'm *worried* about seeing is the same plot points played out all over again, except Luffy has fancier thoughts. You don't have to go HPMOR or Luminosity levels of off-roading, but it would be fun if e.g. the same exact crew doesn't get forced back together.

    Not to mention One Piece is frikkin' long. Ain't nobody got time for that.
    ```

    - u/MysteryLolznation:
      ```
      How about the same exact crew, but with __more__ people? Looking forward to a reply :D
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Getting all those same people on the same boat is either going to be a long trip down the stations of canon or a series of contrived situations. Most of Luffy's crew followed him because he's good natured, stubborn enough to bull through their issues, and too stupid to be duplicitous. Rewriting everyone to fit would be kind of silly. Why not just write an original character and follow his/her journey instead?
        ```

        - u/MysteryLolznation:
          ```
          That sounds good, really. I mean, there are quite a few characters that wouldn't really need to join the straw hats, without removing much from the whole straw-hat vibe.

          While the necessary crewmembers that had some invaluable functions within the crew could stay, the ... _joy-riding_ members, for a lack of better words, could very well make due on their own, really.

          I'm really considering this one. Rewriting the canon, but instead allowing Luffy to solve the issues present in a different way seems really overdone. The best thing, really, would be to just write an entirely different route, with a huge divergence at some point.

          Thanks for the feedback. That's amazing of you to do.
          ```
