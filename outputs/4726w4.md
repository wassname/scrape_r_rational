    There is definitely a lot more to his character. Besides this rationality he's showing, there's probably more secrets he can tell Zorian (Sum of its Parts).

    Thinking of Xvim as a rational person, he of anybody would definitely want to exploit the time loop. Perhaps by joining the time loop (which, despite Zorian's skill, would upset the balance of power between them).

      Yes, he could outshine Zorian by an order of magnitude and that would break the story. My Doylist hat says this isn't happening.

        I like to think of Xvim as of a Feynman type of a person. Namely, one that has such a cognitive culture, rigour and intuitive understanding that almost any field is open to him if he spends several weeks into getting acquainted with it.

    I thought we decided those were a bad idea because mind reading and or torture and or random chance is more likely than time travel or memory erasure?

        I have one, but I stole the idea from HPMOR. It has two parts, so that two versions of myself would only need to say one half of the password. One major limitation, as I've learned here, is that it's more probable that true mind-reading exists than time travel exists. This is doubly true for Xvim, as mind magic *does* exist in that universe.
        ```

        - u/jkwrites:
          ```
          Two part password - that's a cool idea, and it made me think about how you could incorporate something like [Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) into this for safe mutual authentication!
          ```

          - u/FiveColorGoodStuff:
            ```
            This looks incredible, especially if it could be paired with some kind of memory-editing/deleting apparatus. Then again, editing your own memories just in case time travel happens to exist and you require it strikes me as a little *too* paranoid.

        Mine's a string of gibberish that I came up with when I was a kid.  My ex-GF also knows it and I used that for identity verification with her a few times, so it's not exactly air-tight.

        I've had one since I was in middle school, so before HPMOR. It's not an amazing one, but it's something someone else won't guess. I was older than HJPEV fictionally is when I made it though.

  Here's a legit question: Why is the chapter called Substitution? My best guess would be Xvim thinking Zorian had been substituted. Nothing else I can think of works, and the titles tend to have more significance/relation to their chapter. This chapter has more than just that.

  Now: the speculation.

  Zach could be Red Robe, but that'd be a bit silly. I think Zach would be able to figure out it was Zorian from when Zorian said sorry to Zach before leaving to see the soulkill (if my memory serves). Also his skill during the fight (at least the coin).

  There has to be more than Zach wanting revenge. I think that the relevant authorities were in on the invasion with the Ibasans. Perhaps Zach's families knew stuff about portals & the Ibasans. My memory is fuzzy on them, but they were military and _I think_ led the push against the Ibasans. Could the Weeping be man/lich-made? I think the politics must've been huge. Essentially, the Ibasans targeted the Novedas. When the Weeping didn't kill them all, Tesen Zveri was asigned as his caretaker to finish them off. It was all a conspiracy that Sudomir is taking advantage of. Please correct me on the Noveda family/Weeping if I'm wrong.

  Regarding the scale of loop. First, the simplest thing would be to assume that the spiritual world exists throughout the whole universe too (or permiates). Now, it's also weird to assume that someone made the loop; I remember you writing that generally, previous mages weren't as powerful. Could the gates not be manmade, but god/spirit/something else-made. Something that either collaborated with the humans or the humans stole like every other piece of their magic.

  Now, putting a limit on the boundaries of loop is complicated, eg. what would it be like outside of it? At the edges? Of course, it could be a simulation where say the Earth (or whatever it's called) is high quality, but the stars are lower. There may or may not be a boundary, like becoming high quality when viewed. But that's super complicated and has many nuances. So, if it was made by the gods/another powerful figure, then why not let it go across the whole universe, if the gods created it.

  I like to think of it as a god taking the world as it is, then in a split second, preforming the simulation until it falls apart. Then, after the final loop, the souls that may be changed (time travelers) are affected. For everyone outside the loop, only the time travelers are affected. They are affected the point in time when the loop supposedly starts. I hope that makes sense.

  The god puts (a) mechanism/s to interact with the loop inside it (soul switches, soulkill spell which I think is a switch, gates?)). Here, the two mystic gates aren't related. One is teleportation and the other is the single gate for the loops.

  I guess this solves the stuck in soul trap thing and everything else. The looping construct would be just that, a construct. It's meant to fall apart (like the Matriarch said).

  As for Kael's stuff: he can tell because Soul Sight. Second: his stuff is going to be used for something important. Perhaps there's another Soul Sight potion he's going to share with Zorian. Yeah, I'm a big fan of this theory. Also waiting on the purpose of the Silverlake chapter. All in good time, I'm sure. I bet they're going to meet soon.

  Other holes? Misconceptions? Other theories? plz share
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Yeah, I always had the theory that everyone in the loop was just being "dreamt" by the primordial or something powered by it; the loop will eventually end once the primordial runs out of juice.

    Furthermore, I feel like there's only going to be one soul that "escapes" from the loop. The Matriach's packet said something similar, about how there can only be one. 

    The final battle will be something out of Highlander; Zach throwing supernovas of mana, Red Robe summoning another primordial and Zorian, off to the side, ready to snipe whoever's left standing.
    ```

    - u/Green0Photon:
      ```
      I think it would be unlikely to only let one person out (too complex/Occam's Razor) but that ending would be super awesome. I think the end of the second arc would either be the memory packet reveal (which would be either total information or barely enough which would be because plot realizations or foreshadowing respectively) or would contain some nuts stuff with the soul container (or whatever it's called).

    > Here's a legit question: Why is the chapter called Substitution?

    Some other guesses:

    - Zorian's grinding on aranea was substituted for collecting herbs with Kael.

    - If the loop is isolated to this planet, the visible stars may be substitutes

    - In the political history, mages in Houses were substituted for first generation mages
    ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    That seems kinda complicated. I think your theory needs shaving with an ocaam's razor.

    I think it's pretty likely that there really are only two time loopers: Zach and Zorian. Only Zach and Zorian have that soul marker from when the lich did his evil spell thing, or at least, theirs were the only markers Zorian detected. If someone was concealing their soul marker, they would have to both 1. be a soul mage and 2. be in the loop. Unless the marker isn't indicative of someone who's looping.

    We don't actually *know* what Zach's motivations are, nor Red Robe's. If Zach was Red Robe, and if he had already deduced that Zorian was the other time looper, maybe Zach had no compunctions about killing Zorian because he would just be back in the next loop. Red Robe might be a simulacrum of Zach's. Have we ever stopped to consider why Red Robe disguises his identity? I mean, if Red Robe is in the time loop, then what does he have to gain from the disguise when no one will remember what he does in the next loop except for another time looper?

    Maybe it's so that the ibasans don't recognize him as a noble from Eldemar, so he can gain their trust? While that does seem more like a Zorian tactic, remember that there is a possibility that part of Zach's soul was separated from him and fused to Zorian's, which could explain why Zorian got pulled into Zach's time loop. And Zorian has been fighting more openly and directly now than he used to, which seems more like a Zach tactic.

    As for how the time loop itself works, maybe there isn't actually a time loop. Remember how the Aranea died? They never came back after the loop reset. Other people who die in the loop are back to life after the reset, but the Cyorian Aranea aren't. This feels like it should somehow be a big clue, especially combined with how "time travel is impossible" has been repeated so many times throughout the story it feels like forshadowing. So what could be going on?

    I'm going to just take this theory and run with it for a bit to see where it goes.

    Limits:

    1. no time travel
    2. not cosmic in scale. the phenomenon is limited to Eldemar and the surrounding nations, or maybe even just Eldemar if the Ibasans are already arrived at the start of the loop.
    3. Zach is probably Red Robe, since it's pretty late in the story and no other major characters that we've met seem equally plausible as Red Robe yet. Even if Zach only has a 40% chance of being Red Robe, it seems at this point like everyone else is even less likely to be Red Robe.
    4. the phenomenon is fueled either by the ambient magic, or the trapped souls, or some combination of the two.
    5. It is possible for someone to be removed from the phenomenon. I.e. the Cyorian Web. Their corpses are still in the phenomenon, but their souls are no longer in it, otherwise they would be back to life at the start of every new "loop".


    4 makes it seem like the phenomenon has something to do with the attempt to summon the primoridial, since that would be an obvious place for the ambient magic used up with each "loop" to go.

    This rules out dimension hopping, because that would require the Aranea's souls to be erased from time after a certain point in all universes that are identical up until the "loop". Since that would be cosmic it breaks limit 2, and so is very unlikely.

    Possible ways to remove someone from the phenomenon would depend on the nature of the phenomenon. If it is some sort of simulation (i.e. a "dream" of the primordial) then the Aranea could have been removed if their real bodies outside of the dream were killed. Supposing they're not time travelling, because of limit 1, they're not dimension hopping, which means that everyone in the story really is in the same place, which means that when the "loop" resets, everyone is replaced with a version of themselves that is one month younger. Or the changes to their souls accumulated from that month are erased.

    Maybe all of the "loops" exist simultaneously, and Zorian is just jumping from one instance to another, replacing whatever version of him is already there. If that's the case, then maybe the phenomenon isn't being "fueled" by the ambient magic or trapped souls at all, and that's just an indicator of which "loop" he's in. When it "runs out" that means that Zach has been to every "loop". In other words, a finite number of "loops" all existing simulatenously. This is unlikely because it doesn't explain the mechanism for how Zach and Zorian are jumping.

    Here's a thought. What if Zorian's soul *never actually* escaped from its imprisonment? Nor anyone else's? If we're going by the simulation/dream hypothesis, then this would make sense, but it still doesn't explain why nearly every trapped soul is reliving the same month over and over without remembering any of it. Nevertheless, the "dream" theory is one of the simplest explanation so far that seems to fit in text evidence and it incorporates the soul-collecting machine better than the other theory above does.

    I'm quite sure the starting points and ending points of the "loop" have to be very significant. Since Zach is the original "looper" we need to pay attention to what he does and what happens to him and in Eldemar in general at the start and end of every loop, especially the first loop. So what happens, generally? At the start of each "loop" Ibasans prepare to invade, Zach defeats his caretaker and runs away. At the end of the first loop, Zach was fending off the invasion when he got affected by the lich's spell. The lich's spell interacted with the phenomenon, pulling Zorian into the phenomenon. If we're going by the dream theory, and Zach had some way to remember things after every reset, then getting part of Zach's soul spliced onto Zorian might make Zorian remember too.

    Maybe Zach snuck in some sort of device into the mansion to transmit memory packets to and from his trapped soul? This seems unlikely.

    If we're still going by the dream/simulation theory, then we need a mechanism for how Zach remembers things after each reset. I think it's probably a memory packet. The question is how he's storing the memory packet. It would have to be stored in something that lasts through each reset. It could last through each reset if it's outside of the soul-collecting machine. It could also last through each reset if it's stored in something inside the dream that is still there with every reset. Maybe the memory packet is stored in the ambient magic that decreases with each "loop". After all, that ambient magic decreasing with each "loop" could somehow be hiding Zach's degrading memory packet. When the memory packet has completely degraded, Zach and Zorian will no longer be able to store new memories from each "loop" and therefore will no longer be able to "loop" and will lose their memories with each reset just like all the other trapped souls. The next question then is why Sudomir's soul would be in the machine if he's the one who created it. Someone would have had to kill his real body outside of the phenomenon. He said he created the machine for "political reasons". What sort of spell could he be gathering those souls for that would fit political reasons? He's not ibasan, and he's the mayor of Knyazov Dveri, and the people there love him, and aside from being a soul mage, he is not known to have been involved in any crimes or conspiracies against Eldemar prior to this one. It's clear from some of what he's said that he's not really on the Ibasan's side. He's just using them. So what could the Ibasan's give Sudomir? The ability to teach and practice soul magic openly perhaps? That doesn't really go well with his killing off of all the other soul magic experts in the nation. What about bringing someone back to life who is useful to him politically? Qtach-Ichl is the king of the Ibasans, right? Since he's a lich and that means none of his heirs could succeed him. Maybe Sudomir is trying to bring back one of Ichl's heirs, and is using the souls he captures to try to open a door to the spirit world? This would make more sense, but it would need some in text evidence supporting it. Hmm...

    So in summary there are a couple of theories that are most likely:

    -They're all trapped in a dream/simulation inside the soul machine
    -Zach is Red Robe
    -the reducing ambient magic with each reset is or somehow represents a degrading memory packet, and the memory packet is what is making the phenomenon possible.

    I bet those psychic mice might have something really important to do with all this. They're clearly not ordinary evil psychic monsters. If they were, they probably wouldn't be any more dangerous or foreboding than a threatening Aranea tribe. While they could be being used by the Ibasans for spying purposes, i'm not sure if they've actually been in Cyoria every reset. Have they?

      ```
      __If you're unwilling to read through my whole mess, /u/Sailor_Vulcan, read the bottom-most section, separated by the line.__

      Yeah it still is kinda complicated and has elements not backed up by the story. Few things on Gods, Portals, and stuff.

      In many ways it would be simpler to only have two loopers - one marker is better than two + the king's loop was only him. I'd say it's pretty likely that Zach knows Zorian's in it though: Zorian has given so many clues that if Zach was paying the least of attention and wasn't dumb, he'd have found out.

      I'm not even sure it's possible to hide the soul marker; if so, it'd be super hard (probably). No hints towards that.

      If Zach was Red Robe, he would've killed soulkilled Zorian already, considering he probably knows Zorian is a looper and Red Robe's 'kill every potential looper'/'kill hundreds/thousands of Araneans'.

      Good point of the disguise. Of course, if capturing Zach went wrong (assuming diff people) then he would want the Simulcrum to hide himself.

      How could he control the Simulcrum so well, though? We know for certain Red Robe isn't a telepath (otherwise Zorian would know). Perhaps when alone it would be possible, but probably not on the ground (as Zach) and attacking (as RR) at the same time. A potential solution would be Soul Switches bullshit, but Occam's Razor.

      I could definitely imagine Zach!RR as a fourth party in the whole politics thing (Eldemar, Ibasia, Sudomir, Zach!RR). That would be more likely than him being good or bad. It's still problematic though (limping in when he first comes back sick, but he could've been fine and wanted to keep up appearenced for Zorian). Mmmmmmm, perhaps, perhaps. Doesn't fit with Zach's personality that Zorian's taken on though.

      The Aranea plus __the assassins__ were soulkilled, which is why in particular they are dead at the beginning. The time travel is impossible could be important, being right by simulation. We don't quite know what's happening with Soulkill though. I'd wager time travel is more likely than soulkill.

      1. Difficult to say. Simulation's simpler than some other semi mind mess-with-people.
      2. Again, what would happen when you exit the area? Especially by having an area so small, people would find out.
      3. Less likely, yes, but not him more likely. There are more hoops to jump through with Zach than some random person. It's possible, but hard to tell. Random Idea:(With Daimen, Domagoj started off as world building, and just added that in as characterization for Zorian. Points for Zach?)
      4. It's very hard to say. If more local, then maybe the souls, a very real possibility if the loop is what Sudomir wants. It fights the idea of the original loop with the king, though. Yeah, solutions, but Occam's Razor. | Regarding ambient magic, unless there's a well, the world is mostly a mana desert. (With the exception of the dungeons.) I was thinking alignment mana or something, heart of the world magic, or godly magic/mana.
      5. There are definitely possibilities in every case as for why someone can be removed. As with some real time messing, it's simply trapping the soul (perhaps by attaching them to yourself in some way) to prevent them from returning to their body on reset. Or it could be souls leaving immediately after the reset. | A simulation would be a simple delete/don't return on something. A person with the marker could effectively have root level permissions to control the loop. That's the point of the switches. | As for your no real loop, it's less defined. Perhaps getting fully caught in Sudomir's soultrap? That would be debunked because of Kael(?)'s saying Zorian would be getting caught each time. It just gets more complicated to solve, which I definitely could.

      Yes, the primordial could be involved in some way, but there is no confirmation on its existence. (Idea: it needs the soul container, but Sudomir would never let that happen if that was the case.)

      Dimension hopping/Multiple worlds Multiverse sounds unlikely in either case. It's implied that the souls aren't actually killed, just moved/trapped/something else. Nothing requires they be erased, for anything. As for a godly or primordial dream, they would just be modified.

      Mmmnn it's getting hard to respond. Sorry I'm tired. You're going into more and more speculation. More complicated than simulation anyway (not the most likely thing, anyway).

      >Maybe all of the "loops" exist simultaneously, and Zorian is just jumping from one instance to another, replacing whatever version of him is already there. If that's the case, then maybe the phenomenon isn't being "fueled" by the ambient magic or trapped souls at all, and that's just an indicator of which "loop" he's in. When it "runs out" that means that Zach has been to every "loop". In other words, a finite number of "loops" all existing simulatenously. This is unlikely because it doesn't explain the mechanism for how Zach and Zorian are jumping.

      Just no. Why limited? Why simultaneous? It's so goddamn complicated. I love Occam's Razor.

      >If we're going by the simulation/dream hypothesis

      Of which there are many, that is, by a god, by a primordial, in the trap. The trap is unlikely because why would Sudomir go nuts? All of the dream ideas are simple in some ways, but have little basis in the story/foreshadowing.

      >Since Zach is the original "looper" we need to pay attention to what he does and what happens to him and in Eldemar in general at the start and end of every loop, especially the first loop.

      Yeah. He's important.

      >Zach defeats his caretaker and runs away.

      There's more to it than this.

      Also Zach's first loop was not Zorian's first loop, right? At most a decade for Zach, I can't quite remember.

      As for joining, parts of their soul swapped, and Zorian joined the loop. Thus, Zach keeps his soul and Zorian keeps his at the beginning of each loop. This is why they keep their magic abilities too: it's not just memory. The book actually says this.

      I couldn't read your final paragraph. It was... uh ... too off base.

      __If you're gonna take anything away from my critique take this.__

      ---

      I love how you posted a long-ass response to me. That's awesome. However _you really need to reread the book_. Let me repeat, __you need to reread the Mother of Learning__. You're missing some important ideas that the story almost goes out and states for you. Without these proven ideas, it's really fucking hard to theorize. I've read 3 times, I think, and I'm ripe for a reread. Also, this is in my top two stories, so I love to theorize about it.

      Forgive me if I'm patronizing or anything. I really don't mean it and want to enjoy the story with you :P

      After you do that, we can come back and be theorizing buddies. Also, sorry for not putting quotes in front of each comment. Just pull up what you wrote along side what I wrote.

      :\ It's probably real time looping and Zach is probably not Red Robe, but he could be.

      Also, you spelled Quatach-Ichl wrong. Hell, I might've spelt it wrong.

      In progress edit: The summary doesn't really need commenting on this. The brainrats have always been in Cyoria, just not always commented on. The Aranea have also prayed on them, too, especially after Zorian started helping them.

      Thanks for the thought man. I'm also close to character limit, wow.

        Don't worry about sounding patronizing. It was unintentional and kinda justified lol.

        I'll take you up on that offer if I can finish a full reread before the story ends lol.

  I find it extremly unlikely that Red Robe is Zach.

  What does this Red Zach *wants*? He wants to burn Cyoria to the ground? Well, he did it dozens of times by now. Why didn't he exit the loop? He wants to munchkin the loop before exiting it? Then why he wasted time on invasion, and why he wastes time on this game with Zorian? He wanted to play chess with himself, and then, when it bored him, he created Zorian to play cat and mouse? That's far too Occam-unfriendly theory, on the level of 'it's all just a dream'.

  Really, even Daimen!Red_Robe makes more sense.


  That said, everybody who paid attention know that Red Robe is actually **Veyers Boranova**, and this chapter's ending all but confirmed it. He is from Noble House, too, if you missed it.

  Think about it. From in-story perspective, low morals — check, bad temper — check, motive to see Cyoria burn — check, a reason to hide his identity (from Zach) — check, political reason to help Ulquaan Ibasa — check, opportunity to notice the loop — check, access to resources necessary to hijack the loop — check.

  From reader's perspective, do you think *nobody103* of all people just dropped Boranova's name in early chapters? Like, as a background detail? Oh, who am I kidding.
  ```

  - u/hoja_nasredin:
    ```
    actualy in HPMoR just for having baba yaga name appear 3 times readers were able to tell she is related to flamel.

    It would make sense that in MoL Red Robes is someone whose name appeared exactly once, or someone like Daimen whose anme appear every loop.
    ```

  - u/Cheese_Ninja:
    ```
    If we knew what RR has been up to the last dozen loops or so it would help a lot with speculating.  But Boranova does sound like a decent guess.

    There was another noteworthy line in that chapter.
    >"A topic for another time," Ilsa said without missing a beat. "For now, I want you to take notice of what happened when you dispelled the spell on the bowl – it dropped like a rock, and if it had not been magically strengthened, it would have probably shattered upon impacting the table. This is the main problem inherent in all disruptor spells. Disruptor spells are the simplest form of dispelling, and **virtually every spell can be disrupted if you put enough power into the disruptor, but sometimes disrupting the spell can have worse consequences than letting it run its course.** This is especially true for higher-order spells, which almost always react explosively to disruption because of the vast amount of mana that goes into their casting. Not to mention that 'enough power' can be far more than any mage can provide. Place your bowls on the table and put a few torn pages from your notebook into it."

    Possibly even an apparent time loop spell?  That could be interesting.

    Zach and redrobe have been in the same locality. But Zach may have instigated or helped the invasion before the time loop started and changed his mind when he saw his classmates being slaughtered. It could be a part of why he tries so hard to defeat the invasion repeatedly.

        Good point. Maybe the Zach we know isn't the real Zach but an imposter. Zorian needs to surreptitiously obtain Zach's training orb.

                Hmm. Nah, Imaya's mysterious husband is Quatach-Ichl. That makes her ancient, too, so probably she is Baba Yaga, therefore Silverlake.

                Come to think of it, didn't Kael warned Zorian not to ask Silverlake about her last name? And Ilsa warned Zorian not to ask Imaya about her husband. An obvious similarity.

                On a sidenote, Silverlake being Baba Yaga [explains](http://mythicalarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baba1.jpg) the mystery of her disappearing house.

                And if Baba Yaga is related to Quatach-Ichl, that makes Quatach-Ichl Koschei the Deathless, a lich from Slavic folklore. And guess who author is? Croat!

                IT ALL FITS!

                  So I literally just noticed now that Ichl is Lich with the L at the end. 

                  I don't think I'm the proper person to go looking for linguistic codes.

                  Imaya's stated last name is Kuroshka which is almost exact Russian for 'small hen' (exactly would be 'Kurochka', курочка),  and as you mentioned, Baba Yaga's traditional habitat is a hut on chicken legs. So it does all fit.
                  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    I think it's more likely that Red Robe (or whoever started the time loop) is another member of Zach's family (or someone else with a vested interest in Zach's survival), and that part of their "win condition" is that Zach needs to survive the events that they're putting into motion. 

    I've also been suspecting that it's Neolu for ages - or that, at a minimum, Neolu is working with Zach the way that Kael is working with Zorian.

    From way back in Chapter 3:

    "Neolu finished in only half an hour," said Akoja after a brief silence. "I bet she'll get a perfect score again."

    "Ako…" Zorian sighed.

    "I know everyone thinks I'm jealous but that's not normal!" said Akoja in a hushed but agitated voice. "I'm pretty smart and I study all the time and I'm still having problems with the curriculum. And we've both been in the same class with Neolu for the first two years and she was never this good. And… and now she's beating me in every single class!"

    "Kind of like Zach," said Zorian.

    "Exactly like Zach!" she agreed. "They even hang out together, two of them and one other girl I don't know, behaving like… like they're in their in their own private little world."
    ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      Counterpoint: this passage in Chapter 6:  

      > Like he suspected, the two girls Zach hung out with during Zorian's original month were nothing special without the Noveda heir there to help them out and hang out with them
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        That could still imply a Kael-style mentorship or some other method by which Zach passes on information to them from previous iterations, though.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```

      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        Just because that's Zach's motivation doesn't mean she can't have something else going on. Maybe Zach is letting her in on the timeline stuff when he chooses to visit, similar to how Zorian is telling certain people. Zach may also have developed his own methods of passing information from other timelines - or maybe a sufficiently powerful mind mage (or someone with a similar skill set) can get that info just from being in contact with Zach.

        I do think the "other girl" is also an intriguing possibility, however.
        ```

    - u/space_fountain:
      ```
      I still think it might be very relevant that Zach's entire family died out. Maybe his family was prebuilt into the spell
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        Yeah, that's definitely interesting.
        ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      > I've also been suspecting that it's Neolu for ages - or that, at a minimum, Neolu is working with Zach the way that Kael is working with Zorian.

      I assumed that was from Zach helping on that particular restart. I don't think Zach is really that clever.
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        That's definitely possible, but the specific language ("Exactly like Zach!") struck me as being a potential meta hint. 

        It's definitely possible he was just giving her test answers or whatnot - we do know he liked to find conditions that keep his classmates alive in the final assault - but I think it's worth evaluating the possibility that he eventually got lonely enough to research some method of memory storage or transfer. He'd been looping for quite a while before Zorian got started.
        ```

    - u/mat7cut:
      ```
      If it is someone from Zach's family who is intentionally keeping him in the time loop, why wouldn't they either reveal the plan so he can help and train his magic or just safely take him out of the picture so he can't interfere?
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        A couple options there:

        -The plan involves keeping Zach safe, but Zach wouldn't approve of the plan.

        -The plan involves keeping Zach safe, but Zach's knowledge of the plan would encourage him to take more dangerous actions.

        -The plan requires Zach to be alive at a specific point in time, but keeping Zach alive is not expressly part of the objective. (For example, Zach needs to be sacrificed to wake the Primal, but this consumes his soul and can only be done once...or something.)
        ```

        - u/mat7cut:
          ```
          Just to clarify, when I said "take care of safely," I meant why not knock him out through some magical way. Using mind magic or alchemy, for example. Or using some sort of time magic to freeze him. IIRC, based on Zorians tracking, Zach is also sleeping when the time loop begins so he would probably be any easy target.
          ```

          - u/Salaris:
            ```
            That's a very good question. Maybe that implies that Zach either:

            a) Zach having agency is important to the "win condition" of the loop;

            b) Keeping Zach incapacitated is either difficult or not worth the expenditure of resources;

            c) Whoever initially started the loop isn't actually active within the loop and/or has restrictions on their behavior.

            Food for thought.

    - u/glowingfibre:
      ```
      If Zach *is* Red Robe (which I am much less certain of) then it's time to seriously consider that Red Robe might have a motive that does *not* ultimately involve pointlessly kill people. It doesn't make much sense for Zach to be incredibly evil. Recall that having a piece of Zach's soul made Zorian *more prosocial* and interested in other people's lives and well being. If Zach's prosocial exterior was a facade then his soul shard would have a different influence. We might potentially imagine Zach to be *good but morally weak* or *manipulable* at worst, but I'd be very surprised if he ultimately ends up a real villain.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        >having a piece of Zach's soul made Zorian more prosocial 

        Did it? I thought he simply got his empathy in check and that removed the only problem he had with other people.

  >"You realize what this means, right?" Kael asked him. It was apparently a rhetorical question because Kael immediately answered it himself. "Every one of those times you died during the invasion, your soul was likely sucked into that thing along with everyone else's."

  >"Yeah, so?" asked Zorian. "The time loop mechanism clearly doesn't care about that. It just plucks my soul out of the pillar and goes on to do its thing like usual."

  >..."Yes, and the collection process is apparently sufficiently benign that you have suffered no soul damage from being exposed to it multiple times," Kael said.

  Yess, like I said in the previous chapter discussion XD

  That said, that was a good chapter. Zach reminds me of Naruto too much to even consider him a Red Robe, what a clever plan, Zach, I'm fairly sure you can't devise it. Xvim being awesome was expected since he showed his perfect mind shield, Xvim being *this* awesome wasn't. Politics make sence, and that's a good thing.

    As I say in another comment in this thread, I really don't think that Zach is Red Robe. Yeah, the soul kill invasion would be to draw the other looper out, which is possible, but I think Zach would've realized it was Zorian if that was the case.

        It seems to me like mages have a negative viewpoint to using non-magical attacks. Like when Zorian used the Handgun on the red robe, the red robe said "what kind of mage uses a handgun". Maybe mages dont use non-magical means of attack because of a cultural reliance on magic?
        ```
