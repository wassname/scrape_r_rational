## [HSF] Perspective flip of the 80s horror film 'The Thing'. Probably not worth reading if you haven't seen the film (which you definitely should).

  I enjoyed this a lot. When the alien discussed the tragedy of the almost immutable, aging, death-marked bodies we inhabit, I found myself sympathising with it, and with us. 

  Eventually, I hope that advancing science and technology will allow for indefinite life extension. I hope that it will allow for greater bio customizability. I hope that it will allow for greater self-awareness. 

  If Watts' thing had come to earth only a hundred years later, perhaps it would have found a much more familar world.

  Watts's alien is one of my favorite aliens in anything, ever.

    Have you read Peter F. Hamilton's *Pandora's Star/Judas Unchained*? It has a similar alien I also enjoyed reading about. Takes a bit longer to get to it though :P

  Peter Watts is proficient at making the alien seem familiar and the familiar seem absolutely repulsive.
