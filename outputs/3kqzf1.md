## Here are your powers, should you choose to accept them... [BST]

### Post:

You are a wizard in a standard urban fantasy universe. Here are the rules:

1. You start with four million joules of magical energy, which exists on a mysterious magical plane which apparently has no purpose but to store magical energy. 
2. You are able to identify who else has a store of magic around them, and, thus, who else is a wizard, by looking at them. (pictures and video don't count) You will also know if magic causes an effect within a quarter-mile of you, and what the effect is.
3. You can convert this magical energy to any others kind of energy with 99.99999... percent efficiency, and get it to do useful work for you. 
4. You make the magic work by concentrating on what you want it to do, and then speaking a trigger word to make the magic work. The magic will attempt to carry out your instructions, drawing on your available stores of energy to do so. There is a gap of about an eighth of a second between when you speak the trigger word and the magic begins the task.
5. Magic has computational power, but no intelligence. It can do math, but cannot create solutions to problems on its own.
6. Using magic to do a task uses exactly as many joules of energy as doing the task any other way, times a variable for distance between you and the object affected. At distances less than about a quarter mile, the extra energy for distance is negligible; after that it follows something like an inverse square law (magic at half a mile requires twice as much energy, magic at a mile eight times as much, etc).
7. Information which travels through magic, without passing through any other medium, travels at the speed of light.
8. Once you have begun a task with magic, the magic will continue to work until it does what you want or it runs out of energy.
9. Your store of magic refills if less than full at a rate of one million joules every six hours, except while you are actively using magic.
10. You can temporarily increase your store of energy through meditation. After fifteen minutes of meditation (no benefits for more or less time spent), you will gain an additional two million joules, which will be fully available for another fifteen minutes before beginning to drain away at a rate of hundred thousand joules every minute. This can't reduce to zero joules of stored energy. You can only meditate once every twenty-four hours.
11. If your store of magic ever drops to zero, you die. 
12. If you eat the brain of another wizard within eight hours of their death, the total energy they had available at the moment of their death is permanently added to your stores.  

How would you break this universe?

  1. Gain more power. This means eating the brains of other wizards. There's some aspect of diminishing returns here, because the recharge rate doesn't scale with the size of the the energy store, but that's alright; getting more power is a good first step to breaking the universe.

   If possible, get into friendly cooperation with other wizards. Brain-eating is just "after death", the only reason to kill other wizards is if you want it *immediately*. So we can have a culture of ritual consumption of other wizards brains post-mortem, if other wizards are amenable to that.

   Assuming other wizards *aren't* amenable to that (for example, if wizardkind has descended into an irrevocable war with each other) then I start killing some wizards. The biggest problem is finding them, and not being found in return. Experiment with other ways of "looking". Figure out why photographs and video don't work. Try to make some sort of outfit that would disguise me.

  2. Investigate how magic triggers work. Can I make them conditional? For example, "at 4:00PM do `X`"? If they can do computation, I might be able to rig a counter of some kind, even if it won't respond to a strict time. Conditionals are really powerful; they would allow for shields, for example, by saying "expend energy to counteract energy over a certain threshold that passes through this shield". If I can set up conditionals so that I never go over my energy store, causing spells to fail instead of killing me, all the better.

  3. Investigate computation. How much energy does computation use? How fast is computation? Can I make a magical interface with a computer somehow in order to make a supercomputer? If possible, I interface my magic with my smartphone. There are lots of potential applications I'd like to run if I'm relatively unbounded by the need for computing power.

  4. Start running a bunch of low-energy spells. 4 MJ isn't all that much; the handy [orders of magnitude (energy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy\)) page on Wikipedia informs me that it's about four thousand bullets, which is a good starting point. Magic bullets (or their equivalent) don't seem like the way to go; instead, I would go with things like remote viewing (extremely powerful even if restricted to a quarter-mile, for stealing things like passwords or grabbing sensitive information). It would probably be possible to make a whole bunch of money really quickly with just that, until I get to the point where money doesn't matter.

    Well, now we know why no such culture exists. Prion diseases are nasty enough when you don't have access to cosmic powers beyond mortal ken.

    In all honesty, though, that's probably pretty easily solvable- if you know the structure of a prion, it wouldn't be incredibly hard to eliminate them with this magic system.
    ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    I believe your math is wrong, it should be about two thousand bullets. 4×10^6 J / 1.8×10^3 J = 2,222 bullets.

    >  Figure out why photographs and video don't work

    I presume it is simply a crude patch to approach the intended rule of line-of-sight.

    > It would probably be possible to make a whole bunch of money really quickly with just that, until I get to the point where money doesn't matter.

    Rig the lottery. Bingo balls are much less than two thousand bullets. The problem is that other wizards will probably be in range to do just that.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I didn't do any math, so I'm not surprised. The wiki page is giving the numbers for a specific type of bullet fired from an M16, which I just wily-nily adjusted down because I thought it would probably be a bit high for what I think of as "the destructive power of a bullet". (An actual list of [muzzle energies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy#Typical_muzzle_energies_of_common_firearms_and_cartridges) can be found here if you want to do an actual comparison. But you'd pretty much never use the wizard power for firing bullets in the first place, so it's just for the purposes of concretely visualizing the abstract numbers.)

      > Rig the lottery.

      I worry that this would be too conspicuous, though I'd have to look into how anonymous you can be when you win the lottery. Winning the lottery seems to be the sort of thing that draws a lot of attention even if you're not a wizard?

      Or have a chain of people: Wizard A (4 million joules) has their brain eaten by person B, who meditates (6 million joules), and then is killed, who then has their brain eaten by person C, who meditates (8 million joules), and so on.

  >Magic has computational power, but no intelligence.

  This needs to be quantified, along with the efficiency rate of converting other kinds of energy to magical energy (or how magic may detect variation in nonmagical energy levels, whether through conversion to magical energy or magically abstract information, as in 7), because these are the most important parts. This determines the costs of remote viewing and automatic analysis, as well as other computation in general, and replenishment of a spell's individual power or your own through ambient means.

  In addition to this, saying that it has computational power but no intelligence is an oxymoron, as intelligent processes are a computation, and would be achievable in this system regardless.

  You need to specify whether replenishment occurs not at all while spells are in effect, or at a reduced rate, possibly inversely related to the current energy drain. Your rules 9 and 10 seem particularly artificial in their limitations, and I would recommend a less contrived ruleset for a story based in this setting. I am wondering what is so special about the brain here as well, and this would be something my character experiments with, as upload is a very highly-rated instrumental goal.

  You need to clarify how the detection of magic works. What is an "effect," and how much information do you have about the effect? Can you sense magical energy levels or detect them through magic with any amount of accuracy? This question in particular is important, as my immediate reaction to 11, despite the contradictory 8, is to always run a spell either alerting me when my energy levels approach 0 or shutting down all of my spells for me. Another possible interpretation of 8 in light of 11 is that spells are at least able to determine your own reserves, or there is the capacity to build in cost limiters into the spell itself.

  An accurate form of magic detection is *necessary* to answer any of these questions in-universe. I would require answers for these out-of-universe to know my character's capabilities, and how quickly I would be able to determine those answers in-universe through experimentation. You also don't specify how much of this information is given to the character, so I would assume the entire contradictory text is given to every wizard simultaneously. Even with these rules, there is not enough information to proceed, and an accurate form of magic detection is the largest prerequisite to even approaching breaking this universe. At the current level of information, with no other way to gain more (besides research to find a magic detector), there is very little I could do other than participate in the global cannibalistic deathmatch these rules would inspire.

  Research into safely eating brains would be required regardless of answers. I want my life bar to be as large as possible.

    That's not at all an oxymoron.  It just means that while magic can implement arbitrary Turing machines, it doesn't implement anything intelligent *by default*: if you want a mind, design it.

      True. However, this effect is reading your intentions out of your brain, so I'm not entirely sure how unintelligent it can even be. I will admit that the spells themselves have no intelligence by default, though.

  >Magic has computational power, but no intelligence. It can do math, but cannot create solutions to problems on its own.

  Does the computation cost anything? If not, you can get a lot more power out of it by telling your magic to do something like "push all the colder atoms to the right, and all the hotter atoms to the left," making a temperature gradient, and getting power from that.

  >You make the magic work by concentrating on what you want it to do,

  How precise and detailed do you have to be? Can I say "produce photons that act like a television screen tuned to channel 10" or would you have to specify each and every transistor and pixel in order to do that?

  >You start with four million joules of magical energy

  How much magical energy does it take to levitate something?  Theoretically, it should be zero (as you aren't adding any energy to the system) but that seems incredibly broken.

  EDIT to add:

  What kinds of sensory powers does magic intrinsically have?  Can it follow normal human definitions of what an "object" is?  Can it take inputs within the 1/4 mile (eg. "produce photons going away from this sphere, as if all of the incoming photons had reflected off of a perfect mirror.")?  Can it take inputs from outside the 1/4 mile for free (eg. produce photons coming out of this surface that are identical to the ones passing through that distant object/location.")?

  Killing people is obviously very easy within a few miles, so I won't go into too much detail there.
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    >"push all the colder atoms to the right, and all the hotter atoms to the left,"

    It would still take energy to accelerate the atoms, and you'd lose energy overall because you wouldn't get a perfect conversion of energy into some other format.

    >How much magical energy does it take to levitate something? Theoretically, it should be zero (as you aren't adding any energy to the system) but that seems incredibly broken.

    It would take energy to levitate an object up to a certain level. You probably don't lose energy for just holding something in place (assuming you can base magic off a planetary reference plane) though.

    - u/glowingfibre:
      ```
      If it's *magically* sensing the temperature of the atoms and that sensory ability doesn't itself cost as much as it usually would, there's still a net gain (since you've essentially created maxwell's demon)

  How do people become wizards? Maybe start some sort of wizard-generating farm, and quickly absorb the 4 million joules per person as soon as possible after their initiation as a wizard (I'm assuming you immediately start with the 4 million joules). Which should be easy, given that brand-new wizards shouldn't normally be able to skilfully control their magic.

  Also, given enough time, magical computers, and then a magical Internet. Although I imagine the interface would be a pain to use, since you'd have to manipulate individual bits.

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  > Your store of magic refills if less than full at a rate of one million joules every six hours, except while you are actively using magic.

  That works out to 46 watts. A human uses about 100 watts on average. It's possible that you're a perpetual motion machine, but it's not clear that that's the case.

  > After fifteen minutes of meditation (no benefits for more or less time spent), you will gain an additional two million joules

  That's over 2 kW. Much more than a human consumes. Now you can be a perpetual motion machine. You can cause a population explosion that never ends since you can support yourself on magic. And you can levitate for free, so physical area isn't much of a problem either.

  Experiment how magic works at molecular scale, as a catalyst. Kickstarting an exothermic reaction with a catalyst uses no joules of energy, other than the creation of a catalyst and the start of the first exothermic reaction. The start of the reaction is utterly minuscule on a Joules scale, but it's the "creation of a catalyst" which is vague. Magic seems to usually act as a 99.9999999...=100% perfect thermodynamic engine, so by extrapolation it should be free.

  If exothermic reactions can in fact be catalysed using magic, as the rules seem to indicate, all terrestrial matter other than Fe-56 is now susceptible to nuclear detonation, at minimal magical cost.

  I'm not sure how to use this knowledge without risking global extinction. There are so many actors in this world that MAD is unsustainable. What I need is knowledge. Experiment with building an autonomous magical detection system; one which can recognise casting and some to-be-determined authorisation system. If that works, set up the following global rule, or one like it:

  > (while 0) If [someone who isn't authorised] uses magic^1 , trigger a small nuclear explosion in their voice box (disabling their ability to cast magic while hopefully keeping them alive).

  This should serve to keep me anonymous while eliminating all threats other than non-exploded wizards who happen to see me in person. Since any magic is invariably suicidal, it is hopefully almost impossible that someone would stumble on a functional magical machine capable of significant damage within this system.

  I would also try to invent a system which allows me to incapacitate a wizard before I have to vocalise a trigger word. Most crudely this would be destroying someone's voice box if I snap my fingers while I look at them, and most sophisticatedly it would read my^2 thoughts, pick up the "that guy is a wizard" signal, and use that as a trigger to destroy their voice box.

  So, *GM volente*, this would serve to make me and people I authorise the only people capable of magic. It would leave me anonymous, except perhaps in the distribution of wizard fatalities which may be higher in my wake (solution: stay indoors until the number of people whose throats mysteriously explode starts dropping).

  I would then go about making the world a better place. Crank up particle accelerators, make fission/miniature black hole reactors, threaten world leaders into good governance, blow up terrorists, rapists and murderers, detonate all unauthorised chemical and nuclear weaponry, burn smallpox and cocaine, threaten to destroy the entire planet with my dying breath if it ever comes, etc.

  **edit: magic as a nuclear catalyst**

  Quantum tunnelling is a phenomenon by which an atom can 'hop' from one side of a potential barrier to another. This relies on the quantum wave-function being spread out over space, and not actually being blocked by potential barriers higher than the amount of energy available to the particle (which is in an energy eigenstate for purposes of this explanation), only decreasing at an exponential rate, going from "likely" to "pretty much impossible" in the span of femtometers. Quantum tunnelling is the key mechanism for all particle physics reactions, particles jumping from one energy eigenstate to another at nearly the speed of light and then staying there again for a much longer timescale.

  Important for my idea is that the probability of quantum tunnelling never quite goes to zero. It's an exponential decay, but those never reach zero. Nuclear reactions are exothermal, so the quantum tunnelling probability is non-zero, so without adding extra energy it is possible for the hydrogen in water to spontaneously react in accordance to typical solar fission reactions, though the probability means it probably hasn't ever happened at room temperature in the history in the universe.

  However, it can happen, therefore it constitutes "any other way" under rule 6. Since quantum tunnelling doesn't require outside energy, the magical reaction doesn't require energy either. Therefore you can catalyse nuclear reactions for free.

  I'd want to know more about the process of brain consumption. Is it enough for the entire mass of the brain to pass the lips? To enter the stomach? Given that it's presumably chewed or chopped up along the way, how pre-processed can it be for the magic transfer to still work? Can it be minced? Liquified? Dehydrated? Burnt? Ground into dust? Does it still count as eating if you throw it up after consumption? If you teleport it out of your stomach before it's fully digested (in any form)?

  Essentially, what is the maximum number of brains you can physically strip the magic from in a given timeframe? (ie if you can dehydrate and grind them to dust, you can probably eat quite a few at once.) How many molecules or atoms can you remove before consumption? Can you use magic to speed up time for yourself (or even just speed up your metabolism), allowing you to eat an enormous number of brains in what the world would consider a short time period?

  Can you extend the eight hour limit by freezing/preserving the brains? By magically putting them into a volume of slowed time? By accelerating them under thousands of gravities (see also the question about whether liquefying them makes a difference)?

  In summary, if a thousand wizards all died at the same moment near you *for reasons*, how many of their brains could you salvage magic from using every loophole you could think of?

  Is it possible to convert regular energy back into magic somehow, or is it a strictly one way process?

  If its one way, I would probably start by draining away a certain amount of magic each day to charge a battery to run all my stuff off of. If I can somehow store pure magical energy then I would do that as well to start accumulating a larger buffer.

  I would probably not heavily use my own magic pool to do anything, I would just convert it into some other sort of energy pool and use *that* for everything. 

  I would definitely be interested in identifying what magic actually is and where it actually comes from. The mere fact that magic exists opens the potential to exploit it outside of the conditions people have naturally. The best way isn't to break the universe, its to carefully dismantle it and reassemble it to suit your desires.

  "Information revolution". Computation is a physical process, this energy *and efficiency* level will let me run.. seriously good computer architectures purely in magic using buggerall of my overall budget.. 
  The energy limits don't matter, because any violent conflict ends with magically induced grand-mal in whoever had the longest triggerword on their attack spell, but mostly fighting other mages is a terrible idea. Dangerous, and no real gain. If the local mages are actually using the eat brains strategy, that means the culture is horrifyingly dysfunctional. Should probably do something about that.

  I am with most of these guys in needing more info.  However if I understand these rules upon magically  becoming a wizard I think my best tactic is to get away from everyone so that I can experiment with magic in preparation of leaving the planet after determining how to safely apply magic to sustaining my own existence.

  Probably work on replacing sleep, food and breathing with "meditation".

  After my own perpetual magic engine can be self sustaining I don't need to eat other people's brains.  Probably I'll go build a garden on the other side of the moon or something.  If some one is being uppity with magic and starts following I'll go further out.

  I'd start with stuff that takes 0 work.

  Cast, "hold rope" a bunch of times, and you've got a space elevator.  Follow the rope up, cast "hold air bubble" and you've got a space station.

  Magic can do math, so it should be possible to cast a "pull on object, tangent to its velocity" spell that uses 0 energy and do asteroid mining.  (+ infinite energy if magic doesn't have a preferred reference frame)

  At that point, you've got arbitrary money.  You're out of other mages range, and have the ability to drop orbital-velocity rocks on anyone you don't like.

  The other end of the scale would use very, very tiny amounts of energy to move precise things.  Destructive stuff is easy if you can directly mess with chemical bonds.

  For non-destructive things, it would be cool to make perfectly pure diamonds.  If you're paying the chemical binding cost for c-c bonds, you can get diamond for 57 kJ/g.  It's cheaper if you're transmuting hydrocarbons with some existing bonds.

  Desalinization would be really cheap (exact numbers depend on how close magic can get to Maxwell's demon), and surgery would be amazing.
