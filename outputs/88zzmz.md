## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  /r/CircleofTrust 

  Reddit's April Fool's prank this year involves creating 'circles' which are threads in that subreddit, in which you can give people a password and invite them in. It appears that getting more people is 'good' in a similar way to how 'karma' is good.

  You can get betrayed however. Every person who enters the code has a choice to join or betray, so be careful who you trust. You do not know who betrays your circle.

  It appears to have something to do with game theory and the prisoner's dilemma. People in the subreddit have flairs in the format like 0,0 or 7,5.

    But it isnt a prisioner dilema.
    Not all game theoretic things whith the words trust and betray have anything to do whith prisioners dilema.
    You can set up a prisioners dilema whith it , by interchanging  keys or  something like that .

      I was wrong, I thought it'd be a prisoner's dillema type situation, turns out it isn't really.
