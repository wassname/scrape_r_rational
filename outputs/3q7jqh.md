## You wake up tomorrow morning with the powers of Albus Dumbledore. How much wealth and power can you amass by the end of your very long life?

### Post:

You are the only one with magic powers. Everything else remains as it is right now. Feel free to start a religion but try not to get disected by the government.

  hmm... so i have a large pool of dubious magics, undefined by canon. i have magic enough to be tied for most powerful wizard in combat, and i have transfiguration. presumably, i can cast every spell in canon, or very close.
  If transfiguration is permanant... use that to launder gold and other, more useful, raw materials. sell them, probably on the black market at first, or other places. eventually, upgrade to making them consistently. 

  If transfiguration can change one chemical into another, at any time i can cause massive devastation with FOOF or other explosive chemicals, in addition to standard combat techniques, for self defence.

  I suspect I'll eventually accidentally commit suicide by chemical accident, but until then... I'll make money by turning something into something else.

  Imperio has potential as well, as does aparation, but most techniques aren't that useful, at least not in HP canon.
  Edited in new ones after a good night's sleep:
  Cheering charms, now that i think about it, could make a reasonably effective depression-retardant, if they don't create a dependency. 

  While the limitations on portkeys are unknown, these are fanon ones that sound likely- (portkeys are two way- so i could create a portkey to mars, but i'd need to send it there. portkeys can only go to a destination you can visualize accurately- so portkeys don't work unless there's a highly functional map with excessive detail- how convenient that these things might exist.)

  take a career making magical paintings, and paint at least four copies of myself. test for sentience, as well as memory retention. if this is the case, see if i can make magical cameras that make fully functional paintings, capable of interacting with the outside world. (photographs are clearly inferior to paintings in harry potter canon, they cannot talk, to start with. they might pass a turing test anyways, but it needs to be checked.) If not, upload my freinds and family anyways, but wait to upload anyone else, save the most useful- i might have more important things to do then add a few centuries to someone's life, and this isn't immortality- only the lifespan of a very well cared for painting.

  Renegade!Me: Imperio every important person on earth -- easily accomplished given Disillusionment, Polyjuice, and teleportation. 

  Paragon!Me: Use Geminio curse to create massive (albeit temporary) numbers of materials / objects for science and money.

      Force cooperation in a game-theoric sense on the world scale. Eliminate sectarian conflict, invest in infrastructure, food production and distribution, basic standard of living for all humans. Eliminate major negative influences such as organized crime, terror groups, or drug cartels, eliminate partisan political whining. 

      Find some way to increase intelligence. If Wit-Sharpening Potion or Felix Felicis actually works, make a ton of it, distribute to researchers. Force lawmakers to indicate monthly under Veritaserum that they are operating without improper external influence, bribes, or under duress. Failure to do so will result in temporary and then permanent removal of office. 

      Randomly check those who pass with Legilimency, just in case.

      Design new spells: fixed Tranfiguration for example to permanently and safely transform cotton into carbon nanotubes, like the spells to turn glass into steel. 

      Design a magical item which uses Aguamenti as a combination infinite clean water source/perpetual motion machine by running conjured water over a hydroelectric generator.

      Then play it by ear. Hell, if I have Dumbledore's powers, I have Fawkes too. Cure as many incurable patients as possible, triageing for those with useful skills or potential who would otherwise be lost.

  Not much, I still dont have a wand.

    ```
    You think he can't do wandless magic?
    ```

    - u/NotAHeroYet:
      ```
      He can, but wandless magic is less powerful, and harder. A large number of spells could follow conservation of energy subtly, preventing defeating entropy. I don't know that he can do wandless transfiguration or any of the other really useful spells.
      ```

  - u/pizzahotdoglover:
    ```
    Hahaha I didn't think of that. Powers include the wand. Phoenix would be useful too
    ```

  - u/Geminii27:
    ```
    Hmm. If you get the inherent magical knowledge as well, I have to wonder if Dumbledore knew enough to be able to construct a wand, even if it wouldn't have been Ollivander-standard. Presumably there's not just one single source of wands in the world.
    ```

    - u/Quillwraith:
      ```
      They all have cores from a magical being, so unless wizard hair is valid, it's probably a no-go in this scenario.
      ```

      - u/Geminii27:
        ```
        Or whether enough wandless magic could be put together to recreate said magical beings, although that sounds difficult. I wonder if it's possible to create wands with nonmagical cores, even if they're less powerful?

  1. Luck Potion

  2. Decide further actions based on dice roll
  ```

  - u/Sceptically:
    ```
    Only if you also have Dumbledore's access to reference materials and reagents. Power means little without the knowledge of how to use it effectively and the means to direct it appropriately, and to make a luck potion from memory would require the use of a luck potion.
    ```

- u/captainNematode:
  ```
  Assuming this is canon Dumbledore.

  Step 1. Amass a moderately large amount of wealth via conventional means (transfigure or Geminio rare materials, use Reparo to mend expensive machines, use the luck potion for anything money related, generate energy in any of a bajillion ways, such as through the use of reducio and engorgio, heal otherwise incurable injuries or diseases, scry for lost treasure or mineral deposits or whatever, become a celebrity).

  Step 2. Bribe Rowling to change canon to include an "infinite wealth" spell.

  ```
  I don't want to die, so I'd presumably just lose my body and be a ghost. If I live that long, and given what I'd manage to do near the beginning, I'm pretty sure I can take over a good chunk of the visible universe.
  ```

- u/protagnostic:
  ```
  I'm gonna go with "all of it".
  ```

- u/Jinoc:
  ```
  Honestly, I'd probably start with using polymorphic magic of whatever kind, as well as transfiguration (stuff to platinum should get a bit of money, though there are much better ways), to fulfill pretty much every hedonistic desire I have. Shouldn't take too long.

  After that, try to nudge policy in a low-conflict direction, basically. Eliminate nuclear weapon stockpiles (not in a widely advertised manner) in the hands of regimes I don't trust (i.e. pretty much every non-western ones). Get Putin to self-destruct, just in case. Possibly create a mass hallucination in two or three ISIS locations to get them to radically alter their religious beliefs towards more peaceful ends.

  After that, it's nudging different government to a) get increased funding for AI research and b) pass a few legislations I like.

  And once that's done, basically back to hedonism. I can get everything I want with a flick of my finger, life isn't hard.

      The answer to this question is honestly... magic.
      ```

- u/rdalex:
  ```
  Amassing wealth and power?  Are you kidding?  Magic can get you those, but _managing_ them, that's waaaaay too much work. As demonstrated by Dumbledore himself, in fact.

  As the only one with reality-bending stuff, I 1) become immortal, 2) stay under the radar and 3) concentrate on a solution to the "hey, this guy looks exactly like his long line of ancestors" classic problem.
  ```

  - u/Geminii27:
    ```
    That's why you have field-effect spells cast on national, economic, and military capitals which constantly nudge all the people in them towards supporting, maintaining, implementing, or at the very least not acting against your long-term goals.

    (Or create a telepathically-spread and magically boosted memetic virus which does the same.)

    While there might still be a significant spread of individual personalities and thoughts, *on average* the world will be more likely to do things you want done.
    ```

    - u/rdalex:
      ```
      Unless it's basically like making a wish (supply a more or less well-formed thought, no effort to cast, no effort to maintain, no time limit), such AoE spells still sound like a way too much work to develop, set up, cast and maintain.  Not to mention that you'll condemn yourself to a lifetime of fighting against humanity's inherent stupidity, and let's be honest here, if you're doing it you've already lost.

      I guess you _could_ cheat and continually tweak the global population's minds, with whatever self-sustaining method you can think of, but frankly I'd like to think that even with near-omnipotence I'd still retain some measure of moral integrity.  As my current position is that my self is defined by my thinking patterns fed by my memories, the very concept of manipulating people's minds in the shadows is abhorrent.

      So to summarize, I'd be too lazy to set up such a worldwide affront to my sensibilities.

      (Sometimes I wonder what I would do in a supervillain's shoes, and then I realize that I'd probably stay at home with a good book, and the story would be over in two pages)

    Be one of those fanfiction!Dumbledores that's a metamorphmagus. Then you'd only have two steps.
