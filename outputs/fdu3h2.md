  It's been too long since I was writing original fiction and this has been kicking around my brain for a while.

  Blurb:

  Athos is a good dog. He likes frisbee, bacon, and his family (SmolFriend, Mom, and Dad). He's not so keen on falling through an interdimensional portal to a fantasy world where floating boxes tell you that you've just been given status as the 'Supreme Exemplar' of your species, a powerful package of abilities that includes human-level intelligence. Sure, being smart is nice but less so when it comes with the need to survive in a land made from bits of different dimensions stitched together like patches in a quilt. A thousand species, a thousand lands, sorcery and super science rubbing elbows, wars and intrigue everywhere...it's exhausting for a good dog who just wants to go home!

    Ow his poor tail! Why is it that keeps happening to good dogs? Stephen Matuchek in Operation Chaos, and I think Professor Wolfe Wolfe in The Compleat Werewolf, both had their tails shortened in the course of the story.

    Eagerly awaiting chapter 2.

  I thoroughly enjoyed that first chapter. I think you did a good job representing a non human intelligence at both cognitive levels. Plus he is rather adorable, as any good pupper would be.  As far as the language goes, a dog who can't understand those he wants to get pets and belly rubs from, doesn't seem like an optimal doggo, so looking forward to your mentioned magical solution.

  I wrote a comment about this not being r/litrpg and hoping to see some rational worldbuilding or characters, but deleted it when I noticed who the author of this post is. I have high hopes!

    I'm flattered. :>

    Are LitRPG stories definitionally not rational and therefore not suitable for /r/rational?
    ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      No, but they are also not definitionally rational, and there's an occasionally recurring problem around here of people posting entirely-irrational stories that just happen to share a format or genre with some rational stories.

      I wanted to try to head this off early if it was here just because other litrpg stories are here, and not because it [eventually] contains rational plots / world / characters.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:

        Gotcha.

        I'd like to think it will have rational etc in it, but we'll see!

  >This guy? This guy was making me wonder if perhaps there were limits to the whole human/canine friendship compact. If so, I felt like he was definitely crossing those limits.

  Hahaha ok I'm all in

  >**Supreme Exemplar!**

  Literally *the goodest boy*
