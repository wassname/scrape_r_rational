  Oh my god:
  > “Full power,” Jake said.  “Ram it.”

  This was incredibly well done, and tied in to the end of the OG Animorphs story beautifully. 

  My current theory for Vasco is that Edriss is coming to save him, since she doesn't want a part of herself to die.

    This is the intended interpretation.

  ```
  In Roman mythology, Jupiter was the child-- the "joint creation" if you will-- of Saturn and another titan. Saturn tried to eat Jupiter when he was a baby, and was tricked by the other titan into eating a rock instead. He believed Jupiter was dead.  Saturn was later defeated by Jupiter, who reigned over the new age of gods as God of the Sky.

  In this chapter, a bolt of fire the size of Jupiter is flung at a titan the size of Saturn, who is consuming a very large rock. As best as I can discern, this chapter takes place sometime around Halloween in the late twenties, meaning the Earth and Saturn are aligned.

  The Fury of Jupiter will destroy them both, before hurtling onward into the void.

  Years later, if alien beings come to the solar system to see where it all began, they might search the skies for the receding blaze of glory, exploding in slow motion due to time dilation as it carries away the age of titans, and marks the dawn of the age of gods.

  They can find it in the constellation of Aries.

  The Ram.

    If this was an intentional easter egg, I believe it may just be the best I have ever discovered. If not, I suppose the urlimist deserves credit for poetic flair.

    (Also, depending on how z-space corresponds to ordinary space, that fireball may well be headed directly toward whatever planet the Howlers most recently came from. It's certainly going to wipe out everything near the mouth of this side of the z-space bridge)

  Oh that was so good!!!  I was literally screaming "Ram the sun!!!" by the end!  In no other story could I be so incredibly excited by the protagonists making a suicidal move to explode the solar system but that's part of what makes this story so good!

  Also <3 <3 <3 at Maninho sacrificing themself to give Tobias a Garrett, that was so sweet and touching.

    Many thanks to u/4t0m, whose post on [character arcs](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/kp7wgl/character_arcs_in_ranimorphs/) was pretty influential throughout the past two chapters.
    ```

    - u/4t0m:
      ```
      I was really not expecting to get such a heartwarming scene between Marco and Jake (Edit: and not only the care in the first scene, but the trust at the end! Perfect!) or Tobias and Garrett, this late in the story, and thought there was pretty much no chance you'd wrap up Tobias' conflict about identity and death.  

      Great chapter.

        The end of Tobias's section made me tear up. Never thought I'd be saying that about an Animorphs fanfiction at the age of 23, but here we are.
        ```

        - u/4t0m:
          ```
          There's some serious economy of storytelling in this chapter.

          We even see a yeerk sacrificing itself for a human's wellbeing (probably...), lending credence to the idea that Terra really has absorbed cooperative and altruistic values.

          (Edit: Not just cooperative, but choosing to stop experiencing, for the benefit of another, is really incredible to see from a yeerk.)
          ```

  - u/oleredrobbins:
    ```
    Why did Garrett have leave? How was he helping Rachel? I didn’t understand that part
    ```

    - u/holyninjaemail:
      ```
      I'm assuming it'll be explained next chapter!
      ```

    - u/daytodave:
      ```
      Garrett's the other outlier, the second hardest to predict after Rachel. His name wasn't in the prophecy, so it's likely Crayak has spent less time modeling him than the others. He's also the mind most different from Rachel's, so he's the most likely to come up with something she wouldn't.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        He's also the only one with anything resembling an actual superpower, if it comes down to "defend Rachel while she's focusing on other stuff."
        ```

        - u/daytodave:
          ```
          Can Garrett please please please thought-scream into a hypersight sequence with Crayak?
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I mean, he could've waited until there was a reasonable probability Garrett was dead... but... yes, it was touching.
    ```

    - u/holyninjaemail:
      ```
      It's not about Garrett being dead.  It's that what Tobias needed at that moment was a Garrett there with him, and they both gave each other permission to do whatever they wanted with their morphs.  If there are two Garretts when all is said and done neither of them will mind!
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Right, but the question is if it's worth it for Maninho to sacrifice his life if Garrett is still probably alive.

        Edit: Unless Maninho is still alive, just morphed!

        Edit2: Never mind, that would seem too cruel to that instance of Garrett...
        ```

        - u/holyninjaemail:
          ```
          That's the entire point of the "what’s good for you *is* what’s good for me.  And trust me: you need this."  Maninho was created such that he genuinely values Tobias's well-being above all else, including for instance continuing to exist as himself.  Presumably Tobias can get a new shard from Terra after this, so he won't be permanently Yeerk-less.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            I know that according to Maninho's utility function, it was worth it (as far as he thought), I was just wondering if it was *really* a good idea.
            ```

            - u/TK17Studios:
              ```
              They do not expect to be able to rendezvous any time soon; the whole point is that the Chee ship is trying to get as far away as possible, as fast as possible.
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                Yeah, I got that part, I just feel sad for him. I get attached to fictional characters sometimes. (I really liked the chapter, by the way.)
                ```

                - u/daytodave:
                  ```
                  The hologram conversation was an opportunity to collect every last shred of data they could about Tobias-and-Maninho, so Terra has a way to reconstruct Maninho's requiem and return it to the sharing.

                  **Edit:** I just realized that if the holograms transmit thought-speak, Maninho could have quietly morphed into a tardigrade and talked privately with Terra. Maybe he sent them something like the *delest*, to carry his final thoughts back to the sharing. He could have also asked the ship to scan him and store a backup before he morphed (the only reason individual yeerks can't be morph-resurrected is that Seerow's tech tries to extrapolate from DNA when it scans an incomplete organism, but Good Ship + Quat's lab tech wouldn't have that limitation).

- u/KnickersInAKnit:
  ```
  Wait hold on a moment here. Maninho is tiny. Tiny morpher mass = able to spend ages in morph, way more than the 2h limit. Tobias was asleep for that long? Long enough for the pocket dimension with Maninho to collapse, and then for Ship to burn off the Yeerk tissue in the Garett morph after?

  Edited to add:
  That Jupiter-sized chunk of the sun is one day going to demonstrate why Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest sonofabitch in space...

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    So, in an earlier draft of the chapter, Cassie was going to head to Mars *as Rachel,* in a seven-Potters-style deflect

    and the idea was that Cassie was going to just grab onto, like, *an entire Bug fighter* and take it into her morph so that her time limit was like 3sec and then she'd die and be Rachel and the Chee ship could burn away the tissue

    and that was Dope and Rad until I remembered that morphing would totally let Crayak know what was up, under some pretty reasonable assumptions, so instead of having Cassie sac herself I went with what you see above

    but anyway long story short is, you can just morph with a boulder and hey, presto, very very short time limit.

    Fenrir's also correct that you could just burn away the control tissue, but that feels more ... violently unpleasant, or something.
    ```

    - u/KnickersInAKnit:
      ```
      Oh man. RIP Maninho. You were great.

      Question, and this comes down to purely author headcanon territory...did Garrett consider partnering with a Terra shard to mirror Tobias before departing? I'm curious as to his reasons if he did but decided against it.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Author headcanon is that Garrett would take on a Terra shard, à la standard transhumanist "but this is just better," especially post-hypersight.  I am not decided, yet, whether he had time to do that in all the hustle and bustle.  Guess I gotta pin that down before the next update.
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I just realized Maninho might still be recoverable by Rachel, if he stayed in the hypercomputer since he never demorphed.
        ```

        - u/KnickersInAKnit:
          ```
          I thought once the pocket dimension collapses that's it for the morpher though?
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Right, but it's implied that the data stay in the hypercomputer from where the Players could potentially recover them if they wanted.
            ```

          - u/daytodave:
            ```
            Only if Maninho actually morphed with a boulder to give himself a quick death. If he just had the ship burn off the tissue, the bubble could be stable for days
            ```

    - u/Brassica_Rex:
      ```
      >morphing would totally let Crayak know what was up

      But... But... She... Still morphs in this version?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        They all morph at or after T=0

        The key was that you couldn't have anyone morphing *before* the moment when they break cover.
        ```

  - u/FenrirW0lf:
    ```
    There's technically no reason the ship couldn't burn off the control tissue before Maninho itself dies. Or perhaps Maninho is still connected and is just letting Garrett be in control.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Or he just asked the ship to burn off the tissue right away.
    ```

    - u/daytodave:
      ```
      Maninho's time limit is long enough for Garrett to go through REM sleep, and Garrett wondered why Tobias didn't just stay in his morph armor to get his hand back. So this Garrett morph could go to sleep, get acquired, and then Maninho can demorph, and Tobias can restore the same Garrett using Quat's lab with complete continuity.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I think that if Maninho did that, there would be no need to leave the note - the note sounds like something more final.
        ```

- u/FenrirW0lf:
  ```
  This chapter was great. Answered a lot of questions but, of course, raised plenty of others too.

  One thing is that I'm super curious about what's really going on with Crayak right now. On the one hand it's possible that it really *did* spend its initiative down so low that the best it could do was mobilize the remaining Howlers and also launch a few whatever-weapons-they-were from the not-really-Earth-anymore's surface. But on the other hand, maybe it didn't and it's holding its initiative in reserve for... something. But if that's the case, what kind of *something* is worth risking the hypercomputer that it currently lives in? I don't feel like getting Marco and Jake to sacrifice themselves is itself enough of a reward for that kind of risk, if it could kill them off and more in some easier way.

  And of course the other thing is what's the deal with all the unanswered alternate universe/alternate timeline shenanigans, and how will that play into the endgame? Is something going to happen soon that's the actual cause of those shenanigans? It's been claimed that time travel is impossible in this universe, but do we really *know* that? Maybe self-consistent loops are possible à la HPMOR, and we've just seen the weird effects of some future cause radiating backwards in time. Or maybe there's a DBZ-style immutable but branching timelines thing going on, and the current universe is the result of intervention from another timeline. But if that's the case, who intervened and when? All in all, I still have no idea what to make of it and I guess we'll have to see what the next chapters bring us.

  There's also the question of what part the Visser has to play in the remaining chapters, if any. Does he have backups that would have survived the quantum virus? If not, then he's presumably still backed up inside the hypercomptuer several times over like every other morpher. Would Crayak have a reason to bring him back after wiping him off the game board? Would *Rachel* have a reason to bring him back?
  ```

        ```

        - u/daytodave:
          ```
          Maybe the goal is to get the game to a state where Crayak has to simulate a scenario where a quantum virus is made that perfectly matches a critical piece of Its own hardware, while Rachel quietly pulls the machine with that hardware into regular space, where it's immediately ripped out by the simulated quantum virus
          ```

        ```

    - u/FenrirW0lf:
      ```
      plot twist: Crayak deduced Toomin's gambit and knew all of this was coming. So it's pretending to put up resistance while quietly guiding the Animorphs along a path it wants. Also destroying the arbiter is bad actually, and just helps unleash Crayak sooner rather than hurting it.

      not sure how confident I am in that line of thinking, but it could be a thing. especially since there were two separate attempts to destroy the arbiter, and Crayak seems pretty content with sitting there and letting the second one happen after the first one foiled itself.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        ^(SEEMS PRETTY CONTENT, DOESN'T HE)
        ```

        - u/FenrirW0lf:
          ```
          If all that is true, hopefully Rachel is quick enough on the uptake to divert Jake and Marco's hyperdrive jump before it's too late! If not, I guess *she'll* be the one trying to deflect all the damage instead of Crayak...

    Oh you know what, I hadn’t actually thought about that. There is a good chance Crayak just stops their ship. I’m not sure if he can kill them outright because they’re the “chosen ones” and may still have a lot of protection in the game a random person wouldn’t

  /u/TK17Studios - thanks so much for writing this!  FYI, I've recently moved it to our wiki's 'Defining Works' section, on the basis that I think of it as part of the *reflectively* rationalist canon along with *Luminosity* and *HPMOR*.

  Very few stories, even here, so strongly convey the experience of reflecting on rationality that readers can learn from it.  (in HPMOR we learn mostly from the *inadequacy* of reflection, but he *was* eleven...)

  Always on the edge of my seat to read through another one of these updates. :)

  I have a question: Regarding everyone generally avoiding morphing before the arranged countdown-end time so as not to give anything away...

  And regarding Tobias and Garrett acquiring one another shortly before the arranged countdown-end time...

  Does the acquiring process itself not access the hypercomputer, and the characters know that it doesn't? Unless this was explained or discovered at some point that I missed, I would have thought that it does, the same way that morphing does, to upload and process the acquired pattern so that it can be used later.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    They simply didn't think about it.

    It's *plausible* that the acquired patterns are saved locally, and not uploaded to the cloud, such that it wouldn't tip off Crayak.

    Interestingly, if it *did* tip off Crayak, for some reason Crayak did not seem to respond as if it had noticed...

  I love the nods to canon here after the last few chapters seemed to veer wildly away from it. I'm glad (/heartbroken for her) that we got the same reckless!Cassie that canon gave us. Cassie was always a wildcard in canon, even more so because none of her friends ever particularly recognized her as such, which made it all the more damaging when she did break ranks and do something unexpected.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Yeah, I drew heavily on alternate-future terrorist Cassie for these two chapters (or like, not her directly, but I tried to imagine a transitional state, and what would take her from the-Cassie-we-know to the one we saw bombing civilian Yeerk population centers).

      You may or may not be familiar with Madoka Magica (another of the worlds that spawned [a very popular fic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToTheStars/) in a similar vein to others on this sub), but if not, the despair event horizon is a pretty key concept in that world. And as such, it's the people with the most deeply held idealistic principles that end up snapping the most severely.

      This Cassie is not unlike Madoka Magica's Mami when she (>!in that one timeline!<) learns the truth about the world they live within. >!Naturally, she takes it upon herself to 'save' everyone she can from an even worse fate by deciding the best thing for everyone is for them to die then and there instead of possibly facing future tortures and suffering. And with that goal in mind, she's very quick to lean in to the fact that no-one expects it of her to quickly restrain and kill half of the team before the news even sinks in properly for them.!<

  This chapter might be summarized as "remember all those NPCs? Turns out they can make decisions, too. Oops."

  There's something thematically relevant, there, but I'm still trying to process the last scene and comment simultaneously, so I'm not sure how to phrase it better than <3 <3 <3 .

  So I think the idea here is that Crayak put too much of himself into the Arbitor, that's the megastructure that showed up around Earth, and their plan was to distract Crayak so they could do as much damage to the physical structure as possible, possibly while blowing up the Sun and/or Earth, in whole or in part, whichever works. Something went wrong. Feels like the Howlers leaving a contengency deadman's switch type thing, more than direct action from Crayak, but that last scenehappened so fast I'll have to reread.

  Thank you!

  Edit: Eddris may or may not have screwed everyone over by allowing Bosco to morph, thus revealing the plan to Crayak?

  And it really sucks to be Cassie right now. Though I guess it really sucks to be within 1AU of Earth right now, in general.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    As Invisible Pony points out, Edriss had no incentive to tip off Crayak.

    In my headcanon, she was *aaaaalmost* not self-aware, in the way that you can kind of sneakily let yourself do something you know you shouldn't do, while humming innocently to yourself/distracting yourself/not thinking about it too closely.

    So she stuck to the plan, in a fashion that would be visibly hard to distinguish if somehow anybody checked, in a way that would allow her to truthfully say things like "yep, I've told him to morph at the appropriate time, I've told him to launch at the appropriate time, we're all set."

    But she slipped a couple of digits—enough to ensure that he'd come out of hyperspace *not* in the middle of the sun.

    BTW his morphing was part of the bluff—he was meant to morph so that Crayak would *see* that they were alive, that they were coming, that the sun was going to get rammed.  But if Crayak did in fact see, Crayak would have noticed that the course *wouldn't* take the ship into the sun, so I wonder how Crayak would have reacted/how Crayak would have interpreted this weird bit of data...
    ```

- u/Brassica_Rex:
  ```
  Reactions: 

  What a way to go, ramming the sun. The sheer spectacle is dimmed only slightly by the fact that presumably everyone has backups of everyone else, and even one survivor means everyone lives. 

  Wonder what’s going to happen with Vasco. Probably we’ll get to see what V3’s quantum virus contingencies are from his POV.

  What would Cassie want to do with a shelf of quantum viruses? Was this part of the plan?

  Tobias gets it... finally. Took him long enough.

  I see the original plan for 1 narrator per chapter (as described in Ch. 44’s notes) has gone out the window. Probably for the best, and I’d likely have done the same. It doesn’t set off my OCD as it’s limited to the final and suitably epic arc.

  Only 2 chapters to not only resolve the present crisis, but explain and deal with the canon-discrepancy stuff, as well as the narratively mandated return of V3. Those are going to be tightly packed no matter how you dice them (I’m hoping for more 30k word chapters personally). But however it turns out, there HAVE to be only 2 chapters left, by hook or by crook, to make the total 54. If I was writing and really needed the chapter space, I’d relabel Ch. 48 into an interlude, freeing 1 more Chapter number. Very clever to pad out/hold in reserve a flexible number for the crucial chapter count.

  Questions I’d like to clear up:

  - Was Rachel the one responsible for taking down the z space rift? She had to because they were all outside it at the start and Cassie had to make it to Mars ASAP, am I right?

  - Possible snarl Re: short term memory

  > clones either of us made would have memories that stopped a day or so ago

  Here it takes about a day for memories to settle, but elsewhere this time has been variously stated to be somewhere less than 5 days or about 10 days^as ^you’d ^know ^^if ^^you ^^had ^^^checked ^^^^your ^^^^email.

    Well they no longer have the morphing cube and given everything that’s happening on earth, even if they did finding people willing to sacrifice themselves and being able to care for the bodies until they wake up would be a challenge…I think this is it. Rachel being a demigod now does change things though, maybe she can just bring everyone back

      Oh yeah I forgot it's hard to keep track of all the pieces

      Point still stands though, since there's a Player level enitity on their side. Probably they're going to bring back earth if they win, and given that it's a story, they probably will.

        Yeah it will be a fine line to walk because “well we beat Crayak but earth is destroyed and all the characters are dead” is a little too bleak to be satisfying and “they all lived happily ever after” is a little too cheery to be satisfying. But I’m done doubting the author, there have been several points in the story where I thought “there’s no way he pulls this off, he wrote himself into a corner” and I’ve been wrong every time

          Well said. Now assuming a satisfying ending has to lie between those extremes, or outside the paradigm entirely, the most likely route is going to hang on the weird timeline stuff.

          My best guess is they'll end up creating the Canon universe which ends up creating their own in a recursive loop, or something at least that weird.

    Z space rift surrounds the solar system, not the Earth.  The Visser was doing stuff on Mars before he discovered the bridge, and I think with Serenity they figured out the barrier was past Neptune.

      It was Rachel, yes.  The thinking there was: we can either all file neatly across the single known choke point where any half-competent idiot would have placed countermeasures (I mean, we already *saw* countermeasures being used there, to devastating effect)

      or we can reopen the whole system, which not only has the benefit of letting us jump straight in, but also lets us bring Livingstone into play and threatens further intervention from e.g. Andalites

        (unless the setup was more a formality, akin to setting up a game board? but that would make unilaterally removing it even costlier)

  Tobias is going to the Pemalite homeworld 11 days away; it's the only other place that even might have technology that could be a threat to Crayak.

  The only other move I can think of that even *might* force Crayak to respond would be going to Leera, abducting a bunch of Leerans, and dropping them into the middle of every gathering of sentient minds he could find, anywhere.

  I predict that this:

  >A billion simulations began, then, as the player checked and re-checked and re-re-checked its assumptions, making sure that it had not missed anything of import. A billion Vissers crawled through the simulations, encountering the information under a billion slightly varied sets of circumstances, reacting to it in a billion slightly different ways, creating a billion branching futures.

  will end up having been a bad idea, or at least an interesting one. The halting problem implies you can't make an absolutely perfect virus-checker, right? So as soon as Visser 3 realized he was being studied and modeled, he would have started trying to make a program that models his behavior a virus that takes over the Arbiter. And he would obviously base the exact strategy on the subtlest quantum randomness, to ensure that all billion copies throws something different. And even if no copies succeed, some copies might come close enough to warrant further investigation by Crayak (copying himself, for example), thereby spawning more copies of the Visser. This is exactly what Toomin did to Father: as a simulation, take over the platform. I wonder if the trap Toomin set with Rachel is intended to distract Crayak from this, and to incentivize it to consider low-probability events, such as being taken over by copies of one of your simulations.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    > The halting problem implies you can't make an absolutely perfect virus-checker, right?

    Please, explain.

    (I think Crayak is too intelligent for the Visser to hack him in this way - Toomin hacked Father because of his special talent for probability meddling. If Visser can do the same, I'm not sure it's been foreshadowed. But anything is possible at this point - I have no idea why Crayak isn't responding, so something I didn't think of must be the right answer in any case.) >!It's connected to the Visser, probably, given a spoilered comment from the TK.!<

        - u/FenrirW0lf:

          It was almost certainly just Crayak convincing the Visser to play along with unlocking the Chee. I don't imagine that Toomin, with his incredibly subtle manipulations that had to stay under the radar from both players, could repeatedly co-opt the avatar or create his own copy of the avatar while also avoiding notice.

      So I don't want to pretend I super understand it, and I wrote all my comments last night while high af, but my armchair understanding is that writing perfect, infallible antivirus software is [impossible](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pubs/virus.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi1-aTXqurwAhV3AZ0JHYa3AtIQFjAAegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2IYhc2g175hIFZ7JdT5gEw), and that the reason why that's true is because the [Halting Problem] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) is provably undecidable:

      >
      >In computability theory, the halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running, or continue to run forever. Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist.
      >
      >For any program f that might determine if programs halt, a "pathological" program g, called with some input, can pass its own source and its input to f and then specifically do the opposite of what f predicts g will do. No f can exist that handles this case. A key part of the proof is a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which is known as a Turing machine; the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines. It is one of the first cases of decision problems proven to be unsolvable. This proof is significant to practical computing efforts, defining a class of applications which no programming invention can possibly perform perfectly.

      In other words, one of the "this must be true or else we are irredeemably fucked anyway" assumptions the kids can probably make is that not even Crayak could make a platform that can be absolutely certain a given simulation is safe to run. I'm wondering if Toomin incorporated this into his strategy when planting his "ghosts in the machine".

        > In other words, one of the "this must be true or else we are irredeemably fucked anyway" assumptions the kids can probably make is that not even Crayak could make a platform that can be absolutely certain a given simulation is safe to run.

        Unfortunately:

        - The halting problem means it's not *always* possible to determine what a given program does, if that program can do an unlimited amount of computation.  
          **But** that doesn't apply if you say "well, computing for more than a billion years is suspicious as *heck*, I'll treat that as a virus".
        - The halting problem refers to all possible programs.  "Programs we want to run", or "programs simulating people", may be enormously simpler to analyse.
        - The halting problem *does not* rule out perfectly secure "sandboxes".  If Crayak is simulating a program or person, *there need not be any way "out" of the simulation*.  
          (not even LARPing the malign universal prior, which is sad in this hypothetical but very good news IRL)

        TLDR, Crayak could in fact start running programs in an inescapable sandbox, and terminate them if they looked suspicious without needing ultracomputational powers.
        ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        So, as PeridexisErrant points out, the biggest obstacle against that idea is sandboxing. Viruses aren't mathematically impossible to defend against, they just exploit vulnerabilities that are due to design flaws.

        It's perfectly possible for a god to create a simulation program that has no flaws that a non-god brain would *ever* be able to find/imagine in a few weeks.

    On that note I kinda have been wondering what drove the Ellimist to play along after he got backed into the corner by Crayak. The only move he could make was to use all the initiative he had to eliminate the Chee, but wouldn't he also know that doing so would cause him to forfeit the game? If his choice was between losing the game by inaction and losing the game by action, it seems like he could have thrown up his hands and been like "You wanted unlocked Chee, Crayak? Okay, hope you have fun with them!"

    I'm guessing that the Ellimist must have had *some* hope that he could wipe the Chee out while keeping the game going, or else he wouldn't have given it a try. Or maybe his actions didn't *directly* lead to a forfeit according to the rules of the game, but still left him open to some kind of direct attack from Crayak that he didn't anticipate. But I'm not really sure how that works since we don't know the exact rules of the game.

    Does it allow the players to directly attack each other if they accumulate sufficient advantage, or does one of them have to break a rule to be open to attack? And is it the opposing player that has to do the kill, or does the arbiter do that automatically? It *seems* like Crayak is the one who did the Ellimist in, and seemingly in a way that the Ellimist didn't predict in advance. But it's still hard to tell from an outside perspective.
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Author headcanon is that the Ellimist knew that unlocked Chee was *the same kind* of hellscape as Crayak, and possibly worse in magnitude.
      ```

      - u/FenrirW0lf:
        ```
        Right. So now I'm guessing the Ellimist knew he was toast either way, and the last choice to be made was whether Crayak or the Chee would be running the show from then on. And he chose to go with Crayak.

        I'm guessing Toomin specifically designed his successor's values such that he would see that as the better choice too.
        ```

        - u/daytodave:
          ```
          I thought the Ellimist didn't know that popping the Chee would give Crayak a chance to kill It, because Crayak was smarter and had planned the Chee Gambit as a trap for the Ellimist. That that move was possible was one of the things Toomin mentioned "could be known only to Crayak".
          ```

          - u/FenrirW0lf:
            ```
            That's what I thought too at first, but what the Ellimist really failed to realize is that Crayak was going to unlock the Chee at all and then leave it holding the bag. And the key thing is once that realization hit, the Ellimist also realized it was in checkmate.

            Eliminating the Chee requires actions that violate the rules of the game (bringing out the hypercomputer and using it to zap them away), which leaves it vulnerable to a killing blow by Crayak or the arbiter itself or whatever. Not eliminating them means letting them run rampant and free since Crayak purposefully rendered itself helpless to intervene. Eventually they'll figure out how to get into the arbiter, take out the Ellimist and Crayak both, then continue doing whatever they want with the universe uncontested.

            So the Ellimist knew it was fucked and the only thing it could do was choose between the lesser of two bad futures.

      Helium: I covered above
      Cassie: they wondered if the visser had a deadman switch for Mars and then she became that deadman switch
      Marclones: he noticed that where before his mind contained him and the visser, now it is a single entity. Foreshadowed with esplin’s first death

Maybe even gets to go back to his video games
