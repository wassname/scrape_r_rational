  /u/callmesalticidae convinced me to post this on AO3. i wrote it a while ago and didn't think it was terribly good but the new netflix series (which is an excellent adaptation) spurred me to have another look at it.

  it's just a short like 1 (or 2, maybe) chapter loveletter to rationalist stereotypes and the baby-sitters club

    I love it, and can't wait to read more!

    (uber for babysitting? What could possibly go wrong!)

      > uber for babysitting? What could possibly go wrong

      That's the problem, I was sitting on this for about six months because I didn't have any sort of plot in mind. Just like, "Stacey is a biohacker", "Dawn is working in clean meat", "Mary Anne is a computer programmer" (a bit of a stretch but it kinda works). 

      So I guess at best I'll write a vignette about each of them and call it a day. At worst... just Kristy and Mary Anne. 

      Because yeah, really not inspired to write a story about how a startup gets its wings, as much as I'd like a rat!BSC to happen.

        When I made that joke about the AI, it was only partly a joke, because I legit thought this was going to spiral into "the Baby-Sitters Club somehow end up baby-sitting a seed AI."
        ```

        - u/AngelaCastir:
          ```
          okay that's kind of "friendship is optimal" level ridiculous but hey my rat!AU BSC could well be the most equipped gatekeepers of the seed AI
          ```

    I chuckled quite a bit reading that, I'm definitely interested in your second chapter!
    ```

    - u/AngelaCastir:
      ```
      The second chapter isn't nearly as funny, but I'll have to post it since everyone liked this one so much and I don't want people to think I'm holding out on them. 

      (It's very easy for me to first person POV Kristy as I'm basically Kristy)

  So we’ve got rational fics of Baby-Sitter’s Club and Animorphs, which of K. A. Applegate’s series should get rational fanfics next?

  Everworld is already a heavily rational take on being dropped into another world and/or mythology being real. It’s either aged very well or very badly, as the real big baddie are >!a traitor in the party!< and >!neo-Nazis with guns!<. It also has characters struggling with their perception of reality.

  Remnants is a horror story of a spaceship full of refugees who leave the Earth just Bef its destruction by meteor, and wake up millennia later on a spaceship that their own ship was picked up by, and find themselves mutating over time and contending with the other inhabitants of that ship.

    Just so you know, Ann M. Martin is not K A Applegate. :)

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      Okay, but *imagine that crossover.*
      ```

      - u/AngelaCastir:
        ```
        The Baby-sitters club walking through the construction site when Elfangor is dying? Someone's surely done that already, right? The go to early 90s kids series + the go to late 90s kids series is waaaay to obvious
        ```

        - u/callmesalticidae:
          ```
          In one of the ghostwritten books, Visser Three is hit by a de-aging ray and they have to raise him. 

          It's an adorable story, and a lot of fanfic will come of it, but by and large the readership will agree that it just doesn't make any more sense than the Helmacron Tournament Arc, and few people will view it as canon.

  SHE NAMED HER SON, SAGAN!  
  This is a master stroke.
