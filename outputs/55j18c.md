  That's brilliant, Cometspawn!
  If there is only one other beanie baby pentagram of dragons in the world, that's where the vanishing name sends you!

  (That is what's happening, right?)

  *(Yes, I meant Heptagram, I was tired and exited so I forgot that Penta means 5 not 7)*
  ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    It could be some other heptagram of very rare dragons. But yes.
    ```

    - u/NotACauldronAgent:
      ```
      Seriously, I had dismissed the name as enforced plot progression, I forgot how useful sympathetic teleportation is. Is there a scrying name that they can use to spy on and then recreate recreate, e.g., Thamiel's throne room, and use it as a scry and die attack? Those are always fun.
      ```

      - u/MugaSofer:
        ```
        Nah, you'd probably end up in some other careful recreation of a room. Your own throne room might work, though.
        ```

        - u/NotACauldronAgent:
          ```
          Hmmm, how can you enforce similarity through scry scanning? Would a reconstruction of Thaumiel teleport you to some other Thaumiel? That is a real thing we must consider. Is there something we know about Thaumiel that is unique to Thaumiel, and has nothing similar to be reconstructed? 

          Nothing comes to mind.
          ```

          - u/Frommerman:
            ```
            We know that Thamiel is an aspect of God. So, we need to construct something which is kabbalistically an aspect of God.

            I don't know how to do this directly, but I do know how to construct an Aspect of Dog and then send it through the Panama Canal.
            ```

            - u/NotACauldronAgent:
              ```
              Sounds great! No flaws at all, nothing bad could happen by dropping the embodiment of evil on the Kabbalistic center of North America. 

              (Good idea, 4/7, nothing can go wrong. Let's try it!)
              ```

      If it's a heptagram of dragons, it's a herptagram. But even so, it's a heptagon/herptagon because you get -gons when you've got only points, and -grams when you get to add all your fancy lines. 

      Also: I assumed that stuff like making something so odd that it couldn't be in more than two places and then using the Vanishing Name wouldn't work because it's so obvious *everyone* (with the Name) would have immediately tried it, and then Unsong would have sold Vanishing tickets, which would definitely help out with the whole "yeah, tech like airplanes sometimes doesn't work because Uriel can only fix things at a god-*like* rate" thing. Plus, we haven't seen Singers with a massive escape system with nodes all over the place in safehouses.
      ```

      - u/NotACauldronAgent:
        ```
        The name is supposed to be new, Aaron mentioned it was just being tested then. Also, Jane was really suprised when Aaron knew it. It may be obvious to users, but there aren't any full users outside the Cometspawn yet.
        ```

      - u/VorpalAuroch:
        ```
        Hasn't the Vanishing Name has only been well known for weeks, not even months? Maybe there's a corporate, very expensive, travel industry being built on it already.
        ```

  - u/Arancaytar:
    ```
    But if there is an opportunity for another big bad (eg. Thamiel, or Samyazaz) to attack you, how do you persuade the universe to prioritize the dragons over that? Placebomancy?
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I'm going to guess that the fact these are super rare beanie babies of which a very small number exist is part of why it works. If it was some common object you would have a problem of naturally occurring arrangements of the objects
    ```

    - u/NotACauldronAgent:
      ```
      The way Jane was obsessing over it, they sounded really rare, like she couldn't get a replacement anywhere, that definitely lends evidence to that theory.
      ```

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  This is the best chapter in a while. I loved basically everything here.
  ```

  - u/ArisKatsaris:
    ```
    May I ask why?

    To me like it felt like one of the less interesting chapters in the whole work, they just fight random monsters just by blowing them away, as opposed to e.g. clever use of palindromes, or of Aramaic.
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      1. Stuff happens and the plot progresses, with like actual plot revelations and plot points happening and so forth. The status quo is changed as Aaron and Jane both find out new things and change their present circumstances, and a new character is introduced who may be a crucial part of the story (depending if she really is his computer as claimed). A lot of Unsong chapters have nothing happen to progress the overall plot, and while they can be interesting digressions I really like it when things actually happen.

      2. I really like the plot structure of a lead-in with random talmudic musings about vampires, leading the reader to think "oh another random Kabbalah chapter" - as a lead in to "vampire-like creatures attack!". It felt like a neat reversal and subversion of reader expectations.

      3. The clever wordplay, references, puns, and so forth are integrated into actions and plot advancement in an interesting way, as opposed to it being the subject of digressions that are expected to be interesting in and of themselves.

      - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
        ```
        I think that the use of "I'll do what my father did" solidifies this chapter as one of the best.
        ```

      - u/biomatter:
        ```
        As interesting as the opening ramble about 'lilith' was, I thought it was kind of weird that it cuts into the 'nope, these aren't what I've been talking about' scene. Doesn't that just make the whole intro an excuse to talk about something unrelated?
        ```

        - u/seventythree:
          ```
          Are vampires *really* unrelated if later in the chapter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer shows up?
          ```

          - u/biomatter:
            ```
            Ah, shit, you're totally right :P
            ```

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  So, the really important question is, can Sarah still speak names super fast? Has she still been discovering new names? Is Jane gonna arrest them at arrival. And if so, is Sarah a match for the Cometspawn?
  ```

  - u/UltraRedSpectrum:
    ```
    My money's on Sarah, here. In a world where the limiting factor on magic is your ability to repeat the same tasks over and over as fast as possible, nothing tops a computer.
    ```

  - u/thecommexokid:
    ```
    That was 4 questions.
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      But only one of them was important.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Deus ex machina!

  Also, at what dire Chehovgunned situation will our team be? Is it UNSONG headquaters again? Or maybe Dylan Alvarez?
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    The leading hypothesis at the moment is that the septagram of purple dragons acts as placebomancy for reliable teleportation with the vanishing name. I.e. the "similar situation" criterion of the vanishing name is satisfied by the septagram instead of anything outside it.
    ```

- u/awesomeideas:
  ```
  Let's say you encode two different Names into a Klipotified sentence, e.g. the first letter of each word is one Name, and the last letter of every third word is another Name. Which Name takes effect? Do both? Does it depend on which name you are thinking of at the time? If it does, which feels natural, maybe you could use it to turn a klipah into a killpah, where the more obvious Name is dangerous to the utterer, to prevent a bad guy from figuring out what you're saying. If more than one can be used at a time, I wonder if they could be combined to form complex spells. You'd work out interactions and interleave the names.
  ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    I think one of the rules of klipah prevents that. Something about how you can't say the correspondent of another letter in between or it doesn't work.
    ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  Did we hear about Aaron's father? I'm wondering if this is a Chekhov's gun I'm missing.

        Well, that's what he *intended*. Whether this pronouncement ends up holding more weight, just as his fate with The Other King was said to exert a pull over the future, is yet to be seen.

    ```
    If your base possesses bulwarks against enemy invasion, and you create a new entrance, that entrance is probably booby-trapped against enemies. Given that the heptragam is presumably one of only means of ingress into the Cometspawn's base, it is safe to assume that the area is well-guarded against the sudden appearance of The Other King.

  No puns for a "end of book" its missing the main drive of the story
