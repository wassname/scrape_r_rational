## [D] Yudkowsky's first law of science fiction: a rant

### Post:

(*first law of fanfiction. Damn reddit's un-editable titles.)

(This thread contains vague, high-level spoilers for a bunch of rationalfics - which I can't warn you about because just naming them in context is the spoiler. I don't think it'll bother most people, but if you're a purist, stop reading.)

Pattern:

1. Add a smart character to an existing setting, often with bonus skills / information / magic.
2. They bulldoze through the setting's various problems, perhaps kickstarting a scientific / economical revolution along the way. This is a fun read, because it's pure wish-fulfillment sugar with munchkin flavouring. So I start to really enjoy the fic.
3. The author probably never had a long-term plan, but since everyone is showering them with praise they just keep going by following the logical consequences of early chapters. Having overcome the setting's primary adversity in the early chapters, the protagonist's successes naturally tend to snowball.
4. Eventually the author realizes that they need an opposition of some kind. It's too late though. At this point, any new threat they can coax out of canon is either underpowered or a diabolus ex machina, or both.
5. I stop reading or hit the in-progress mark, and realize I've stopped having fun a while ago now.

This has happened to me repeatedly with fics recommended in this sub. 

(Even naming a work here is a spoiler; the vague, high-level kind that I think most people are okay with, but I'm tagging them just in case.)

Non-exhaustive list:

* [Saruman of Many Devices](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7568728)

* [Inviolate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346)

* [Adventures in Effulgence](https://edgeofyourseat.dreamwidth.org/2121.html) (which admittedly was never intended to be more than wish-fulfillment porn / drama porn)

* Some continuations / forks of HPMOR (possibly because it's really hard to write Yudkowsky-style villains, who act in the background and wield unknown powers but are still fair on some level)

* So many of the Worm fanfics I've tried (admittedly not all recommended here; still, OF ALL SETTINGS, Worm should be the one where authors have the LEAST trouble finding challenges their upgraded protagonist)

* Every Peggie Sue / Groundhog Day story I've read apart from [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644) and [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893) (both of which [SPOILER](#s " have time-looping antagonists; and they still skirt awfully close to the pattern whenever they spend too long without reminding us of those antagonists"))

Yudkowsky's [First Law of Fanfiction](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2269863/Less-Wrong): 
> If you do anything to increase the protagonist's power, or make their life easier, you must also amplify their opponent or add extra difficulties to their life. **You can't make Frodo a Jedi unless you give Sauron the Death Star.**

As an alternative, consider putting Jedi Frodo in a wheelchair. I would enjoy crossover-possessions, alternate universes and self-inserts a lot more if the protagonist didn't end up with a brand-new set of skills IN ADDITION TO all the skills of the original. 

(It's often the skills the original had by the end of canon, too; Worm!Taylor spent traumatic *months* developing some of the abilities the average Worm fanfic *starts* her with.)

Or hey, you can ignore all that and just write wish-fulfillment. I will read it with pleasure. But then please *end* your story on step 2.

Just needed to get this off my chest.

  I'll admit I personally prefer the stories where a rationalist character powers through, sneakily defeats, or completely bypasses various canon problems, but then runs smack into other problems (canon or derived) which cause them genuine issues. Particularly if they've started feeling a bit smug about how smart/informed/capable they are.

  And it kind of makes sense. Any protagonist who keeps pushing their boundaries will run into a lot more situations, events, opponents, and so on than one who lives life in the background. And the more things that a protagonist encounters, the greater the chance that one or more of them will be something they can't handle - and the effect will be worse because the speed at which they were moving will generally mean that they haven't had time to build up networks, secondary defenses, and fallback positions.

    One of the later "Wiz Biz" novels is like this (if you look at it as a SI in the canonical 'medieval magical universe' because that's kind of what it is). [SPOILER](#s " Wiz Zumwalt's OP software+magic has saved the good guys and made lives better for all humans, but now humans are heading into the wilderness and causing all kinds of magico-ecological problems.")

        That's what made this story stand out for me - the guys causing the problem aren't the "Dark Council" (or whatever it's called, it's been a while), but perfectly ordinary people acting in their own perceived best interests. And Zumwalt had to stop and think for a change.

        > Wiz Biz is not a rational programmer for the same reason Sherlock is not a rational detective, I think.

        Why do you say that?  (Honest question, not snarky.)  The details of the magic system are never really clearly laid out, true.  Still, Wiz's actions are driven by his values and are reasonable based on who he is and what he knows at any given point.  Better, his magic isn't "and then I needed a thing so I took five minutes to do it" -- he has to spend considerable time prepping his spells ahead of time, and he loses most of his most significant battles.  ("Loses" as in "needs to be saved by an ally", I mean.)

        In the first book the factions are good and evil, but after that it's more realistically grey.

  You know what fanfic community has a good record of sufficiently powerful antagonists? Dragonball Z. Turns out there's almost no power up to canon you can't fix by moving forward an arc or two in that setting.

  Though to be fair, I have yet to read a fic where the dragonballs were abused instead of nerfed. It would almost be embarrassing if there wasn't an author somewhere that was able to write themselves into a corner with the help of nigh omnipotant wishing machines.

  Yes, the same thing was with [*Blood and Chaos*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/threadmarks) — the author had to both restrict his own character’s originality and (at least partially) refocus the story from physical confrontations and powers required for them to inter-character relations. 

  I think not introducing an enemy of equal power could still work in at least two cases though. 

  * 1, if the protagonist [didn’t think in terms of enemies\bosses to beat](https://medium.com/life-learning/your-life-is-tetris-stop-playing-it-like-chess-4baac6b2750d#.ro4ibyo6f) but rather in terms of “fixing” the whole universe to their likening. Difficulties:

   * if the story started as an action \ adventure, it would abruptly change its genre (strategy \ history \ infrastructure management) losing many readers in the process;
   * even if did start with warnings about the incoming genre shift, it still wouldn’t be interesting for as wide an audience as a general action \ adventure story is;
   * it would be hard to write a high-quality story in this direction: one would have to be well educated in history, political and social sciences, economics, etc.

  * 2, using an analogy with video games, the author could be describing his character’s actions in an open sandbox world where the main plotline has already been completed. Often you want to know what happened with the hero after the main plot line is finished and they are at the peak of their power — but for writers, the sensible thing to do is to finish the story right at this point. So you usually end up with either no continuation at all or with a sequel that starts right off with introduction of another [big bad.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad) In case of videogames, however, players will often return to an already “finished” RPG ([TES,](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page) [GTA,](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page) etc) to just spend some time there as a form of *casual* entertainment. What eventually dims the interest in this case is depletion of original content in the game (e.g. side quests) and getting bored by the game engine’s capabilities. Both these problems are solvable when an imaginative writer is writing a *story*, so I think an OPed protag could keep going from one original “side quest”\plot arc to another — if the story was intended as a pulp fiction from the start.

  >Yudkowsky's First Law of Fanfiction

  On another note, why are you naming that law after one particular person? I don’t think EY was the first person in history to point out that stories should be balanced to preserve intrigue and tension. So why is it being introduced as *his* law? Isn’t it like saying [Someone]’s Law of Round Wheels?
  ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    The application to fanfiction is particular.  Regular authors need to think of balancing invented protagonists and invented difficulties; fanfic authors need to be told to *rebalance* the difficulties.

    > I think not introducing an enemy of equal power could still work in at least two cases though.

    It's actually something Yudkowsky claims as his own (adopted) law on his fanfiction profile, /u/Roxolan was likely quoting the first place they discovered it. (Whether we should encourage and propagate Yudkowsky's name-claim is another story.)
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      Correct.

      (edit: and I see no reason to contest the name-claim unless someone else has an earlier one. It's not like Ed Murphy *invented* the idea that things usually go wrong.)

  I don't think the Dresden/ASOIAF one was meant to be a rational fic, or even one with much challenge. It always felt like a slice of life fic with some munchkining and industrial revolution porn (there has to be a better term for "character from the future introduces new technologies and advances the setting to the next era", but I can't remember it) to me.

  And we don't know yet if the Mannis one is going to turn bad, you're kind of assuming.

  And the problem with Worm fics is that [](#s "the final boss is horribly designed. He's invulnerable to everything unless you figure out his one weakness, but then you only need one specific power + generic dakka to defeat him.") With that example to follow it's no wonder people have trouble writing good Worm villains. Also there's a delicate equilibrium of villainy in Brockton Bay and adding original characters or buffing established villains kind of messes that up.

  But I agree with you. Stories need to spend more time in the planning stage, which unfortunately Spacebattles doesn't really agree with. They're all "hey let's turn this 1k word drabble into a 50k word unfinished story with no planning in between". It kinda sucks.
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    There's also the problem that power levels in Worm range from 'lowest of street tier' to 'Mid-Cosmic Tier'.

    Anything that can fight effectively at the end has to be significantly changed or buffed from anything that finds the beginning remotely challenging. It's like the most egregious Sorting Algorithm of Evil possible.

    ```
    > I don't think the Dresden/ASOIAF one was meant to be a rational fic, or even one with much challenge. It always felt like a slice of life fic with some munchkining and industrial revolution porn

    I agree. The pattern still happened though. 

    The payoff of industrial revolution porn happens at the very beginning (when the time traveller is all "look at this cool idea!" and everyone else goes "oh my god this is the best thing ever") and again years or decades down the line (when all the cool ideas finally become widespread reality). I really enjoy this genre. But like many others, ASOIAFTWAMF makes the mistake of sticking to an almost day-to-day pace rather than jumping ahead. So it starts awesome and then gradually degrades. 

    And the author probably realizes this on some level, so to keep us entertained they tried to add in threats. But because the protagonist is a millionaire demigod gadgeteer (with [](#s "demigod sidekick daughter")) in a low-fantasy setting, and because there's no buildup (since the author started out writing a peaceful slice-of-life story with no antagonist), it falls flat.

    > And we don't know yet if the Mannis one is going to turn bad, you're kind of assuming.

    The pattern has already happened. Maybe it'll get better in the future, sure. But from where I stand, on chapter 1.16, it has fully entered the "[](#s "main challenges defeated, industrial revolution kickstarted, huh how can I challenge this character, maybe the other nobles are grumbling? I'm sure the millionaire prince and his loyal-to-the-death army are quaking in their boots")" phase.

    Compare e.g. *The Two Year Emperor*. Fairly similar setup, fairly similar snowballing start, but the threats escalate *even faster*, so the protagonist remains on the brink of disaster for the entire story. And when he [](#s "*does* achieve complete victory, the fic gives us a couple of chapters of literal-wish-fulfillment porn and then *ends*.")

    > Stories need to spend more time in the planning stage, which unfortunately Spacebattles doesn't really agree with.

    Yeah, this is probably the root of the problem. You can't skip the boring bits to get straight to the awesome bits, and then end, if you don't even know where the awesome bits are going to be - and at what point they'll stop coming.
    ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  I agree with almost all your points, save for the inclusion of Inviolate.  

  While several fics in DC have done the twist that Inviolate did, when you find out the real antagonists involved they are certainly still a significant threat to the main character, despite his optimization. I don't agree that it hits stage 4, excepting maybe the epilogue, which I'm glad ended the story there - any continuation from that point could have been bad.

  Similarly, it's hard to justify stage 4 on Oh God am I the Mannis Now - the SI is in a setting with provable supernatural elements which hard trump any non-supernatural foes with no or little counter to them and no access to supernatural strength himself. He's also a lot more realistic in the sense of not remembering all of the minutiae of modern technology to be able to perfectly recreate it at will. 

  Trying to write my own SI story however, I can understand the problems. I tried to solve it by choosing a main setting which is basically impossible to directly overpower because the existing foes and threats in the setting are Worm level of dangerous and less concerned about stealth or collateral. 

  I also eliminate all my SI's knowledge of the setting until a significant point in the story - they have to optimize from their modern perspective but without meta-knowledge. 

  Also important is creating a specific storyboard early on to figure out where the story is going, and how it's going to get there. I'm still working on that, but I've got the major events planned out in such a way that those familiar with the setting shouldn't consider anything as Deus Ex Machina. 

  I'm considering adding in a canon plot device to help with avoiding that issue by providing a reason for what are effectively cutscenes of some of the opposition.

      I won the Rational Horror prompt here when the writing contests began ( I think it was the second or third prompt?) with a story called [The Real You](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PmC1LfBHH2poxcgKJZRjDprwWLrlOgD3zHG9o_OIRvk/edit), though my little sticky note flair thing disappeared when I modified my flair.

      I don't consider it my best work personally, I wrote it in about an hour and a half after reading the prompt, and have only done cursory editing. 

      For the new story I'm working on, I'm trying to get a good percentage of it done before I start posting - my writing style is not conducive to small daily tidbits, I go back and reedit, add sections, or flesh out a beginning skeleton several times in the process. Things get moved around, reorganized, or changed in wording. 

      Having read an obscene amount of fiction, I've gotten to the point where I can instinctively tell what turns of phrase are good and evoke relevant imagery and which ones are jarring and remove you from the scene. An improperly worded sentence or description can be worse for immersion in a story than a nonsense plot point or even a blatant misspelling. Because I'm hyper aware of this, I nitpick my own writing to the hilt, and my speed suffers a lot.

      Time Braid does a sort of OK job of explaining stuff so that a newer reader is not totally lost, and goes pretty fair off the rails of canon so reader familiarity is not always assumed. I'd say to try it. There's a lot of nouns that will be unfamiliar at first, mostly because of gratuitous japanese names for stuff, but you can Google anything important and let the rest sort itself out by contextual cues. Honestly, I think you're more likely to be turned off by some of the content than by the source material - Time Braid contains a *lot* of nightmare fuel that some people find objectionable. I really like the story, but I *completely* understand people who don't.

Leaving aside the whole S&M stuff, I never really liked the story's underlying message/theme, that humans need to have suffering and conflict in order to be happy. Yes, becoming virtual addicts is a possibility, but I feel their are ways to counteract that, and simply disregarding the Singularity isn't one of them.

        Mobile web is still in beta.

        Spoiler tags are implemented through custom CSS, because reddit doesn't have sitewide spoiler functionality. The mobile site doesn't load the custom CSS, so it breaks all subreddit-level spoiler functionality.

        If you have an app, most of them don't load in custom CSS either, but they have special static rules that allow spoiler tags in the most common formats like ours, which is `[text](#s "spoiler text")`. I know this is how redditisfun does it and I assume that's how other apps do it as well.

        According to /u/akahotcheetos, this is a ["high priority"](https://www.reddit.com/r/mobileweb/comments/39nv1r/support_for_spoiler_tags/cs7awsb) but that was seven months ago. There are still apparently people working on the mobile site, since admins like /u/schwers and /u/nr4madas still post in /r/mobileweb, but they haven't fixed something that breaks basic functionality for discussion and requires a ten line change to their CSS without any redeployment, something that's already implemented by all their mobile competitors.

        So yes, I think it's fair to see this as just giving you the finger. Unfortunately, there's no much that we can do on our end.

  Agreed. Suggested improved 1st law: 

  >You can't make Naruto a rationalist unless you take away his plot power.

  The problem with all of these fanfics is that they take a standard story where everything revolves around the hero, then give the hero rationality but *still let the entire world revolve around them*. Sauron does not need a deathstar to kill frodo. Frodo just needs to be able to die to a stray goblin arrow.

  Heck, even Hpmor has this problem. Harry comes into Hogwarts and not only does he start out with a ridiculous amount of scientific knowledge right off the bat, but ALSO everyone loves him and he is super rich without having to do anything for it, and everything he does is awesome for some reason. He'd come across as much less of a Mary sue if the rest of the world didn't see him as the main character.


  edit: one of the very few examples of a fanfic that does this right is The waves Arisen. No matter how powerful the main character becomes, he still feels vulnerable because the rest of the world treats him like fodder.
  ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    To be fair, I think Harry being the main character of HPMOR (both to us, the readers, and to the narrative itself) was intentionally written in such a way by EY. For all its rationality, HPMOR was clearly written as an almost self-aware story. It knew what it was, and played it to the hilt.

    ([Dungeon Keeper Ami](http://addventure.bast-enterprises.de/frecent.php?tag=Dungeon+Keeper+Ami) (Pusakuronu chapters only) is also impressively good at avoiding this pitfall, given its premise and length. It's a damn shame it instead fell into the pitfall of not being very good writing.)

    Also, all the stories in the OP (and I could dig out some names for the broad categories at the bottom of the list if you want) make for good reading, **provided you stop reading as soon as you stop having fun**. They blow their premise's payoff in the first chapters.

  Yes, if /r/rational were a cooking/foodie subreddit dedicated to a specific cuisine or discipline, these would be the junk food recommendations.  _Saruman of Many Devices_ isn't ratfic, but it is a very good application of the _deus ex machina_ from one setting to another.
  ```

  I'd say i definitely agree with the general point, and would add "The Waves Arisen" to the list if you ever think of trying it.

  I also agree in regards to time braid, and I think its interesting to point that one of the interesting things that work for time braid in my opinion is that that it skirts some of the issue simply by having one of central most powerful characters offscreen half the time.

  I of course think the way it built sakura up was really well done, but in my opinion if the story was instead on naruto it would have felt too OP. but by not having naruto as the MC it gets to sort of "eat the pie and have it" if you will.

    His list was for fics that fell into that trap. Waves arisen IMO was concluded quite well.

    - u/IomKg:
      ```
      I understood his list, and felt that Waves arisen fell magnificently into it.
      The final, though it had a few nice gimmicks, felt completely forced.

      But i guess our opinions on the matter are just different :)
      ```

      - u/t3tsubo:
        ```
        That's fair, I just never really got the sense that the waves author was "building the plane as it was flying", so to speak. And it was concluded without even reaching into the canon's most ludicrous powers.

  ```
  Have you read [With This Ring?](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/) at least in my opinion it does this kind of thing pretty well. The antagonists advance in a fairly logical way to counter the main character, and his successes feel earned.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    [I read a bunch of *With This Ring* and it was quite fun, and then it stopped being fun, then I read a good deal more](http://rationalreads.com/?#/works/30). It's right around that time I finally integrated the "you *can* just stop reading, you dummy!" rule. (I do wish that had happened *before* I encountered *Adventures in Effulgence*.) 

    But IIRC I dropped it because of a combination of poor pacing and unmet expectations (when a rationalist enters a superhero world, I kind of expect more than slice-of-life intersped with bog-standard superheroing to ensue; or at least I want better written slice-of-life). I agree it doesn't fit the pattern in the OP, which is why it's not on the list.

    - u/GlueBoy:

      Agreed. I read way more of that story than I should have. I still can't quite explain why. I lost all enjoyment and I still. Kept. Reading. 

      Same thing happened with "The Games we Play". Holy shit, what a shitfest, and this from someone who really enjoyed Ryuugi's other stories.

        I've kept reading WTR and the part that bugged me has always been Renegade.  He rolls in, curbstomps everything, rolls out, is rude and untrustworthy to everyone, ignores the Justice League's ROE, and never faces any consequences or experiences any character growth.  I've said as much in the thread multiple times.

        Zoat just put all that out the window.  The latest arc is Renegade-focused, and I think it's my favorite of the entire story so far.

  Have you noticed my rational fanfiction [Shears](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/300693/shears)? This is something I deliberately chose to address.

- u/ErinFlight:
  ```
  What isn't often considered in these stories that a rational individual won't always succeed even if they behave perfectly rationally throughout the entire story. Actually, in some setting, they will still be more likely to fail. You can't think you're way out of everything.
  Born during the black plague? Maybe you have a higher chance of survival, but you're not going to recreate all scientific knowledge since then. You still have a good chance of dying. Maybe you can attempt to escape to an unpopulated area, but can you get there in time? 

  Are you an illiterate farmer in a poverty stricken region l? You may eventually succeed, but there is no garuntee. Disease, famine, loyalty to family, and natural disasters could all easily stop you.

  Even in a modern setting you can't always prevent a car crash.
  A rational character isn't a perfect one. 
  They also should still make mistakes unless they are somehow omniscient. 

  Once you introduce magic it becomes more difficult, but assuming the power has obvious limitations that need to be worked around (not just unlocked by figuring out one key fact), you should still be able to have an interesting story.

  Also, a rational character may learn faster, but they don't learn instantaneously. Someone experienced could still have the upper hand.

  Anything else you've noticed along these lines? Ways to create difficulty for a rational character in a magical setting without giving them an equally intilligent antagonist (which is definitely a viable option, but I'm curious to see what else there is)?
