## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  One of my characters can increase the gravity of a single point. This point is the focal point of his eye-lenses — meaning that if parallel beans originating from one of his eyes passed through his eye-lense they would meet at a focal point, and when both focal points of his eyes meet *that's'* where gravity will increase. Because of the way our eye-lenses work that means that he can't just look forward and decide where the gravity-point be at an arbitrary distance from him. There must always be something for his eyes to focus on.

  He can increase the gravity of the point whenever he wants but he can only have one unusually attractive point in space at any point in time. The unusual attraction of a point has a life-span that gets shorter the stronger the attractive force of the point, but he can also end it at will. After an unusual gravitational point becomes normal he has to wait 10 seconds before he can create another.

  If he creates a gravity-point that's strong enough to lift a single coin but too weak to do anything else it will last so long that he has not bothered to check. (I'm thinking of something like a year, but it could be more if necessary)

  I'm trying to find a limit to how much gravitational force he can put on a point. I already know that, if several conditions are met, with many power-ups plus a MacGuffin and with him dying in the process he would be able to create a black hole the size of the head of a pin for a tenth of a second, but that's a final-showdown kind of thing and not a very practical limit for daily use.

  With the exception of the will-die-black-hole-final-gambit, this is not supposed to be any world-ending, triumvirate-tier power, but it should still be powerful. I'm hoping this story will be something of street-level power fights.

  Having all that in mind a) how do I muchkin the hell out of this power — utility and offensive purposes are all welcome — and b) what would you suggest to be a limit.

    Unfortunately, the gravitation effect on an object's motion does not depend on that object's mass - it'll accelerate a bowling ball exactly as quickly as a coin. The limiter on gravitational acceleration is actually "distance from the center of the mass" - since your mass is described as 'point-shaped', this produces.. some inconsistency.

    If the thing can pick up a single piece of invulnerable adamantium buckshot at a distance of 1m, then if you put that same piece of shot 1cm away from the point and let go, it'll accelerate toward the point at about 100,000 m/s\^2 (and more as it gets closer), pass the point, start decelerating the same way, and come to a stop roughly 1cm on the other side. It should basically oscillate, and fast enough to cut through most things it can come into contact with. 

    Why 'invulnerable adamantium buckshot'? Well.. when it gets close enough, tidal forces will rip any real material apart - when the acceleration on the front half of the sphere is 1k, 10k, 1M times higher than the acceleration on the back half of the sphere, it will stretch out and deform - that will actually happen far faster than any real material can deform, so it'll really shatter into tiny pieces, which will also all oscillate around that center point as a cloud of metal dust. And we can go further, since the individual atoms will end up ripped apart by the same effect when they are \*close enough\*.. and ripping apart atoms is pretty exothermic.

    This is the problem with trying to create physics based powers that violate physics - the effects always turn out to be explosive because of the boundary condition issues :-\\

      After a little more thought, I realized that "a point shaped mass" is actually the *definition* of a black hole, and you can just refer to the physics of those in all cases :-)

      Which is substantially slower than a bullet..

    Any mass has a Schwarzschild radius (the radius of a black hole with that mass), and a point is going to lie within it and be a black hole (which should immediately evaporate due to Hawking radiation if it's sufficiently small), so your mass could be distributed in a constant-sized ball the size of the head of a pin (foreshadowing!) that can be with enough effort swallowed by the Schwarzschild radius.

    Gravity decreases with the square of the distance. Think magnets - as you remove magnets a few of their sizes from each other, their force goes from strong to maybe barely noticeable. How far up does it lift the coin? Enough acceleration to hold the coin is one Earth gravity. Enough acceleration at the surface to lift it up from 10 cm away is about 1778 times that. You really really don't want 1778G in the space your brain is moving through.

    You can use this to get free energy, by turning a gravitational point on and off above a mass to move a lever back and forth.

    Others have pointed out how "only strong enough to pick up a small object" isn't a thing with gravity, and how a focal point becomes a terrifying shredding tool because falling off at a ratio of 1/r^2 means that when r is very close to zero the force gets an absolutely enormous multiplier.

    If I remember my basic physics correctly, once you are inside of an (even, ideal) hollow shell, the gravity of the shell as a whole is basically zero as it is balanced out on all sides.

    So obviously the other thing you need to have to limit the power of this ability is that the effect needs to be produced as spheres of varying sizes, with anything resembling a point being a top-level effort.

    If the sphere adds a meter per second per minute, it's fairly useless for launching coins but capable of demolishing buildings trivially with a little time. Stuff that enters the sphere basically just ignores it until it exits the sphere, limiting the force that it gets up to, and mostly resulting in stuff settling into a bowl-like shape at the bottom where the gravity of the sphere is balanced by the gravity of the earth, assuming that the gravitation is strong enough to lift things straight up at all. (Which would make it enormously powerful for crushing people with buildings, mind you.)
