  Heh, Tavish really was a horrifying character.

  Wooo! Invincible Naked Amazonian Grandmother! Was hoping she'd get to confront the gods about how messed up the world is, but that ending is pretty good too.

  Nice story! I like how you played with a ton of tropes in this story, like Kill the Healer First, We All Meet At an Inn, Battle Monk, The Gods Did It, and of course Bikini Armor. And just the right length too, well done :)

    Thank you. I'm thinking of doing a few in that vein.
