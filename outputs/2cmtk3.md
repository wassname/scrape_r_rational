With this post, I'd like to announce a new worldbuilding project:

From now on, I will accept worldbuilding commissions. In the comments, you can provide the initial details for the world you want me to create. By private message, I will keep you updated on my progress, and ask you to make a few choices. Once it is done, I will post it in another page, and link to it in this post.

If you are interested in this endeavor, you can join the workshop as a participant. Requirements are an active imagination and the ability to rigorously explain every element of your world. 

Note: This is going to be *rational* worldbuilding.
