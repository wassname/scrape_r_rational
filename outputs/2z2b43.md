  If I were to make a game about statistics, I would be cautious of trying to force it to relate to everyday life, where sufficient data has to be gathered and then represented abstractly to make it analyzable by statistics. I'm also worried about a potentially cheesy narrative that may make statistics seem even more uncool. My gut instinct is to make a game that uses an addictive reward system, like a gambling game, where people who can use provided statistical tools to analyze the options available to gamble with score higher.

  That said, good luck with the game!

    Your gut instinct is to make a gambling game for children? :)

      What better way to show them the power of statistics? ;) Something that seizes their minds and connects the thing we try to teach them to their most personal urges, that gives them a stake in what they learn. It's not gambling if the child does not obsess over trying to learn the material to do better at the game.
