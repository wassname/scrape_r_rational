  Really good chapter. Worth the wait. I particularly enjoyed how well Xvim did against every attack thrown at him. And the shield breaker spell he used seems really useful if it isn't extremely hard to do.

  More generally: what do you think Zorian should do next to improve his magic? Personally, I think he should learn the Force Lance spell well enough that it becomes nearly invisible like he did with the force bolt. He doesn't have much mana, so making a spell designed to destroy shields seems important. Another thing is he could try to make that hexagonal sectioned shield Zach taught him to spin. The spell he was taught remains static when one of the panels goes down, meaning it's relatively simple to aim for that hole. Making it spin could mean that any holes would be incredibly hard to hit. The spell is less useful against omnidirectional attacks, but judging by this chapter those are rare to be used on individual people.

      Incorrect. He thrust out his hands toward the two ends of the gate. But yes, he's clearly very experienced with it. With a *proper* mastery of the spell, you wouldn't need anything more than that ;).

    I definitely think he needs to look into becoming a shifter/transformation mage for physical abilities, he's just so immobile. He also needs to learn how to make that coin that Kael made.

    As for pure magic, it has to be learning dimensional spells. Even though they are expensive to cast he is really good at spell formula which can offset the costs dramatically by creating a hasting item beforehand.

    Being able to properly defend himself also looks like a priority, and unstructured magic too as he could use that while transformed.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      >how to make that coin that Kael made.

      Given that QI has one of the keys, this(or anything else that could disable QI like that) is probably the top priority right now.
      ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > he needs to look into becoming a shifter

      Kael strongly recommended against anything that would alter his soul. Too much risk of fully activating the marker, which would result in him being recognised as an imposter Controller.
      ```

      - u/Vakuza:
        ```
        I think Zorian should fact check that with Alanic, it might not alter his soul, even then he can learn about transformation from Lukav.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Transformation is possible, he's done it before with an eagle, and Lukav has already agreed to turn any suitable rare monsters into potions.

          (Not that he'll remember that agreement, of course, but no doubt he'd agree to the same terms again.)
          ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      I believe the coin has been discussed before. The thing about spell formula is that you can't make an object to do something you can't do yourself. The coin involves soul magic, and Zorian only knows soul perception and defense. IIRC, the only way to gain soul sight, the prerequisite to learning soul magic fully, is to either be born with the ability or take that one potion with the ingredient that only occurs every other decade.

      I agree about getting better mobility. He can't really gain muscle mass while in the time loop, so a mobile transformation form would be very useful. Even a potion would be decent.

      I don't think we've really seen the type of spells dimensional magic gives, aside from variations of teleportation and the one redirection thing Xvim did.

      Better defenses if definitely important, and he can ask Xvim about it, but it's a little non-specific. He doesn't seem to have any glaring weaknesses in the defense category, and I'm not sure of any low hanging fruit he could grab to make himself even better.

      Ooh, just had a thought: sound seems to travel normally through most barriers right? Or at least around them? Maybe he could weaponize sound waves for a method of making people deaf.
      ```

      - u/Cheese_Ninja:
        ```
        I'd say as long as he could get the design for the coin from Kael, Zorian could mass-produce them most of the way and have Alanic or Kael put the finishing touches on it.

        This chapter has highlighted that while Zorian isn't bad at anything in particular, there's still a lot he can learn from the likes of Alanic, Zach, and Xvim.  But I think he'd still be best off focusing on his mind magic, outside of certain opponents with immunity/high resistance, it stills gives him the best result for its cost.  And his experience with the Aranea shows that he still has room for advancement.
        ```

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          I'm not sure about continuing to focus on mind magic. Yes, it has innumerable uses, but I think he's getting to a point of diminishing returns. Right now, he's a better mind mage than any human he's ever heard of. He can take down people who have invested their lives in defensive magic in a few minutes, and he broke through the shields of the most heavily defended non-psychic he's ever seen in what, 30 seconds? At this point, in term of combat, I'm not sure what else he has to gain beside taking down shields quicker. While the non-combat uses could still use honing, for combat I think he's about as good as he's going to get, and time spent for combat magic should focus on other things.

          Also, spending more time on combat magic means he can make spell formula to cast those spells. Easier to make an elaborate offensive or defensive spell into an item rather than spend time to cast it in combat.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            > I think he's getting to a point of diminishing returns...time spent for combat magic should focus on other things

            But for Zorian, mind magic *is* combat magic. It's his strength, and most enemies' weakness.

            Yes, he can break through anyone's shields - if they're a sitting duck. 30 seconds is unacceptable in combat, though. And after breaking through, there's the matter of efficiently utilising the puppet, doing as much damage as possible before they get taken out. Or multiple puppets; surely he can handle more and more of them as he continues to practise?

            Then there's his mind sense. It was indispensable, this time around, in detecting invisible/underground foes. Does its range increase with practice?

            If Zorian does fall back on Xvim's notebooks, he'll want to be able to read people's minds efficiently and as non-destructively as possible.

            And what about Zach's mind? *If* Zach ever lets him in, he'll need as much skill as possible in handling memories. And if RR left any mental booby traps...

            Mind magic still has a fantastic ROI, in my opinion.
            ```

            - u/melmonella:
              ```
              Massed mind magic is another cool ability Zorian doesn't really have at this point. Getting a couple friendly aranea to ride along and act as supports could significantly improve his shield-busting abilities.
              ```

            - u/throwawayJimmyTheCat:
              ```
              You make a good point. I’d prefer him to be able to crack well-defended minds for information or control in a few seconds.
              ```

          - u/throwawayJimmyTheCat:
            ```
            > He can take down people who have invested their lives in defensive magic in a few minutes

            He’s even more powerful than that. Recently most of his psychic attacks haven’t been a full-out assaults; usually, he’s trying to get control or information.
            ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > a mobile transformation form

        Well, we all know what form he *wants* :)
        ```

      - u/Mekanimal:
        ```
        Weren't the methods of gaining soul sight the ways to achieve it without murder though? Now we know that no one else in the time-skip is technically a living being of the real world there might not be so many issues with murder.

    - u/FishyBinder:
      ```
      The coin only works of the lich is willing to touch it.  That doesn't seem likely in a combat situation.
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        But a bullet can. 

        There was a time when Zorian toyed with the idea of enchanting the projectile and came to conclusion that it was too hard at the time. It may be from hard to impossible to make truly potent explosive ammo due to size limitations, but the soul coin is a low-energy project. It could be fit in a high caliber ammunition. The gun itself could be enhanced since it is not constrained by size, namely the barrel could be reinforced and gunpowder alchemically boosted.

        The benefit of a gun is that it is *really* fast. You can dodge arrows and magical projectiles. Firearms can't be dodged, not without preemptive temporal acceleration. That moment when he spotted the lich in the beginning of this chapter, he really could use a sniper gun.

        Worth a shot, at least.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          You do realise you're going straight to the 9th circle of hell for that pun right?
          ```

          - u/Xtraordinaire:
            ```
            Seems like a fitting *punishment*.
            ```

        - u/FishyBinder:
          ```
          Seem like it might work although a gun might be too harsh and damage the magical item used.  Other options could include a sling shot or air gun. I wonder if there is some length of time the coin need to remain in contact with the lich in order to work, or if maybe the lich protects his soul better while in combat situations.  At any rate he should talk to Kael about it, maybe do some tests and get Kael to write down the designs and results in his notebook.
          ```

        - u/narfanator:
          ```
          Why do you need a gun when Zach is stupidly good at throwing stuff extremely accurately?
          ```

          - u/Xtraordinaire:
            ```
            With a gun and Zach you can throw twice as many things.

            A gun is not a magical weapon and thus has no mana emissions that could be detected with some mana sensing.

            A gun can bring projectiles over the speed of sound.
            ```

            - u/GeeJo:
              ```
              Only in the 20th century. Before that rounds were strictly subsonic.
              ```

              - u/Xtraordinaire:
                ```
                True, but this is heavily dependent on barrel, cartridge and gunpowder quality. MoL-verse has magic and alchemy to spruce things up a bit.
                ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                Even subsonic, it could still be too fast to react. Especially if you snipe QI in the back before the fight starts. Even if he has crazy mana senses (probably), he'll have a hard time shielding that fast.
                ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              > A gun is not a magical weapon and thus has no mana emissions

              Well, a magically-reinforced gun is probably a different story...

        - u/throwawayJimmyTheCat:
          ```
          hahaha yes, worth a shot! I suggested it two weeks actually, so I really hope if more people mention it, Zorian will explore this option.
          ```

        - u/kaukamieli:
          ```
          Maybe some unstructured throwing? A sling can throw things really fast. Magic should be able to work as a gun...
          ```

      - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
        ```
        Can Xvim port it right next to the lich?

        How about 20 of them?

        Or:  There's probably *something* in the world that Quatach-Ichl tries to grab on sight, especially if a disposable battlemage is pointing it at him rather than offering it to him.  Zorian has a few tries to figure out what.
        ```

    - u/throwawayJimmyTheCat:
      ```
      I counter your comment with the suggestion that Zorian should make his teleportation spells extremely efficient, so he doesn’t have to worry about mobility as much.

      Definitely agree about that item Kael made, as well as a hasting formula.

    - u/Cryxx:
      ```
      > I definitely think he needs to look into becoming a shifter/transformation mage for physical abilities

      Grey Hunter Shifter Zorian is my dream outcome. It would fit thematically: First he learned how to think like a spider, then he learns how to turn into one. It would also delightfully weird out his acquaintances :D .
      ```

      - u/bludvein:
        ```
        Zorian won't become a shifter because of the soul influence, but even if he did the grey hunter would be a ridiculously poor choice all around. Magical animals have a much stronger mind than a normal animal so the instincts would carry over more strongly. There's a reason shifters choose normal animals. Grey hunters are ridiculously aggressive and territorial by default. Do you really want to turn Zorian into a hermit when this is all over?

        I've always thought it would be a good idea to learn transformation magic from Lukav though. He's in an ideal situation to practice, and while it doesn't come with the instincts or the easy transformation it doesn't have the demerits either.
        ```

        - u/Cryxx:
          ```
          I did call it a dream scenario. I know it doesn't actually fit into the story for various reasons. I just had fun imagining how it would complement his power package. Although I wonder if it's possible to compensate for the instincts using Aranean mind enhancements/alterations. 

          Transformation magic is certainly more realistic. I'm definitely hoping that Zorian will turn into a spider of some kind at one point.

      Transformation requires alchemy skills or lots of mana. Probably not the best area to focus on.

      He should focus on getting already good alchemists to share their stuff. If he can get some cool potions he should be pretty badass.

    - u/_fabien:
      ```
      If there was more time left in the loop, I'd easily see some nerfed down version of what Sakura does in Time Braid: medical ninjustu/magic that records the state of your body allow you to restore it. That would allow Zorian to improve his physical abilities despite the time loop (train during the loop, record the state of his body at the end of the loop, restore at the beginning, do it again).

      But it doesn't look like he is going to learn healing anytime soon.
      ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    I think his first priority should be to bring Zach, Xvim, Alanic together, then go over the battle in extreme detail while everyone takes notes, asking about any useful low-hanging fruits, exceptionally mana-efficient spells he can add to his repertoire, points of weakness for himself and Zach, etc. That kind of analysis could highlight new things to study and practice.

  - u/throwawayJimmyTheCat:

    Good question!

    1. **Simulacrum:** He should ask Xvim and Alanic about the simulacrum spell. It may or may not help in the fight, but it may be very economical in terms of time to have an extra Zorian to assist in crafting, etc.

    2. **AoE Mind Blast:** If he could target ten or more people at a time, he would have a way of knocking out large numbers of enemies in one go.

    3. **AoE Mental Suggestion:** If he could cast one spell that made a large group of people fight each other, that would also be helpful.

    4. **Multiple Anti-Teleportation Formulae:** He could give everyone a half-completed teleportation formula, then any time QI tries to disrupt the anti-teleportation field, a new one would get placed.
    ```

  - u/Nickoalas:
    ```
    I'd like to see more improvements on his unstructured magic.

    Isla commented at the start of the book that in an ideal world all magic would be performed in an unstructured manner. Structured spells are more convenient.

    Look at what Xvim was able to do with his mind shield. A structured spell isn't capable of self repair like that. If Zorian was capable of making physical shields with unstructured magic he'd be able to reinforce and patch any holes as they appeared.

    I'd have mine up all the time like a flexible second layer of skin.

  So...either Red Robe is actually part of the upper echelon of the cult, or he learned a lot about them and disguised himself as one.

  I wonder whether another time traveller might be able to pull off the same disguise? No doubt such an individual could learn a lot...and in the real world, maybe even be quite disruptive.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    This is probably the only real new piece of information we've got from this chapter. At least until Zorian expands on what he managed to mine from the cultists in the end.

    It makes sense, though. Red Robe sure posed as a cultist, and was apparently treated by the Q-I as one. If Red Robe is Veyers, it is most likely a disguise. Maybe someone from his house is a high-ranking member and thus he had a bit of advantage.
    ```

  - u/hoja_nasredin:

    in the restart where Aranea where dead RR appeared in his Red Robes shortly after restart.

    So he has an easy access to those Cul items. He probably was a part of the cult before the tiem loop.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      This is really inconclusive. Zorian can craft notebooks with hundreds of megabytes worth of information. Crafting something as generic as ominous red robe is child's play for a mage capable of creating a simulacrum.
      ```

      - u/Cheese_Ninja:
        ```
        RR doesn't even need to craft it, as long as he got in good with the Dragon Cultists' high mages in one of the loops to find out where they stash their identity-obscuring robe, he's just a teleport away from acquiring it.  RR might have to bypass some security, but that's a non-issue at this point.  Granted, crafting might still be the easier option, depending on the complexity of the robe and RR's crafting skill.

              Close. I think, more specifically, he made Sudomir flinch and lose control, then took control himself and *piloted* the dragon into the ground.

              Eventually Sudomir recovered enough to regain control (because he had more equipment), which is when the dragon started struggling against the living metal cords.

              Taking control of the dragon might indeed be feasible, and would be quite awesome, but it would first require getting past whatever security is on the thing. Zorian's previous expeditions didn't even reveal its presence.

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      He is a specialist in *defence against all kinds of magical attacks*. That already implies a very broad range of skills. I'm sure that he looks after his health, but athletics just wouldn't fit into his schedule.

      And when a simple stamina potion will get him to the battlefield, where he can slap QI's projectiles aside like tennis balls...well, I'm certainly not going to accuse him of failing to reach his potential.

  I love [counterattacks like this!](https://u.pomf.is/nbhlsd.webm)

  Also, I hope during some of the later restarts then will make it obvious to Quatach-Ichl that they know all its usual and most effective attacks so it’ll reveal more of its esoteric attacks and spells. It’s risky, but if they manage to pull it off in a controlled manner, it may help them in the final battle against it after exiting the Loop, since Red Robe may warn the lich to use non-default random attacks against Zach and Zorian.

  Now that was an intense chapter. Looks like the golden fire that damaged the Lich on that previous restart had come from Alanic (or maybe someone from his order, I'm very curious about them).
  Xvim simply backhanding the Lich's spell was particularly badass. 

  Now, I hope Zorian managed to get at least something out of his red robed target, cause it would be really disappointing after all this effort. Still, looks like the high echelon of the Cult are really powerful mages.

    > I hope Zorian managed to get at least something

    Oh, it certainly wasn't wasted effort. They've learned a lot:

    - The location of the ritual platform. Maybe they can come sooner next time, and with more numbers.
    - The value of a robust anti-teleportation ward for fighting QI. Booby-trapping it with soul magic is a great idea, /u/Cheese_Ninja. Also lots of general tactical information about what worked against him (absorption cubes, Xvim's drill) and what didn't (they need to find a counter for his temporal acceleration).
    - The names and addresses of two of the shifter children. The more of them ZZ can protect during the month, the harder it will be to make the ritual work, and the more likely that the cult will overextend itself.

    Plus, of course, next time Zach will have better soul defences, Zorian will have a better idea of how to quickly break into the summoner's mind, etc.

    The loop is supposed to operate for '11 lifetimes' under normal circumstances.

    1333 ÷ 11 = ~121

  How do you all suppose QI knows to go after Zorian?

  Zorian’s actions:

  0. Spell absorption cubes.
  0. Creating a boom to let people know QI had arrived.
  0. Mentalist attacks against enemy mages.
  0. Telepathically tracking flank attacks and QI’s movements.
  0. Anti-teleportation field that both succeeded in preventing QI from teleporting (which shouldn’t be easy, and which was done thanks to Xvim’s dimensional training), and succeeded in withstanding QI’s initial dispel (again, thanks to Xvim’s training).
  0. Mind-controlling the giant lizards.

  Except for numbers 1 and 2, none of these things point to Zorian, unless . . .

  0. QI can determine the origin of mind magic.
  0. QI’s dispel told him who cast the teleportation ward.
  ```

  - u/Nickoalas:
    ```
    I think Zorian's actions, including countering QI's attacks with the cubes and alerting others to his surprise attacks would have painted him as a threat.

    Zorian was tracking QI with his marker and QI would have noticed Zorians ability to keep track of him.
    ```

    - u/Overmind_Slab:
      ```
      Not only would they have marked him as a threat but QI might have noticed that Zorian wasn't throwing out powerful spells or blocking anything without help. Zorian represented a greater threat when compared to any of the battle mages other than Alanic, Xvim, or Zach and he seemed to be less capable of defending himself.
      ```

  - u/LucidityWaver:
    ```
    No. 5 points to Zorian's initial location. I think QI would connect to Zorian based on what happened when and where he first appeared and the awareness that's likely required for battlefield teleportation.
    Determining the origin of mind magic isn't too hard; who has well made mental shields, isn't doing much else noticeable and is probably visibly seen reacting quickly to things hidden to most or all other senses.

          That is true, but Sudomir was specifically watching Zorian, and no-one else.

- u/Accord_:
  ```
  Why didn't the lich go after them to the ritual site? He's obviously stalling to protect it, 3 of the MVP's rushing off in a hurry highly suggests that they're trying to go straight to it not just going to wherever.

  Some reasons might be :   
   - he can't teleport in the hole though that shouldn't matter much, I'm sure he has some way of going very fast like Zach did.  
   - he can't communicate with the ritual squad because of the hole's interference and if he left in pursuit he would leave his elite mage squad for dead. Why should he care? well suppose Zach just flies around while the lich is in pursuit, the mage squad dies, the whole good guy squadron moves into the hole and apparently the lich isn't confident he can keep it at bay on his own.  


  So kinda makes sense but kinda feels a little off that it was that easy to just bypass him, couldn't he just move his whole team to the hole entrance? that seems like a much better defense spot
  ```

  - u/DerSaidin:
    ```
    Maybe QI's motivation is more to damage Cyoria, rather than do a successful summoning.

    Maybe one of the other Cyorians got a new anti-teleport ward up.

    Maybe QI believed their shield would be sufficient, in combination with mind magic shielding.

      > all seven of them had shielded their mind incredible well

    Sounds like they were aware the bubble had that flaw, and shielded up to complement it. They just just weren't expecting such a skilled mind mage.
    ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    For all that QI is incredibly powerful, he is still just one mage, trying to hold together an invasion force that is severely outmatched by the defenders. If it wasn't for him, the defenders would have won quite easily. I imagine he decided those 3 wouldn't be enough to pierce the barrier protecting the summoners and that their mind defenses would be enough to hold Zorian.

        Yeah, I keep forgetting that distinction. Most of the time my mind just labels them all as "invaders, acceptable targets", but they actually have quite different backgrounds and motivations.

  Now, they can just teleport to the site of the ritual. Zorian, Zach, Xvim, Alanic can teleport as soon as QI engages.

  I suggest Zorian gets Xvim’s help in creating an explosive cube with the most advanced invisibility magics on it, place the cube at the center of the ritual site before the shield goes up, then the cube can explode on a timer.

  Even if the explosion just disrupts concentration or vaporizes the ball of blood, then mission accomplished.

    ```

    - u/throwawayJimmyTheCat:
      ```
      One possible solution:

      Zorian makes sure every mage has a teleportation ward. This time, the wards don’t have to be made hastily and so might be able to resist the information feedback property of QI’s special dispel and be less easily destructible.

      In addition, ZZX(A) can carry several well-made anti-teleportation wards, each with slightly different properties. During the main battle, Zorian can experiment with activating different ones and see which wards QI cannot punch through.

      Next, they teleport to the ritual site and QI can’t follow.

      They teleport in, drop the invisible grenades as a timer, offer token distance to the RRs, teleport out like they’re retreating. They reengage QI, meanwhile the grenades blow up. It’s a two-fer.

      It’s also possible that the ritual site had powerful anti-teleportation fields too. That may be why QI didn’t follow.
      ```

  - u/Nickoalas:
    ```
    That would kill all the children who were sacrifices. It's effective but heartless.

    Removing QI from the loop would be *highly* counterproductive. They need to learn everything they can about how he fights, so that they can beat the real one.

    I suppose, if it came down to "soulkill the lich or you won't get the keys in time to escape", then they'd have to do it, but that would mean that they'll really struggle in the real world. And he's likely to have impressive soul defences, too. Besides his ability to teleport in the blink of an eye.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:

      Agreed. If they learn the soul eject spell, it’d be best to save it for *after* they can reliably kick QI’s butt.
      ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    They'd still have to fight him in the real world, so meta is not that strong here. The final boss fight is inevitable.

    It is still a great idea. If they ever manage to master the soul eject button, they should use it whenever they don't feel like wasting time while getting the keys. If the dragon Zach killed in the first arc (and wasted ton of restarts) has a key in his treasury, instead of fighting it again just soul eject it and get whatever you need. Same with Q-I, as well. Suppose they get good enough to fight the lich, but he keeps fleeing whenever things don't go his way, and therefore the crown remains unattainable. At that point it is very sensible to use the eject switch.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:

      Of course, this would make it exceptionally difficult to actually evict him. RR used an area-of-effect version, but ZZ can't really afford to do that, because who knows what would happen if they hit each other. Although maybe Zach could do it by himself.

        Well, in the middle of combat, he went looking for easy targets. Penetrating the summoner's defences was a different matter: the mage was non-psychic, and couldn't do anything to retaliate or actively defend himself without disrupting the ritual.

Shouldn't zorian be highly focusing on this? If he increase his own memories and critical thinking to a higher level on par with a supercomputer, he could have easily learn and *master* powerful spells in mere days, having finer control of his mana.

  Furthermore, in the previous chapters mentioned that using ambient mana as an alternative source of power will corrupt host mind to be insane while the soul and body will be relatively safe from corrupt. If zorian could tune his mind to be like a transformer for power stations. he could be the single most powerful mage in the story. Throwing unlimited artillery spells with a single flick of finger as long as there are high ambients. 

  This is just a theory of the potential of mind magic

  Curiously, i like to know whether mana shaping allows you to feel, contain and concentrate ambient mana with your own personal mana. The higher the concentration, the faster one could regenerate mana. If zorian could create a layer of ultra high density of mana around him,solving his mana reserves problem. This might need insanely good mana shaping and perception skills of the likes of xvim or even better. 

  In short, how does ambient mana be converted to one's own mana naturally? Is sitting down and wait really just a natural way of increasing ambient mana concentration in the surrounding of the host?

  Lastly, do you age inside a black room? its seems to slow down time and not slow down biological age. Wouldn't the drawbacks of multiple uses be huge and taxing on the host body? And could a pure soul be anchored inside the black room for necromancy training?

  TL; DR mind magic could use to turn the brain into super computers and transformers for unlimited firepower. shape mana like a container a gas can for better recovery rate.

    On the subject of ambient mana - I'm a little surprised that Xvim apparently ran out of mana and just used his body as a shield, while standing *inside the Hole*. You'd think that in such a rich environment, already committed to defending Zorian with his life, he could keep using mana until he either finished off the cultists or collapsed from the toxicity.

    > I feel that mind magic have the potential to be the single most OP power in the story.

    And if you make a single mistake, you're likely to shatter your own mind. Which will have lasting consequences across restarts. And Zorian has no-one to tutor him; none of his aranean tutors even mentioned that such techniques exist.

    > the soul and body will be relatively safe from corrupt

    This is incorrect. Taiven indicated that using ambient mana in an emergency may put you in bed for days with a fever. It definitely poisons the body.

    > If zorian could tune his mind to be like a transformer

    That's basically what the existing assimilation techniques already do, but there's no indication that instantaneous assimilation is possible. And I'm sure that plenty of mages have been foolhardy enough to try.
    ```

  - u/Cheese_Ninja:
    ```
    I don't think any amount of mind magic internal alterations will allow for free usage of ambient mana.  I think mana poisoning affects life force directly.

    Mana reserve regeneration according to nobody103: 
    >It takes anywhere between 30 minutes and 3 hours for a mage to regenerate their mana reserves from total zero to full if ambient mana levels are sufficiently plentiful, depending on their personal skill and willingness to risk mana poisoning. This is unaffected by the size of one's mana reserves - those will higher reserves will simply regenerate more mana per minute.

    Anything above a rank 2 or 3? mana well allows for max recovery speed for a human mage.  Above that, higher ranked wells just allow for more mages and more devices/wards powered by ambient mana.  There's a chapter where they mention that Cyoria's major appeal is that it allows for any number of mages and magic research institutions since it's a rank 9? mana well.

    Inside the black room they should perceive time as passing normally.  So if they're in there for a month they'll age for a month, not sure what you mean by "host body" in this case.

  Guesses:

  * Xvim might have been soul-killed. If so, the assault will be way harder in future restarts. Don't think this is likely (soul-kill is probably the loop admin power), but I can't look up the description of RR's soul-kill on the Aranea to confirm/deny
   * It seems likely the inner circle mages have some sort of soul magic anyway, which may require special consideration
  * The ritual may be to contain the Primordial. Alternatively, disrupting it while it is half-complete could create a disastrous backlash (i.e. they need to stop the invasion way sooner)
  * Zorian is going to finally make an enhancement potion to shore up his physical shortcomings
  * If Zorian or Zach learn even one of Alanic/Xvim's tricks from this chapter, holy hell are they gonna be powerful

    > Xvim might have been soul-killed

    Definitely not. That's a Controller ability, and QI certainly isn't a Controller.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      And QI didn't even kill Xvim, it was some random cultist.
      ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      QI does have the crown however. I don't think he'd gain the ability because of it, otherwise he'd be using it like crazy.
      ```

  - u/GodKiller999:
    ```
    There never was a soul kill, the spell red robe used was what excluded people from the loop, but it's the loop mechanism itself that did the job.
    ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure the soul-kill was purple
    ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    The ability wasn't a soul-kill, is was a ban. The admin power is "remove from loop", it's not /actually/ killing their souls, it's just marking them for non-duplication.

  Bravo!

- u/Nickoalas:

  I'm worried that Zach was the only one left on that platform, and we don't know what happened to him after Zorian was taken out.

  It sure looks like Zorian got taken out by a Lich blast to the face, and left Zach by himself against soul magic.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > Zorian got taken out by a Lich blast

    Actually, I assumed that it was something primordial-related. The ritual was interrupted and the red sphere was behaving oddly. Either exploding, or tripping one of the conditions for the loop reset, seems like a logical outcome.
    ```

    - u/Nickoalas:
      ```
      My bad, you're absolutely right.

      I was way too paranoid about 'two steps back' following last chapter's 'one step forward' and missed the obvious.
      ```
