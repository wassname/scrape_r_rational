## [Request] Stories made entirely of foreshadowing.

### Post:

One of my favorite compliments I ever got on HPMOR was "This story is made entirely of foreshadowing."

What work that you've read, if any, stands out in your mind as having the second-highest level of this quantity?

More precisely, after HPMOR, what work has the greatest quantity of sentences that appear different on a second read?  I'm not looking for a single big startling reveal like "Ohmygosh Alice was a traitor this whole time!", I'm asking about the density of sentences that read in a different light once you finish the book and know that Alice was a traitor, there never was a Ring of Meringue, and Bob was just three garden gnomes in a tall coat.

These changed readings will manifest from differently-appearing ideas and plot events, but I ask about the sentence level rather than the idea level so as to look for how much of the reading experience changes on a second read.

This is one of my favorite literary things ever, but you probably guessed that already.

        I don't believe so. The "Chapter 1" thing is just a function of the website. If you open any story on this website, it will say

        > "Chapter 1: " + (Title of the chapter as given by the author)

        And all subsequent chapters will be "Chapter x: " + (Title of the chapter as given by the author).

        I simply found amusement in that the first chapter of the book was named Chapter 3. This amusement could have also been experienced had I opened a brand new book and found "Chapter 3" as the title of the first chapter, even without explicit text stating which chapter it is supposed to be. Because of course it's supposed to be the first one.

        This story does not rely on knowing the exact number of which chapter you are reading. It also does not take advantage of any of the website's functions, such as author's notes. I believe any alternate versions will be completely fine.

    Gotta disagree with CORDYCEPS. It's good (though I think it gets overhyped), but...the foreshadowing I think is just too heavy handed. Like you don't figure everything out in the first chapter, but it's pretty clear what's going on [in the first few chapters](#s " that is to say, the amnesia stuff") and the only good foreshadowing that I think qualifies as the type asked after in this thread comes at the end of Chapter 4.

    But like, I feel like [*everything*](#s " is revealed after chapter 10, and the story goes on for another 16 without having much in the way of new developments. it remains good because of the tension from alphabet and 5, but...there were no big "aha!" moments")

  [Higurashi no Naku koro ni](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry) , and especially [Umineko](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry) is absolutely full of this. Reading Umineko a second time is like a completely different story.

  I really like HPMOR, but regarding this quality, I think these stories outdo HPMOR.

  The Higurashi anime adaptation is fine, but the anime adaptation of Umineko is terrible (critical pieces of information are left out, it feels extremely rushed compared to the original novel, and it stops before the 5th story arc which is one of the best parts).

  So watch Higurashi and then read the Umineko visual novel (there's an English translation available online). I think you'd enjoy them Eliezer.
  ```

  - u/Golden_Magician:
    ```
    Seconded. Back when I was a huge HPMoR fanatic (truly to the point of obsession) Umineko was the only fictional work that I considered to be on par if not above it. Eliezer trying to solve the mysteries of that story would be something amazing for me!

    I also want to put forward my own recommendation: [Shin Sekai Yori](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FromTheNewWorld?from=Literature.ShinSekaiYori), either the anime or the original novel. This story displays many examples of elegant and subtle foreshadowing and re-watching it is an entirely different experience.
    ```

    - u/MultipartiteMind:
      ```
      Umineko, thirded.  I suspect that a large part of that is inherited from the mystery novel genre itself (or in Japanese, 'suiri shousetsu'/'deduction novel'), it was actually my introduction to the line between stories like Sherlock Holmes novels, which show a detective pulling answers out of a hat, and stories like Agatha Christie novels, where the reader is challenged to pay attention to details, *especially* the 'I am confused' moments, and trying to arrive at the truth before the grand reveal is made--I particularly enjoyed Umineko's meta-commentary about the trust between the author and reader (the trust that the reader will try to solve the mystery, the trust that the mystery can be solved), the mentioning of Knox's Commandments and Dine's Rules, et cetera.  After Umineko, I began reading library-held mystery novels, gradually getting used to certain tricks, delighted when I missed something and later kicked myself over not realising its significance.

      In any case, yes!  Umineko was particularly delicious, in many ways, and the Higurashi/Umineko Question/Answer arcs' division is delightful.

      (That would indeed be fun, if Yudkowsky were somehow in a spoiler-free box, keeping a diary of notes/impressions and thoughts about Umineko as he read through (challenged) all of it...)

  I'm somewhat taken aback by the way you chose to phrase that. 

  >What work that you've read, if any, stands out in your mind as having the second-highest level of this quantity?

  Surely you don't genuinely believe that you have created the work that has more foreshadowing than any other in the history of fiction? So much so that there may not even be a second place.

  I enjoyed HPMOR, but it had its faults. While it was memorable, it's hard to claim that HPMOR is the ultimate example of any particular literary virtue.

  (Oh, and to answer your actual question: Mistborn. HPMOR is nowhere close.)

  Mother of Learning comes to mind immediately as having a flavor of this.

  Damn near everything that Zorian encounters early on happens to have some relevance or importance later on. A sad girl standing on a bridge? Subplot. A kitten looking at him sadly? Subplot. Language expert consulted early on? Subplot. Some rats running by? Subplot! 

  It has the side effect of making the world of Cyoria really feel alive, and it's absolutely lovely.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    My problem with how this was done is that the foreshadowing was *just* foreshadowing, in a lot of those cases. Proper foreshadowing, in my opinion, doesn't *look* like foreshadowing, because it's disguised within the fabric of the text.

    In *Mother of Learning*, a lot of the foreshadowing just bogs down the movement of the early chapters, because it's totally irrelevant to that movement. Telling the reader "hey, this is going to be important later" seems really inelegant to me. This is in contrast to something like HPMOR, where a solution to a conflict early in the story serves as foreshadowing of a solution to a different conflict later in the story, or where lessons taught to a character include clues that get used later in the plot.
    ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      Yeah, I don't think that counts. I know *more* about the girl with the bicycle 60 chapters later, but my rereading of her first occurrence is not subverted in any way.

  >This story is made entirely of foreshadowing

  >sentences that appear different on a second read

  >sentences that read in a different light once you finish the book 

  You've basically just described Worm in three sentences.

  The world is fundamentally built on deception and secrecy. The protagonist is as much a newcomer to this world as any first-time reader. At first glance, the setting seems to be filled with tropes and ideas that are culturally familiar to the reader, and this familiarity lets the author subvert expectation in creative and interesting ways.

  Characters introduced early on are more fully explored later, often in ways that radically recontextualize past actions and behaviors.
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    Eeeh, well worm does have a lot of those sentences but mostly because it just has a lot of sentences? I recently reread worm and except for picking up more on the unreliable narration and being more favourable to characters that are initialy hostile, I don't think the reread was much different.
    ```

    - u/Action_Bronzong:
      ```
      >I recently reread worm and except for picking up more on the unreliable narration and being more favourable to characters that are initially hostile, I don't think the reread was much different.

      Okay. Working from memory to find examples of these, but here are things I think are recontextualized on a reread.

      **Any scene with Sophia in it**

      In example, the confrontation with Emma and Shadow Stalker at the mall in 5.3. On a blind read through, Stalker comes across as a tough but fair hero motivated by a concern for public welfare.

      With context, the dramatic irony in this scene transforms it into something farcical. Stalker knows about Taylor and her history with Emma. She is motivated by helping Emma, and is intentionally trying to put Taylor in the most negative light possible.

      The meaning behind all of Shadow Stalker's actions is recontextualized, making the scene feel fresh on a reread.

      >Emma looked up at me, eyes wide, mouth open, one hand to the side of her face.  I was as shocked at what I’d done as she was.  Not that I felt *bad*.  A large part of me wanted to laugh in her face.  *Weren’t expecting that?  Miscalculated how I’d react?*

      > Hands seized me with an iron grip and spun me around.  Shadow Stalker.  She interposed herself between me and Emma.  Dark brown eyes glowered at me from behind her mask.

      >[...]

      >Shadow Stalker scolded him, “This is *not* the time or place for arguments.  If your daughter is this… unwell, then that’s *your* responsibility.”

      Shadow Stalker knows why Taylor hit Emma.

      It has nothing to do with Taylor's concussion, but Stalker is playing along.

      >I felt like laughing.  Part of it was just being giddy at doing something to get back at Emma.  The other part was that this whole scenario was so ridiculously upside-down.  Shadow Stalker wasn’t really anything special.  She was just a *teenage girl*, lecturing my dad, an adult.  The crowd that was watching was seeing Emma as the victim, me as the bad guy. **But if you stripped away the costume, if everyone knew the real story, this would all be playing out so differently.**

      (Bolded emphasis mine) Taylor is more right than she knows.

      This is a blatantly intentional author nod, when you have context.

      >I pointed at Emma, turned to my dad, “You want to know why I hit her?”

      >Shadow Stalker put one hand on the side of my face, forced me to look at her, stopping me from talking in the process. “No.  I’m stopping this right here.  No arguments, no excuses as to why you just assaulted someone.  We’re breaking this up now.  Turn around.”

      >“What?” I half-laughed, incredulous, “Why?”

      This can be read as the actions of an overworked Hero trying to immediately deescalate the situation, or as an attempt by Sophia to publicly humiliate Taylor.

      >Shadow Stalker bound my wrists with what I guessed was a plastic wrist-tie.  Too tight.  Then she turned to my dad, and her voice was hushed.  “Look at this crowd.  These people.  They’re *scared*.  A place like this, with this much suppressed panic, fear and worry, this many people close together?  **I don’t care if your daughter is an idiot or just ill.**  She’s proven to be volatile in a powder-keg situation.  **It’s both dangerous and *stupid* to have her here.**  You can cut off the plasti-cuffs when she’s separated from anyone she might harm.”

      The verbal insults and put-downs are so *clearly* in line with Sophia's character, but I don't think most people would ever connect these dots without the later reveal.

      >My dad nodded, embarrassed.  I felt bad at that.  I felt worse at being led off like a criminal, while Shadow Stalker gave Emma a hand to help her up.  Emma was beaming, smiling one of the widest smiles I’d seen her give, despite the red mark on the side of her face. **Smiling as much at the way things had turned out, I imagined, as she was at getting the chance to talk with the concerned superheroine.**

      Really damn funny on a reread, in my opinion.
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        Yes, Sophia is a good example. And you can find foreshadowing for a lot of things abut Taylor's character that aren't originally clear. I'm not saying there's no foreshadowed twists in Worm.

        But large segments of the plot and characters are just played straight; you find out something new that fits previously shown snippets, but doesn't really *change* what they mean. The reveal is foreshadowed, and a re-read makes you notice the foreshadowing, but - for me at least - it doesn't make me "read [the foreshadowing] in a different light"
        ```

  - u/literal-hitler:
    ```
    Not foreshadowing. Worm is like half climax. Every time I thought I was at the climax of that part of the story, it would just escalate into another climax. I think I screwed up my adrenal receptors reading that story.

  If you like anime, FLCL is something along these lines. it isn't foreshadowing so much as everything in it makes sense in a certain context, and you don't have enough of that context until the very end. the first time through it looks like chaos and noise, but a subsequent viewing ends up looking much different.
