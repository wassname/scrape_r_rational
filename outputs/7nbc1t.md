  This is one of the few stories that makes me *feel* things. Things you don't expect to feel when reading or watching a grisly high fantasy story. Amazing writing.

  I like that even at his lowest, Black remains extremely collected and rational. That said:

  > "Never that. Alaya rules. But she must understand that the time for long games is past. Praes now faces an existential threat. Compromise is no longer an option."

  Yeah, but... when an Empress doesn't want to do something, and you do it anyway, this is basically the definition of rebelling.

  Despite Black's calm and composed attitude I can't help but think Malicia was right.

  He's just got dealt a serious blow and his immediate reaction is to turn the Empire into a war machine. It feels too much like a desperate move to obtain as much power as he can so that he's not beaten by an opponent he now overestimates.

  Consider this - the Empire can play a lot of hands that Procer can't. It has more Named, it has greater sorcery, at least several "magical super-weapons" and it's united as a single entity rather than a collection of separate states. 

  It feels like even after the current civil war Praes and Callow could still match evenly with Procer, admittedly with some difficulty.
  ```

  - u/Nihilvin:
    ```
    Her assessment of Black was spot on. He believes the war is inevitable to the extent that he fails to see any other alternatives
    ```
