  I've posted the first part before, but I've updated it to the point where the chapter was supposed to end.

  Also, my website is back up, and I'm back at writing. I'll probably not stick to a strict schedule, but the next chapter is going to be a shorter one.

  I want to say something here, but I can't think of anything. It doesn't feel like much happened in this chapter.
