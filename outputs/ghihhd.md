## Surreal/weird rational fiction?

### Post:

Exactly what it says on the tin, but I'm not *just* interested in recommendations - I'm interested as to whether it is possible to have a work of fiction that is rational while being surreal and/or weird or trippy.

When it comes to being weird or trippy, I'm thinking about the old Jack Kirby Thor comics, with Ego the Living Planet, and the stories with the Silver Surfer, or Doctor Strange, or the Fantastic Four. I'm thinking about Philip K. Dick's weird books like The Man In The High Castle. 

Having read a little about Grant Morrison's run on Doom Patrol, I suppose if it's possible to write a rational work with heroes and villains with bizarre and strange powers. The characters may not be rationalist - they might be the exact opposite - but the worldbuilding itself could be rather rational. And I wonder if it is possible to treat weird premises - living planets, acid trip dimensions and whatnot - rationally.

What do you think?

  Check out Chili and the Chocolate Factory and Unsong. (I am under the impression that Cordyceps is also quite surreal, but I haven't managed to read it yet.)  


  Not all are explicitly rational in their construction, but often they have authors who are clearly breaking that rationality with intent. They often have rational characters, but weird worlds, but there are definitely multiple flavours. Sometimes they're referred to as being anti-rational, but I definitely find they scratch similar sorts of itches.  


  I'll note that Unsong does literally have a DMT dimension in there, and the Cactus Man makes an appearance (though we don't get any mechanical elves!).

    Cordyceps isn't so much surreal as it is terrifying. 

    It's certainly exploring some unusual themes, but it does so more in a psychological horror kind of way than the other two stories you mentioned.

    Edit: I don't mean that as a strike against Cordyceps, btw. It's a great story and I do recommend reading it if you can find the time (it's not that long).

      If it helps, the author _is_ planning to do a rewrite and try to publish it in some way. He gives himself a [40%](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/29/predictions-for-2020/) chance to at least finish the rewrite this year.

    I'm probably going to give it a look, but it's like 64 pages, and I kinda want to know what it's about before I read it, since there's no summary. (And my attention span seems shot to hell the past few weeks, anyway, and there's that too).

      Dude wakes up in The Future getting resuscitated from cryo after his death only to find himself in the only body that was lying around for charity cases, that of a robotic rat skeleton (to scale).  He finds himself at odds with the (strangely flexible) law system, the weird and random bodies people seem to inhabit, the lack of any personal boundaries, and starts trying to etch out his own corner of the world according to his own far outdated values (and love of crypto).

    > In the near future, science has discovered and investigated the reality of the soul, a top-secret facility on the ocean floor monitors the depths for creatures beyond human comprehension, and its eccentric inhabitants balance the familiar challenges of life, love and fulfillment with the surreal challenges of a continually shifting, mind-bending new reality.

    That does sound interesting, and I like the premise, but I wonder in what way it would be rational/rational-adjacent.

  That's exactly what I was thinking on reading the title. How would you go reconciling the two? I suppose it's possible if the surreality is explained (there are certainly surreal things in real life, and LSD is still a thing, so why not?), but it would take some serious writing chops to keep the tone consistent throughout a story despite it having surrealism.

  You might find something similar in first-contact stories with aliens being... alien. 

  I suppose I'll be back to see if there are decent answers to the question.

    I would say it's possible if the surreality is being *explored*: the surreal world has some consistent underlying laws, vastly different from ours, the characters learn about them and utilize them to their benefit. As an example of a world with different laws, Jacek Dukaj's *Other Songs* comes to mind. It didn't leave an impression of being *rational* for me, but its world is interesting and thought out.

    I wonder if its surreal-through-features vs surreal-through-tone. I mean, I won't be surprised if there are surreal fiction works set in the real world, and so there could be a work with a surreal tone set in a very rational world. But lots of people would very well disagree that the work continues to be rational.

    As for surrealism-as-aspect - I wonder how well it's possible to handle reality-warping and stuff like that rationally.

  I have been told that  [https://www.homestuck.com/problem-sleuth](https://www.homestuck.com/problem-sleuth) meets this criteria, but I haven't read enough of it to confirm. It is very surreal, but supposedly it has a consistent underlying reality.

  Stories in the [absursist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism) genre often portray surreal situations for the sake of exploring rational themes.

  One good example of that is the Mars scene with Dr. Manhattan and Laurie in the graphic novel *Watchmen*. On the surface level, that scene looks like two people getting into an argument in a desolate, red wasteland that ends with one of them smashing a glass castle. Pretty weird, no?

  But it's more than that:

  The entire chapter explores the idea of what exactly makes humans so special. If we discard the selfish, anthropocentric arguments, then what's left to render sentient life inherently better than inanimate nature? One answer offered in that scene is that human beings are uniquely beautiful because of their faculty to create and perceive abstract meaning in a universe which inherently lacks it.

  And thus it's fitting that the final panel of that chapter is an allusion to the so-called '[Happy Face on Mars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990315.html)' that first came about when human beings saw a pattern in the shape of light and shadow on a distant planet.

  S.I. is highly surreal and attempts to be rationalist although I don't think it succeeds. Wouldn't recommend but if you feel like reducing your sanity go give it a whirl.

  A better place is a webcomic. It's best if even the premise comes as a surprise so look at it, might not call it rational but it looks at some interesting concepts. I would definitely recommend.

  Onwards to Providence. Brilliant worldbuilding. Could be described as an eldritch roadtrip but that doesn't really do it justice. A nice xenofiction. Even the "Terran" viewpoint characters are more alien than they seem. I especially like the worldbuilding that goes into the logical consequences of a world where souls exist, how they'd evolve that way, how it'd effect culture, how it'd effect development and so on.

      A both hilarious and horrifying adventure story, basically the author wakes up from cryo in a future after a bad singularity apparently originating from several contradictory wish fulfillment systems. For unclear reasons one of the many mad gods placed a bright pink bunny girl with an empty skull contoured for his brain. As it progresses the main character, the world and presumably the author go increasingly far off the deep end.

      It never goes far enough to actually be removed from Sufficient Velocity but it got surprisingly far before a mod locked the thread and banned the author for a bit. read the mod post at the end first before deciding to dive into the trainwreck:

      [https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/s-i-original-si.4573/post-2825875](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/s-i-original-si.4573/post-2825875)

      I didn't know what I was getting in to but I read it to the end anyway, it was hilarious.

      That said it does have some creative points like the time the main character's bones sprouted and I like how it tries to set a ratfic in a setting so utterly hostile to reason.

  Is very weird yet or perhaps because it has a lot of thought put into it. Lots of high concept stuff, time travel, applied infinities, stuff like that. It's broadly a HP fanfiction but the setting has had practically a complete overhaul. I strongly recommend, very strongly considering the request. A couple highlights that are relatively easy to explain are the infinite library where people go on expeditions to attractor points in whatever fractal layout it's been sorted into currently and take out books to decode new spells from, it's quite possibly deriving these spells in a more traditional way would be a supertask. Or Griffindor's Lion(I think that's it's name?), A large abstract sculpture that doesn't change in any way yet the patterns it forms are constantly shifting, the viewer can see a lion moving and roaring in a still object. Or the "train" or the MC being gifted his own perfectly accurate biography but due to the nature of information loops his brain is unable to process the words describing future events until they have happened.

  The works of Gilbert and Sullivan are fond of taking ridiculous premises to their logical conclusion. For example, in *Ruddigore*, the witch's curse requires that the Baronet of Ruddigore commit a horrible crime or die in horrible agony - which, at the end, the protagonist manages to work around by >!declaring that to deliberately fail to commit a horrible crime under the influence of the curse would be committing suicide, which is itself a horrible crime, rendering the curse completely harmless.!<

    I believe that this one was referenced by Isaac Asimov in his excellent short story *The Up-To-Date Sorceror*, if memory serves.
