  I'm really sorry, guys. A hiatus is one thing, but I've always hated authors who just leave without saying anything, so I'm doubly sorry for being that guy. I suspect I'll have lost a lot of readers, but thank you to everyone who stuck around waiting this long - especially the people who sent messages urging me to continue (even though I wasn't using Reddit and didn't see them until now). You guys are way better than I deserve. >\_<

    What do you mean, the loss of your job and illness are a terrible excuse for putting an unpaid writing project on hold? That's ridiculous self-flagellation.

    Even if you consider writing fiction your one true calling, you can expect to write more and better fiction if you stay in good health and not live in poverty. Those are essential instrumental goals, geez.

      Haha, true enough, but it's not like I'm seriously depressed or dying here. I actually did have a couple chapters more or less ready when I dropped off, and I \*just\* promised everyone I would do regular updates before suddenly vanishing, so I think a little self-flagellation is appropriate here. :)

      Also, I'm pretty sure that if you're a writer you're supposed to beat yourself up 100% of the time no matter what. It's a whole thing with artsy types, don't ask me why. :p

    It's a novel on the internet - your wellbeing is more important, even if it is a pretty great one. If you really must worry about such things, just post a sentence or two as an update, saying you need to take some time off. Absolutely everyone will - and do - understand.

    Glad you're back!

  I am absolutely LOVING this in depth connection of all the past events. Especially since it seems that whoever directed the 4ths death is having their plan slowly unfurled to all the MCs. 

  Ive always adored mastermind plots and I have high expectations of this.

  Forgive me if Im wrong but I thought Naruto and Sasuke were with the Sand Siblings the previous few chapters. Did I miss a transition?

    Thanks! I'm glad you like the mastermind plot - I've been worrying that I haven't set it up properly since there's been little speculation about it on the whole. I'm writing a separate post for r/rational on that topic, actually.

    Naruto and Sasuke were training with the Sand Siblings before, but last chapter it was revealed that they hadn't shown up to that day's meeting yet (because they were training with Lee and he has a ridiculous training schedule) and so the Sand Sibs were just with Shikamaru and co when the fighting started. I'm not going to spoil anything else in case you missed that chapter, but I would really read it if you haven't already because it's a good one. :)

      Nah. You've made it so that various characters have discussed or thought about it in ways that feel natural. You havent forced it into the plot or had the plot go around it, which is hard to execute but wonderful when done properly. 

      The only issue I could see is that characters think of similarities far apart in time and connect them easily but that is brushed aside because youve made everyone sufficiently clever. No one seems to be level 1 intelligent but level 2 or higher. Everyone is paranoid for decent reasons and are used to playing the game on multiple levels so they are used to looking for underlying pattern connections.

      Im eagerly awaiting for the moment they actually discuss this underlying pattern and the moment the master plan is revealed. Youve engendered my trust as a reader, I just hope you dont burn yourself out. Make sure you prioritize your health and stability okay?

      And youre right. I merged the last two chapters before this one in my head together. Probably because the Sasuke blitzing Naruto moment was so prominent in my mind.

  Woohoo, TNTBS is back!

  Excellent timing too, I finished re-reading the whole thing a few weeks ago.

  This was a good chapter. I'm surprised Kakashi is still trying to convince Chiyo to stop fighting, it's pretty obvious revenge is the only thing she lives for at this point...

    ```
    Chronic goodguyness, it’s a thing! Also, even though this Kakashi is a bit more cynical, he was still raised by the Fourth with the idea that they have to fight back against the darkness of the world, so he feels like he has to try. Also also, he believes that the *real* enemy is still out there, so fighting her doesn’t really accomplish anything in his mind.
    ```
