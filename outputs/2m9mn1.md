## [Q] Seeking Writing Advice: Illustrations

### Post:

It's easy to find advice on how to improve your story's prose. There seems to be a lot less advice floating around about images that complement the text. Do you have any advice yourself, or suggestions about where to find it?

A more concrete question: I've just found a DeviantArt artist with a non-childish style, willing to draw characters for the price of a cup of coffee. If we're able to work together, who or what from my story S.I. do you think I should request to be drawn?

  In my personal opinion:

  * Images should always be between chapters - never within a scene, and probably not breaking up scenes within a chapter.
  * Images should be either small, simple, or both - enough that you can stop and look at it for a few seconds after a chapter ends, but you don't want to stop the reader in their tracks.
  * Images should be *suggestive*. Suggestion engages the mind and pushes a person to seek more information. If your images are leading the chapters, each image should raise some question or evoke some mystery that makes the reader want to dive in. There are hundreds of tricks here, some of them cheaper (and more effective) than others. Just the picture of a broken window at the start of a chapter will leave the reader wondering when that's going to happen within the chapter. In other words, the image shouldn't be a thesis statement, it should be a tease - an enticement.

  I've always liked the way that the Harry Potter books did this. The *Stormlight Archives* also do something similar, though often it's used for exposition (of a sort) showing fighting styles or varieties of armor that would be laborious to describe. These images all exist in-universe, taken from a sketchbook of one of the main characters or otherwise as some kind of document or something, which I think is clever and helps to keep the reader grounded in the story.

  If you have access to it, I find that "[The City of Dreaming Books](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62031.The_City_of_Dreaming_Books)" handles pictures pretty good. I'm at work now, so I can't check, but I believe it shows new characters being introduced (and the fact that the characters universally look weird makes that a great help), but also complex structures. The book has a lot of weird environments (giant libraries, a house in the skull of a cyclops, a cave full of flying fish, a hollowed-out mountain...) and it helped me visualize the story and the action.

  So basically: characters, and places people might not have seen themselves.

  Action scenes. Climaxes. New characters who are just introduced. Important stuff

  I haven't done this *particular* thing, but in general I find that when in doubt dealing with a creative worker the best thing to do is to discuss it with them and let them take the lead to choose what would excite them the most. (You should still communicate any constraints and preferences that you know you have. The idea is to constrain such that you'll be happy with most things that fall within the constraints, and to communicate just enough that you remove the tendency to "play it safe" under uncertainty from the artist's perspective).

  One thing I would love to see is a map of the places Bunny is traveling to. Maybe the map she received in the beginning for the illustration to be shown in the story instead of at the end?
  [However the map](#s " gave incorrect information on the zones.")
