## [RT][HF][MK] Stealing Sorcery

### Post:

Hey /r/rational,

Please forgive the self-promotion.

I just released my second book, [Stealing Sorcery](http://www.amazon.com/Stealing-Sorcery-Broken-Mirrors-Book-ebook/dp/B016IPJ1R8/). Some of the people here liked my first book, so I thought I'd mention it.

I write extremely detailed magic systems, which I know some people here like, and my characters tend to optimize it to *some* extent. (They're not always doing 100% perfect optimization, but they tend to be fairly creative.)

If you liked the first book, you'll probably like this one. If you didn't like the first book, you *might* like this anyway - it's more character driven, which most of my beta readers preferred.

Fair warning that this is somewhat *rational*, but not *rationalist*, and different characters have varying levels of rational behavior. The /r/rational people I've talked to thus far tend to like Jonan and Lydia more than my other protagonists.

Here's a description:

*The immortal sorcerers – three legendary figures that toppled the empire of Xixis. Each has lived for over a hundred years, leaving a powerful legacy in their wake.* 

*But their children do not share their renowned immortality – and when the firstborn son of Edrick Theas is killed, the sorceress Lydia Hastings is called to investigate the murder. When she discovers a sorcerous trail left by a creature of unfathomable power, she quickly realizes she needs outside help. And while Jonan Kestrian – a spy for a rival military power – might not be Lydia’s first choice for an ally, she knows that he has the knowledge and skills that she needs.*

*While Lydia and Jonan trace the assassin’s trail, Taelien undergoes the Trials of Unyielding Steel, a series of tests to ensure his entry into the Paladins of Tae’os. As he trains for his trials, Taelien faces his fiercest rival yet – Velas Jaldin, a former member of Orlyn’s Queensguard with the power to manipulate motion at her whim. With skills far beyond those of an ordinary soldier, the former Queensguard might be the killer that Lydia seeks – or the assassin’s next victim.*

If you haven't read the first book in the series yet, you can find it [here](http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-War-Broken-Mirrors/dp/1505886554/).

You can get either of them for free through Kindle Unlimited if you have a subscription. There's a preview up for Forging Divinity for people without a description (click on the book cover on Amazon); hopefully the preview for Stealing Sorcery should be up shortly.

  If you don't mind my asking, how did the July 1 change to KU payouts affect you? I've pulled most of my short fiction out and am going to try going wide for a while, but I'm curious how others are doing. My novels were doing okay in KU, but the reporting makes it so hard to tell how it's working -- a few completions or multiple drivebys.

    Since I only have published novels, it didn't hit me very hard at all. My overall income did decrease from month to month, but I think that was probably just a decrease in the number of people reading. 

    Unfortunately, it's hard to track because the criteria are so different now - I only know # of pages read, as opposed to the # of people who exceeded the 10% threshold before. 

    I get considerable spikes when I put my books on Kindle Countdown deals (in terms of sales rank, not income). That's the main thing that makes Kindle Select worthwhile to me; I think my first sale was a big part of why I managed to ride in the top 100 of a couple categories for as long as I did. 

    I wish I had more concrete data to give you, but I haven't really dug into the numbers in any detail.

      That's helpful; I haven't tried KC yet, but I will.  Thank you.
