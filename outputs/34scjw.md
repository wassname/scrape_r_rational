## Am I overthinking this? [Basement!Narnia Worldbuilding question]

### Post:

There's an idea that I had a few months ago about a world that was in (and just plain *was*) a basement somewhere. You go down into the basement, and there are more stairs, and more, and as you keep descending you get gradually enter this other place where the basement levels get weirder and bigger but the urban environment never actually stops being a thing. 

So, you know, a little bit of Basement Narnia. There's a world down there, with cultures and beings that have adapted to the deeps here, and the deeper you go the more that you undergo some sort of time dilation so that you might spend months or even years at a sufficient depth while only minutes pass in the surface world (this has a bit of a Narnia feel, but it *also* gives the antagonists an incredibly unfair time advantage because they're located pretty deep). 

My problem is that I would like for there to be lights, and for the world's water to come from pipes in the walls, and so on, but if that's the case then the building that this world is a part of should be racking up a simply enormous utilities bill, and sooner or later something would be done about that. Not to mention that the time dilation would cause problems in getting water from the surface to the depths. 

Should I just accept that the basement world people will not be getting their water from the pipes, and so on, or am I being too finicky here and it's not a problem because the readers aren't going to crucify me for this one little thing? The former is undesirable mainly because there is then very little that separates the setting from some other random "system of caverns or whatever where strange cultures live beneath the surface." I feel like making it an endless or nearly-endless *functioning* basement is important. 

Or... is there a third option that I'm overlooking?

  I guess if I were reading a story like that, where people got their water and electricity through conventional outlets and pipes, my preferred solution would be for this to be part of the magic of the setting - maybe an enduring mystery that someone tried to get to the bottom of, maybe a bit of magic that can be exploited, but not just something that no one makes a remark about.

  I would like it to be something like ... someone digs into the side of the wall, to figure out where the pipe is coming in from, and finds only that it extends sideways through the earth. And then they try to keep going, to find the source of the water, and find that there's only more pipe, continuing on, in total defiance of conventional ideas about water pressure. Or something like that.

  But I don't know whether that sort of thing fits in with the story that you're trying to tell, or the world you're trying to build.

    No, I am totally down with the characters realizing that this is weird and wondering what is going on, and just... never being able to figure it out. 

    My worry is always that the reader will go "Ha ha, *now stop trying to weasel out of this and give us the explanation or you'll go to the worldbuilders' prison for badly-designed worlds*." 

    The fact that several people are saying, "No, that's alright," (and on /r/rational, nonetheless) is encouraging, however.

      I'd just make sure that this isn't one of the driving conflicts/mysteries of the setting. You don't want to make an inadvertent promise that you're going to explain it and then never deliver.

      My solution would be to have the protagonists come across someone (or someones) already wrapped up in searching for the source of the water/electricity, so that it's clear that this is sort of a sideshow.

        Complete with half a dozen cranks all with their own explanation that is even more ridiculous than the problem that they are trying to solve? >:]

        Thanks. That's a great idea.

      > worldbuilders' prison for badly-designed worlds.

      Oh man, there's a story, A number of aspiring writers wake up in a Jim Henson's Labyrinth-like world where nothing makes sense and everything seems to operate on some sort of nightmare logic. Eventually they discover that they've been dumped into the worldbuilders' prison for badly-designed worlds and have to try to escape.
      ```

  Solution: The water and electricity are generated from the bottom level.

  Since time runs increasingly faster as you go down, this isn't a problem; the total resources consumed from the bottom up follows a geometric progression, in terms of the resources consumed at the bottom level.

  Example: If time one level up is 9/10ths slower than at the current level, and the bottom level consumes 1 unit of resources, the total amount of resources consumed is [10 units.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+0+to+infinity+%289%2F10%29%5En)

  Yes, there are infinite levels, and yet there is a bottom level. But no matter how deep you go, you can never get there!

  Edit: I can spell gud.

    Hm. That goes nicely with the idea that I had of there being Something Really Important coming from down below, so that the local cultures consider "down" to be good and "up" to be bad, and our humble protagonist is considered to be the equivalent of a demon from out of Hell because of where she's coming from. 

    (I'm still debating whether this is going to mean that most of the friends that she makes, at least early on, are Basement World's version of demon-worshipers and diabolists)

  There is a third option. As you go deeper, the basement also scales down (magically). Leaks in the surface world could be rivers. Molecules in the surface world become waterfalls. The breadth of the house the basement is set in becomes miles, becomes hundreds of miles. I don't know if that fits with the feel you're going for, but I think it could solve the problem you're talking about. A falling stream of water, as it goes deeper, becomes a bigger quantity, but also slower, to the receiving frame of reference. The scaling effect cancels out the "event horizon" Zeno-esque effect of the water never reaching its destination.

  In synergy with the "down=good, bad=up" idea, this would equate our world's idea of resources bubbling up from the depths, and one should not dig too greedily, or too deep. Friends and relations going upstairs, possibly to seek their fortune, are never seen again, and when they return to their home level, everyone they know is dead, in the extreme case, at least. There would be a proportional effect in the reverse for going downstairs, of course, which might result in a stratifying effect. This setting is a very interesting idea. :3

  Sounds like Gaiman's *Neverwhere* crossed with *City of Angles*. I've read something with a similar kind of "time running at different rates at different levels", except it was inverted and people in the deeper and slower levels watch civilizations bloom and die above them, over and over again... (and no I'm not talking about Lockstep).

  Would totally read.

    Thanks! I'm actually feeling really good about this idea after getting some reactions (this post got upvoted 18 points? dangggg). 

    This might actually be a story that I could get around to writing in the near future. I'll let you know as I make progress on it, if you'd like.

    It also reminds me strongly of [Attica](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2332389.Attica).

    I have. I didn't think about the similarities there but... 

    Huh. Chronicles of Narnia blended with House of Leaves. 

    Yeah. I can get down with that neat encapsulation. 

    Thanks for pointing that out.

  Yes, some people have noticed that there's rather an anomaly.  The more agreeable ones were paid off, the rest were disposed of.  Depending on how long it's been there, the infrastructure may have been built to support it.  I'd say water is the bigger issue, and I'd mention that it taps multiple sources.

  Somehow all I can think about this is "But time slows down when you go down. You've got it backwards."

  maybe you could make it so that the house is a really futuristic house in the distant future and the first occupant was a evolutionary xenobiologist who lived among humans for a short time and was trying to replicate sentient species that already existed and put them in the same universe/ecosystem to see how they grew, evolved and adapted over time. Maybe you can think of some trick with temperature and of substitute biochemical mechanisms to make a near-equivalent of human anatomy and neurology on a smaller scale as well as control the speed at which things move on different levels?  Maybe have a portal at each level that converts things from other levels into larger or smaller equivalents of themselves down to the molecular level? It wouldn't change how fast or slow time moved, but it would look like it did when people traversed levels and contrasted how much history had happened on different levels.

  Of course, the creator of such a "universe" would probably have his research license taken away because of how unethical it all is.

    My first thought when I read this answer was "complexity penalty".  If it isn't going to drive the story, why add all this magic-driven extra machinery?

  First thought: How hard is it to traverse depthness levels? Is there an elevator system? Buy up really cheap computers and put your computers really deep, stringing network and power cables to your level, and put the people working on life-extension really deep and when they get older cycle them back shallower.

  Actually, depth-shifting seems like a good business oppertunity -- are there already businesses that offer this service?

  In either case, this would give rise to some truly _OP_ supercomputers, in terms of cost per power consumption -- and possiby a return to the mainframe/terminal form factor (or lean client / fat server paradigm, they're really the same thing just with a different scope of networkiness) -- just with all the mainframes at a really low level in the Basement.

  Would political and / or morally-dubious paramilitary organizations regulate who has access to elevators? Because the time dilation being a factor of physical depth, coupled with the magnitude of a force multiplier the time dilation is, seems eminently munchkinable. Who controlls the Elevators controlls the world, and all that.

  We'd also probably expect to see pirates / rogue vigilantes try to bypass the authority of the Elevator Police and cut through different Levels (the ratio of the groups would of course depend on the morality of the Elevator Police), and all sorts of cultural beliefs about Depth and the Elevators.

  (Not to mention that the *Inception* reference(s) virtually write themselves.)

    > First thought: How hard is it to traverse depthness levels? Is there an elevator system?

    No. Just stairs and vents and small tunnels in the walls. 

    > Actually, depth-shifting seems like a good business opportunity -- are there already businesses that offer this service?

    No. The outside world isn't aware of the Basement World at the beginning of the story. Our protagonist will quickly realize the implications of the dilation, however. 

    Oh. Or are you asking about cultures *within* the Basement World? Right now I think that they're intelligent rats. They had to build from scratch after becoming intelligent* and are probably working with steam power at this point. 

    The stairways are going to be *very* important, especially since I think that there are Bad Things (let's call them goblins for now) in the upper levels that they have to keep out. The goblins are much smarter than them (being originally human but experiencing the same intelligence-boost as the rats, if to a lesser degree) and the main reason that the rats haven't been utterly destroyed is that they can use the time dilation to their advantage. 

    With every floor that the goblins claim, however briefly, some of that edge is lost. The rats have tunnels that go through the walls, so they can afford to heavily barricade the stairways without losing their own mobility through the levels. 

    *This is a side effect of the environment, and rats taken out of the Basement World are just normal rats.
