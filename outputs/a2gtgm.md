  So Joon is going to be the mysterious mid-semester transfer student that you see in every high school anime. I do hope this upcoming school arc will be just as full of hijinks.
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    But will Joon-senpai notice how the tsundere catgirl princess *really* feels about him before it's too late?
    ```

    - u/HeartwarmingLies:
      ```
      Sadly the title of Actual Cannibal is already taken.
      ```

- u/WarningInsanityBelow:
  ```
  >“You said my flaws were beautiful, back when we first met,” I said.

  >“No,” said Valencia. “I said that it was beautiful to see you struggle against those flaws.” 

  I went back and checked because I remebered Joon's version, the line was this:

  > “I wasn’t talking about you,” said Val with a small laugh and a shake of her head. “Everything I see in you is beautiful, even the flaws. Perhaps not the flaws, but the way you work against them. It’s very appealing.”

  Strictly speaking Val said both versions. Val was also nomming a devil at the time, so the misspeaking - then correcting was likely intentional \**puts on tinfoil hat**.
  ```

  - u/Lugnut1206:
    ```
    "Working" against flaws and "struggling" are two different things that imply a different perspective on her part between now and then...

    But maybe I'm reading too much into that.
    ```

- u/jaen-ni-rin:
  ```
  I know it's kinda redundant given that there is supposed to be official art Soon™ and it's not all that great looking, but another princess (AC7's if anyone's curious) inspired me to doodle Amaryllis and it'd be a waste to let it languish in the drawer given there's precious little Worth the Candle fanart, so I just hope it doesn't burn your eyes — [https://imgur.com/a/6DlemvM](https://imgur.com/a/6DlemvM)

  &#x200B;

  Anyway, let's hope we're not getting another disaster so soon in the atheneum, though given Joon's track record in that regard that might be a tad too optimistic.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    >it's not all that great looking

    I beg to differ, it owns. Would you mind if we used this for the [wiki](https://worththecandle.wikia.com), at least until there's official art?
    ```

    - u/jaen-ni-rin:
      ```
      It's probably easier to appreciate something when you're not painfully aware of the disconnect between what you meant to draw and what your limited skills made you end up with P:

      But sure, feel free to use it if you like.

      EDIT: I can try to get you an actual scan instead of a photo if you wish, it'll look a bit cleaner
      ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        Sure.
        ```

        - u/jaen-ni-rin:

          There you go – [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GEZcfqVf-4c0yuhVau\_rq-AqLW\_jf3gQ/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GEZcfqVf-4c0yuhVau_rq-AqLW_jf3gQ/view)
          ```

  - u/hyphenomicon:
    ```
    Nice shading, she pops from the background for some reason I can't place, gives it a 3D feel. Maybe the hair? It's got a kind of R3 feel to its strands.
    ```

    - u/jaen-ni-rin:
      ```
      I would hazard a guess it's how the darker marker shades give way to thicker black outlines in shadows. It was only a half-conscious choice, but way they seem "heavy" makes it feel as if it pulls those parts back into the background.

      Also, I assume R3 is some kind of hair product? Not sure how that translates into how hair looks with it though.
      ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    Nice work! I always appreciate fan art. If anyone would like character descriptions, [here's a txt file](http://alexanderwales.com/character_desc.txt).
    ```

    - u/jaen-ni-rin:
      ```
      Thanks!

      I'll just take this occasion to thank you for writing WtC — there's precious few things I would say that make me keep at slogging through time and space to the untimely end, but getting to eventually learn how this story will have ended is certainly one of those. There's nothing quite like it.
      ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    My mental image of a 'default' Amaryllis has her frowning, or at least with a neutral expression. She does not seem like someone that would just randomly be smiling, not unless it serves a purpose. She is a utilitarian smiler, in other words.

  If you're wondering about ch 138, that's just Stats for Nerds II, compiling information for reference from the rest of the work. I'll be adding more to it in the next day or so - I ran out of time to get everything there that I wanted (a list of entads and a list of spells being the two most important).

  Also, thank you to [my patrons for their continued support.](https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales) (New goals will probably wait until I've delivered the worldbuilding doc.)

  [Progress spreadsheet is here,](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing) which will give ETA to next publish when I have it, and word count on what's been written so far.
  ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    These chapters were great. A week as a 'regular student' sounds like it's gonna be full of deeply hilarious hijinks (assuming he doesn't blow it all up immediately on accident!) and I love the entire idea, so I'm looking forward to it a LOT. I'm super hyped for the next set of chapters - I hope he actually gets to do a 'regular student' set of events for at least a while without it all blowing up.

    I hope the Bursar has his dried frog pills ready...

    This continues to be a great story and this last set of chapters was a refreshing interlude after some of the more harsh ones. The bit about Fel Seed discussed with the locus makes a TON of sense.
    ```

  - u/blast_ended_sqrt:
    ```
    Checking Stats for Nerds, there's actually fewer quests left than I thought there were - I wonder if we'll actually get through all of them before the (I assume) final clash against Uther (Fel Seed)?

    Great update!
    ```

  - u/JanusTheDoorman:
    ```
    I think I've told you this before after reading Metropolitan Man, but just wanted to say again that your work is amazing and I really appreciate you putting it out there!
    ```

  - u/alexshpilkin:
    ```
    The chapter numbers on AO³ and the spreadsheet is now out of sync, unfortunately, due to Stats for Nerds II counting as chapter 138 on one but not the other.
    ```

    - u/alexshpilkin:
      ```
      ... Aa-and now it isn’t, faster than I could finish editing my comment =)

      Although the average word count per chapter is now (arguably) wrong.
      ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    > If you're wondering about ch 138, that's just Stats for Nerds II, 

    Shouldn't there be a Dancing skill at zero somewhere? Or does he even get half of the companion's skill when he completely removed it from his skill tree?
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Canonically there are 266 skills, only 40 of which Juniper actually has at any given time. Juniper still gets the benefit of companion skills from Symbiosis, even if they're not one of his 40 selected skills, and his companions aren't limited to just 40 skills (though they also don't benefit from super-learning, just the benefits of Twinned Souls which artificially increase their skills).

      (I have the full list of 256 skills + Custom written down, in case anyone was wondering whether they were just numbers. Helps keep track.)
      ```

      - u/SkeevePlowse:
        ```
        Since Joon has canonically seen that list of skills (during his first jaunt into Essentialism, if I recall correctly), is there any possibility of us being able to see that full list of skills as well?

        &#x200B;

        If you felt like being extra-super-nice to us, I think we'd all also appreciate knowing what's excluded and the note the game layer provided.  \^\^  But obviously this is just idle, if rampant, curiosity, so don't feel bad about saying 'no' if you don't want to for whatever reason.
        ```

        - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
          ```
          It'll probably be released as part of the Apocrypha after the series is over, but if I put it out *now*, then it both locks me in (if I think that something is dumb and want to change it, or want to write a side story with more fully-hammered out stuff, or whatever) and it also produces a lot of fodder for non-fruitful discussion.

          The full list includes skills that Juniper could take, but has chosen not to, for whatever reason, and I find it mildly annoying when people make arguments about decisions without the full context, which a list of skills would necessarily not have.
          ```

          - u/SkeevePlowse:
            ```
            That all seems entirely fair, and getting to see it at all at some point feels like a win, so... thanks!
            ```

- u/SvalbardCaretaker:
  ```
  So Bethel has a secret about someone-not-Joon, that would make Joon happy. She read it out of subconscious clues like heartbeat, pupil dilation etc. During the height of a wedding ceremony, Mary turned around to look at Joon. 

  She decoded her future-self messages after all.
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    It sounds like she listened too and turned off the soul modification.
    ```

  - u/icesharkk:
    ```
    I agree. I think bethel knows that Mary undid her soul mods based on Mary's physical response to dancing with Joon.
    ```

  - u/eroticas:
    ```
    I think it's likely that she decoded her message and undid the modifications to her soul, but at the height of the wedding ceremony he was looking at her first. She might have just felt his eyes. Does it mean anything that he looked at her?
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Having just felt someones eyes is not a thing, not even on Aerb. And we know that Joon loves her already.
      ```

      - u/eroticas:
        ```
        Not literally, i mean catch his eyes staring through the corner of hers. I don't think it's obvious that Joon loves her.
        ```

        - u/Fresh_C:
          ```
          He said as much in narration in chapter 140. Though it was less concrete and more of a possible justification for his jealousy at the thought of her being with someone else. In contrast he stated that with Valencia he knew for a fact he didn't love her.

          So we can at least surmise that his feelings are somewhere between "just wanna bang" and "She's my soul mate".

          edit: ch 140, not 40
          ```

- u/Rorschach_Roadkill:
  ```
  Lovely peaceful little update, thank you. I enjoy these calms between storms so much. And Joon's talks with the Locus are great. He keeps trying to get her loyalty up and ends up accidentally therapying himself and it feels pretty healthy honestly.

  Grak appears to be actually in the process of healing for the first time and it's very heartwarming. Him and Solace being cuddle buddies is straight up cute. Hopefully he'll find stumble upon his own Jorge soon.

  Anyway, looking forward to seeing what fresh hell awaits us in Sound and Silence
  ```

- u/major_fox_pass:
  ```
  I really enjoyed this one, especially in the way that a higher CHA subtly helps Joon in social interactions without him realizing it.
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    I noticed this too! Watching him talk to the Locus, Grak, Amaryllis, and Bethel in this update was great, because he wasn't committing a dozen avoidable social mistakes with just his phrasing, like usual, but he definitely wasn't a master, he was still awkward as hell with Grak and hesitant to be forward with Amaryllis, but not so egregiously so. It actually felt like a single point in all social stats, instead of just getting social superpowers all of a sudden.
    ```

    - u/jaghataikhan:
      ```
      I'm starting to think that due to how ridiculously powerful the level 10/20 loyalty power ups are, focusing on CHA *may* have been one of the ways to max out party firepower the quickest
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure it's Behar Arthur did, or something similar bin whatever his version of the game layer was, he almost certainly maxed SOC stats while he was in the theatre troupe and then after they died he was unprepared to face the physical trials he was put to, which is why he got his ass handed to him until he met Vervain.
        ```

  ```
  Bethel being 'Advisor on Home Affairs'... *groan*

  # WtC Wiki Progress Report
  Since [my post last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9yc1dm/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_135137_holding_krinrael/ea1e93v), there's been a fair bit of progress on **[the new *Worth the Candle* wiki](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki)**.

  Summaries are complete for the **first six chapters** of the story: "[Taking the Fall](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Taking_the_Fall)", "[Thickenings](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Thickenings)", "[Solely Responsible](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Solely_Responsible)", "[Reaver](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Reaver)", "[Goraion](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Goraion)" and "[Cold Comfort](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Cold_Comfort)".

  The minor characters from "Goraion" ([Poulus Cambria](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Poulus_Cambria), [Becca](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Becca) and [Sly](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Sly)) have comprehensive write-ups. So too do [Nate](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Nate) and [Ricky](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Ricky), the two other kids from ten-year-old Juniper's and Arthur's D&D sessions. A start's been made on [Arthur Reimer](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Reimer)'s page, but it's slow going and we're still trying to formalise a way of doing these write-ups. There's placeholder pages for [Juniper Smith](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Juniper Smith) and [Amaryllis Penndraig](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Amaryllis_Penndraig), but there's so much to be written up for those that we've been putting off making a start. Pages for the game layer have yet to be completed, with the exception of a fairly comprehensive page for "[Achievement](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Achievement)" and a "[List of Skills](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Skills)".

  Other **miscellaneous completed pages** include "[Frongal](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Frongal)", "[Blackthorne](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Blackthorne)", "[Color Riot](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Color_Riot)", "[The Collection](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/The_Collection)", "[Obol](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Obol)" and "[God](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/God)". We've also made good starts on "[Athenaeum](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Athenaeum)", "[Risen Lands](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Risen_Lands)", "[XC-class soulcycle](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/XC-class_soulcycle)" and "[Earth](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Earth)".

  To make these pages possible, I've been compiling an assortment of **custom templates**. While the wiki software does include plenty of bits of convenient markup, there were a few things missing for our purposes. I've added a [scroll box](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Scroll_Box) which has been put to use with the new "[Reflist](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Reflist)" (for preventing long lists of references from bloating a page's length). There are now standardised templates for citing [extracts of the story](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Wtc), [extracts of *The Council of Arches*](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Tcoa), [Reddit comments](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Reddit) and [Discord comments](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Discord). The "[storylink](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Storylink)" template is used to link out to articles on a chapter from character's biographies and such. There's now [a template](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Gt) for marking text as quoting a game notification. For some reason [citation needed](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Cite) and [sic](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Sic) weren't a thing, but now they are. I decided to throw together a template for ["mentioned only"](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Mentioned) and for [linking to a main article on a subject from a section on that subject](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Main). The new [messagebox](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Messagebox) template has been used to make a [stub](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Stub) template, which is presumably (read: unfortunately) going to see a lot of use. [Linking to wikipedia articles](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:W) can now be done just with the article's name. Examples of all of these templates' use can be found on their respective pages.

  The pre-Aerb timeline of the story is kind of impenetrable, with Juniper's notes in chapter 105 being the best resource for organising it. We're looking into organising the story's flashbacks in chronological order - for now, we've pulled out all the relevant text and loaded into [one page](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Flashback/src) in chapter order, but we've got our work cut out for us untangling the chronology.

  In case you're wondering about the... *unusual* prioritisation on display here (Blackthornes? Nate? *Really?*), things so far have generally just been a case of doing pages as and when the opportunity to do so arises. This isn't about turning as many redlinks blue as possible, it's about making sure what's going up there is **reliable** and **comprehensive.** To do so, we need all the help we can get - **no experience necessary.** Got a favourite character, chapter, or creature? Do a ctrl-f on the story and start pulling out info for a new page. **Just head over to the wtc-wiki channel of the alexanderwales Discord server (linked at the end of the last chapter) to join the discussion!**
  ```

  - u/aeschenkarnos:
    ```
    The pre-Aerb timeline may have to stay fuzzy, given that Juniper is supposedly 18 and has more gaming experience than the average 30-year-old no-outside-lifer (and more psychological self-awareness than most folks *ever* get). Which is fine, he's obviously a partial self-insert and his prodigal gaming makes the story work well, but it would make construction of a timeline difficult.
    ```

    - u/PathologicalFire:
      ```
      He created the Ell around age ten, so if he was DMing at least once a week, every week since then, he might well have gotten through as many systems and campaigns as he did.
      ```

      - u/aeschenkarnos:
        ```
        All weekend every weekend, and a fair number of school nights too, and *maybe*. Like Tiger Woods played golf, or Tonya Harding skated. But in both of those cases, there was an adult driving them to do it at least as much as they were self-driven.

        Gaming is a team sport, too. And better gaming pretty much requires bad gaming as a pre-requisite. Ten-year-olds are munchkins, they burst into tears over failed rolls, etc etc. You have to crawl before you walk, unless you have one hell of a good coach.

        Also there's the literacy level to consider, and the sociological sophistication level.

        This isn't a critique of the story quality, it's a great story. All I'm saying is, Joon's gaming backlist is like HPMOR-Harry's reading backlist.
        ```

        - u/Iconochasm:
          ```
          To an extent.  When I was that age, I was in 5+ campaigns simultaneously, running half of them.  If some of my peers with a real work ethic had been as furiously into ttrpgs as I was, I can see them getting close enough to call Joon only a minor exaggeration.
          ```

        - u/nineran:
          ```
          For what it's worth, I had 10 year old Harry's reading backlist (and am now a boring adult and no kind of genius). It just requires **obsession**. And reading is a solo sport, though being able to talk about it with grown-ups helps.

          The  team sport aspect is a really good point. I know what kind of hours I spent on reading. I didn't know *anyone* else who did the same at that age.
          ```

    - u/The_Wadapan:
      ```
      It's not about working out exactly which day every event took place on, it's about being able to definitively state "flashback X takes place before flashback Y" for as many given pairs of flashbacks as possible. Tiff's arrival, Arthur's death, and many smaller details besides can be used to split up the forty-odd flashbacks into groups - I just don't want to make incorrect assumptions. It might be possible, using the dates given in chapter 105, to apply something more than a relative ordering, but that's not really a priority.

      Besides, Juniper ran sessions *twice weekly* from 2009 to 2017. I'm sure there's plenty of details that can be used to work out a more accurate figure, but just as a rough ballpark, that's between (52 * 2 * 7 = ) 728 (presuming he started in December 2009 and went to Aerb during January 2017) and (52 * 2 * 9 = ) 936 sessions (from January 2009 to December 2017). Dude's spent thousands of hours doing these campaigns, many of which we know only actually lasted a couple of sessions. Is this level of "prodigal gaming" for a ten-to-seventeen year old unusual? Sure is. Is it a timeline impossibility? Nah, I don't think so.
      ```

      - u/aeschenkarnos:
        ```
        Gaming is like a harvest, reaped from the seeds of cultural input. It'd be the next thing to impossible to just pump out game sessions over-and-over without material on which to base it. You have to read, watch movies (Joon *also* has extensive movie knowledge), participate in games run by others, participate in web forums like this one, etc etc. For every campaign, there's several hours of prep - even for very prep-light systems like Dungeon World, you still have *some* prep, even if it just consists of thinking about (say) a scene you want to run with "some evil king" confronting the PCs and in actual play that turns out to be the local duke one of the players created. Granted Joon could probably spend a lot of his classroom time daydreaming and not suffer much from grade reductions, but still.

        I suppose you could just repeatedly run pre-generated campaigns like Pathfinder APs, but that's a problem too - each one of those is going to be at least 200 hours of play. My own group just finished a Pathfinder AP that took 133 3-hour sessions to get through. Even at the cracking pace of high-school all-weekend gaming, that's still most of a year.

        And Joon and Arthur's group *weren't* "kick in the door, kill them all, loot the bodies, rez the hostages" murderhobos. They actually liked to role-play, develop relationships with NPCs, etc etc. That stuff (which is the real fun of gaming anyway) takes even more time.
        ```

        - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
          ```
          That's one of the breaks from reality that I found acceptable. I would consider it at the edge of plausibility, rather than strictly implausible, but understand it's one of those places where YMMV. Per the math as it's been laid out in the story, most campaigns were on the short side, low single digit months rather than years. Per the math as it's been established for play, that's ~8-24 sessions, which, again, is on the short side, depending on how long sessions actually are. Should be one short one mid-week, then a marathon session on Saturday of maybe 12 hours (noon to midnight), which is what we did when I was that age, so an average of maybe 8 hours each. Not all of that is actual play time, since some of it is conversation, argument, eating, breaks, etc., but it's hard to account for that. That would mean ~192 hours of play every three months or so. (In practice, lower during the school year, not during holidays, more during the summer but with fewer players.)

          I'd say maybe half of the stuff in WtC is taken from actual high school campaign notes, old posts from our forum, PbP campaigns I ran in high school, etc., with the rest being either made up explicitly for the work, or taken from campaigns I ran as an adult. Partly this is because I didn't jump ship from campaigns as quickly as Juniper is said to have. In some cases, campaigns were "split" for WtC (e.g. they're described as being different campaigns, but in the reality that they were taken from, they were just two extended different arcs within the same world).

          As far as inspiration? The campaign list notes a number of them; SCP, *The Atrocity Archives*, *Fine Structure*, Star Wars, Pratchett, etc., and there are more of them scattered through the entire work, none of which I think is *particularly* unreasonable. It's also noted that Juniper and Arthur watched movies specifically because Arthur thought that cultural literacy was the mark of a good citizen (which, again, is something that I actually did in high school).

          (Most of Juniper's emotions, reads on people, knowledge, etc. are taken from autobiography/e-mails/posts that I wrote when I was 13-18, so they're what I would consider *mostly* realistic depictions of what it was like to be that age for me, if not for others.)

          I generally consider Juniper at the edge of what's realistically plausible; he's an exaggerated version of how I was in high school, with many of the same forces shaping him.

            I didn't even think it was particularly a break from reality.  I know I did at least as much gaming (as a player, to be sure) between the ages of 11-18 as Joon did, and I played with a GM back then who was every bit as creative as Joon.

          I completely agree with you, you simply can't map Joon's references and experiences to a timeline that still has school and sleep. Even with those gone it would still raise my eyebrow.

          But there's not much way around it without Joon seeming to have created every idea independently (versus subsuning culture). In particular I think the amount of references he makes could be toned down especially quoting the actual scientific name but other than that it's an unavoidable affect of the protag
          ```

          - u/chris-goodwin:
            ```
            Joon didn't necessarily create every single idea, himself, out of whole cloth, but a lot of it had to have come about from ideas bounced back and forth between him and players during campaign setup and "session zero", and even more of it developing from things that happen in play.  

            I wasn't much of a GM, but I'm quite sure I did as much gaming as Joon did around the same ages, and I gamed with a GM at the time (one of my high school friends) who was every bit as creative and not much less prolific, quantity-wise.

  However, I do think Loyalty could be a two way street. The increases in the Locus' Loyalty this chapter felt like Joon was actually starting to understand what druidism and the locus are about.

    I hesitate to say that it's impossible, but it strikes me as impossible. Or at least very close to it. Too many entads have specifically mental or emotional effects, and we can't currently read input as naturally as we would have to for many of them (controlling vines, for example). Every entad would have to be specialized for unique input and gameplay.

    And I have a distinct feeling if a WtC game ever gets attempted, it would end up in a real-life Friendship is Optimal scenario just with 9000 hells rife with devils and demons, instead of cutesy ponies. Not quite sure which would be preferable to be honest.

    For the most part Dwarf Fortress is the closest thing in existence to the kind of game described in WtC.

    Try making a mod for DF?

    Alternatively and more interestingly if you want to try doing something from scratch...Try looking into Entity Component Systems.

    Also let's look at some random sentence in WtC.

    &#x200B;

    "A few seconds later, a variety of birds landed on the staff, and she tweeted at each of them in turn, causing them to fly off. "

    &#x200B;

    From this the game is going to need to understand birds of different varieties, a female (assumed human out of context), staffs, A model for communication. The sentence implies that there exist behaviors like flying, tweeting and landing on various entities. Something would have to be done with adjectives like "on" and "away" There is a need for a model for each of those as well as models for all the concepts they depend on.  At the end there is a bunch of entities that interact with each other through closely integrated systems to produce a state of the simulation. (And  how that state is displayed to the gamer is a completely separate problem) Over time as entities and systems are added or revised the world will be able to say more complex things.

    &#x200B;

    Unlike all those other guys I'm fully convinced you can make a great game based on WtC.

    All entad's have this pattern:

    an entad is an entity,  has activation conditions, an acceptable class of targets and changes the target(s) when activated. Sometimes, it has a duration or temporary effect.

    An example entad that fits this framework would be described as "a staff that when tweeted at causes itself to fly away" The more concepts are defined the richer the entad could be.

    If you want to have an entad that has effects on emotions or mental attributes you need to create a model of mind and emotion for it to affect. An entad can't affect anything you don't have a model of. the model doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to be good enough that the player can fill in the gaps with their imagination. (locus?)

  If a soul is like a specific type of component in which it is just a collection of data attached to an entity then spirits are like systems which determine how entities change over time. (and interact with each other).

  &#x200B;

  Many things that don't have souls should still be affected by spirits. Although the spirit wouldn't interact with the soul so the strings of spirits would have to be accessed through some other means. (June has only accessed spirits through their affects on his soul)

  &#x200B;

  The true name might be an instance of an entity and there might be other components that you can gain access to besides the soul through knowing the true name like a location component which doesn't seem to exist in the soul but can still be modified by teleportation based artifacts (and still mages). My guess is that the true name points to an instance of an entity. My guess is that everything in the world (all artifacts, objects, people, animals, groups, buildings, cities, and possibly civilizations ect. have true names although it's harder to find them for some as there might not always be a convenient reference to it in a component such as it is with the soul component. ( I wonder if there is an artifact that can find true names of anything.)

  &#x200B;

  Typically Systems can take an entity and add and remove components to it. 

  &#x200B;

  Magic systems/spirits in general might listen in for the existence of specific components. An exclusion zone could be created by creating a spirit/system that adds and removes those components as an entities location (component) shows they left and entered a zone. You could remove a spirit from the world and destroy the exclusion zone with all that that implies. Alternatively create a spirit or modify an existing spirit so that it ensures you have the necessary components to use the excluded magic. That way only you can break the exclusion zone in a more controlled manner ie that gives you a distinct advantage.

        You can't go back further than you can teleport, which puts a limit on it for them and even if you could it has to be impossible as otherwise there would not be a general attitude of death being hard to reverse on aerb. Most likely some part of the spirit leaves the body after you die and you can't revise something you don't have all the component parts to.

  Does that teleportation entad mean that Juniper can do the Mjollnir thing? Throw something, constantly teleport with its flight?

  Unrelated to the chapters.

  After the library arc ended, I have this theory about what the DM
  actually is. Tho it comes with some flaws too.

  The idea is the DM entity that Joon met in his soul trance after he
  maxed out his Essentialism (Chapter 78: The Sacrifice) is actually an entity
  just like Cypress (old Amaryllis on the doomed timeline), but instead
  communicating via book, the entity is communicating via soul link.

  Or speaking more formally: the DM is a simulation of a character
  (probably Joon) on another doomed timeline. Sending message to the
  past via their soul link.

  Or maybe with another wording: Joon following that DM's soul link is
  actually activating the doomed-timeline-simulation and creating that
  DM avatar.

  The Flaws:

  - The DM gift (the Earth Backpack) is hard to explain
  - The DM is actively nudging things here and there
  - If he's just simulation, why not just tell Joon directly?
  - They already met in the past (in the recording of Joon's consent of being
    transported)

  Okay, sorry, just wanna let this theory out from my head. I know it's
  flawed.  And seems unlikely. But after reading the Cypress chapter and
  start thinking about the "what if" scenario. The scenario where Joon
  was one that tasked with sending message to his past. The talks
  between Joon and the DM comes to my mind.

  June has all the tools needed to create his own memetic weapons and defenses. Hell, with spirit and existentialism combined he could create a contagious "ideology" meme with a backdoor such that it doesn't affect those who know about it. Taking over the world with mass scale mind control. Oh wait I guess June wouldn't do that. He might be able to make a meme that can cause fell seed to self destruct.

  Both Valencia and Bethel lack a soul but do they have a spirit? If not what is this thing that Bethel has that is not soul or spirit but has properties attributed to both in fantasy settings? Is there a skill that might give a clue? Is it really memorization or the mind? In which case social skills would be necessary to manipulate it.
