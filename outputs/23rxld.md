  ```
  The bits in chapter 16 where the Mars-exploring astronaut blithely lays out a series of methods for weaponizing the mass effect in novel ways to the surprise and mild horror of the Asari diplomat was _perfect_.

    "Our bored college students are more creative than the sum of the military engineers of the rest of the known galaxy"

  ```
  People say this is a "humanity fuck yeah" story - I think that's just what happens when you put realistic humanity into the setting of an unrealistic space opera.

  [edit] I think a possible valuable RL good-idea takeaway from this story is "make first contact with astronauts; they're most plausibly sympathetic."
