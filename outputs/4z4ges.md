    Also human-level AI that hasn't yet reached superintelligence?

    But I know you can't really write stories otherwise, so this one was still quite enjoyable.

  Great first chapter! I'm hooked and can't wait to read what comes next. 

  Loved your seamless explanations of the 'technical' details.

  And I give you bonus points for your nod to Excession.

      OCP = Out of Context Problem which, I think, was originally from Excession.

  I enjoyed it tremendously.  Do you have a non-binding estimated schedule for continuing it?

    Im aiming to update about once a week, on either Sunday or Monday.

  This is really interesting. I'm guessing this is at least partially inspired by Tabby's star.
  ```

  - u/Sagebrysh:
    ```
    I haven't actually read that, so no.
    ```

      ```
      Tabby's star isn't a story, it's a real thing.
