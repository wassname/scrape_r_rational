  The invisible crossbow almost certainly refers to Archer but I would laugh my ass off if it turned out Cat really did have one and it turned out to be a pivotal macguffin for the entire plan.

    ```
    Yeah, the trick here is most likely that while the Skien is fighting them he isn't actively manipulating the labyrinth.

    Thief is inside the threefold reflection and unaccounted for. Archer is somewhere, probably geting let in via the staff entrance by Thief right now. 

    The many complex plans with a convergent end point was a trap to get the Skien to notice the convergent end point and stop trying to channel surf all the complex plans so he wouldn't notice that one plan started late and DIDN'T converge on confronting him in a boss battle.
    ```

  ```
  The Chain of Hunger must have been pulling their punches with Procer all this while. Unless threats like these are the reason top tier  heroes like Saint and the Pilgrim exist in the first place
  ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    My guess is a group of important somebodies has been treating the Chain the same way Black and the Calamities have been treating the Named Good in Callow. The Skein is undead and *old*, because the Horned Lords are today a thing of fading legends.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    When Horned Lords are killed its probably at the end of a big quest by a party of 5 Heroes with lots of prep, knowledge of its weaknesses, and narrative weight.

    Catherine is just dropping into this ones lair 15 minutes after finding out about it without a plan and knowing virtually nothing about her enemy.
    ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      ... and most horned lords aren't named
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Its quite possible that every one of them is Named, given how rare they are.
        ```

- u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
  ```
  So the Skein's plan is just... Know what's going on then drop down from the ceiling?
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Between the floor actually being a pit filled with bones, dramatically positioned artifact and all the foreshadowing about Horned Lords, the boss fight was an inevitable outcome of all plans leading to the same room. I'm halfway expecting Catherine to trick Skein into punching her onto a wheel and start to dodge and run on it, simultaneously shuffling the palaces. Maybe she'll even accidentally portal-cut Malicia stepping over a doorstep.

  ```
  How do you stop a Seer from weaving plots that interfere with your assassination scheme? By getting into an extended brawl with it.

  I'll note that the Skein said the options were sending Malicia to ~~Cat's party (Cat, Masego,~~ Vivienne, ~~Akua)~~ or to Hakram. Indrani is unaccounted for. She probably has no orders or plan at all (not that she would follow them anyway) but she'll happen onto Malicia and go "don't mind if I do". The undefeated Fuck-The-Augur style of the East, designed by the Dread Empress and now used against her.

  On a completely unrelated note, [Akua as a helpful fairy makes too much sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seKaU-qQuts).

  EDIT: re-reading this, the Skein never mentions leading Malicia to Catherine. He says "The Empress escapes, yet dies to a blade of stolen moonlight." The only person with such a blade is Vivienne, who just acquired it from Spellblade. So Thief is actually gone to do her things, not just hiding. And the Skein doesn't seem to consider Catherine escaping his trap to be a serious proposition.

  For some reason I am convinced that the final one of these will not be "Cat's plan", but rather "Malicia's plan".

      Just Archer getting drunk and punching out an undead dragon.

      And somehow solving all the problems by doing so.

    Most likely the Horned Lords are super rare
    ```

    - u/TideofKhatanga:
      ```
      I vaguely remember a chapter stating that ratlings were mostly just that. Ancient Ones were mean stuff but only seen during large attacks and only in limited numbers. Horned Lords were basically never seen and when they were, it was the right time to shit your pants.
      ```

      - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
        ```
        Didn't they have no idea that horned lords existed until Akua filled them in?
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          The principate does:

          “The Lycaonese woman crept softly to Klaus Papenheim’s tent, where a single candle still burned. Twenty years, she’d fought for the prince. She’d followed him unflinchingly when he’d charged two hundred cataphracts into the meat of a ratling army of thousands, backwhen the Longtooth Lord had tried to breach the walls of Hannoven.”

          They’re able to fight off these ratling lords with soldiers, when two of the strongest named coming out praes in recent times have difficulty even handling a shadow of one? Like, they should be looking at all the armies of orcs, and saying “thank heavens its not the ratlings.”
          ```

          - u/turtleswamp:
            ```
            First correction:

            Soldiers, siege engines, a wall, and heroes. Not just soldiers.

            They Lycaonese have a fortified position which they defend (rather than wandering into their lair and tryign to stab them), and a strategy of containment that combined with the chain of hunger's willingness to eat each other likely serves to reduce the frequency of large powerful ratings like Horned lords. Also dealing with big single threats like a Horned Lord is something heroes are particularly good at where villains tend not to be.

            Similarly Black is attacking the parts that aren't defended by the huge array of static defenses that keep the chain of hunger at bey so of coarse he isn't having as hard a time as the Longtooth Lord did. 

            Second correction:

            Soldiers fight in armies to exploit force multipliers. Fighting an army is an entirely different game than fighting a band of Named.   If Cat had the 15th with her the Skien would be facing very different tactics. (I mean Cat could have just tossed goblin fire into the room than held the doorway Spartan style for example)

            Third Correction:

            "happened once in living memory" is not even close to "all the time", Hailie's Comet has a period of 70-ish years so the last time it was visible was within living memory but it's still considered a "once in a lifetime" sight, not something that happens "all the time". The last time a Horned Lord showed up being say 20 years ago doesn't mean it wasn't a hundred years after the one before that, or that there haven't been spans of more than a century between some and only a couple decades between others.
            ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              Did you not read the chapter I literally godsamn quoted at you? They didn’t hide behind the wall, he charged into the army of ratlings, and the horned lord, with his own army. Names were not involved; we know Klaus disdains them, and if he had to rely on them for crises he’s practical enough that he’d be singing a different tune.

              I’m talking about Black vs Klaus in the mountains. Not black’s sack prover plan, although that has other issues. 

              Part 2: cat has demonstrated a level of power that makes armies laughable as a threat to her. She was literally only stopped from soloing the proceran invasion force by opposing named; the guide tries to say that soldiers are super able to kill them, but much like the claim “heroes are OP” it only happens offscreen.

              If callow can be said to fight off invasions alll the time ( and it has in story) despite often spending far longer than that between attempts, then it’s entirely fair to refer to the lords attacking the principate the same way.

              E: adding on to part 1, names and mages are super rare in the principate, and in addition to klaus' statements about not relying on named, we know that he didn't need any to take on the horned lord. His force was 200 heavy cavalry when he fought horned lord + ratling army.
              ```

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            It's not really clear if that's a Horned Lord or just a regular big commanding ratling with a fancy title.
            ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              In addition to it literally being called lord, we have the following quote that establishes it as something different:

              “She’d followed him unflinchingly when he’d charged two hundred cataphracts into the meat of a ratling army of thousands,  backwhen the Longtooth Lord had tried to breach the walls of Hannoven. She’d pulled him out of the mouth of an Ancient One when the tower-sized monstrous rat had been about to bite clean through his plate, the year after.” 

              The procerans under Klaus aren’t the type to name ancient ones, and they don’t seem to be able to name themselves until they hit horned lord.
              ```

              - u/melmonella:
                ```
                >they don’t seem to be able to name themselves until they hit horned lord

                Where do you get this from?
                ```

                - u/None:
                  ```
                  Because they can't talk until then?


                  “Wolofite records agree with the Lord Warlock,” she said. “There are scrolls dating back to Triumphant’s campaign in the region that speak of a time in the life of their kind called the ‘metamorphosis’, where ratlings will transition from bipedal beings of observed sapience into the animalistic large creatures called the Ancient Ones. The few of those beings that manage to consume enough quickly enough while in that state are speculated to undergo a second metamorphosis into the elusive Horned Lords of lore.”

                  “Those Horned Lords,” Vivienne said. “Back on two feet, about sixty feet high, antler-like pairs spouting from the head, capable of human speech?”


                  Unless it named itself as a ratling, and they remembered that when it hit ancient one, *and* called it that? That seems like a huge stretch to me, especially since she's callign it that in a monologue years later, but doesn't have any name for the ancient ratling in the narration.
                  ```

          - u/TideofKhatanga:
            ```
            >two of the strongest named coming out praes in recent times have difficulty even handling a shadow of one

            The Skein is anything but weak though. It is a shadow of what it once was, but "what it once was" is a demigod. Save for Edward VII (who's likely there because the Dead King was feeling pissy), every revenant we've known by Name or backstory was an A-lister. I strongly doubt that the average Horned Lord is able to casually *eat* a magical dimension created by a Fae Queen.
            ```

        - u/TideofKhatanga:
          ```
          The chapter I remember was most likely from Black or Cordelia's point of view. I don't think Cat has dealt with the topic of the Chain of Hunger before this arc.
          ```

  - u/haiku_fornification:
    ```
    The situations are quite different.

    The ratlings might be powerful but they're a known quantity. A soldier fighting against them will know exactly what to expect because there's a history of doing it going back to before the Principate.

    Meanwhile, the Legions are exactly the opposite. In the assault on the Vales they: redirected a mountain lake and peppered the crusade with goblinfire and munitions, dropped a mountain on the northern pass and used a dragon twice. 

    It's a different type of war as they're fighting against an intelligent opponent, they're not defending from a wall and their army is primarily composed of levies and mercenaries - not professionals.
    ```

- u/best_cat:
  ```
  I'm still going back to a passage from Chapter 37:

  > I exerted my will and tugged at Akua’s leash, gently. There was resistance. I tugged a second time, and when I did not feel her moving towards me I rolled my eyes and simply dragged her here. The shade poured out of the wall about thirty heartbeats later and only then did I loosen my grip. Diabolist was grimacing.
  >
  >“That,” she said, “was exceedingly unpleasant. And I barely had time to bid my farewells.”

  We know that Akua was off chatting with some unspecified person.  This makes me think she has an as-of-yet unresolved scheme.

  And now, we've learned that the Woe's "Murder & Arson" plan started after Akua was off doing whatever she's doing.  And the Woe are almost certain to leave Keter once they've finished their murders and arsons.

  I'm looking forward to seeing how that turns into a twist

  Drown is bolded... Does Cat have a new aspect?

    Bolded, but not captialized; emphasis, not aspect.

- u/AurelianoTampa:

  Random thoughts:

  Curious about the bones. Undead don't (need to) eat, right? So the Skein either retained his hunger after death/Revanancy, or he does it by habit, or all those bones were already there. Considering Edward VII said that the Skein replaced the Bloody Sword, and only Ed and Thief of Stars have been in place for more than 100 years, the Skein must eat a LOT of things to get bones 70 feet deep through his boss chamber. 

  Also, pretty irrelevant, but I now am nicknaming Edward VII as "Ed the Undying" in my mind. As he's, y'know, undead. And an Ed. Anyone else play Kingdom of Loathing?

  Finally, gosh darn it, I'm really liking Ubua lately. Her sass was on point in this chapter, enough so that it even caught Cat flat-footed. Or maybe it didn't, and Cat's purposely playing the straight man and holding herself back from bantering, as she knows leaning into it will bring them closer? Either way, Ubua the banter fairy is a lot of fun to read.
