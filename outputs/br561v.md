  Someone's been reading Fred Clark!

  I liked how various themes of the chapter all sort of tie together. Good stuff.

  Hmm...I wouldn't have said that "kill them all, God will know his own" was in character for the Colonel's faith, but, everyone's an individual.

    Maybe the the colonel was [Catholic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caedite_eos._Novit_enim_Dominus_qui_sunt_eius)?

      No, it was pretty clear that he belongs to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

      >The Doctrine and Covenants say that the righteous on earth will be caught up to meet him, and his coming will be preceded by fires, floods, hurricanes- we’ve certainly seen enough of both of those signs, even if the ‘Righteous’ seem a bit randomly selected. Half the Church, but half of everyone else too. Not my place to question. But the… things left in their place don’t fit in at all. And there’s been no great sign, and no angels announcing Christ’s return, so it’s hard to say that this fits the *Mormon* interpretation of a Second Coming.

        Whoops, I misread that section. You're right!
