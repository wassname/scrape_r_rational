  Hey everyone, welcome back, and sorry for the cliffhanger! Also sorry for the slightly late chapter: those of you caught up on HPMOR can probably guess what distracted me.

  So, one of the readers brought up some good questions about pokeball functionality and the hoothoot's death in his review, and I wanted to share some edits and clarification here:

  Even if Red had registered his hoothoot with his pokedex, he can't just catch another pokemon and overwrite its data with the hoothoot's: pokemon don't become "energy" per se. They are basically atomized and compressed into a mass of what looks like energy, much like the light of the Star Trek transporters. The actual pokemon that was captured needs to be the one used, or else a pokemon that's almost literally a copy of it down to the atomic level, or else risk major complications. Just think of the gut bacteria and antibodies that need to be recreated. It's theoretically possible, but so difficult that it's rarely attempted and has never been successful.

  Pokeballs are so arbitrarily powerful that the temptation to include more features and failsafes and capabilities than those included in the games/anime, like wireless data backup and automatic registry, have to be resisted. Since I need to draw the line of how powerful they are somewhere, I'm trying to stick to the games' capabilities as much as possible, and even come up with various miscellaneous restrictions (battery life, mass limits, "lock on" requirement) to explain why people in the games and anime don't, for example, fly over wild pokemon dropping pokeballs on them until they're caught.

  Otherwise, taken at face value with how they *seem* to work, the munchkinry would be so powerful and so obvious that the only explanation for why people in the games and anime don't use them that way and are still smart enough to tie their shoelaces in the morning is that pokeballs *can't* be used that way, and it's just up to our imagination, or in this case mine, to come up with reasons why.

  Hope that makes sense, and if anyone has new questions or objections to note, I'm really interested in hearing them, as always!

    But can it distract you-know-who?

      I'm pretty sure he could explain why kids like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, it just adds nothing to his utility function.

  So Blue got a Shiftry. At the loss of his Caterpie and Beedrill. I don't think it was worth it, especially considering how much that 'mon's gonna be hating him for dismembering it.

  The part with Red and Leaf was interesting, as was the differences of pokemon between regions - even the same species can have differences it seems, just like reality! I also liked how Leaf gave the Pichu to Red, and apologized about his dead Hoothoot.

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Yeah, that's definitely going to be an upward climb for him.

    Not to mention slaughtering it's entire tribe O_O. I don't think, say, a dog, would ever forget that sort of thing. Luckily for Blue it seems the pokeballs do some kind automatic obedience training to the pokemon.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Yep, but it doesn't actually remove memories: just adds new ones that (usually) help with obedience and forming a bond.
      ```

- u/E-o_o-3:
  ```
  Huh, I was pretty sure they were overpowered and would have to escape somehow rather than fight, given the previous chapter's very scary description of how dangerous even the single Shiftry was! I guess Shiftry do not account for allies hidden in pokeballs :D

  As always, your writing gets better and better with each chapter. Really good tension! I like the relative lack of plot armor preventing things from dying, it will make future fights more intense.

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thanks a lot :)  I've been definitely trying to improve, and it's good to know that I am a bit.

  I liked the fight scene. It did a good job of keeping up the tension. I didn't realize this before, but how does Squirtle expel so much water? Does it store compressed water somewhere? Do its attacks in this story use up less water than in the games/anime? It makes more sense for a Blastoise, which is large enough to hold a lot of compressed water, but not really for a Squirtle. Even absorbing water through the skin shouldn't give it access to that much - google tells me that at 20 degrees Celsius you can't get more than 15 mL per cubic meter.

  Since the names Volta, Faraday, etc. exist, does that mean this pokemon world is a post-apocalyptic version of ours? Or is that just a reference. I'm looking forward to finding out.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Squirtle stores compressed water, yes: it allows it to hold more than what its size would normally appear to, but not nearly as much as the anime, where it seems to be infinite.

    As for the names, their world has many of the same major figures in history, particularly science. It was a decision I made early on to allow Red to make references to scientific discoveries and research that allows the readers to still look it up and research it in more depth :)

  Great chapter!

  Typo?

    Fixed, thanks!

  This reference was perfect, it's something completely in-character for Blue and didn't break my immersion at all, good on you Daystar.

    Thanks, glad you liked it :)

  Hi!

  I just stumbled upon this recently. I was looking for something to fill the void that HPMOR will be leaving. I really like that you've picked Pok√©mon to do a rationalist version of :D

  As others have mentioned, your writing (and my enjoyment of the story) has steadily improved as you've written more. Perhaps I'll give critiques at a later time, but for now, please take this message to *keep on writing this story*! I'm very much immersed in this world you've adapted, the characters you've developed, and there's so much possibility! I'm very much interested in seeing where you take the story from here. 

  And above all else, thank you :)
