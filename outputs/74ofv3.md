## [RST][WIP] Yet, There Are Dandelions - A solvable mystery serial in a science fantasy setting

### Post:

Hello! I started this web serial recently, and a friend of mine suggested it might be received well here. Like the title says, it's a murder mystery story that I'm writing with reader solvability as the highest concern, as a kind of puzzle. To be honest, I wasn't familiar with rational fic's as a discrete thing until about a month ago, but it seems it fit pretty well - the main characters are all intended to be relatively rational actors working towards particular goals, and the setting is intended to follow a discrete set of rules that also factor into the mystery, with a relatively big emphasis on how seemingly supernatural phenomena can be perceived differently depending on who's looking at it. 

Anyway, I don't want to say too much. [Here's the start if that sounds interesting to you.](https://yettherearedandelions.wordpress.com/2017/08/08/prologue-unwanted-guests/) If anyone decides to try it out, let me know what you think.

    Pfft, not exactly the way to make a good impression on my part, I guess.

  Ooh, I'm intrigued. Count me interested, and keep the subreddit updated as chapters release, please :)

  It sounds interesting, but the text is gray on dark gray.  Would you consider switching to a higher-contrast option?

  I'll personally give it a shot still, but low-contrast text is difficult to read.  There are people who would take one look and close the tab.

    I'll turn up the contrast. My eyes are a bit weird, so it's hard for me to tell this kind of thing.

    e: Better?

      Your monitor is probably also not calibrated. Use tools for this sort of thing, not intuition and random senses/hardware.

  Feel free to be blunt with any impressions! Because the nature of the story as one where even the very minor details are important, I've ended up rewriting the early parts several times as I've tried to strike a good balance between being entertaining enough to hook and conveying all the important information, while still coming across as organic. It's at the point where it's tough for me to read objectively, so I'm not above going back to parts just yet if it fails to be intriguing on one level or another.
