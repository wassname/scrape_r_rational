  Huh. Looking back, I guess I wasn't supposed to be cheering when Saruman was monologuing about his industrial revolution. I mean,
  > The old world will burn in the fires of industry. Forests will fall. A new order will rise.

  Yeah, go Team Enlightenment!!

      Thanks. Before I start reading that, do you know if it's finished?

        No, it's not finished. Still worth reading though, since it's covered most of the War of the Ring.

      Welp.  I'm going to have to go find the discussion thread for that.

      And whoever "Central" is, *It's clearly the bad guy here*.  Nothing that talks frankly about optimizing world-lines is *ever* the good guy.

        Central is an AI battlecomputer from "The General", a series of books by David Drake about rebuilding civilization after it collapses. I recommend it.

          > Central is an AI battlecomputer

          Ah, so *that's* why I'm holding a shotgun.
          ```

            ```
            Actually, Central *is* the good guy...or, at least, isn't a bad guy.  It helps to organize and run military campaigns that cause a lot of bloodshed and it convinces the protagonist to do some things he doesn't want to do (and to *not* do some things that he really wants to do), but it plays straight throughout:  it gives people the information and lets them make their choice.  

            Of course, you could make a case that it's lying throughout and that all of its evidence is stacked in order to force people to choose the option it wants, but the result does actually seem better than what was there before it started.
            ```
