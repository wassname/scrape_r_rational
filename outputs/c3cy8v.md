  This is pretty good, if really angsty. The pacing suffers at times, especially when the main character is not in immediate crisis, but for the most part this is a captivating read.

  No knowledge of the setting was necessary when starting from book 1 for me. (I tried reading the original books after the first 2-3 books of this fic, but couldn't really get into it)

    Yeah, I think my pacing sometimes suffers from the fact that all of my beta readers are selected for being unnaturally fast readers, and/or enjoying hanging out with the characters while they do mundane stuff just as much as I do, and thus have very little incentive to tell me to cut it down ;P
