## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  A very simple one, because I have a strong feeling it can be utterly broken but can't come up with an idea on spot.

  You can shapeshift into anything that exists on Earth, as long as your mass stays the same (down to, say, a milligram) compared to the one you currently possess.

  You retain your consciousness and ability to shapeshift, but everything else depends on what exactly you turn yourself into (a brick can't move on its own neither does it have any sensory organs, for example). 

  You are not required to know the working details of the thing you transform into: if you try to shapeshift into a human, you'd become a random human with precisely the same weight you currently possess. When transforming, you can use only one word in order to describe the result; you can become a "human", but not, say, a "human with the knowledge of a certain password." (Your knowledge stays the same anyway, the change doesn't affect memory and cognitive patterns.)

  If you attempt to become a liquid or a gas (or plasma; anything non-solid, basically), you won't transform at all. You don't know what becoming liquid or a gas in during the shapeshift would do to you, but you suspect you'd die.

  Only stuff firmly attached to you is counted towards your weight. If you transform into a small tree, and then someone breaks your branch, the weight of the branch is no longer yours.

  This ability has a four minutes (passing on the surface of Earth) cooldown.

  How would you use this power?

    ```
    Can I turn into multiple independent things, if I become morbidly obese and then turn into, say, a rockband does my conscience spread over 4 to 5 different bodies?

    If so, repeating that trick and turning yourself into a literal one man army seems like it would be a good start.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      It sounds like a cool idea. Yeah, it should work. Very nice, thank you. 

      Btw, do you have any ideas about gaining weight other than eating as a human? I'm a bit stuck here, but maybe there's a more efficient way?
      ```

      - u/kraryal:

        Sneak into your local food factory, turn into one of the anaerobic microbes, they can grow faster and eat the local supply of sugar. 

        Go to a lake and turn into one of those "grow in water" dinosaur toys, 6x volume in two to three days, turn back, do it again...
        ```

        - u/NTaya:
          ```
          > 6x volume in two to three days

          I don't think it gains much weight, it's mostly just volume. But yeah, an idea with microbes is nice, I'll think into it.

          Thanks!
          ```

          - u/CreationBlues:
            ```
            all that volume is water. If water trapped in the dinosaur counts towards the weight, then it'd be pretty efficient. Or they could do a hydrogel
            ```

        ~~If done properly you can gain weight as a human very fast using the keyword "hungry" over and over. Just eat a burger, use hungry to empty your stomach and then rinse and repeat until you have gained the desired mass.

        On average random transformations should have your stomach partially full as well, so repeatedly transforming into any large size animal and eating as much as you can in between each transformation should still allow you to gain weight pretty fast.~~

        Just read you farther down explicley prohibiting this by saying you need to digest the food first. You could still gain weight fairly fast by just skipping pooping or peeing, but that wouldn't really help you grow that fast.
        ```

      - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
        ```
        Drinking two litres of water and then transforming into someone naturally two kilos heavier on cool down gets you half a kilo on average per minute per body, assuming that you cycle between bodies weighing 40 to 80 kg that gives a doubling time of 80 minutes. This means that 2 days of uninterrupted chugging water would give you 68 billion bodies, obviously logistical complications would arise before you get that high.

    ```
    Word: "assassin"

    Shapeshift from a tall, fat nerd into a medium-sized person armed to the teeth. Kill the target. If I can escape the immediate environment, word:female. Now the security chasing me leaves me because the assassin was a medium-sized man. Move a bit. Word: self.

    If caught, let myself be imprisoned. Then, word:spaghetti. Slip through the bars. Word:guard. Make my way out. Word:female. Escape the vicinity. Word:self. Collect payment.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      Not sure how spaghetti would slip through the bars, but generally the idea of becoming an untraceable assassin is rather cool. Thanks.

    I would try transforming into a computer and seeing if I can augment my intelligence that way. If you can partially shapeshift, become a cyborg.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      No, you can't partially shapeshift.

       I think the result of an experiment with a computer would be a conclusion that your consciousness is supported by magic and has nothing to do with your body, unfortunately.

    Publicize your power, become an actor, become a celebrity and get stinking rich with wide influence, sure people might not trust you with an official position but it's still pretty good. Be a rescue worker or something on the side for good reputation. You'll be able to get pretty much anything you want for as long as civilization lasts and be in a position to help it continue a bit longer. No need for anything fancy.

    Do the words have to be in english specifically? If not, create a custom language that has all nouns be single words. Now you can turn into anything.

    If you wanted to kill all life on earth, say antimatter.

    What happens if you lose mass while transformed? What happens if you gain mass? For example if I become a sponge. Or if I become a piece of metal that then oxidizes.

  You're part of the Resistance against an evil(well, greyish really) world-spanning organization in a world in which ideas have an effect on the world reality. Ideas affect reality in a way that is defined by the idea itself and it gathers power when people think of it. The evil organization already have a lot of content out there for people to think about and controls the media in a semi-autonomous way. Your ultimate goal is to topple the evil organization.

  You want to create an idea that becomes a huge topic(such that people talk/think about it) and that is designed such that you can use it to fight the organization. The evil organization controls the biggest media but isn't monitoring actively, so if you want to use the news etc. to spread the idea it needs to be innocent on the surface, else you need to think of another way of spreading it. 

  Idea descriptions should include how it helps you fight the evil organization, why people are thinking a lot about it, and why/how it spread.

    Make a meme about storming Area 51?
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:

      Would you be willing to provide a little more details?

      - u/IICVX:

        This is obviously a "ripped from the headlines" suggestion, but there's currently a meme popping up in a few subreddits about "raiding" Area 51 - you can see it occasionally on /r/all right now. 

        Most of the memes are about the loot people expect to gain, or nonsensical videogame-based advice about what to do during the raid. The success of the raid is treated as a foregone conclusion.

        The thing is, most people don't really *know* where Area 51 is. Because of that, the idea really boils down to "on <the date specified in the meme>, a successful assault on a government property will happen and the attackers will get away with high-tech government loot (and/or alien babes because this is the internet)"

        So yeah. Spread a meme like that - vague location, concrete date, concrete action - and make sure it catches in the public conscience. Then on the day of, execute your plot with the assurance that this idea has your back. 

        Heck, it might even work in reality - security forces might be so tied up with the nonsense about raiding Area 51, that another attack somewhere else slips through.

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Start spreading a meme about bureaucracy; spreading the idea that the bigger an organisation, the more inefficient it inevitably becomes, until it finally collapses under the weight of its own red tape.

    Merely discussing this Idea will eventually topple the evil organisation, or force it to split into smaller pieces (so, victory or partial victory)

    I mean just host a seance and ask the ghost to curse the organization's leadership into incompetence.

    Enough people believe in witchcraft that it should be pretty doable as long as you use the stupidest method you can think of.

    Edit: or pray the gray away.

    Anyway your big obstacle are probably the underground complexes this company has, full of people who are kept contained in an information-isolated environment to make them believe whatever it is the company's leaders think is most beneficial to themselves personally but also helps the company somewhat.

  You are the monarch of a feudal kingdom. You have the chance to forge an unbreakable alliance between your dynasty, and one species of animal. Within the bounds of your kingdom, this species will live alongside your people peacefully, and attempt to assist your people in their labours in any way they can. Your allied species will respect your authority in all matters.

  What is the best species to ally with?

  - u/Palmolive3x90g:
    ```
    Well the cheat answer here would be human since you kingdom would become immune to rebellion.

    Do the animals get any boost to their ability to think or communicate? I think some sort of pess animal like rats or bugs might be a good one since they would be hard to deal with back then.

    - u/Boron_the_Moron:

      The animals become smart enough to understand human language, and communicate with your people, though they cannot physically speak human language.

    Wolves.

    Note: I am assuming a feudal kingdom in medieval Europe or the sort of place commonly seen in western fantasy fiction which is often based on Europe.

    Wolves are common enough that I would expect them to be available in my kingdom, unlike, say, chimpanzees or elephants, and can be used for military/police purposes or for the sort of things we use dogs for generally, and making them my devout allies allows me to remove all the scary stuff that peasants hate about wolves.

    Eagles or hawks might also be good for spying because they can fly and see really well, but I consider wolves' sense of smell to be good enough for spying, and wolves probably are, on net, better for attack purposes.

- u/LazarusRises:

  Three scenarios:

  1. You become utterly, Siberian-level invincible for one second a day, exactly at noon of whatever time zone you're currently in.

  2. You have one full day of invincibility to use whenever you like. Using it permanently depletes your store. (This is 236 years of using one second a day as above.)

  3. You may become invincible whenever you want, but you must spend an equal amount of time feeling like you have a bad flu (weak, shivery, headache/stomachache, vomiting, etc.) Payment begins as soon as you stop your invincibility, and it automatically ends after 24 hours of use. You can't go invincible while paying it back.

  Your goal is to amass as much wealth as possible while avoiding capture.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    >exactly at noon of whatever time zone you're currently in.

    It saddens me that this is time zone-based rather than sun location-based. I wanted to go to space and orbit around the Earth such that the sun is always exactly in the middle of the sky all the time, and thus have permanent invincibility.

    Then again, since this power is strangely reliant on time zones, can you take over a country and take the concept of daylight savings up to 11 by setting the time to always be 12 noon? Would that make you permanently invincible within the borders of your country?

    What happens if you are physically on the boundary between two time zones? Would only the half of you in the timezone currently at 12 noon be invincible? (What happens if there's a border dispute so the borders of a country aren't well-defined?)

    > You may become invincible whenever you want,  but you must spend an equal amount of time feeling like you have a bad flu 

    Is there a minimum interval of time between invincibility uses?

    If not, toggling your invincibility on for 1 nanosecond every 100 nanoseconds should be pretty much indistinguishable from being permanently invincible, since 99 nanoseconds isn't enough time for most attacks to penetrate your skin before your invincibility toggles on and negates the force of the attack. And 1 nanosecond of a bad flu every 100 nanoseconds shouldn't really affect how you feel significantly, so the side effect is manageable.

    You just need to watch out for attacks that can hurt you in those 99 nanoseconds. Which attacks can do so depands on how your invincibility actually works. If you're being burned alive, do your cells just not absorb any heat from the flames? Does the invincibility rapidly disperse or delete any amount of heat above the harmful threshold? Do your cells that die just magically respawn in the same location in perfect health?
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      Now let's think about how to actually exploit invincibility.

      I'm thinking of hair. Grow your hair to extreme lengths and when you go invincible, you have an invincible mass of hair that you can use to cover arbitrary objects to make them invincible too.

      If hair doesn't count for invincibility (or falls off too easily), what about skin grafts? I think you could mass clone your skin cells fairly easily then graft them back onto yourself, such that you have as much loose skin flopping around as you want.

      Now you can make money legally by offering to be the heat shield for spacecraft. No more need for big and heavy heat shields that increase the fuel costs exponentially. Simply bring you on board as an astronaut, and whenever the spacecraft needs to re-enter the atmosphere you cover the front of the spacecraft with your body/hair/skin and turn on your invincibility. Depending on the mechanism behind your invincibility, you could re-enter the atmosphere without heating up at all, and also ensure the rocket behind you doesn't heat up either, yet still slow down to a safe velocity for landing.
      ```

    The third way is vastly superior compared to the two others, just have something that can knock you out when you feel bad. I don't think you have to worry so much about capturing, you can always just break out.

  Felicity caught the paper plane before it hit her this time. Aside from a few oddly blacked out suggestions, it was much the same as the last time.

  She had four options. Speed and reflexes, useful long-term and well-rounded. Mind control projectiles, hopefully capable of bypassing defenses that would survive the falling rocks—assuming they fell again. Retrying the last wish at a larger scale, with gas-filled boxes around the opponent and a trap-laden fortress to protect herself, doubling down on an idea that so far had worked. A magical decoy, to engage in combat on her behalf, with physical skills in excess of her own, and absorbs targeted wishes.

  Mind control had, fairly evidently, the highest potential by some measures, but it seemed the most risky, and if it was even partially ineffective it would leave her undefended, a gamble she didn't want to take. A decoy would also nullify some set of attacks, but if the power of a wish is limited, its complexity would mean she would lose most head-to-head battles, since after the decoy falls she would have no follow-up. The final choice was between landing the kill herself with enhanced speed, exposing herself to danger but allowing her flexibility, and an optimized static arrangement of traps and poisons to take out the target without her direct involvement.

  ---

  The moment Arlene teleported into the arena, her heroic golden armour shining in the sunlight, her mythic warrior reflexes had her running for the gap between the slanted steel walls rising from the ground to entrap her. The moment she knew she was too late she changed course, charging at the centre of the wall, to climb her way up to the hole in the roof.

  She reached the wall in a leap just as it ceased movement, and her hand, infused with unphysical strength, stabbed a grip into the smooth steel. Barely had she grasped its surface when a hundred rocks plummeted through the opening, cratering the unshadowed square in the middle of the room, other rocks pummelling against the sloped walls and wrenching her grip free.

  The moment the rocks stopped, the square, steel roof fell into place, plunging Arlene into darkness. She heard canisters exploding, hearing and feeling a strange gas take hold over the room. Arlene screwed shut her eyes and refused to breathe. If she were in any other body, she would have lost all hope, but she was sure her strength was purely magical in nature, and it took no special effort to engage. However many seconds she had, it would be enough.

  Tentatively opening her eyes, and relieved to find them unaffected, she regrabbed her handhold, and like an elite climber launched herself in one motion to the top, stabbing her fingers into the small gap between the walls and the roof. She made a handhold in the motion, but the force threw her free, and she had to leap back to and up the wall to secure herself again. Her chest was pounding for oxygen, but her body showed no trace as she pushed with all her force for the wall and roof to part. Neither gave enough—the walls were thick, and the roof heavy and littered from above with rocks.

  The warrior spirit is indomitable, but Arlene's was not. She gasped for breath, and the hallucinogens took her.

  ---

  Sorry for people expecting this earlier; most of the weekend wasn't a good time to write it and, to give some more out-of-character information, the other legal wishes would probably have left you dead, so I wanted to make sure the choice was what Felicity would really have gone with.

  Felicity has been observing the outside of the room that formed around her opponent from within her trapped fortress. She's noticed loud sounds from within the room, which have died down but not fallen silent, and she's starting to regret wishing for the room to be filled with hallucinogens instead of general anesthesia. She thinks she sees an entrance, but doesn't want to fight barehanded. What does she do?

  I'll give fairly free reign for what is in the trapped fortress that she can use, as long as people don't try to push too far. She knows the layout in it and can move around safely. The room filled with hallucinogens is a separate thing, and the rocks that fell with the roof were in addition to the previously fallen rocks, which are to one side.

  Note that only time travel that makes my job much harder is banned out-of-character; time travel that's less difficult to write may still be considered. Same for the library wish that got squashed.
  ```

  - u/siuwa:
    ```
    Alright, so we went with this one:

    >another is a fortress full of traps that can kill or disable the opponent and either poisonous gas or something that can disable the opponent, with herself and the cover at the center.

    I can't formulate a well-supported argument on why we should be winning without knowing what exact powers they have, but I suspect we could be winning with most other options.

    I suggest we wait outside the room and let the oxygen in the room out. If that's implausible then at least she would be wasting stamina doing whatever. Then we stab her with a spear when she breaks out.

    Edit: Also, may I borrow this idea and run a similar quest in SV?
    ```
