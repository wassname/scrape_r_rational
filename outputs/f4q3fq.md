## Pyrebound 12.3

### Post:

Another update, another oddball pyre to visit.

Pyrebound has been running for about a year now--I've been posting updates on r/rational about half that time.  It's a grim high fantasy serial with strong Mesopotamian influences.  If you'd like to read it from the beginning, the first chapter starts [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thank you!

  Damn, Darun is taking this hard. That sounded dangerously close to suicidal idolation there.

    Dang, four of them?  There are always formatting glitches for some reason, but that's a big set.  Thanks!
