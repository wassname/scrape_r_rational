## [WIP] Need some editing help for rational Supernatural

### Post:

I have been writing rational Supernatural and have just started writing out my final draft of my first arc. I should be finished with chapter 2 tonight and I was hoping to get some advice on the first two chapters and intro. I am not happy with some of my conversation formatting and could just use general recommendations on improved quality.

Let me know if you are interested, especially if you have some previous writing experience. Thanks!
