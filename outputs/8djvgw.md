## Sequel to Significant Digits?

### Post:

I just got around to reading Significant Digits, it was super great, but I kinda remember a sequel to it posted here I can't find now

  ```
  You may be thinking of Orders of Magnitude. It's not exactly a sequel though - and unfinished when I last encountered it.
  ```

  - u/redstonerodent:
    ```
    It's finished now.
    ```

  Maybe you're thinking of [Orders of Magnitude](http://www.2pih.com/table-of-contents/) even though it's a prequel to HPMOR and Significant Digits.
