## Inspired by Hpmor

### Post:

I recently started writing my own story for fun and wanted opinions from similar readers. But instead of posting this in the Hpmor subreddit and going off topic, I thought it might fit in better here.

[Harry Potter Jedi](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9824728/1/Harry-Potter-Jedi)

The tale of Harry Potter, if he grew up watching a little too much Star Wars. 

I'm not sure if this precisely qualifies as rationalist fiction, but I would appreciate any input people have. Although I know the writing is still rough, I'm trying to refine and touch up past chapters when I have time.

I also created /r/hpj/ for fun as well if anyone cares to go into more detail about the story.

Thanks

  The first time I tried I dropped it because I couldn't handle Harry's strange dialogue, but I'll try again.
