## [RT][FF]Pokemon the Map is not the Dungeon, a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Quest

### Post:

I was going to write a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon rational fic but ended up abandoning it .

I still had a lot of fun making worldbuilding for it so I decided to make a quest in the setting .

I don't have that munch experience writing or whith quests(apart from playing mfd ) but I'm going to try anyway and learn as munch as I can in the process.
