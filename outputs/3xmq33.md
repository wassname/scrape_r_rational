  I notice that Naruto didn't put any restrictions on how long Kurama could take control for this time.  Of course Kurama is an ancient and powerful being with his own goals and desires so probably nothing to worry about,  right /u/eaglejarl ?

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Exactly! It's nice to see someone who isn't all suspicious of poor Kurama.

    Too bad little orochi-kun did not have the foreknowledge of how his seal works, or I'm sure he might have approached the situation QUITE differently. A lesson in preparedness toward unknown elements, I'm sure.

        Do you *really* want to know?

        I'll give you this much of a hint -- consider who's involved:

        * A couple dozen Sound ANBU.  Fanatically loyal to Orochimaru.
        * Anko.  A high-A-rank ninja.  Smart, vicious, and absolutely *done* with anything that gets between her and getting her kids home...even if it means her death.
        * Orochimaru.  Rationalist.  Psychopath.  Crazy prepared. One of the best, if not *the* best ninja alive, he's more than a match for any non-Kage and can give most of the Kages a run for their money.
        * Kurama.  In terms of raw chakra he is by far the most powerful being alive.  A bijuu with literally billions of years experience at manipulating chakra and a thousand years of watching human history unfold, he's been trapped inside one person after another for almost that entire time...and now he's out.  With no restrictions on what he can and can't do, so long as he protects Team Anko.

    [](#s "Kurama is so good at spur of the moment planning. Why, he figured out how to deal with Orochimaru's reaction to Naruto's new form with barely any notice! Certainly, he acted with only the best of intentions in improving Naruto, and now he is saving the day yet again. Thanks, Kurama!")

    Further typos:

      > reserves were too low for

      Thank you, fixed.

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Mwahaha!!!

    I'm actually tempted to cut back to Konoha next time. The tears of rage would be delicious.

- u/MadScientist14159:
  ```
  Is a naru/hina crossbreed even genetically viable anymore?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Proooobably not? It's very unlikely to come up, though. 

    And, of course, the Fox could always do another change to make it work.
    ```

    - u/Nevereatcars:
      ```
      It's funny how everything the Fox does leaves Naruto more reliant on letting the Fox do more things in the future...

      Nah, probably nothing to worry about.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        > Nah, probably nothing to worry about.

        Nope. Nothing at all. Kurama is a *trustworthy* city-destroying Primordial demon from beyond space and time.

  ```
  >"I need your explicit permission to take control of the body," Kurama reminded him.

  *facepalm*

  goddammit Naruto, you're really smart today, aren't you?

    > goddammit Naruto, you're really smart today, aren't you?

    Not really. Well, at least, not forethoughtful.
    ```

  - u/Nevereatcars:
    ```
    It's so stupid, Orachimaru can't POSSIBLY have predicted it. Thus, it's the only option that can work!
    ```

- u/liamash3:
  ```
  > Naruto-kun's misshapn body was still wrapped around her back, his soft fire-red fur ticking the back of her neck.

  misshapen body was still

  Well, seems Orochimaru is rather eager to see just what's happened to Naruto. Wonder if he could even reproduce it, though?
