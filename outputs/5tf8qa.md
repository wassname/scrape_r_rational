## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  *Somewhere in the deserts of the Middle East, a tower rises, stretching up toward the heavens.*

  Every person on the planet who could speak can now speak the same language. It's not English or Hindi, Esperanto or Hebrew, no other earthly language. It's something different, and that's inconvenient because everything is currently written in those other languages!

  There's a mad dash to translate from these recently dead tongues. **At the same time, how do enterprising individuals use all this to their advantage?**

    There *is* a source of Rosetta stones - any text whose author is alive and can re-write it from memory with reasonable accuracy. For that matter, *any* text such that at least one person has memorized it and can reproduce it with reasonable accuracy.

     Linguists still remember how various languages relate to each other, even if they cannot understand any of them, so they would be able to cross-reference languages as we relearned them, to double-check meanings.

    Trickiest part is the subtle connotations. At least some of those will probably be lost forever, at least to within certainty
    ```

  - u/MonstrousBird:
    ```
    So do people still understand the written languages? Does anyone? Or is it more that we need a rosetta stone for the written sources? If the latter then you need to find people who have memorised scripts and see if their memories still include meaning enough to translate. If they don't then you're stuck with translating alphabetic scripts using names as the gateway...

      Talk to actors. You'd have easily enough English-speaking actors to reconstruct the text of all of Shakespeare, most Broadway musicals, other big plays (and the appropriate scripts would also be relatively easy to locate, since they'd be in use).

      Then you could reach out to the hardcore fans of a lot of media and cross-reference that with the transcripts and recordings. That gives you the ability to figure out how the writing is pronounced, too.

      Books are actually harder, since they're lengthier. You might find people who have memorised sections; poems are probably a good way in here, too. Certain versions of the Bible or other holy texts would be viable.

      And once you've got a basis (say the most common 1,000 words or so) you can start using dictionaries to fill in any gaps.

      I don't think it would take very long at all to have the knowledge required to translate 99% of all English texts. Maybe a few months, if people were able to organise effectively.

      The most crucial stuff could be translated immediately, but other things would have to wait for years or decades (probably never, for the vast majority of produced works).

      What would happen in the meantime would be interesting. I don't know enough about the pipeline that goes into providing services (especially power, the internet, and mobiles) to know whether it would even be possible to organise.

      They may be able to hold crash courses to teach people how to use computer interfaces and the like, but if anything went wrong you'd have a snowball's chance in hell of debugging the process.

  You have the ability to induce satisfaction in others, which works on acquaintances at arbitrary distances, and on everyone in line of sight, but does not give any feedback. You can only induce levels that can naturally occur in humans.

  Your goal is to kill/dominate/dive insane a supernaturally strong, durable and fast person who is aware of the possibility of such control, but not of you specifically.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The obvious use of this power is training people to like you and want to do things for you, which requires long exposure and a certain base amount of trust and positive feelings. Doing this successfully with someone who is aware of this power would be more difficult, but probably not impossible. Probably best used by a person who is already good at manipulation, who would craft a persona to appeal to the target without using this power at all at first, then gradually over a very long period build a relationship in such a way that the increasing satisfaction feels natural. Eventually, through careful manipulation and judicious use of power, it should be possible to make the target dependent on you, or at least highly inclined to listen to you.

    Alternatively, if there are any genuine physical threats to the target--kryptonite--you don't have to build a relationship with them if death is an acceptable alternative. Just get well enough acquainted to use the power long distance, have some sort of monitoring in place (easy if you can pretty much universally train people to want to do you favors), and start sending good feelings whenever they do something risky for them--like get near kryptonite. Encourage dangerous thrill-seeking, and escalate the satisfaction the more dangerous the situation. They'll probably get themselves killed eventually.

    For insanity--maybe repeat above scenario but instead of dangerous behavior reward pain, or something the target would consider evil or immoral, or maybe even something nonsensical. At the very least you can confuse them.

  You have the ability to see 5 minutes into a simulation of the future, that doesn't include the results of you seeing this simulation. Obviously you can pass messages back within the simulation from as far forward as you want so actually there's no real limit to how far you can see.                      
  How do you use this ability to make a perpetual motion machine? Assume post singularity levels of tech if necessary, but simpler more elegant designs are better.                           

  This power lets you precommit to doing computation then getting the results without having to actually expend any resources thus allowing you to blatantly violate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer's_principle. Given this violates thermodynamics it ought to allow free energy to be produced, but how does this work in practice?

  If your answer generalizes to getting free energy out of nearly any magic ability that lets you get information without expending the necessary thermodynamic work then that's even better.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    The idea of a perpetual motion machine is defined as:

    > A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely without an energy source.

    On the other hand there's Landauer's principle which dictates:

    > If an observer loses information about a physical system, the observer loses the ability to extract work from that system.

    It's subtle, but there's a difference between the two. Perpetual motion is about *gaining* energy without needing to do any work. Violation of Landauer's principle is almost the opposite where *no* energy is lost as we learn the results of a computation or work is done without using any energy. The first violation involves a machine operating without limit to do an action while the other violation involves the same action being performed without needing to turn on a machine in the first place.

    So while they both involve a violation of entropy, they do it in different ways which are not interchangeable. Hence, precognition can't be leveraged into perpetual motion machines.

    I could be wrong about my above speculations, but this chain of reasoning sounds right to me. Feel free to correct me if you think otherwise.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      See I think those two types of thermodynamic violations are more interchangeable than you think. I probably should've brought up Maxwell's Demon because that makes my point more obvious, but oh well.               

      Basically if you have information about the position of particles in a system (without having to expend energy to get that info) you can basically run a heat pump without having to expend any energy. You can start with a box of gas or liquid particles then selectively open a gate or otherwise control their motion in order to get one side hotter than the other, then allow them to re-mix and get free energy.                       
      So it seems like you could use a system like that to get a heat differential in order to run a stirling engine. So now that it's clear that getting free energy _is_ possible the question remains as to how to effectively manage it. After all it's hard to imagine a system efficient enough to actually make use of a maxwell demon style system with lots of little tiny gas chambers with gates between them, in an actually useful way.             
      However those sorts of questions are about logistics, just because something's physically possible doesn't mean it's easy to actually leverage it.

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        OH YEAH! I totally forgot about Maxwell's Demon!

        Okay then, so it basically comes down to figuring out how to use information about a system where one could use the information to extract energy when normally getting the information in the first place would disallow getting the energy. Or the best way to do this is to take advantage of some natural phenomenon where the timing is crucial to 'harvest' the energy.

        - u/RatemirTheRed:
          ```
          (I got the idea from [this article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19723-summon-a-demon-to-turn-information-into-energy/))

          Put a rotor in the fluid. Fluid molecules move it either clockwise or anti-clockwise. Use your precognition powers to record the times when rotor is turned clockwise in the future. Then, put this information into a machine that will unlock the rotor only if it turns clockwise.

          I am not sure if it is really enough to make a perpetual motion machine. It all depends on how much energy is spent on locking/unlocking the rotor and how much energy you can get from the rotation.

          Edit: I am becoming increasingly doubtful of this solution. The information must still be read in some way. Also, mechanical parts will degrade eventually. (Second issue can probably be addressed by making a similar installation that gets energy from random electronic excitations caused by thermal fluctuations)
          ```

        - u/vakusdrake:
          ```
          Yeah I know the theoretical aspects but I was hoping somebody on here had the engineering talent to actually come up with a plausible outline for how you effectively turn free computation into free energy.             

          I mean given how many people on here likely have a good knowledge on necessary information theory and computing I bet somebody can.                                 
          Given how many settings have magical means of obtaining information without doing the necessary thermodynamic work some logistical details would be nice to know for thinking about these things. As opposed to just being able to say that it's definitely _theoretically_ possible.

          Anyway if this doesn't get enough attention maybe i'll repost it in the monday general rationality thread.

  Inspired by a discussion on /r/asksciencefiction:

  You get the [Death Note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note); the same way Yagami Light does, it drops out of the sky and you pick it up, and you've got Ryuk helping you out. 

  Potential goals:

  a) take over the world?

  b) bring world peace?

  c) just become fabulously wealthy?

  d) challenge mode: any of the above, but L is looking for you.

    I've been thinking about writing a Worm fic where Taylor gets this power, actually. I have some really cool ideas for how to abuse the death note.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It's a very cool combo,  because capes hide names and faces,  yeah
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        It's difficult. I don't plan to write it from Taylor's perspective, but rather from the perspective of the rest of the world slowly catching on to what's happening. I know how I want Taylor to abuse her power, and have pretty much figured out where that leads her, but I haven't figured out particulars or how to get the ball rolling.

        Suffice it to say, she won't be behaving at all like Light.
        ```

    The Death Note lets you control your targets in the time leading up to their death, which you can postpone by up to a month if I remember correctly.

    It also basically requires sociopathy to use effectively so I'm assuming that.  Expect hufflepuff bones.

    So first of all, Light is an idiot. Your default is 'dies in an accident' unless you need otherwise. 

    So it's also a temporary mind control device. Find a mid-level millionaire without direct offspring in your area. Have them spend some time with you, create a story about how you saved their life or something which they tell everyone, and have them give you some money or change their will.

    Alternatively, find out who picks the numbers for the lottery.

    Now that you have some start-up capital, pick a business you dislike. Short their stock for your entire value. Take control of a couple of their C-level officers and create a massive scandal, timed to go off shortly after you short-sell, but before the return is due. Then some of them commit suicide, others die in accidents.

    Once you have a decent nest egg, you can start looking at politics. Begin by eliminating all the biggest threats - avowed terrorist leaders die in either huge explosions or malfunctions which also eliminate much of their groups, or die renouncing their previous views publicly creating  massive infighting. Dangerous world leaders come down with pancreatic cancer and peacefully transfer power to a better candidate before dying in their sleep.

    Then the minor ones. Public scandals, accidental death. To ensure people don't take your threat seriously, have Alex Jones write about how several of your random deaths are caused by reptilian mind control, and then die trying to attack some military installation or something. 

    Misinformation and public expectation are your greatest allies. Muddy the waters, use different methods, and pick targets and execution methods which are in character, or at least which pattern-match to that type of person.

    I'd advise you to never actually try to take power yourself. You just become the moral compass which trims the fat, and allows your chosen leaders to reach the top. Become a reasonably successful investor and venture capitalist in the meantime 

    There, that takes care if a, b, and c.

    In the case of d), you just need to add in a bunch of white noise. I assume hundreds of others will also benefit from the stock trick, so really the only way to find you is whatever method you use to get start-up capital, and that's also going to be milled with white noise.

    I mean, or I just write "L Lawliet dies of a heart attack", since I already know his name and what he looks like.
