## [Biweekly Challenge] The Mentor

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7w05pl/biweekly_challenge_infighting/), the prompt was "Infighting". Our winner is /u/vi_fi, with their story, ["Adversaries"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7w05pl/biweekly_challenge_infighting/dtxbpsu/). Congratulations to /u/vi_fi for their eighth win!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **The Mentor**. [The mentor archtype](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype) is one of the oldest tropes in fiction, for some pretty obvious reasons (while we all love autodidacts, they don't tend to be great at providing exposition within a story). I think there's a good opportunity to use mentors as an exploration of how we learn, and from whom. "Mentor" here can be abstract, and need not refer to a master/apprentice relationships; you can choose to focus on a luminary, if you'd like. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, March 7th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Meditation**. TVTropes has a [useful notes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Meditation) page with a lot of links. I believe that meditation is of particular interest to the rationalist(-adjacent) community, largely because of its intersection with mindfulness and metacognition. In movies and television, meditation tends to be "magical", in the sense that it's really hard to show someone's thoughts on screen and is really easy to just show them sitting still and then snapping their eyes open with a sudden revelation. In prose, I think it's a good deal easier, because you can give the internal thoughts of the character and relate thoughts to metaphor, which gives a fair number of descriptive options. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 3/7**. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [is posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zb204/challenge_companion_the_mentor/).
