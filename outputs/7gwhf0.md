## [D] Can a super-villain with a planet buster coupled to a quantum measurement, eliminate (observable) histories in which he loses?

Sort of like Worm!Coil but constrained by known physics & assuming MWI is true. I am unclear exactly what causes timelines to split i.e what constitutes a quantum measurement. The link above claims any thermodynamic irreversible process will causes a split. Is this accurate? I need help in thinking through scenarios where a super-villain can exploit that.

  You and everyone in physics.  But at the level you're talking about, there are a ridiculous number universe-splitting events on Earth alone at pretty much every conceivable moment.

  If all the villain wants to do is create a dichotomy - every reality is either his, or Earth-free - he doesn't need any special quantum technology to do this.  He makes his attempt, and in any universe where he is defeated, he activates his device.

    There's a short story where a group of scientists have been trying to build a new high energy particle accelerator and it never seems to be able to get up to full power. They realize that if it did, it would collapse the false vacuum, and so the only surviving world-lines are the ones where something went wrong.

      I don't suppose you have a link? This is difficult to google.

          Ugh now that you've said it I remember reading it, but am also completely unable to find it. This is going to bug me.

    Yes, universe splitting would be mindbogglingly prolific. 
    Oh... that would render the quantum measurement superfluous wouldn't it. That's what I was afraid of. 

    Will sub-atomic irreversibility & consequent universe-splits cause all physically possible events to occur? This seems to be taken for granted in sci-fi but it is not at all obvious to me that would appreciably affect macroscale evnts that we care about. Comments?

      I share your skepticism. The truth is the many macro-scale events have very little, if any, quantum variability.  The specifics of the electron collisions in your brain aren't usually going to change the decisions you make, for example.  Every world that splits from the same initial gunshot is going to have the same resulting bullet hit.

        The quantum events that change your decisions now would be ones that happened minutes, hours, days, or years before, and the changes only butterflied out to the macro scale over time.

        But there would still be many events in the brain of every person, every second, that would eventually result in macroscale differences. And it doesn't matter whether these events happened in the past or are happening now, because until they've amplified to the macroscale level every version of you will still be making the same macro decisions, so you can still usefully think about them as if they were happening now.
        ```

          ```
          Thanks! Do all quantum events eventually cause macro-scale deviations? Specific cases such as the double-slit experiment or a Geiger counter is clear enough.
          ```

          - u/ArgentStonecutter:
            ```
            If they don't, can they be said to have happened?

        I think there's very small amount of worlds where the bullet would spontanously disappear, or quantum-tunnel through?
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          There are, but the failure rate of any machine you build to implement the universe destroying will be far worse than the incidence of this (in no small part due to its own parts quantum tunneling away)
          ```

        - u/NebulousASK:
          ```
          Maybe?  I suspect not.

  Controlling the pruning of branches is basically the gimmick in Greg Egan's first novel, _Quarantine_. Any more details would be spoilers.
