  Man the Warden's scary as fuck. *Replace someone's mind with a copy of her own?*

    That's some real platinum shit

    I think it's more that she implanted a copy of her mind to pilot Lavarro "in person" so to speak. Lavarro still exists but is being suppressed more strongly.  Once Lavarro's mental immune system has had enough time to work on the problem the parasite personality will likely disintegrate.
    ```

      ```
      The question is if the Warden will allow that to happen.  She could have Lavarro travel to Watch territory to be apprehended more permanently, or just have her kill herself.  I doubt she would willingly let Lavarro go free after everything.
      ```

  Bit disappointed after finally getting some action last week, but it was interesting to see Wardens point of view. Wonder what she's going to do with Lavarro.

  I'm gonna be upset if the next chapter starts with Rain waking up from the stone. Hoping for some actual progress on his soul stuff there.

    Patreon spoiler to answer your question about Rain and the stone: >!The next chapter is all about detailing Rain's experience in the stone.!<

      Thank you and everyone here so far for spoiler-ing these revelations. I really enjoy lurking here to see people's takes on the chapter, and while I've seen a ton of spoiler tags, no one's ruined anything for me yet.

        Agreed. Infosec is tight among Delve fans, and it's greatly appreciated.

      Cool!

    You should drop the story till 2021 then, I just canceled my Patreon.

    Out of the next few chapters, maybe half of them progress the story.
    ```

- u/NotValkyrie:
  ```
  I was worried the Warden would be an ass but i'm pleseantly suprised.
  ```

  - u/Luminous_Lead:
    ```
    The Warden is everyone's ass, but tempered. She's refined buns.
    ```
