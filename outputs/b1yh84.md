  Nice though at the dongle or phone phase I begin to wonder why there are no manipulators, I'll blame wierdtopia, or the fast time simulation one, jurisprudence

    A couple of other commenters asked similar questions, to which I replied:

    > Of course some would. The only problem is that chips get a lot more benefit from economies of scale than motors and structural frameworks; while computers continue to become ever-cheaper, robots don't improve nearly so quickly. Emulated minds who pay for luxury robot bodies will, by necessity, need to be paid more than a similar em who doesn't pay for that luxury, and given how many such ems are likely to be found in the marketplace, will likely be rapidly out-competed by the ems who toss such values under the bus. (There's a now-famous blog-post on such issues, "Meditations on Moloch", at https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/ .) There are ways to avoid this form of race-to-the-bottom, such as em labour unions and government regulations, but they require significant effort to keep working.

(... And now I'm starting to wonder about my fascination with rectangular-shaped future people. :) )

  Scripted by me, drawn by Tailsteak (creator of http://forwardcomic.com/ , among other things). Moderately inspired by Hanson's "Age of Em" (even if it avoids getting into the weeds of some of his suggestions), so seems decent enough fodder for this subreddit. :)

  Oh, that was a fun read! I'd been wondering what you've been up to.
