## [Q][MK][BST] How do you best exploit absolute body control?

### Post:

So I have this power I am working with a character having. Virtually absolute body control.

Specifications are:

* It obeys conservation of mass.
* It is literally an unending number of nanoscopic telekinetic tweezers.
* Every change requires conscious concentration. It has a limited capacity for functioning autonomously.
* It includes full, constant awareness of everything inside body.
* It is slow. Healing a cut in the back of the hand takes an hour if left on autopilot, or five minutes of constant attention.
* It is limited by the users knowledge. One has to know the transformation is possible, and have a clear goal in mind before the power starts supplying guidance.
* It is not possible to become grossly inhuman, in any reasonable time-scale. Either mentally or physically.
* Damage done to the brain is generally irreversible. The tissue can be repaired but the information is lost.
* Severed tissue loses control property.

Mental self-editing is go, and it has built in safeguards against messing yourself up. It will readily supply guides for how to do just about anything.

So far I have thought of:

* Perfected physiology: strength, cardio, breathing, bone density, reinforced tendons, myelinated nerves,  more connective tissue, no diseases.
* Cerebral maturity, (character is 15 years old,) for improved empathy, etc.
* Little to no sleep required.
* Improved productivity, by editing away how mental fatigue accumulates.
* Improved memory.
* Intelligence enhancements.

What else is there?

  I can't answer this question unless I know what the character wants. Also, you should look up Sandersons laws of magic. “A character's weaknesses are more interesting than his or her abilities”

  I've actually written a full length novel with a main character who has a similar, though much weaker power. He could self edit, but only at natural speeds. So for example he could regrow a limb, but it took a couple months for the flesh to grow.

   He did many of the obvious things, of course. Upgrading touch until he could feel the footsteps of opponents, upgrading hearing until he had sonar and could hear heartbeats, upgrading smell to be better than a dog, upgrading taste until he could taste poison, things like that. He could put half his brain to sleep at a time, and so never sleep again, but it caused him to act oddly (Dolphins actually do this).

  I explored the way he invaded everyone’s privacy. There was one moment where he started smelling blood everywhere, then he realized it was menstrual blood. He could tell if someone was pregnant with a sniff. He could generally tell if someone was lying. Knew people better than they knew themselves.

  I explored his ability to self-edit. He could make himself feel euphoria. He could orgasm with a thought. Could wire head himself at any time, for any reason. Could remove any pain or trauma. Magic in this world was tied to your emotions, where stronger emotions gave you more power, so he would make himself insane with rage or pain for short periods, then wipe the memories.

  That said, all the best tricks were for specific opponents. At one point he was fighting vampires, so he changed the circulatory system so that major veins were deeper in the body, and what blood he did have was less useful to them. There was a fortress surrounded by a moat of poisonous gas that he needed to break into, so he made himself able to go for long periods without air. He threatened to become a typhoid Mary. There were people that used mind control, so he created a second brain (He could only use the brain for short periods, as otherwise it would overheat. Brain produces huge amounts of heat). 

  The entity that he got his power from was even stronger. It had turned all its enemies into giant worms that were immortal and exquisitely sensitive to pain, then turned them loose. The worms felt everything as pain, which caused them to thrash, which caused them to leak poisonous blood, which burned them even more, which caused them to thrash even more. The end result was that an entire ocean was poisoned and full of giant insane monsters constantly trying to kill themselves by attacking anything that they thought could threaten them. The entity also saved the brains of people who were exceptionally skilled or unique in some way, then gave their abilities to itself. It created a giant clone army, star-wars style, made out of half a dozen supremely skilled and loyal fighters.

    Can we get the name of the novel? It sounds pretty damn interesting :P

  But seriously.

  >It includes full, constant awareness of everything inside body.

  Awareness does not equate to understanding. Unless you have a body OS already installed, or a masters in medicine or the like...

  Actually, that sounds *seriously* distracting. See brain enhancement notes, below.

  ---

  >Little to no sleep required.

  Nope, sleep is not a well understood effect, and might be structural to your huge humaniform brain. 

  Your...your mind *is* still running on your brain, right? No way that isn't safetied. So too little sleep == damage. If anything, you'd be **less** able to intentionally miss sleep, as that might count as damaging and engages safeties.

  ---

  >Improved productivity, by editing away how mental fatigue accumulates.

  Right, but again: how *exactly* does this work? Unless your body control works on magic, or has instinctual or automatic elements, this won't work without a greater understanding of neuroanatomy than the vast majority of people actually have.

  >Improved memory.
  >
  >Intelligence enhancements.

  Same issue, just more so. This is your *brain*. Safeties engage the moment you try to make it "better" with some abstract, pop-sci thing you came up with.

  ---

  What I've got:

  * Muscle fatigue disappears as recovery times and repair becomes instantaneous. You can run your body forever, any way you want.

  * Not bruising or bleeding for significant amounts of time.

  * No more coffee, as you can control attention and focus after reading up on what common drugs do to affect your systems and replicate this (carefully) through trying the drugs, then trial and error to get the same effects.

  * Unaging, as all decay is stopped.

    Added an information advantage. The power supplies specific hacks for small step changes. Refactoring is up to the user.

    Awareness is also understanding, and is non-intrusive. No names for stuff, lots of knowledge.

    Brain still runs mind. There are already drugs that improve memory. Neuron density might be a factor too.

  Er...if you're saying that you have total and complete control over a human sized bundle of mass down to the nano-level then there has got to be some better defined limitations in place here (or at the very least, an extreme rigor requirement for the language used to program the mass) because at this point I think it's harder to talk about what *can't* be done.

  As in literally - name almost any random thing which doesn't grossly violate the laws of physics, and we can probably figure out a way to accomplish it..

  In other words, if you want to write a hard munchkinproof fiction you've got to start from something more well-defined. You can't start with intuition-driven nano-tweezers or you'll end up with rational! [Tetsuo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryb9IIiB100#t=6326). It sounds like you want the powers to stay body-themed, so we should probably BST a set of premises which remains mostly within those constraints.

  You said you can reshape your body more or less freely, right? Can you put a tendril of yourself into someone else? Either to kill them, set a bone, repair an injury, destroy a tumor, kill all the bacteria making them sick, etc?

  This sounds a lot like the Bene Gesserit or possibly the Tleilaxu from Dune, but without the galaxy wide conspiracies. You might get some ideas from those books or even Dune fanfiction.

  If you can control everything in your body down to the molecular scale then breaking down cellulose into base sugars should allow you to eat very little of almost any plant, and you could
  create useful artificial chemicals, such as tritium, or nearly anything if down to the atomic scale.

  Though that might make it completely overpowered.

    Chemistry could in theory be done manually, but it would be slow. Better to engineer a biological process that creates it.

  Depending on what means "grossly inhuman", Alice (let's call her that) can alter herself pretty efficiently. For example, it may be possible to duplicate her brain (hide it inside the body, so nothing actually gross). She may then tinker with it (always keeping "backup" for safety), for example optimize it for performing rapid calculations and controlling of her ability, thus increasing speed to conscious levels (already x12 or even better if optimization worked). This may also make sleeping redundant (there are papers on sleep being mandatory to cleanse the brain).

  Alice should study biology+chemistry, and study HARD. If she finds good scientists (who won't vivisect her on the spot) she can provide them alot of answers about human body. Also, with dedicated team, she should be able to engineer and craft different specialized self-replicating bacteria (and that's what Panacea should be doing instead of inefficiently healing people one-by-one).

  Actually, depending on exact mechanism of "gross" limit, it may be possible to craft and eject "parts", designed to combine into "flesh golem" (working completely on regular biology). It may be possible to make this flesh golem Intelligent, Friendly and self-replicating. I don't need to tell what it means, not in this subreddit.

  You can (probably) become a lot stronger/faster if you have complete control. There's something called [governor theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_governor) which posits that there's something in your brain that stops you from using your body to its full extent. That comes on top of making your muscles stronger/faster/better, which you're presumably already doing.

  You can remove pain, obviously. You'd still want feedback of some kind, but there's no real point in making it something that you can't ignore, or which debilitates you (stupid body).

  Can you change gender or physical appearance? Or is it basically just at the limits of what a person could plausibly do without any power (badass normal)? Can you alter your DNA? If you have that level of control, you could clone yourself pretty easily. Or just turn into a cloud of spores. Or take over a person's mind. Depending on whether there are any limits, you would get into really crazy stuff.

  You could study your micro-expressions and control them in order to become a really good liar. A polygraph would never work on you.

  You would never need birth control again (or conversely, could get pregnant pretty much at will).
  ```

  - u/mhd-hbd:
    ```
    Yeah, I added some restraints against crazy stuff.

    Mental strength limits could easily be overcome, as could pain. Any damage done by over-strain can be repaired. Nice.

  Just one for myself: Increase breathing efficiency by roughly 40% by implementing countercurrent-flow lungs like Birds have.

  Get fat. Experiment in your fat deposits, preferably on the outer edge near the skin, just in case you need to cut it out on a quick notice. 

  Friendly reminder, Panacea of Worm had ingrained knowledge of biology, Symbiote Bob from farmerbob1 story had an AI in charge of making upgrades to his body. 

  Unless the power comes with some understanding of how chemistry works or some complex safety limits on what can be made, then you shouldn't mess around with your body. 

  Chemistry is complex and so is the human body, building something like nanotubes over your bones can be poisonous, turning your right hand into a bionic claw can strain you the rest of your body with weight.

  Ideally you would build parts in your self, and then wear them. But get an engineer to do it for you.

  >It is not possible to become grossly inhuman

  This one bugs me. If there's control down to the nanoscopic scale, why on earth couldn't nonhuman forms be pushed for?

  Essentially, where's the limit? Could the character reshape themselves into a neanderthal? A gorilla? A bear? Look at the most severe medical deformities and mutations on the books - what could be done with cellular-level control over teratomas, polydactyly, polymelia, dicephaly?

  Look at human mutations and medical cases which enhance some aspect. Tetrachromacy, UV and IR sensitivity, [magnetoception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoception#In_humans), [polarization sensitivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidinger's_brush), and so on. All kinds of enhancements.

  ```
  Create a super infectious bacterium or virus that can infect people and take control of their brain and make them easy to control for you. Constantly produce this on your skin. Mass mind control. Probably set it to make everyone feel an intense love for you.

  Create several bundles of flesh filled with a knock out gas. Throw these at people. Likewise you could weaponize this into a spray. 

  Create a construct which is obedient to you, and will feed on the flesh of  animals and humans to increase in size. Cut this construct out. Army.
