  There is [a TV Tropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeroesSaveTheWorld) now. There's a handy "timeline" page for organizing things events chronologically (and which has shown me that the first sequence is a bit more of a mess than it had to be, in retrospect). I'll be trying to give the rest of it some life as well, at least enough that there's a skeleton there. 

  /spends five hours wondering how the character page should be organized.

  Thank you again for reading. I'm glad that you're enjoying the story.
