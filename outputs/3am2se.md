  The first arc (or two?) is a great transhumanist story with magical girls, before the plot thickens...

  Well worth reading, if you don't panic at the length.

  Second best hard scifi I've ever ready.

    Seriously, I doubt there's anybody on this sub who would honestly say that they had enough to read. Give us your good stuff.

    Spin Control. It's a novel and I read it a while ago so it might not hold up. ..

    Also, rather oddly it's the second book in a trilogy, but much better they either the first or third. Which is not the usual pattern. Usually the second book is the weakest.

  BTW, at a glance I would say the Japanese there says Mahou shoujo madoka magika instead of puella magi whatever.

    It does, but the official "English" title of the original series is Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Latin and all that.
