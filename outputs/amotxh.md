  Finally I got to upload a new chapter. Sorry, people. I've been sort of out of it and that has made my writing slower. There's a bunch of things going on with work and life right now (as well as a certain imminent event involving the UK which might affect both considerably). The frequency of chapters might suffer a bit from it.
  ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  So, my predictions for the fights.

  On the left: Krillin beats Yamcha, Goku beats Ox King, Goku beats Krillin. Seems rather obvious. 

  The right is a bit trickier. Barring any shenanigans: ~~Son Gohan~~ Inari-san beats Giran, and Mai (to everyones surprise) beats ~~Muten Roshi~~ Jackie Chun. Gohan probably beats Mai (but it could go either way).

  So in the finals, Goku fights either Gohan or Mai. Narratively, he beats Mai but loses to Gohan. Realistically, he loses to both.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Hm. I have something I'd like to ask about this, but I'd rather not comment any predictions until next chapter, where you'll see the outcome of all four quarter finals.
    ```

    - u/Grasmel:
      ```
      Well I don't want any spoilers, so I'll try to remember to ask on the next chapter.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    What makes you think Mai will beat Jackie?
    ```

    - u/ketura:

      Could actually flash him for the distraction at the crucial moment.
      ```

      - u/Grasmel:
        ```
        I didn't even think about it, looking back I think it's some sort of narrative instinct about what makes a dramatic story I just assumed. I guess that doesn't fly in rationalist fiction though, so I think I'll change my mind to: Jackie beats Mai, Inari bears Jackie, Inari beats Goku.
        ```

    > Realistically, he loses to both. 

    Any particular reason you think that? Goku has been training a lot since he last met either of them, intuitively I'd guess realistically he beats both of them, but narratively both fights could go either way.

    Completely unrelated, but I find I cannot read Krillins voice in anything but the TFS version now (which is interesting, because that is not true for the other characters that have been both this and DBZ abridged) .

  >"It is now customary," he started, "for the participants to take an oath. Please come in front of this altar, bow slightly, and answer: do you promise that you will uphold the rules of the tournament; that you will not do anything to infringe them, and hurt any participants outside of the ring, nor any of the organizers; and that if one or more of you were to break these rules, the others will help in stopping them and bringing them to justice?"
  >
  >"Has any of this ever been necessary?," asked Yamcha, worried.
  >
  >"Not really," the monk reassured him, "it's just a tradition."

  Obvious Chekhov's gun is obvious.

  Anyway, I agree with /u/Grasmel prediction's for the left bracket; Goku is the protagonist, so he has to make it at least to the finals, and we have already seen a lot of Yamcha so the semifinal fight has to be against Krillin. Right bracket is much harder to predict, though it seems unlikely that Giran will make it past the quarterfinals, given that he is the most tenuously connected to the plot and characters.

    Heh.

  Thank you, story writer, for eliminating some of the needlessly ridiculous concepts from the original.  I'm looking at you, seductive woman and Stench Man.  I understand the original series was for the younger types, but such things were beyond ridiculous.

  I assume, however, that *this* version of Krillin actually has a nose?
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Well, they were funny-ish in their original context, but here they would just have bogged me down, so off they go, used as setup for a good lampshading joke!

    As for Krillin... he looks like in the original, so I'm not sure if that should mean he actually has no nose, or simply has a very hard to see one. A lot of people look weird in the Dragon World. But I'll assume he has a sense of smell like most humans (and unlike me).
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      Thank you.  Krillin is my favorite Human character in the series (not that that's a high bar), and the whole 'no nose' thing just seemed to be an art style until they referenced it in the Stink Man part of the tournament.  It just seemed dumb for a one-off gag.

      I'm also one of the 'nose doesn't work 90% of the time' people, so it always confused me why they did that.

      You have a *lot* of lampshading jokes, and I love them.  You take some of the stupid or pointlessly silly things out, but still find a way to use them for humor, and I appreciate that.

  I like the part where she said "I got better".

  I sorta expected it soon as she made her previous statement but to actually go trough with it is very nice

  Also, yay more chapters !

    Obligatory Monty Python reference! In an alternative take it referred to that one time she was turned into a carrot, but it would have been hard to make that relevant again.

  2 questions

  Is there a schedule you're trying to keep?

  Is this other writing you mentioned published anywhere?
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    I've started going for something like one chapter every two weeks. Then slipped back to one every three weeks, and this one took a month. In general it's a fixed number of weeks because I always upload on the weekend.

    As for other writing... not yet. This is a shorter story so I would like to finish it before I put it up somewhere. It'll be on FF.net and AO3 as usual.

  As always, great work! 

  >with impromptu tents pitched up all over the place, chemical toilets, and cooking fires.

  This seems like something that the tournaments sponsor could easily solve... Just fly in a mega capsule hotel or something, theres probably a festival/emergency offshoot somewhere in the org-chart. 

  The Commentator is a monk and has a name??? Thats hilarious! Hes such a great character! 

  Also I just *now* got the jackie chun joke... In my defense I was 11 when I read DB the first time and it never clicked on rereads.

    Hm, true, though you'd also need the room to set it up, and let's be frank, not really *their* problem. If those people wouldn't pay for the hotel, that'd just be a waste of money.

    (also for various reason I've decided - and I think mentioned? - that there's a mass limit on capsule objects, and it's around the size of a house. So a mega hotel would require multiple modular capsules to assemble)

    > I just now got the jackie chun joke

    You mean Jackie Chun = Jackie Chan? I actually recently heard that Toriyama was inspired to make Dragon Ball by the fact that he used to watch Hong Kong Shawn Brothers kung-fu movies while he drew Arale, so in that logic the reference makes even more sense.

      > So a mega hotel would require multiple modular capsules to assemble

      That's still amazingly awesome, though.  You could carry them all in a backpack and with a little work have this big structure practically anywhere it would fit.  Always wondered why they never did something like that to begin with.

      I imagine it must be convenient for Bulma, too.  How much you want to be she has at least one "Port-A-Potty" capsule for emergencies?

        Well, it's not exactly this, but there's going to be some amazing applications of capsules in the future of the story...

        Damn, you spoiled it.

      Yeah, that one is a great homage. 

      Sorry to hear that your life will be stressful. Thanks for writing!

  As always phenomenal, your dialog in particular has become really good, where in the first chapters these characters felt a bit wooden.

  I only comment to point out you might mean figuratively instead of metaphorically when discussing the front of the tournament? But I'm not that great with words so..
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Thanks! I'll check about figuratively/metaphorically. I'm not a native speaker, so I may make the occasional blunder :P.

  Uh, who's Gohan? Goku's son hasn't been born yet, no?
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Goku's grandfather (really, his adoptive father) was called Son Gohan too. He then named his son after him (which is customary in many countries). In the original show, he's only seen when Baba brings him back from the dead to fight Goku in her personal tournament, at the end of the Red Ribbon arc, as they needed Baba's services to find the last Dragon Ball.
