  I like this, but some nitpicks (which may already have been made), as I read:

  1. Lung the organ and Lung the Chinese dragon are pronounced with different vowels.

  2. Is there still a Wall Street after the Golden Morning? New York was destroyed, I think. Though it could still be used as a figure of speech.

  3. I don't think Vlad would be that surprised by books being available. Paarfi is writing at that time, after all, I seem to remember other mentions of reading for entertainment as well.

  4. Wait, this is Earth-Bet Brockton Bay, not a new city on one of the alternate Earths? Because _it_ was very definitely destroyed by Scion.

  6. "I stared at Loiosh. Do you really think Teacher could control my mind if he gave us a power like Impâ€™s that would work on electronics?" Why would Vlad think Teacher couldn't?

  7. If it's Earth Bet, Bitch shouldn't be at the meeting.
