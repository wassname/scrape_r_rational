  Fenn’s willingness to just shoot arrows at people is equal parts hilarious and disturbing.

  Also, you know how the popcorn variety serial fiction takes every opportunity it can for the protagonist to blow everyones minds with there seemingly impossible awesomeness? You know, the 'A is clearly impossible! No one has ever done blah blah blah' *protagonist proceeds to do said impossiblity* and then everyone's jaw drops? Well that sort of thing is so much more satisfying when it's used sparingly and it's why i love every moment of Devil Valencia speaking 'unknowable' truths, dissecting water-sack-tendril sign language and leaving everybody speechless.

  Also also, did anyone else feel sorry for Masters? He made the wrong approach, and i have no qualms with how Joon dealt with him, but you can see the chain of reasoning that led to his choice of actions and the poor guys been spending the last 500 years living a lie, waiting for this moment, at least in part for altruistic reasons, and he completely fucks it up.
  ```

    ```
    If you want people to trust you then you can't betray that trust, Masters. You'd think someone that old would understand that, but I guess his desperation not to let June get away before he got his answers led to him doing the very things that ensured he wouldn't get his answers.

    I suppose it's not all over, though. Masters is still alive, and the team could conceivably be willing to speak to him in the future if he was under their power instead of the other way around.

      "Man, that chapter was so sad. I could barely read it, with how horribly these poor people were being tortured!"

      "What? When did that happen? The group was going to a movie night! It ends with them lounging in the grass, gazing at the stars!"

      "THERE WERE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BEING TORTURED WHILE THEY DID THAT"
      ```

      - u/DCarrier:
        ```
        I can generally ignore it if it doesn't come up, but I'm a lot more concerned when they kill hundreds of innocent Tuung who are going to be tortured than when they just knock out someone who tried to kidnap them.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          Yeah, I wasn't making fun of you.
          ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      I don't recall -- is there anything inherently bad about the hells themselves, or is it purely that there are devils/demons there and they torture people? If it's just non-human monsters torturing you, then that is a clearly solvable problem: Valencia is able to eat them, so there are almost certainly other ways to eat them. Find enough of those ways, combine them, eat all the bad guys. Voila, the hells aren't so bad anymore. 

      On the other hand, if the place is a lake of fire then there's not much to do.
      ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        Valencia's ability to eat them appears to have come about from a loophole in her non-anima status, caused by the Game system requiring she be a "real" person and rewriting reality to make that happen. As the Game is unique to Juniper and Uther and this was done by the Loyalty system (which has an extremely limited number of slots, to the point I doubt they even *could* get another non-anima in there) it is very possible she's unique in this regard.

        Of course, finding ways to improve her rate of consumption might be possible.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          She seems to be growing in consumption power as Juniper grows in regular power.
          ```

    - u/renegadeduck:
      ```
      I keep forgetting about the torture thing. I’ve been rolling my eyes at the Christian concept of the afterlife for too long. Turns out my mom was right — they got stuck that way.
      ```

      - u/xartab:
        ```
        I also got this thing where I've had to listen to religious mythology stated like facts so often that now I get a bit of a pavlovian "PU-LEASE!" every time it's mentioned, and this unfortunately had the side effect of making me scepticise to fiction that shares those same elements. I'm assessing it, but it's kinda bothersome.
        ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    re the demonstration of skill, it also helps that the protagonists are going up against other groups who are also competent and well organized. E.g. the team we just met in this chapter. Means that it feels like serious threats, and so makes their skills seem more meaningful. Those "oh my god you di the amzing forbidden technique" moments aren't effective because they often rely on everyone else being thoroughly uncreative and incompetent
    ```

- u/xachariah:
  ```
  It looks like Raven is getting setup to be a significant character.

  With Uther, she was 1200 years old, or 12 in human terms.  
  500 years later puts her right in the Juniper Smith strike zone.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    That part seems weird to me. How can someone who is 1200 years old act like a child. It seems to me that what makes a teenager immature is little to no meaningful responsibility and the lack of life experiences, good or bad. Raven was an enforcer of a giant empire which I assume makes you grow up fast. Maybe all it means is that she had the hormones of a teenager. Great chapter.
    ```

    - u/akaltyn:
      ```
      Joon mentioned that that species learns more slowly, but not at a hundredth as fast, so that probably means that they can do some things more quickly than others. So perhaps they are developing mentally in some ways, but with their body lagging behind. 

      Now I think about it in that way someone with hundreds of years worth of skills and experience, but the mental architecture and emotional respones of a teenager would be downright terrifying. 

      I can imagine Uther taking advantage of her emotional immaturity to have her as a loyal enforcer/minion. But her father Masters having grown up with others of their species regards her as an emotionally undeveloped child
      ```

      - u/GeeJo:
        ```
        > I can imagine Uther taking advantage of her emotional immaturity

        Given the story beats so far with regards to Uther, I thought you were taking that sentence in a different direction.
        ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      Maybe it's about hormones? 100 years is plenty of time to get used to teenage-stupid-making hormones, but you wouldn't be immune to them, and if they last a thousand years (age 11 to 21, or 1100 to 2100) you'd probably develop plenty of bad habits.
      ```

  To my surprise and delight, we've reached the $500 per month goal [on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales) earlier today, so the publicly-available worldbuilding document will be released sometime in the next few weeks when I can squeak in the time to get it finished (I'm not prepared to stand by that deadline). Thanks to everyone who donated!

  - u/mustyoldgoat:
    ```
    So, that means things have more than doubled since April. Which is good growth. From the numbers, it takes about a year from here, consistently publishing (and reminding people of your Patreon [which this "thank you" does a great job of]) to get to the ~$3,000-$4,000 USD mark. Weirdly, support is currently dying off for authors at about the $5,000 USD mark. I don't know whether that is just the number of people reading right now, or what people do not feel comfortable giving above that amount (armchair speculation says it might be the amount people are comfortable with authors making from their work). In a few months you might want to do something interesting to encourage a few of us to level up into the ten dollar club.
    ```

    - u/mojojo46:
      ```
      I think when you see that an author is making ~$5k a month, you think "huh, they're doing ok for themselves; my $2 won't really make much difference" and then you are less inclined to donate. At least, that's the bias I think I have. I think the best solution to this is to have multiple channels of donations, with Patreon only serving as the consistent monthly donation.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I think Wildbow does something like that - he has a Patreon (with $4900 per month, go figure), and he also has a separate donation thing for extra chapters.
        ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  One thought I've been having:

  The DM as he presents himself to Juniper is a simulationist.  He has set things up, he's letting them run.

  The DM as he must have been during Uther's time was narrativist as all get out, with Uther coming through literally hundreds of skin of his teeth situations.

  The DM tells Juniper that Uther used to cheat on behalf of the players, and it totally undermined the game, if you knew he'd bail you out even on dumb risks, then pretty soon everything was dumb risks.

  I think the DM is running the game for each of them in the manner that they DM'd.  Juniper is living in a crazy world where naming the wrong actor may kill you, while Uther has endured decades of kafabe victories whose lack of real stakes drove him nuts.
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    Speculative spoilers here.

     [I think](#s " it will turn out that Juniper, at least, is his own DM, and maybe it was the same for Arthur.  If you re-read the DM scene, the 'you're not me' part reads a lot like the 'I'm not The One' scene from *The Matrix*.  The POV character is led to a conclusion by an omniscient NPC, and, when that conclusion is stated aloud, the Oracle/DM says something that is taken by the MC to be an explicit confirmation of that conclusion, but, when examined closely, confirms nothing of the sort.")
    ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      I dunno, I just assumed the DM was closer to an author self-insert than June was.
      ```

    - u/mojojo46:
      ```
      I just sort of assumed the DM 'wasn't' Juniper in the sense that 10-year-older Juniper with added god powers 'isn't' Juniper, and also has vested psychological reasons to clearly signal as a different, if similar, person.
      ```

      - u/phylogenik:
        ```
        My working assumption since before the DM-focused chapter was that the DM was a future (or current) Juniper trying to work through his psychological hangups (incl. e.g. residual anguish over Arthur's death) by simulating a game where he, as a self-insert, is undergoing the healing journey of maturity and self-discovery that is confronting a series of challenges tangential to the Arthur (and related) questlines. 

        It seems like something the Juniper of the story would do, given his love of DMing -- recognize his downward spiral, dissociate himself (from his character/representation of himself), and explore how that character would behave in all these different scenarios in order to better understand himself and his motivations.

        Is it still Doylist if the story has multiple layers? (I guess DMing a campaign where you're the only player is just telling a story to yourself)? I guess a more Watsonian take is that it's not so much that the DM is some sort of future Juniper, but more that Juniper is the DM with his memories wiped.

        Thus, there is no Arthur-DM and we instead have the omphalos hypothesis -- the world was instantiated when Juniper stepped foot in it (or maybe just before).
        ```

        - u/PresentCompanyExcl:
          ```
          But why is he simulating conscious beings and putting them in pain. He said he wouldn't do that kind of thing, so maybe 1) they are perfect actors 2) hell is fake and they are let out afterwards 3) he no longer has the same morals
          ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    I suggested last time that the DM for Uther's "campaign" was (directly or indirectly) Joon during his dark period after Arthur's death, and that's a lot of why Aerb was such a hell for him. I've since done a reread of the story, I think the timeline for this checks out pretty well.

    In particular most exclusions occurred during Uther's time on Aerb, many of the worst of them are from Joon post-Arthur, and Arthur's descriptions of Aerb rather line up with Joon's description of his DMing while lashing out at people.

    If that's true, the big difference between the DM for Joon and the DM for Arthur is that Joon is no longer providing him with fuel for the campaign...
    ```

    - u/WalterTFD:
      ```
      The DM can pretty clearly play fast and loose with Time, so I'm not super convinced by this, but it is certainly a possibility.
      ```

      - u/DRMacIver:
        ```
        Yeah, the chronology isn't a smoking gun for sure, but it's canon that most of the exclusions happened during Uther's active time ([Exclusion #16 happened while he was active](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/33742929)) and that a lot of them came from Joon post-Arthur's death (["a frightening number" came from the Manxome Foe campaign](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/34742762)).
        ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Oh wow, that's brilliant.

    If that's true, it sheds an interesting light on the GM's line:

    > "I don’t need you," he replied. "I could fix every single problem in Aerb myself, if I wanted to, and Aerb has an enormous surplus of problems at the moment. I don’t want to fix Aerb though; I want you to do it."

          Something like "Hero complex" is more accurate--Juniper treats *himself* as if his actions are justified no matter what. He even acknowledgdes it in one of these chapters, when he catches himself making retroactive justifications to Fenn.

- u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
  ```
  I really hope Joon doesn't back down on the democracy argument. Group voting is important, as is respecting vote outcomes, and I get that a big part of the story is going to be Joon overcoming some of these implicit biases toward dismissing his teammates but that vote was bullshit. There was no way to even know if what they were perceiving was accurate, and leaving a team member behind on the basis of a nebulous luck sense is inexcusable. It didn't really seem plausible even- Mary had to know that all of them leaving would have been an open-ended narrative risk. Walking away from a hot situation even for a minute while saying "She'll be fine" is A) *also* dismissive, in a much more callous way, and B) just *asking* for a kick in the ass.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I disagree. Mary's choice to retreat seemed rational, there was no way to know if the Juniper who claimed to be using soul sight was in fact real. Leaving the exclusion zone to check who is real and plan seems smart.

    Having a vote in life or death situations is foolish, there is a reason why all armies insist on a clear chain of command and executing orders without question. Seconds matter. Having a vote when an unknown amount of the members are compromised is close to suicide.

      So much this.  They need to decide, stat, whether Mary or June is in charge when we are in round time.
      ```

    - u/adgnatum:
      ```
      You're right about the vote. Lots of pressure. Also consider the interplay when Juniper gave Valencia her measure of authority.

      Juniper touched on why leaving and staying were both... *less-than-appealing* ideas. No fair omitting one.

      From his own position he has the best reason to stay, with the confidence that his allies are not trapped or presently being deluded. Splitting the party is bad, but it isn't infinitely bad, and sending one part away from trouble (while not a terribly common *outcome* in games) has merit.

      Mary exerted considerable power by picking two choices (everyone leaves/stays) for the vote. No time to discuss other options? What a coincidence!
      ```

  - u/adgnatum:
    ```
    Agreed.

    >I kept thinking to myself that it was absolutely idiotic to stay in the face of whatever was happening, and I also kept thinking to  myself that it would be an act of supreme cowardice and betrayal to leave Valencia behind. I thought that for the whole time the portal was closing, until it was so small that I couldn’t possibly have fit through it. 

    This doesn't read as *self*\-centered to me at all, nor thoughtless.

    What sort of unconscious thoughts might drive this? Oh, I don't know, being the one with the extra sense? A game layer that tries to punish cowardice?

    Or, from another angle, what sort of emotional strength would be needed to square all that away on a short time scale?

    Based on the current set of chapters, it also seems like he didn't hear anything back through the portal from them. Maybe that was just from the emotional stun.

  ```
  I am disappointed that solo mode wasn't really a thing, I was hoping for Jun to be on his own for a while, as much as I love the gang I feel like having him working alone could be a refreshing change for the story, the group long discussions before every little decision can get exhausting.

- u/adgnatum:
  ```
  > and all I was doing was making up stories to make myself feel  better, arguing positions that I was thinking up as they came to me,  rather than what I’d actually felt or thought at the time 

  Hence the discussion maxim to give your true reasons rather than your best persuasions. I'm not always the best with that one.

  >He *could have* faked it. He obviously *didn’t,* but --

  This got lost in the discussion for narrative reasons, but i think it's worth some attention here. Just being in the exclusion zone (to-do: find boundaries) forces these considerations. The problem of an untrustworthy communication channel doesn't go away just because there wasn't anything wrong *at that moment* after all. It wasn't obvious then.

  I briefly toyed with the idea that Masters was spoofing the apparent race of the renacim and getting away with it as long as the soul-body consistency checked out. Maybe another time.

  >“Not imps?” That was short for imperials, though the slang dated  back to the Second Empire and was rarely used. That was an oddity to be  tucked away for later examination.

  Like now. I know Solace is the last druid, but maybe a similar effect brought them here now? Something old. 

  For the record, Cloud Gate was the mental model I was already drawing in. Writing: success.

  Having around Valencia seems like a useful way to avoid endlessly failing to trust anyone. It's a considerable improvement from the rather intractable issues in the Fallatehr encounter.

  >“Me too,” said Amaryllis. “If the world is going to end in five  years … it seems likely that we’re going to have to be the ones to do something about it, the way things have been going.”

  What brought *this* on? Just the end-of-world prediction? Seems disproportionate.

  Discussing the nature and profile of the Dungeon Master with untrusted parties in any capacity seems really difficult. It touches on several of the fourteen points and is hard to ground in any demonstration. *This* is the lens through which the rising horrors won't go away by themselves without Juniper.
  ```

    > What brought this on? Just the end-of-world prediction? Seems disproportionate.

    Might be the time they almost all died fighting thaum-seekers. Or the time they almost all died fighting a gold mage. Or the time Fenn almost died fighting Amaryllis's cousin. Or the time one of them sort of died breaking a soul mage out of prison. Or the time they almost all became mind-controlled fighting a soul mage. Or the time they almost all died fighting an army of frog people. Or the time they almost all died breaking into a haunted house. Or the time they almost all died because Joon said the wrong name.

    Also confirms exactly what Fenn was complaining about, that he's dismissing her and not treating her as an equal. He's approaching the argument in terms of how to win or mollify her, not honestly communicating.

  Valencia is great. I like that she basically took out Masters solo, probably. Though I will not be 100.00% that she's not Masters in disguise until we get a POV section of her, to be honest.   

  So, they're in a ship that Juniper helped make the ideas for, right? So... maybe Juniper worked out how to pilot it for his game, and can apply that knowledge to steal their ship and get somewhere safer?

      Masters could potentially fool soul sight if he knew she was Non-anima (which he does), he could deliberately make sure soul sight saw nothing, it's probably the only way he could fool it actually, but he didn't even know that soul sight is what Joon was using.
      ```

      - u/icesharkk:
        ```
        I made that argument last thread and was tightly shot down. Masters knows Joon has an extra sense so from his perspective. Prior probability is it's an entad whose function masters doesn't know and therefore can't fake. He would need another leap of logic to specifically assume it reads the soul. So it's unlikely that masters is faking soul sight based only on the idea that Valencia is nonanima.

        Joon knows how to fly a helicopter, there were several helicopters in the story but he did not get to fly one, Joon has remarked that this is surprising since his backstory contains such an obvious hook for allowing him to fly a helicopter.

      - u/None:
        ```
        Juniper wanting to pilot a cool flying device but being unable to do so has occurred two times so far - at the confrontation with the gold mage at the desert fortress, and at the fight against a few helicopters worth of enemies in the forest.

        He think since his father is a helicopter pilot, and he can pilot one as well, that it ought to happen eventually. A Chekov's skill, basically.

        So Makin- seems to think this is a running gag that will only be subverted in the climax. I'm not that sure about it, but it certainly makes sense.

          I don’t know about climax, but the usual game design trope for video-game RPGs, is that you’ll never get a new mode of transportation that allows you to go more than three new places, because it ruins pacing. So you basically will only ever get unlimited free-travel using a Cool Ship, right when you’ve already just finished entirely exploring the surface of the world the Hard Way.

  Binge read the entire series over the last few days, and boy are my arms tired.

  I've gotten pretty annoyed about how much terrible litrpg is being published lately. Shallow protagonists by authors who think that increasing stats equals character development, often just as shallow plot, lazy world building, often times terribly unbalanced or just bad game design it the stats thing is something everyone gets, or is terribly overpowered with no real stakes being far of macguffins of even more power/freedom. It's gotten to the point where I found a decent looking premise isekai book about a trio from Earth swapping places with the big bad demon of another world, but after a bland opening chapter where they get sperated, one gets turned into a wizard and saves a pirate boy from a mob, and then gets to see a character sheet, I just dropped the book there.

  Meanwhile, worth the candle has deftly used all the overused tropes to make something fresh. This story is the Evangelion of litrpg, isekai, and arguably harem fantasy/comedy, decon/reconing pretty much every trope in the genres, and will hopefully live on in many hearts after the fad of giving hero protagonists character sheets dies off.

  The only major logistics for of the world I see is the confusing nature of how the Pendrag family managed to acquire to many entads that can specifically only be passed down by blood inheritance. Entads are basically randomly dropped onto Aerb, with only a fraction of them being especially powerful with no major downside, so it's rather unfeasible to expect anyone to have more than one good entad that they could only bequeath to their child. With ten generations of a tightly knit court specifically marrying for entads, they would still have has to average an intake of several entads a year. Something just didn't add up to me.

  Aerb's Cosmology is rather curious, a giant hex with opposite edges being adjacent makes a tiling plane, but it raises the questions of how the edges were determined, as without a clear border line, the effective edge of the hex could be anywhere. If the border is set by custom rather than evident cosmology, it raises the question of if it's even possible to prove there is only one hex. It could be that each tile is an independent but identical hex, or it could even be some form of the many worlds setup, with each hex different but only by so little that you would have to travel across unfathomable copies to find a difference that was noticable.

  On a similar vein, the boundless depth is said to get wider as it gets deeper. This raises the question of how wide can it get, does it slow to a convergence, or get as wide as the hex itself, or somewhere even wider? Also, how deep of a column of air do you need for it to become opaque? I can't help but think that much sir being heated at noon each day would create a pretty brutal updraft.

  When Joon made a checkers game in basic, it said that it didn't support kinging or bubblegum. Despite thorough searching, I can't find any reference to what the bubblegum in that sentence refers to, plz explain.

  The exclusion zones are a fun, curious, and existentially terrifying phenomenon. One detail that I'm dreadfully curious about is, what shape are the zones? Spheres or 3d stadiums would be my first hunch, but If they're hexagons, that possibly offers an interesting insight into the overall nature of Aerb itself... For that matter, what skill has the label of excluded #1? Looking at the first few exclusions could offer some interesting theories on the principle. Gestalting skills was #4, I wonder what those first three are, possibly to do with world building? Exclusion magic being exclusion #0 would be quite amusing.

  The exclusionary principle says that some zones have a set magic/physics that is excluded elsewhere, while others are also locked to a specific person as well. What evidence exists for this to be the case? What rules out the hypothesis that the only difference is that the second type is one the original causer decided to stay because they have mastery over the space?

  On the nature of the exclusion zone borders, do they simply block the excluded magic from exiting, or do they at times act as more substantial walls? Eg. Can glass cross the glass fields border in either way, can a zombie cross the risen lands border (does it act like a wall, a vaporizer, or simply stop moving?), can those with a personal zone leave the zone at the cost of losing the unique magic (something that wouldn't be likely done volentarily, but it could be a humane way to deal with a zone), or are they locked in, perhaps by the same "wrap around to the other side" system the hex works on?

  The Ice magic exclusion zone was from Arthur making Ice-9, wasn't it?

  It's rather curious as to what exactly the exclusionary principle covers, instantly obviously threats to the entirety of Aerb make sense, but the more borderline ones raise the question of some of the equivalent threats that weren't excluded. Why [Redacted], but not the Actual Cannibal? Why Manifest and the goblin, but not the soulraping elf? 

  Sapient beings have souls, demons and devils are sapient. I can't help but think that the way to reach the magical singularity is to use soul magic to convert six billion demons into skill points.

  And that's not even touching on the hinted yet totally untouched areas of questions about the gods.

    These are some very good thoughts! I will try to answer to a few of them.

    >how the Pendrag family managed to acquire so many entads that can specifically only be passed down by blood inheritance

    I think similarly to what happened with Kuum Doona - the Pendraigs got entads transferred to them, then somehow bound them to their bloodline.

    >while others are also locked to a specific person as well. What evidence exists for this to be the case?

    From chapter 75:

    >Murder in Duplicate - As soon as it was discovered by a precocious young girl, the ability for a person to duplicate themselves was excluded to a thousand square miles and that single person.

    So the game layer itself says it.
    ```

    - u/Prezombie:
      ```
      Ah yes, the game layer would be treated with higher regard than the secondhand source of the book on the subject. It does seem to be a slight contradiction, or perhaps a poor wording, as it's also sourced that each doris has her own soul, which then implies that only a single doris can perform the duplication feat, since after duplicating herself, she wasn't a single person anymore was she eh?

    “Oh, what’s that? You voted to abandon Val? Well she hadn’t voted yet so I just wanted to grab her real quick so she could vote on that too.”  

    I can totally see him doing that though, it’s amazing how skilled he is at pissing off literally everyone around him—even a paragraph long flashback features Bethel offended on Ropey’s behalf. If I didn’t know better I would’ve thought his SOC was in the negatives.

        Well, there’s not avoiding a bad situation, and then there’s actively making it worse. In either case, the vote was already 4-1 so it was already as good as decided, since Fenn was saying she would only stay with Joon if she’d known he would’ve ignored the vote. To avoid listening to a majority vote on a technicality would have pissed them off even more, I think.

    That would be arguing in bad faith, and a super infuriating thing to say.

    Like, obviously if you're making a vote about whether to rescue a teammate, you can't ignore the outcome of the vote because "lol the girl we're supposed to rescue hasn't voted". Joon's teammates made a judgment call ("this is too dangerous, we'll rescue Valencia later") and Joon disregarded it.

        And the fact that Bethel was back at home, and her entad expertise wouldn't be effected by the form she took, I'm pretty sure it was meant to be "at".

  Can someone summarize the movie code for me? I understand that using Earth films is a fairly solid encryption since Masters couldn't know which films each of them have seen (though, even then, magic), but I don't understand how they used that to encode messages.
  ```

  - u/adgnatum:
    ```
    Sure. Imagine dividing a square into 9 smaller squares and writing down the first nine letters in each. To specify a square, you need to know if it's left/center/right and if it's top/middle/bottom. If you know those two things, that's a letter. To get 26 letters you imagine stacking these squares in groups of three, so that you also have front-inside-back. (9\*3 = 27 > 26, so there is an extra square; don't worry about it.)

    Now to turn movies into any of those three dimensions. A made up movie title is (let's arbitrarily say) left/top/front, a movie that they never watched but discussed is center/middle/inside, and a movie they saw is right/bottom/back. So if you agree that the first movie is the left-right axis, the second movie is the top-bottom axis, and the third movie is the front-back axis, you can uniquely specify one letter with three movies.

    Now imagine you're Masters, and by tampering with the protocol you make someone rotate their imaginary square (so that the first movie is front-back, let's say). They'll get different letters from the same movie titles. They won't get words; they'll get garbage. But at least now they know there's an illusion.
    ```

    - u/adgnatum:
      ```
      Now putting on my attacker hat. If Masters is *really good at this* then there are some things he might notice. If someone uses a movie as a made-up word it probably is made up for everyone. And inversely, if someone has seen a movie then maybe others have at least discussed it. There is a penalty for repeating (non-)movies.

      If this sounds like fun, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time\_pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad).

        There *is* one other thing: Timing. ...I'm still assuming linear time, because time travel makes a real mess for this. (Unicorns, though. The exercise of waiting a few minutes at the right times is left to the reader.)

        >I need to make sure that everyone is who they say they are.

        The most damaging thing an attacker could do is impersonate *everyone* to everyone else, such that no two parties actually communicated but trusted that they had.

        There are other attacks. Another is to impersonate absent parties well enough to fool to all present and give no hint that the illusion persists.

        A *slightly* less damaging variant on either attack is to fool some fraction of the group and leave the others aware of the ongoing illusion.

        >Solace, you should have enough, given movie nights. Some small amount of repetition is allowable

        Repetitions carry risk, but they're nearly unavoidable for Solace's use.

        An attacker could manipulate when everyone started their messages so that rather than sequentially communicate and avoid duplicates, they all communicate at once without hearing each other. Now the attacker has several encrypted phrases with presumably standard frequency distributions on the letters *and* no one thinks they should have heard anything yet.

        Everyone just gave a message and expects a response, so the attacker has very little time. All an illusion needs to do is stall. Maybe their new associates interrupt with a question; a delay from outside the system is dangerous.

        If the delays vary, the attacker now has a few guesses in order to fool at least one person. Wrong guesses alert that person, but no one else knows a message has even been transmitted. However:

        >Grak began.

        This helps the defenders because everyone wants to know if they can trust what they heard about the wards they're in. It's a mostly non-arbitrary choice who should go first. Imagine everyone being told they should go first. (If you're in a *hurry* you can skip imagining Grak, since he didn't need to be prompted in the chapter. I won't tell him if you won't.)

        Arguably, having common knowledge of being in the ward is an unqualified victory for the defenders, but only arguably, so let's keep going!

        The attacker can also try changing the sender/recipient of a message.

        Keep in mind that everyone in the party expects an encrypted message, even if the attacker changes it. In some cases the unencrypted message may be a known-unknown. (Does Fenn think she knows whether Mary and Grak watched *Fight Clown*?)

        If the message seems suspect to the recipient and they react overtly with any of: facial expressions, shouts, or cleartext the discrepancy may be from the meaning or the non-common movies. Because movies were primarily watched in pairs, this seems like a strength of the system, but a watched movie is probably not also a fake movie in another context. It's still weak information to the attacker. Concerns along these lines probably led Amaryllis to say this:

        >I want one short, coherent message from everyone, ideally something personal. If there’s any doubt, we can ask questions and give responses to each other.

        The protocol wasn't fully specified by the text, but presumably if anyone encountered an *in*coherent message, they wouldn't overtly react to it, but would send a garbage message that will definitely seem like another protocol failure no matter what an attacker does with it (and it won't have the right letter distribution).
