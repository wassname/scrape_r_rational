  Reading now.

  > Chapter 1

  That prank would not have worked if you'd just chosen a "trust me" password in advance. Stupid. 

  -Man, this really wants to be a movie.

  > Chapter 2

  Wait, apparently this is our setting now? Okay? Okay.

  > Chapter 3

  They didn't. They did not. Oh come on. (I might be slightly skipping through this.)

  > Chapter 5

  They realize this is rape, right. They do, right.

  > Chapter 6

  No wonder he doesn't realize the answer. The answer is insane. (Or practical, depending on how it works.) But he should have at least thought of it.

  > Chapter 7

  OH NOW he thinks of it. Late, champ.

  > Chapter 9

  Promising title, at least. Maybe we can get some sense back into this story.

  Why would you use _physics_ for that?!

  > Chapter 10

  Finally some answers here.

  > Chapter 11

  Where the fuck is _here_?! Please tell me this is not the afterlife bugging out. (The name of the story worries me in that regard.)

  > Chapter 12

  A house. Okay.

  Oooohoo. Clever monkey.

  > Chapter 13

  It's somehow adorably catlike.

  [note] I still have absolutely no idea where this is going.

  > Chapter 14

  I'm way more comfortable with this setting. At least I understand what's going on.

  > Chapter 15

  And I'm confused again.

  > Chapter 16

  Name-drop Alcor. Nice.

  > Chapter 17

  Oh What. What. Also Catlike Robothing is just the dorbest.

  > Chapter 18

  This is the most clear description of Patternism that I have ever seen.

  -God module. Snort.

  > Chapter 19

  This is the first chapter that I have to scientifically disagree with. There's a bit more variation to it than that, you know. (Lord, deliver us from the Evopsych just-so stories...)

  > Chapter 20

  Well, this seems unfriendly. They're surprisingly hands-off, considering.

  > Chapter 21

  This is the most utilitarian definition of love I have ever seen.

  > Chapter 22

  This really reminds me of Bioshock Infinite.

  Up to

  > Chapter 24

  and you still haven't explained what that place is. Better hurry up.

  .... Okay. Okay, what.

  WHY WOULD YOU NOT USE A SIMULATION.

  > Chapter 25. "Closure"

  WELL NAMED YOU FUCKS. Man, what a hook. Can't fault you though.

  Okay.

  In summary.

  _Nice_.

  Niiiice.

  Kind of a UFAI story, of course. Not very ethical. Not very CEV. Kind of genocide. I can't fault th-- wait, yes, they're humans, I can totally fault them. Can't fault the realism of it though. I like to tell myself I wouldn't do this, but we all know how malleable humans are under power.

  So.

  Cool future. Let's hope it never comes to pass.
