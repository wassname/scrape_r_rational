  The prompt was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2loawc/wp_in_the_fear_of_becoming_a_main_character_the/), which is [currently the all-time top /r/rational submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/25hbpa/dc_nope_the_anime_a_short_comic_about_a/). The responses are pretty funny, and follow the spirit of the original pretty well.
