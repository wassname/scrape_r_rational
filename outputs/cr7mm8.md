## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I get why they're doing it, but translators breaking 5 page chapters into two/three chunks is really starting to annoy me.

  This is sorta a dumb question.

  Is Lucid Dreaming an actual observable phenomenon?
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    The Wikipedia article on lucid dreaming mentions training people to use eye movements to signal when they are lucid dreaming during sleep studies, as well as EEG recordings. So they are about as observable as any other subjective mental phenomena are.
    ```

    I have, I think, had a lucid dream once, although the way I got there was not the method I usually see described, which involves being in a dream and then noticing it. Rather I was fully aware as I transitioned from being awake into the dream. 

    This was years ago, when I was a sleep-deprived college student. Back then, I had a tendency of lying down in the middle of the afternoon and briefly slipping into a sleep paralysis/half-asleep thing, which was usually accompanied by a buzzing sound and weak visual experience, and where I was fully aware. One time, though, the experience was extremely vivid and I flew around on a dragon or something.

    I'm replying to you to post a related question rather than asking you for a recommendation.

    Can anyone recommend a book that can teach how to develop lucid dreaming as a skill?

    I keep becoming conscious that I'm dreaming when I'm asleep, but I can't manage to stay asleep.
    ```

      I don't know if I can recommend a book, but I had techniques that I used when I was in high school to develop lucid dreaming, which I think were ripped from a website on the early web. There are just two steps.

      1. Set a timer for every fifteen minutes, or some other interval
      2. When the timer goes off, try to do things that aren't possible in the real world.

      What these things are is up to you. Mine were:

      * Look at a clock and try to read the time, which is typically difficult to do when you're in a dream.
      * Attempt to levitate.
      * Attempt to use telekinesis.
      * Look at writing and make sure that it makes sense.

      The idea is that eventually you will have the habit of trying these things ingrained into you, and you'll try them in your dreams, whereupon they will actually work, and you'll then be lucid dreaming.

      This worked for me, to the point where I was lucid dreaming roughly every other night. I never really had the purity of control that I wanted though, and I kind of stopped doing the daytime exercises, which lapsed me back into normal dreams.

      I've heard that keeping a dream journal also helps, but never really tried that.
      ```

        Thank you for that and it sounds like I was doing some similar stuff without realizing.

        I constantly wake up in the middle of the night and check the alarm clock to make sure I didn't oversleep for my new job, and the semi-lucidity started around the same time. When I started keeping a dream journal for interesting dreams, my dreams became more vivid and I remembered them better after waking up.

        Thanks for the advice.
        ```

      A dream journal was useful for me. Also what u/alexanderwales said.

      To avoid waking up early one can use [spinning](http://www.lucidity.com/NL7.34.RU.SpinFlowRub.html), I've had some success with it.

      I don't have a book, but here are the tricks that have worked for me. It takes practice, it's tough not to wake yourself up once you've realized you're asleep. I would say I lucid dream about once a month, and maybe every other time is for any appreciable duration. 

      * Reality checks: probably the single most useful trick I know. These are actions you take often enough that they become habitual, and that have different results depending on whether you're awake or dreaming. (They're also what the totems from Inception are based on.) The one that works best for me is pinching my nose and trying to breathe through it. If I'm awake, the air is blocked; if I'm asleep, my body is still breathing, so I'll be able to inhale through my blocked nose. If I can breathe through my nose while pinching it, I know I'm dreaming. Other reality checks include reading text or a clock (they're garbled and nonsensical in dreams) and looking in the mirror (your face will move/not be your face). 90% of the time when I lucid dream it's because I twigged to a reality check. The other 10% of the time it's things like realizing that I've already graduated college and don't have to worry about this class that I've never heard of--kind of a reality check brought about by the dream itself instead of by my conscious mind within the dream. 

      * Dream journals are very helpful, mainly so you get a better idea of what your dreams feel like. I've kept one on and off over they years, never all that consistently. I could probably lucid dream more if I was better about it, but not keeping one doesn't prevent me from doing it. 

      * Dream anchors. This is related to the journal, though it's never worked for me. The idea is to find an object, image, symbol etc. that appears frequently in your dreams, so when you see it you know you're asleep. I'm not sure if I just don't dream this consistently, or if my lack of dedication to the journal prevented me from finding one, but I've never noticed anything consistent enough to work.

      The other thing to keep in mind is that, even when you're stably lucid, you're not omnipotent (or at least, I never have been). I always try to fly first, and it takes a *lot* of effort and focus to get going. I've also tried things like producing sparks or holographic images from my hands, which flat-out didn't work. I think this is also a matter of practice. Flying used to be almost impossible for me; the last few times I've tried, it's been hard but doable. As yet, I haven't been able to do much except for fly, but that's fun enough that I'm happy to practice it while I try other stuff.

  You're a magical kiddo of medium wariness, who's just escaped from a bunch of goons sent to seize you at a public space. You've escaped onto the local transit line; you're starting from a point about the middle of a major line. How far do you wait before getting off, and do you use your flight-like powers to fly back to your home tonight? Do you ever go home?

    >How far do you wait before getting off, 

    Neither. I ask the other people on the train to call the popo and my parents and ask them or a transit worker to wait with me. 

    >do you use your flight-like powers to fly back to your home tonight? Do you ever go home?

    Way not enough context to answer these

    I've noticed there are people who engage in forums and don't contribute meaningfully, they just bleed away the energy with ill-considered objections... My term for them is forum barnacles. It's a kind of mop, I guess. Not quite like the trolls that try to infuriate people into more stimulating discussions with clever misunderstandings and whatnot, but more like a weaponized uncreative and uninsightful perspective that makes you want to go *elsewhere* to have your interesting discussion with people that actually *get* it.
    ```

    - u/appropriate-username:
      ```
      Hopefully you're not confusing uninsightful discussion with discussion that contradicts your worldviews.
      ```

      - u/lsparrish:
        ```
        No, I mean people that are actually uninsightful. Like, actual logical mistakes that you can verify with minimal effort. Like [this one](https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=48773.msg1979818#msg1979818), from a thread I haven't participated in. The guy assumed that aluminum being non-magnetic was a problem, but the issue had already been discussed up-thread. There were even youtube videos demonstrating the principle. The issue isn't that he misunderstood the nature of aluminum, though, it's the way he chose to express that misunderstanding. He tried to make the OP seem like an idiot.

          I don't think this is unique fo forums, though? Isn't it just...people?
          ```

    The author seems to over-value fanatics.  Fanatics devote time and energy and do create social capital, but that naturally leads to them both overvaluing their contributions and seeking to control creators.  This desire for control can frequently create friction that dooms a community, especially if it provokes a reaction from the creators.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    I generally agree with the authors outline of a subculture's evolution (with the caveat that it's an oversimplification and ignores cyclical waves of popularity, subculture splintering, subculture mutation, and subculture aggregation), but strongly disagree with both their assertion that subcultures died in 2000, and disagree with the reason they give for the death of subcultures as a whole (and also disagree with the limited form of the statement-- that the reason they posited lead to a reduction in the number of subcultures.)

    Number one, plenty of subcultures popped up after 2000, with goths and hipsters being some of the most obvious. Meanwhile, you have plenty of "old" subcultures still alive and thriving-- furries, otaku, fighting game nerds, model train fanatics, etc. Number two, if there's been a decrease in the number of subcultures or frequency in which they pop up, that's simply due to the fact that our generally more permissive culture makes subcultures less insular because it's less socially objectionable to share even our more obscure hobbies with the world at large.
