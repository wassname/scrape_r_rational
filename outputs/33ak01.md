## Rational Superpowers: True invisibility.

### Post:

In further playing with superpowers that I may use in a story in the future: True Invisibility.

The character would have the following power:

Generates a field in a limited bubble around themselves that curves all energy radiation around them, causing any form of detection (heat, light, etc) to notice nothing wrong.

Prevents any form of energy from leaving the bubble as long as it's up (probably with the exception of Kinetic for functionality and simplicity sake. Walking might be a problem otherwise not to mention people bumping into the field, unless I'm wrong.)

Limitations:

Naturally, this will mean that while the field is up, they're stuck with the Oxygen inside of it when it goes live. Can probably be countered with a portable source of oxygen.

All forms of energy in and out are blocked, meaning the information you have is what you have. Counters: either hand held or heads up map. Moving people or objects may be an issue.

Question:

Build ups: With what's in the bubble being what's in the bubble, what's the time frame for heat building to the point of being a problem?

Any other byproducts of living that could become a problem in anything resembling a reasonable time frame?

  This would defeat casual observation, but it's not difficult to see straight through it anyway. The basic problem is that it takes radiation 1.6 times as long to go around you as it would take it to go through empty air. Most sounds would be delayed enough to be noticeable to the unaided ear - if you're in front of a wall, everyone would notice the anomalous distorted echo. If you're lucky, they will just "feel a presence" instead of consciously notice the oddity, since those kinds of distortions are exactly what lead to that sensation, but you won't fool machines. Or bats, for that matter. You could fix that by modifying the speed of sound, but you can't modify the speed of light without breaking physics entirely. A laser rangefinder would detect you as a meter deep pit in whatever is behind you.

    If you're allowed arbitrary control over the speed of light, you can use it for time travel. Just this bubble won't do much. Although I'm not sure how you'd deal with it if you want to alter the speed of light but not outright warp space to the point of just creating a tiny sphere that's bigger on the inside.

  [You may be interested in this write-up from Sam Hughes](http://qntm.org/invisibility) which goes into some details of how he solved this problem to his satisfaction.

  So that aside, the big problems are:

  * Heat
  * Air
  * Blindness
  * The interface between the ground and the cloak

  You can make a field that "bends" all light around it so that any laser that goes through it appears straight to the outside observer. But you still need to figure out what the invisibility does when someone is standing on a patch of grass, or tracking their way through flour - is this a known weakness?

  For air, you're looking for respiratory minute volume. It's about 12 liters of air per minute during light activity, so depending on the size of the field you might start running into problems pretty quickly. A sphere two meters wide has ~4100 liters of air in it (minus however much your body takes up) meaning ~342 minutes, or ~6 hours. You can breathe air that you've already breathed, but I'm not sure how much you get out of it. Either way, this is pretty easily solvable with an oxygen tank. Varies a lot depending on what you're doing.

  For heat, the human body produces about 100 watts, which isn't getting vented or conducted to anywhere. It takes 4.2 joules to raise the temperature of a gram of water by 1 degree (Celsius). The average man weighs 80kg, and is mostly water. So given that, it takes 336,000 joules to raise the temperature of a person by 1 degree. Since watts are joules per second, that means 3360 seconds to raise temperature 1 degree, which comes out to be about an hour. Obviously this is going to be variable depending on activity. Hyperthermia (> 37.5 °C) in ~1 hour, Hyperpyrexia (> 40 °C) in ~4 hours.

  Edit: I'm a software engineer, not a physicist.

    Wasn't one of the main issues with breathing in closed space the CO2 buildup, as opposed to oxygen deprivation?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Let me preface this by saying that I have no idea. To wikipedia!

      There are two conditions that happen together - hypercapnia (too much CO2) and hypoxia (too little O2). [Concentrations when we inhale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing):

      > * 78.04% nitrogen
      > * 21% oxygen
      > * 0.96% argon

      And when we exhale:

      > * 78.04% nitrogen
      > * 13.6% - 16% Oxygen
      > * 4% - 5.3% Carbon dioxide
      > * 1% Argon and other gases

      So after breathing through all of your air, which takes six hours if you're in a two meter sphere, the air will have the exhalation composition (a decent naive assumption). The [hypercapnia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercapnia) page has a handy table which shows tolerance for carbon dioxide - depending on what your carbon dioxide output is, you're either one week or one hour from being dead (probably on the low end given that you're continuing to add more carbon dioxide with every breath). Now, the question is just how bad being at 13%-16% oxygen is for you. Wikipedia didn't have a table for that, but [this PDF did](http://www.airproducts.com/~/media/Files/PDF/company/safetygram-17.pdf):

      Oxygen concentration(% vol) | Health effects of persons at rest
      :---|:---
      19 | Some adverse physiological effects occur, but they may not be noticeable.
      15–19 | Impaired thinking and attention. Increased pulse and breathing rate. Reduced coordination. Decreased ability to work strenuously. Reduced physical and intellectual performance without awareness.
      12–15 | Poor judgment. Faulty coordination. Abnormal fatigue upon exertion. Emotional upset.
      10–12 | Very poor judgment and coordination. Impaired respiration that may cause permanent heart damage. Possibility of fainting within a few minutes without warning. Nausea and vomiting.
      <10 | Inability to move. Fainting almost immediate. Loss of consciousness. Convulsions. Death.

      Based on those two tables, it seems like the lack of oxygen would get to you first. But it's not a sure thing. If anyone can find an authoritative answer to the question, I would like to see it.
      ```

      - u/IomKg:
        ```
        Interesting numbers, though unless i am misunderstanding something they seem to imply that the CO would kill you first, though the oxygen would probably impair your judgement and hurt your performance first.
        Basically oxygen would cause you worse symptoms at the beginning, but would take a bit of time to kill you, while CO2 would only be mildly annoying at first but would kill you after a while).

        Anyhow the end result is that using an oxygen tank will not truly help you because after a short while the CO2 would be poisonous. 

        I mostly remember the thing about CO2 from an old Discovery\NG\whatever show about submarines and about how they needed to use chemicals to take the CO2 out of the air as it became the issue very quickly after you started getting extra air\oxygen supplies..
        Unfortunately though i don't remember anything too specific so i might be wrong.. 

        **edit**


        just noticed

        >78.04% nitrogen
        >13.6% - 16% Oxygen
        >4% - 5.3% Carbon dioxide
        >1% Argon and other gases

        how could the O2 be 13.6%? 78.04+13.6+5.3+1=97.94%, if we go with the 4% CO2 then it ends up being 96.5..
        it seems the numbers are only possible if the O2 is 15.5%~17%

  An alternate version, which seems more "true" to my mind (in that it's less of a hack and more of an elegant extension of physics): imagine a spherical shell, with you inside. On the surface of the shell is a (two-dimensional) "white hole" coming from an alternate reality that is in all respects the same, except that there is no shell there. (If it helps, imagining an infinitely-densely-packed array of micro-white-holes, each of which comes from a separate copy of said alternate reality, thus negating any impact of the holes on one-another's input energy.)

  So, imagine the shell sitting on some grass. Looking at the bottom of the shell, the grass being packed down by the shell resting on it would be obscured (imagine a perfectly black circular void)—and from the surface of the shell, light energy from a world where the grass is unbent would be emanating (replacing said void with what you "should" be seeing.)

  If you're going to play those sorts of games, just blow a "pocket universe" big enough to hold you with a tiny neck connecting to this one. You can make your pocket universe as big as you want, and stick a microcamera through the neck... the bigger it is the more likely to be detected, the smaller it is the less effective your vision is.
  ```

  - u/IX-103:
    ```
    The problem with the pocket universe with periscope concept is that it still doesn't address how the your bubble interacts with the rest of the universe. Yes, you can allow light in through a narrow opening, but what happens to the other force carriers? Do gravitons propagate through the neck? If so, then the neck region will appear to contain the full weight of your pocket universe. If the opening is too small or the amount of mass in your pocket universe is large, its weight would cause it to sink through whatever floor you are on.

    If you have control over the shape of the manifold(s) dividing your pocket universe and the rest of the universe, you might be able to get around this by increasing their surface area. If you have a large enough surface area spread through a large enough region, you would effectively be spreading your interaction with the universe over a much larger space, making you much harder to detect. Though at this point you're more of a human blob or man that can turn into "fog" than an invisible guy. The topology theory required to find good manifolds and calculate the manipulations needed for continuous time transformations between manifolds while ensuring the laws of physics are obeyed at every point (and avoiding destroying things through tidal forces) gives me a headache, and that's before we even consider the energy and force requirements to create and maintain such a manifold. *edit* And you may want to wear a spacesuit because the pressure at these interfaces would be inversely proportional to surface area. With the kind of surface areas you would need, you're effectively operating in vaccum. Also since radiative flux is proportional to surface area, so things could be interesting.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  You have a field around you, perhaps nearly skintight. The boundary checks incoming photons to see if they would hit you. If they would, it clones them, and with speed of light delay teleports one of the pair to the other side of you to continue its journey. The boundary checks outgoing photons to see if they were reflected from you. If they were, it negates them and stores that energy for the next time it needs to create a photon.
  ```

- u/Chosen_Pun:
  ```
  If we're talking about superpowers, and the blindness issue is an acceptable weakness,  is there a reason the barrier has to be a force field that energy curves around, rather than a magicked area effect within which matter is *more* permeable to certain energy types?

  I feel like working out the bubble mechanics may be more trouble than it's worth, if you just want an invisibility power with built-in drawbacks.
  ```

- u/IomKg:
  ```
  Wouldn't it be "easier" for such a power to work instead by acting as a dimensional shift? instead of bending light which as mentioned already would be detectable the bubble(alternatively in such a case the field could just form around the person and their belongings or any other shape), would shift object through a different dimension so for you wont need to break physics by changing the speed of light, but the light would still take just the same amount to travel through the field. same for sound waves, and it would make it easier to define the interactions with the outside world.

  Though it might be somewhat overpowered when i think about it..
  ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  If everything is being curved around the field, then you're basically stretching space to remove a bubble from spacetime entirely. Or possibly you just have such a tiny connection that it goes unnoticed.

  When you talk about "kinetic" leaving the field, what does that mean? Physical objects passing through the field would be problematic, since they're held together with the electromagnetic force, which is mediated by photons. Do you mean that you can use the field like a hamster ball?

  What happens with sound? Does it alter the properties of nearby matter to allow sound to warp around it like light does?

  How effective of a shield is this?

  Humans generate about 100W of heat. It looks like it would take about 40 minutes for your temperature to increase by on degree Celsius. The air would take about 40 seconds to heat up, so it would probably get uncomfortably hot very quickly. That being said, if you bring your own heat sink, such as some ice water, you could probably last quite a bit longer. Air becomes uncomfortable after about 13 minutes, and dangerous after about 2 hours, but you can bring your own air. A rebreather lasts about one to six hours.

  There might be problems opening the field of air pressure has changed. Does it release slowly, or all at once? You might need ear protection to avoid going deaf.

    In no sense is EM force 'mediated by' photons. It is the medium in which photons exist.

    This was my qualm. If you bring along an oxygen tank, you're going to be increasing the air pressure inside the bubble. Rather defeats the purpose of active stealth if turning it off sounds like a gunshot.

    A rebreather system would be a good way to get around this.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      Just the air pressure increasing from the heat you generate in a few minutes in there would probably make it a lot louder than a gunshot. If you're going to use a scuba tank, then it's more like a bomb going off. It would probably kill anyone standing inside of it.

  > probably with the exception of Kinetic for functionality and simplicity sake.

  The bubble is impermeable. Otherwise you could simply exchange air with your environment, thus bleeding off heat and getting as much oxygen as you require. (And that would offer three additional ways of detecting you: rising CO2 levels, heat dissipation, and air movement. As if we needed them -- but those are effective against any attacker that defeats your light-based detection.) So you're not passing kinetic energy through or anything. But perhaps you're simply saying that smacking the bubble with a baseball bat will move the bubble (along with the person inside) rather than stopping the bat dead or functioning as an immovable object.

  If the ball is rigid, you're in a giant hamster ball, rolling it into things, probably smashing everything around you. Your biggest weaknesses are doors and stairs: you can't fit through doors or climb stairs, and descending a stairway would be harrowing. You can detect two types of objects: the ones that go crunch underfoot and walls. Oh, and you can detect precipices leading into yawning abysses. But only after the fact.

  If the ball is not rigid, you might end up with a non-convex shape. I don't think this is a problem... Anyway, it does let you sense your surroundings a bit better, especially if you paint the inside of the bubble and have a lamp. You can see a distorted outline of anything you're rolling over at the moment. But you can only detect things by rolling over them, so you're not exactly stealthy. This does let you enter codes in keypads and type on keyboards.

  In either case, you can communicate via sound. Either vibrations outside your bubble vibrate the whole rigid bubble, or the bubble's surface is a membrane that can act as a speaker when something vibrates against it. This works both ways, of course; everyone can hear you.

  Alternatively, let's say the bubble is not a physical surface and in fact permeates solid objects. Everyone can detect you instantly because they see a moving circular depression in the ground. When you go through a door, part of the doorframe disappears.

  I don't think this system is particularly practical. The form factor is a serious problem.
