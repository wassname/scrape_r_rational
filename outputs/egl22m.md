  A bit late to the party, but here are my thoughts:

  First of all, the chapters following the capture were great. I loved both the snark and the battle at the end, how he used all the tools at his disposal and the constant looping with the unicorn bones. Probably my third favorite fight after the ones with Raven and Mome Rath.

  However, the capture itself seemed like narrative induced protagonist stupidity, and I'm interested in whether it was in-universe narrative affecting him, or AW just really wanted to write the next scenes.

  I can see why he didn't follow through with his threat of beheading him when he pulled out the pipe, but his only options being killing him (thus causing a major diplomatic incident and having them being fugitives in the short term) or allowing him to use a magic item on him, was a bit of a false dichotomy.

  The first thought that came to mind in this situation was Still Magic, because it's so powerful and yet completely non-lethal. Still Yarrow, and if his sister escalates and calls the robots, still her too and destroy/still the robots as they come. They would probably just lose some political capital, and the situation may result in a standoff, but still much better than taking the risk he took.

  Alternatively, though that wasn't my first split-second thought, just wrench the pipe from his fingers. Grabbing an unknown magic item is somewhat risky, but Yarrow was already touching it, so it probably wasn't a contact based attack.


  Tl;dr June thought that it was bullshit that the DM/narrative came at him with a sleep based attack, but the capture itself seemed even more iffy to me.

    It was a mistake, sure. 

    To be fair, Joon isn't an Aerb veteran. He's basically an overpowered Earthling. I think he's still working off a moral intuition of 'cigars aren't weapons', despite the fact that he knew better. It's difficult to change our underlying conceptions of weapons, threat and decorum.

    Anyway, he had no way to know that it was one of the things that he couldn't tank, nor did he fully know what was an acceptable thing to do at the court of the Lost King. Perhaps they play games of chicken like that all the time? Perhaps it was reasonable for this fellow to feel like he couldn't give in to a commoner?

      Agreed. Pulling out an entad like that is the equivalent to pulling a handgun.

      Doesn't matter if it's a novelty handgun with a fun design, if someone points a handgun at you as a joke you have the right to self-defense.
      ```

    - u/None:

      Also he's subject to the much more mundane human flaw of finding it hard to perceive someone he's just had a fun nerdy conversation with as a threat

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    I think June's dilemma wasn't necessary between lethal force and allowing the entad use; it was between behaving aggressively (taking the pipe away or stilling people would definitely count), and allowing an unknown entad use. He took a risk, not wanting to compromise their negotiating position.

    I believe stilling folks would still be an assault that would cause the guardians to escalate.
    ```

    - u/Calsem:
      ```
      It was a really dumb thing to risk. As he said before he knew things would eventually result in conflict one way or another - better to start the fight with the advantage rather than let the enemy go first. His life is too important to take unnecessary risks - he is the lever that moves the world.
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        I don't think it was in any way clear the engagement with those two was going to lead to conflict, especially violent one.
        ```

        - u/Calsem:
          ```
          I can sorta see your point. On one hand, using a entad after being warned not to is a pretty clear sign that shit's about to go down. On the other hand, it's hallowed ground and it's surprising that they would risk violence there. Also Joon didn't have much time to think about it. I still think he made a dumb decision but what you said makes me sympathize with him a bit more.

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      Stilling or taking the entad away is far less hostile than demonstrating an unkown entad after being asked not.

      It wouldn't have compromised his negotiation position, it would have left him in a stronger one since he could demand recompense.

  - u/AHaskins:
    ```
    It's a common flaw of arguments I've seen on this subreddit that "rational" means "perfect." There is absolutely no action Juniper could have taken that had 0 chance of going wrong - you could construct an entad that perfectly counters anything he could have done, and even taking action against a harmless entad could have spun out of control politically. 

    More to the point, it really seems to me that you're either using hindsight or your ability to stop reading to decide on an action. I make it a point when I get to "what would I do" scenarios that I am absolutely not allowed to read slower than the action in the story. If they pause, I get a moment to think - but if I can't outthink them *in the time they had, with the information they had,* then I don't get to claim afterwards that the characters were railroaded. In that moment, it would be genuinely difficult to figure out what to do, and the antagonists rushed the smoke inhalation (by design) to play on that fact. 

    Because literally any action I would have made had an easy entad-based counter ("pipe of people-targetting-the-holder-with-magic-have-their-mind-read"), I have to acknowledge that the power of the narrative gave me even more hesitation. In addition, he really didn't didn't want to interfere with Amyrillis's plans by starting a diplomatic event. The best I could think of was to have two all-purpose counters ready a deploy in quick succession - which he did, and neither worked in the quarter-second he had to deploy them.

    Rational doesn't mean godlike. Just because you have hindsight and the ability to stop time and think doesn't mean the characters did. If you can't think of a better action *before things go wrong,* then you don't get to complain.

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    In Joon's defense, there was a whole list of factors than made the attack less probable in his mind, the place being a sanctuary and zero violence prior to that. The political setting OTOH added penalties to any unprovoked violence. And yes, the sleep attack was the DM bs. If you put it in gaming terms, Joon got noscoped lololol 420. You don't expect being noscoped without descending into paranoia.

    Reimer and his rogue are slightly vindicated.

    - u/AmeteurOpinions:
      ```
      This is the same Juniper who walked into a room of statues and said “these will animate and kill us” and his party went “nah” and then the statues animated and tried to kill them. I call BS. It’s the most egregious idiot ball in the whole story now. And let’s not forget *all of his other skilled and experienced party members* who have no input or action or reaction, despite everyone knowing they were in enemy territory and that it wasn’t really neutral ground.
      ```

  - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
    ```
    I agree entirely. The way Joon got hit by that pipe made no sense. 

    The moment Yarrow refused to stop his demonstration Joon should have hit them both with still magic, used passion magic telekenesis to snatch the pipe, or something. 

    A much more logical way would be for Joon to have been captured would be for them to have setup various wards and defences, and for the pipe magic to blast them through the wall and through their wards. It's still GM-railroading, but it would keep the railroading outside of Joon's head.

    > However, the capture itself seemed like narrative induced protagonist stupidity

    Very much agreed. It was so frustrating how he directly says: I cannot allow you to use this entad, and if you use it anyway I'll have to stop you because you're clearly malicious. He's thinking rationally! And then he does the exact opposite for no given reason. Ughhh..

    He should have just taken the entad without harming the prince, it's not even an escalation, just a reaction, and is quite politically defensible. 

    Great chapters otherwise, I especially liked the fight scene.

      There was a given reason - Yarrow points out that he'd have to act aggressively in a way that presumably compromises Amaryllis's position:

      >I’d said no demonstrations, and I’d said that I would attack him, but I didn’t know where to draw the line. Surely I would at least have to stop him if he tried to light the pipe. He stopped when the tobacco was in the pipe, looking it over, and then looked up at me. “Have you thought that from my perspective, letting my decisions be dictated by someone who pretends not to have any particular limits on what grievious violence he would inflict means that I would end up ruled by threats, even when those threats would never actually be carried out? It would be terrible policy.”

      I.e. Yarrow has a feasible reason for wanting to demonstrate despite the threat (other than actually being malicious), and he declares he will. June is in a position where he can either attack unprovoked (or at least not provoked in an obviously demonstrable way), or allow it. He allows it.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        Yeah, there was no good solution here.

        Like when the library lady led him down the wrong path because she wanted a private talk with him; a paranoid D&D player would have attacked her on the spot, even though that would be the worst possible thing to do in that situation, and would make him look insane to outsiders.
        ```

        - u/Executioner404:
          ```
          I feel like the lack of aggression from Joon isn't the issue, it's the lack of defense despite anticipating an attack. 

          Relying on Still Magic when he *knew* that it is his strongest, most obviously important magic for his enemies to counter right now, he *knew* that the Dungeon Master might try to knock him out with something that can't be stilled, is pretty dumb.

          He didn't need to potentially start a war just to defend himself in an exaggeratedly cautious way - he'd just need to accept some embarrassment and a potential reveal of some abilities.

          Tap SPD / Unicorn just before he uses the Entad, activate whatever Fear is possible (because it was obviously a tense situation), get ready to leap through a window with Blood, have the Vambrace ready for Panic Loadout and Upward Bliss, he had *so many options* for non-threatening defense.

          Worst case scenario, the Pipe screams the words: "I'M SMOKING!" or something and they all laugh about how dumb it is and how paranoid Joon was.

            That seems like hindsight bias?

            Seriously, this all seems to me like forum thinking, the kind of reasoning that you go through when you have 10 minutes to consider all possible options (and you already know what the answer turns out to be) and you have no pressure whatsoever; I really don't think that's how someone confronted with a high-stake choice in a high-pressure social situation would react.

            Like, as the reader, you say "Of course Joon shouldn't rely on stilling magic, it's his most powerful magic, of course the DM is going to set up an ambush that can bypass it!". Except if Joon instead relies on, say, unicorn bones or passion magic or direct brute force, maybe Yarrow pulls out a memetic entad that happens to bypass unicorn bones and passion magic, or maybe the pipe's power is to put you to sleep if you hold it (unless you have a special anti-sleep entad) and Yarrow was baiting Joon to take it from him.

            There's no way for Joon to be prepared for every single threat that could possibly come after him, especially if these threats happen to match his weaknesses through ~~railroading~~ dumb luck, especially because if he does find a way to have no remaining weakness, the DM is likely to exclude it.

            I'm not saying Joon reacted optimally for this situation. I'm saying it's normal that he reacted suboptimally, given that even very paranoid people don't spend nearly as much time analyzing every situation they're in for potential traps as the average reader does analyzing SI scenes. And even when he *knows* the situation is a potential trap, it makes sense that he'd be defaulting to his most effective weapon/defense, and that in the rush of the moment he might not be considering every single alternate tool at his disposal in case his most powerful ability turns out not to work.

            All of this to say, yeah, I think Joon acted a little dumb, but that seems realistic enough to me. It was basically a confidence scheme, and Joon got sloppy with the time/social pressure.

              Agreed.  People screw up all the time in social situations.  He was up against a carefully planned (and probably practiced) con, in a situation where he wasn’t entirely sure of the rules and consequences, while knowing that acting aggressively would probably have SOME sort of bad consequence.  For all he knew he was being deliberately baited into a trap, and the pipe just blew bubbles or something.  So he hesitated and lost.

              Didn't they literally mention that in-universe? I could've sworn they did, around the time they realized he's untouchable as long as he doesn't sleep. Maybe that was more about Prince's, but my main point here is about preemptive expectations and acting ahead of time.

              I'm not as gung-ho about the whole "BAD WRITING! TERRIBLE JOON! OOC!" thing as some of the people here, but I *did* still expect better of the team from this situation - not because of masterful 30-second reasoning, but because they're the kind of group that thinks these things through and prepares for situations like these. 

              It's the entire reason he even *has* a "Panic Set" on his vambrace, which he never used while panicking yet.       
              It's not about selecting one right answer out of a dozen, it's about readying every single tool available that wouldn't have too big a downside when threatened. Protocols and all that jazz.

              I'm not trying to ask for the impossible, or to complain about every failure, but I just want to see all of their frequent anxious deliberations and preparation pay off in *action* instead of just in foreshadowing and thoughts. 

              It's especially painful in this exact scenario, when he *did* realize it in advance but didn't act on it in any meaningful way. Reminds me of the hallway with armored statues in the prison, except there's no sobering "I Told You So" here, just torture.

              I was a bit disappointed is all, but I can accept that plans aren't perfect and that's just how things went down this time. I just hope this isn't going to be washed away and ignored in the next batch of chapters - I want both this mishandling of the Yarrow incident, and Joon's reckless / semi-suicidal charge against an entrenched Warder to be acknowledged and learned from.

              **TL;DR** - They know the rails are there to an extent, but if they keep reacting to them after the turns already happen it's going to get very tiring very fast.

              The problem is this: Joon defeats them almost singlehandedly when they have time to prepare, significant terrain advantage, and wards set up, without any equipment or his massive Still skill bonuses.  Joon is defeated by them at the height of his power with all these bonuses and his entads on hand, with his team intact and anticipating trouble.   These two scenarios are not consistent rationally, they are forced by the plot.

            His enemies don't know that it is his strongest magic. In universe, Joon has been an official still mage for roughly 2 weeks. For everyone else, that is maybe enough time to consistently produce some effect with still magic, certainly not enough time to be relevant in combat, and the idea that he is currently a grandmaster still mage is ludicrous to anyone who doesn't already know that he is basically Uther. Hell, even if they do know he's Uther, they wouldn't expect him to be that good at still magic in such a short time.

            Similarly, with spirit and soul magic capped out, with blood and vibration magic pretty high, and with a number of other magics under his belt, he is immune to a huge number of effects, and his opponents have next to no way of knowing about those. With all of those magics, he's immune to kinetics, radiation, heat, gaseous attack, attacks against his soul, attacks against his spirit, memetics, antiemetics, and poisons of all kinds. And if he isn't immune to the attack, he's extremely fast, strong, and has a huge ability to dodge or deflect an attack. The amount of things that would instantly incapacitate him with no recourse is extremely small.

            Taking out an entad and activating it in front of someone, when you just threatened to end their life, is likely enough to make someone say that their life was endangered, even if the entad you were activating is something used to escape.

            Keep in mind that Joon has most of his magics illegally. A very possible outcome would have been that the entad was completely mundane, but Joon reacted and revealed magic that he shouldn't have by imperial law. Then he's in a huge amount of trouble, and makes the whole trip to Anglecynn much harder for himself and the party. Similarly, they might have been trying to bait him into doing something they could construe as assault.

            Overall, he wasn't dumb here. He obviously made the wrong choice in the end, but based on the information and time he had available to make the decision, I don't think he could have realistically done better.

            Unicorn bone is an extremely valuable, very limited resource. Joon has largely saved it for desperate situations of clear mortal peril, which I agree with. (Even though in this case, *in hindsight*, an ounce of prevention would've saved a pound of cure.)

              I wonder how the Unicorn bone would've even interacted with the Pipe to be honest... You'd think that it'll work on basically any incapacitation, since it works on death, but Entads are fucky.

              I'm also really not sure how limited his bone supply is. A normal horse has 205 bones, though some might be too big to carry or use in most situations (unless they can cut them? even bigger supply then), and Joon should be one of very few people on Aerb that can use Unicorn bones so they might be able to buy older ones.

              Well, as they say, hindsight is 2020 - so have a happy new year.

                The pipe likely does not work on unicorn magic, since if it did, it would frequently get used to capture unicorns and make a fortune selling off the bones and body parts.

          If Joon had higher charisma he could have done a diplomacy solution. Something like - I'll agree to not chop off your head but also allow you to demonstrate your stupid entad joke if you'll only use the entad on one person at a time, with the rest of the party outside the room and warded, checking in on the person who you used the entad on.

          Presumably Joon can even go in and check the soul of whoever (probably Solace) they used the entad on first, which won't be necessary since they'll see she was put to sleep.

          There's lots of 'talk your way out of it' solutions here, just Joon's build doesnt really allow it.

            Yarrow ignores your offer and keeps lighting the pipe, because he has no interest in collaborating.

            Joon's "if you ignore my warning, I'm forced to assume this is an attack, so I have to kill you" is as strong an argument as could be made in such an adversarial situation; it's a pretty credible commitment. And Yarrow was willing to take the chance anyway.

        > I.e. Yarrow has a feasible reason for wanting to demonstrate despite the threat 

        I disagree, Yarrow's reason is the exact opposite of feasible. He's in the middle of low trust high stakes negotiations with a potentially hostile foreign power. Any competent diplomat would know that taking out an entad in this situation will be taken as a hostile action, doubly so because he's been asked not to. 

        What's more a competent diplomat will know that whoever he's negotiating with will know that a prince will know all that; so when he's seen taking out the entad he cannot claim it's just a game or anything like that. 

        So Yarrow has basically pulled out a gun, Joon reacts appropriately given those circumstances - a warning of violence but no actual violence, and Yarrow's logic was that because he's threatened he has to continue acting hostilely in the middle of a tense negotiation. 

        It's basically playground level logic.

    There's also the counterfactual case: the entad could in fact have been dumb and harmless.  In this case, the point of the bluff is to get Juniper to react aggressively to gain some kind of leverage in the negotiations.  Granted, one could probably press the point that entad use is aggressive in itself, but then he'd be pressed on how he knew it was an invested entad and not a pretty gewgaw.  That could cascade into revealing that he's a powerful soul mage prettily quickly, and that probably doesn't leave him in a good place, either.

    I cringed when he was captured so easily, but on the afterthought, it was not that bad choice.

    Zinnia took their stuff, and put it in her bag of holding 🤯

    Am I missing where Joon realises this or is it supposed to be so obvious it goes unstated? He's asking where his things are in case she decided to stash them somewhere other than her entad.

  Spiritfuckery is delicious. I loved the "saved at the wrong time" fight scene; really felt like a challenging game where you had to memorize the pattern just right to progress further.

  I wonder if it's possible to soulfuck a living unicorn. Turn it into a source of bones, removing them and healing it after.

  Wait. If spirit magic can make someone loyal more or less permanently, and no one else knows it at the moment, is it possible to capture and spiritfuck an animal to serve as a mount? The moral side of this is ambiguos at best, but I'd do that, honestly. Especially to a unicorn.

  Edit: and explain away with an entad that lets the wearer designate one non-sapient creature as a "familiar", for example. Should be unconspicious enough and just on the right side of a power-up to not be game-changing and therefore worth paying too much attention to and prioritising taking it away. I know this likely won't happen, I just love the idea.

        You only have to do so once or twice however, then you can potentially raise tamed soulfucked unicorns.

        Setting up a no-escape scenario against a unicorn is not easy, but with the resources of a thousand-man  company with access to weapons or armor that can completely shut down the unicorn's physical capabilities it's not exactly unfeasible.

  Few theories/observations of the story that aren't connected to the update in particular, but I want to get out there.

  1. Fel Seed is Forty-two, Uther's oldest, loyalist knight, and a *Reimer-inspired shapeshifter*. This way he parallels Joon's own creation of Fel Seed in response to losing Arthur. I'd place the portal as linking him to the lowest plane of hell, which grants infinite flesh regen and guaranteed reversal of death, even after total destruction, a unique property that has only been observed outside hell once, with Fel Seed.

  2. The elemental planes follow the standard dnd elements, with para- and quasi- elements linking them to each-other, and the negative/positive (N/M) planes. The only missing element is air. There's also the alternative elements of Metal and Wood, which are missing more planes yet undiscovered, and a plane of body. This is important because it seems every plane has an associated magic. Most are obvious, Fire/Wind/Water for example, while others are less straightforward, such as Gem Magic and the plane of light (wards against gem magic are wards that block light), or steel magic and the plane of iron (steel is an iron alloy and so the magic is tied to the iron). This also gives the possibility of a parallel element-set to the Planes of Body: Planes of Mind, inaccessible elemental planes of Spirit, Soul and Emotion could be located. A Plane of Spirit could be the source of Burning Man as a "lifeform" entirely based on spirit.

  3. I suspect the Locus cannot be restored, and a core part of its arc is about learning to move on, letting go of the past and finding there is still beauty to be found in the world.
  ```

  - u/bucketsofmercy:
    ```
    Oh God I hope you're wrong about the locus. I've been waiting so long to see it finally fixed and learn more about the locus and Solace :(

    I think 3 was spelled out in the text at some point, and there isn't enough info to make a real guess yet.

    As for 1, That's interesting, and I wouldn't be surprised if the story moved to the hells eventually,  but I doubt fell seed will be resolved by just having Joon go to hell to fight the devil.
    ```

    - u/CuteSomic:
      ```
      Going from the Second Empire knows, it's impossible to restore the locus. But June is one point away from Loyalty 20, which, given that "Twinned Souls" exist for others, might give the locus a little boost. Might. Only one thing is certain, nothing is gonna be easy.
      ```

      - u/Executioner404:
        ```
        I'm still hoping the Doe's Twinned Souls is just straight up Druidism.        
        It'd make a lot of sense as a perk for bonding with a Locus, and would *really* fuck with Joon because everyone knows he'd be a horrible Druid, while also being an important experience to learn from.

        Then his challenge would be to grow powerful enough as a Druid to save the Locus with Solace, without accidentally stripping himself of his powers by cynicism and analysis.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Super late here, but: I imagine there's an avenue for that via temporary self--soul fuckery. Modifying himself to just not care about analysis. Of course I also imagine Druidic magic would very much not like that, and it's one of those things the Second Empire would have definitely tried.
          ```

  - u/kurtofconspiracy:

    Fel Seed as a terminal result of single minded munchkining makes sense. But we have seen enough of Reimer that I feel like we have sort of dealt with him, narratively, so I'm not convinced.

    OK so if Fenn is eventually brought back to life, it defeats that message.

    If Fenn isn't brought back to life, then moving on should be a reoccurring theme right? But Solace has already been revived.

    Moving on doesn't seem like a very present theme. No one's really gone in this.

  Lot of complaining about Joon letting the pipe be lit, but actually, the thing that gives me pause is.. That Yarrow did it. 

  Joon is scary. Murderer of titans, decked out to the teeth. But okay, maybe he discounts that, and just sees him as a minion of Amaryllis, a potent one, but a minion. However...  

  "Hi, my name is Raven Masters, Knight of Legend, founding figure of your national mythos". And he went ahead and broke truce, sanctuary and law in front of her. Which went about as badly as one would expect from his point of view, when she no-sold his bullshit magic entad. Heck, they are fortunate they did not die in the next six seconds. 

  What, by the dark night of the soul were the siblings offered or threatened with to make them go through with that attack?
  ```

  - u/scruiser:

    I would assume they are privileged, powerful, and entitled and thus not used to people that genuinely trump them in magical power (like Joon and Raven) or social standing (Raven).

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Oh yeah, I had the same reaction.

    Like, the very reason Joon is in trouble with the fuzz is because he broke draconic law while almost single-handedly murdering an antimemetic kaiju.

    Every single one of these people can murder you in less than 10 seconds, and the only reason they don't is that it would be slightly inconvenient politically to break guest truce, which you're about to blatantly violate.

    Reminds me of PGtE, where for a while Catherine's greatest obstacle was the sheer amount of people willing to piss her off despite what common sense, self preservation and basic pattern-matching would suggest.

  Mixed feelings. Do I call Wales a hack here, or do I shake his hand for tenderly meming us. 

  Then there's the hotel. And of course. Of-*fucking*-course - the group walks into an entad hotel and it's Hilbert's Grand Hotel. OF COURSE IT IS.

  Freaking loved how the hotel becomes practical - or rather impractical - just by the logistics of getting to your own room. That's great fun. 

  And then there's the elevators. 

  God, what a deathtrap for curious idiots. I'm pretty sure it wasn't corporate sabotage. It was me. You can find my skeleton still ridin' in one of the cabs. Just to see if I could.

    The text glosses over it, but this thought has been worming around in my head and won't go away - the input problem for a finitely sized elevator that needs to be directed to an infinitely large list of floors is actually really hard. So hard that I suspect the only real solution is a turing complete language for floor specification.    
    What I'm saying is that this is a really subtle joke about the halting problem.

      - u/Fruan:
        ```
        Technically true, but there's a limit on how big a floor number someone can be expected to enter without error, especially if you're doing it without a display. You can't have a 'target floor' display in your method, because it's only allowed to be finitely big. Overall a very dissatisfying solution.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          Yeah, but past a few powers of ten, people aren't likely to want to rent a room anyway. You still need to get in and out of the hotel.
          ```

          - u/Fruan:
            ```
            Oh, sure. My worrying about the user interface experience for an elevator in the use cases where the elevator trip is measured in decades is absurd.    
            Is this what a forge frenzy feels like from the inside? Obsessing over stupid details that are overshadowed by more pressing practicallities? This is how dumb entads happen, isn't it.

        - u/archpawn:
          ```
          You can get exponentially larger numbers with a linear increase in time. The bigger problem is waiting for the elevator to reach the floor. And waiting for the receptionist to find your key, unless you just want to pick the lock.
          ```

    - u/hayshed:
      ```
      A solution was already shown to us. The wall of keys that moved to reveal more keys. The elevators could easily have a number pad and a display that gets bigger. Or even just shows only the last 10 digits, Or no display at all. Regardless, the elevators are still in some way infinite even if they don't have infinite buttons.


      Its a good halting problem joke though! - the only way to check if the elevator stops is to run it, with grim results.

      It seems fairly doable to me. All you need is a small display, (either digital or [analog flip](https://previews.123rf.com/images/avectors/avectors1808/avectors180800072/112204151-flip-countdown-clock-counter-vector-hours-minutes-and-seconds-flip-numbers-on-board-display-on-trans.jpg)) a way to insert, edit, or delete numbers at any slot on the display, (also trivial digitally or analog with buttons for digits, mode switch, and slot indicator) and a view slider to scroll through the display with tuning knob.

      The key is you use the tuning knob to adjust the *relative* step of the scroll rather than absolute. So like by default, the view slider jumps 100% of the display: from the beginning of the floor number to the end. One step finer jumps 10% of the display, then 1%, and so on. This would make it so you would only need to adjust the display a total of N times for a desired floor number 10^(N+1) digits long, and review/edit any floor choices fairly easily. Thoughts?
      ```

    - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
      ```
      You go in and hit the '9' key 100 times and it takes maybe a minute. 
      Assuming 1s per floor, the elevator will then be rising for 2 * 10^83 times the *age of the universe*. It's not going to be a problem sending them up for long enough not to matter...

  I was on Joon's side at first about how much of a DM railroad the pipe sequence was--not only an entad that zeroes in on one of his few weaknesses, but an encounter that, by the equivalent of DM fiat, doesn't let him use any of his game-layer-enhanced social/analytical abilities to thwart it. But by the time he gets around to mentally complaining about it himself, it had occurred to me that

  &#x200B;

  * Joon's been "offloading sleep" onto several tuung who don't otherwise have a high security clearance (chapter 179). Presumably Amaryllis *hasn't*, despite her time being otherwise more ruthlessly optimized. So Hyacinth via her at-least-one-spy actually does have a reason to know that Joon, specifically, can but shouldn't sleep.
  * Yarrow is a soul mage, which gives him a strong advantage against being read or intimidated. With prep time, he can modify his own soul so that he *really* wants to light the pipe, even at the risk of his life, but has no memory of why. So it maybe wasn't possible, even in principle, for Joon to figure out what the trap was just from Yarrow's actions and tells.

  &#x200B;

  So maybe the DM was playing fairer than it seemed.

  &#x200B;

  Unrelatedly, has anyone brought up the possibility that Solace is now a high-ranking Penndraig by the standards of at least some of the hereditary Penndraig entads? The entads judge inheritance by different rules; surely at least some of them care that Solace is the daughter of the most direct living descendant of Arthur?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:

      ```
      Well, that's the thing! It's all definitely internally consistent in retrospect, but it's still very laser-focused bad luck that they used the pipe dream instead of address binder on Joon. Like a tabletop RPG I remember playing in once where another player's PC had the weakness "debilitating phobia of the number 37", and naturally the game master had him "randomly" run into someone wearing a hat with the number 37 on it. The player was, arguably rightfully, annoyed that the game master hadn't, say, rolled a d100 to determine the number.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        As much as I think the scene was made out of railroad tracks, I think the pipe dream is the sensible choice for Yarrow and Zinnia.  You have to throw the binder (I think), meaning that Joon could dodge, or you could miss, or he might have a way to escape, or an entad that nullifies it, etc.  With the pipe dream, the nature of the threat is not immediately obvious and it's apparently "no save, you lose".  Once someone is unconscious they have far fewer options for escaping.

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    I think it's somewhat unlikely that Miunun has an information leak like that, but it is at least plausible.

    Soul mages can't delete memories with that high a specificity, which is one reason why soul fucking is not something you do lightly: once reverted the person can tell the authorities what you did. So if he changed his own values, he would at least know why he did it.

    Solace being Amaryllis' daughter and heir to her entads has been mentioned in the discord, and AW said that it's something that the characters know the answer to but hasn't been mentioned in the story. Presumably she isn't the heir, but it's not a certainty.

  So, for those of you who aren't deep into the details of D&D 3.5 splatbook efficiency rankings, "Monkey Grip" is a *phenomenal* condescending nickname.  [Monkey Grip](https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/complete-warrior--61/monkey-grip--1978/) is a feat (basically a special character option) that allows you to increase the size of your preferred weapon for a -2 penalty on attack rolls.  The typical use would be for a human sized fighter who specializes in something like two-handed greatswords to wield an *ogre-sized* two-handed greatsword.  

  Thematically, this is anime as fuck.  *Mechanically*, you're burning a feat to go from a base 2d6 damage to 2d8 damage at the cost of a -2 malus to attack rolls - an average increase of 2 damage on a successful hit.    This is a trap feat.  Even the basic feat [Power Attack](https://dndtools.net/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/power-attack--2208/) will turn the same -2 malus to hit into +4 damage, while also being a prerequisite for a ton of other feats and prestige classes, some of which scale even higher, and which can be toggled on or off as circumstances demand.  Going this route also means you don't have to specialize in "comically oversized weapons" which are both harder to come by as well as inviting derogatory comments about your barbarian's sexual insecurities. 

  This means that the guy with Monkey Grip is either a noob fool tricked by something sub-optimal that looks cool, or an NPC adversary that the DM can give a powerful weapon without worrying about what happens when a player picks it up (because it's too damn big for anyone in the party to actually use it).

  I feel bad for Raven here. She has someone who she can be friendly with, who can talk with her as an equal about a subject she likes, and he stripped himself of the ability.

  Ink magic seems really, ridiculously strong. The raw effects are limited in a few ways, but just the ability to basically make entads with specific effects is great. As seen here, you can tailor items to counter specific strategies your enemy has prepared. And fighting against an ink mage must be a nightmare, since they could bring almost anything to the table. Creating synergies with existing entads seems absurdly good as well.

  The fight, and all the stuff leading up to it, was glorious. Being super snarky about the pain stick, the method used to bypass the wards, "How did you get out?""Magic.", etc.

  From Pallida's reaction to to Solace's impromptu osteoectomy, I realized that she is the [Straight Man](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan) of the group. In spite of this character trait, she is a lesbian woman.

  The ability to turn off pain seems like it would make induction into fire magic super easy.

  For getting out, I think that Joon could use the connection with Amaryllis or Grak and temporarily boost their value of the Spine of the World and Tentar, ways that are obviously artificial and thus can send a message. If Amaryllis periodically heals her skin, Joon could write out more in scar tissue. Possibly, they could get two way communication by both altering her soul's image of her body and writing messages on the skin.

  Rosemallow is the first Penndraig not to have red hair. I wonder if this has any significance, though I doubt it.

          Could have gone better, could have gone worse. Knowing the DM, June going "fuck this" in a place *this* big on politics would have screwed up his public relationships something fierce. Now at least he has leverage because he was kidnapped and tortured, and then escaped. It's both a serious accusation to throw the opponents off balance, and a powerful message that he's strong and resourceful.
          ```

          - u/burnerpower:
            ```
            Hmm. I'm not sure about that. I don't think they actually have any leverage at all. I'm pretty sure this is one of those things set up so Hyacinth has just enough plausible deniability that no one can pin it on her. These people don't play fair. Larkspur called in illegal aid from Doris Finch and an obscene over commitment of something like 5 helicoptors and 50 people to assassinate them. These people don't play nice or care at all about law/morals. Besides they already knew they were strong and powerful considering how they slaughtered that overcommitment. Its not new information.

            That said the GM could have had it blow up in their faces if they said screw politics. It's impossible to know at this point. It's just frustrating because there were two moments where they almost played it genre savvy enough. First when Juniper suggested assassination and second when Juniper almost preemptively attacked Yarrow. Not a knock on the writing, I'd just personally take that as a sign that if the GM is going to escalate no matter how nice you play you should beat him there to grab what advantages you can. Hell every single time they've shown their enemies mercy in this story it gets thrown back in their face.

              Yeah, except one of the duo explicitly confirmed that they were sent by Hyacinth and then they grabbed everyone but Raven. You know, *Uther's Knight* Raven. It may not be enough to bring Hya to justice, but it's certainly something.

              And then June returns, bloody and angry, and tells the exact same story (including the part about "Hya sent us"), even shows the site it happened at, if he manages to secure it. And everyone gets a message, don't fuck with June, he'll beat you without entads or magic, on your ground, after being tortured and with minimal preparation on his side. It's more powerful than "June can sense an obvious trap but can only respond with violence".

              - u/burnerpower:

                Well the duo did say that, but then Hyacinth says nuh uh and disavows all responsibility. It quickly becomes a game of he said she said that Juniper can't win being technically a fugitive and all.

                I'm not sure sending a message helps at all or that one is even being sent here. Ideally details about how exactly Juniper escaped and slaughtered the facility don't get out because one of his biggest advantages is no one understands just how wide his power set is. What utility does sending a message even has for him? Short of being killed its pretty clear Hyacinth/Larkspur have never heard of the sunk cost fallacy. They just won't give up.

    The Armateurs are introduced twice, with overlapping exposition. Once in Rosemallow's house

    > A suit of armor was half-hidden against one wall, which I might have dismissed as more ostentatious decoration if Amaryllis hadn’t already clued me in. It was actually an automaton, one made by an entad that had been churning them out at a sedate pace for five hundred years. The Armateur would follow some simple directions and had its own version of the Three Laws, though those laws only applied to Penndraigs rather than all humans.

    Once in the castle.

    > The Armateurs were entad-made, churned out by an entad that could make one every month or so. I had seen one back at Erstwhile Manor, but it was just one, and here there were lots of them. They were robots, or a magical equivalent to them, without all that much intelligence. In physical appearance, they were like suits of armor, but with limbs and torsos that were so slender they couldn’t possibly have held a person. Each had a long, thin sword that was part of their construction, which they would use when they were ordered to, or when something in their internal logic dictated they should. When Amaryllis began describing their rules, I immediately recognized them as Asimov’s Three Laws, though adapted so that ‘human’ was replaced with ‘Penndraig’ (not that ‘human’ would have been that much less problematic in a world like Aerb’s).

  The whole soul thing was brilliant too - I'm guessing that Y and Z intended to put the group to sleep, check their souls, and then wake them up.

I mean I would be pretty unwilling to let a random passerby go to the hells let alone someone that i might be in pretty constant contact with for months at a time you know?

  So for those of you who have been theorizing about Amaryliss’s resemblance to Dahlia possibly indicating that she is a entad created clone or deaged version of her (perhaps made for purposes of maintaining Entad inheritance), how does the latest reveals about the politicking of Rosemallow vs Hyacinth factor into that?

  This might be a weird detail to ask about, but what is "necrium" in your world? 

  Googling the term only spits out Hearthstone cards and discussion related to them. In Hearthstone it seems to be a chemical substance that allows one to experience all the positive effects of death without actually dying.

  Googling it with "-hearthstone -warcraft" to exclude all that stuff  then the only links left are literally the Twitch and Twitter accounts of a guy called Necrium.

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    The naming is probably just coincidence, as it's "necro-" (meaning death) and "-ium", which you use for, uh, abstract nouns. I don't have a working knowledge of Latin, and Aerb doesn't actually use Latin either, it uses a different precursor language that was originally a conlang created by a small but intellectually influential nation of canine Animalia.

    On Aerb, necrium is the poop of a now-extinct magical creature. Necrium's chief property is that it starts quite soft and hardens with exposure to the (now excluded) necrotic field effect, which is found most commonly when things died. Hence, working with necrium is incredibly difficult, as it needs to be worked absent any deaths of higher animals within a fairly wide range. Once finished being worked, it can be exposed to NFE and will continue to harden with more NFE exposure with no upper limit (except the practical limits of creating NFE exposure), which is useful in a wide variety of applications. As the magical creature that creates necrium is extinct and the NFE is excluded, it's impossible to make anything out of necrium except via e.g. finding an unworked and hardened supply and then using exotic carving methods.

    Maybe turning Soul energy to matter through an entad, or something similar to what Solace did with a skeleton - tapping the latent magic in bones to craft tough armor on the spot instead of consuming them for stats.

    Would make sense considering its use here was described as "claws of polished necrium", in a room full of white stuff.

        That's fair. I think you are right that it went off the rails by applying lethal force to his companions, and that escalation is probably going to bring down the entire faction that put this together. I think she was trying to save her brother and went too far.

  Hm. Yarrow seems to have implied that there is some hidden consequence to the pain stick, which I imagine is going to back to bite Juniper in the ass at some point, even more than just his turning off of pain will. Also, Zinnia is the name of a character from Pokemon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, though I imagine it was chosen on the basis of a flower rather than that.

  Good to see Juniper kicking ass and taking names again, even if his genuine frustration bleeds so believably out of the narrative that I find myself getting irritated reading it. I think my ideal conclusion to this arc would be him walking up to a Hyacinth throwing political threats against him and handing her over to Amaryllis.

  As usual, amazingly well-written. Thanks for the chapters!

      That's obviously not reasonable at all. There are so many downsides I don't know where to begin.

      Killing a prominent member of the court in front of everyone and then doing an extraordinary illegal thing, moreso than even murder, is a great way to get literally the entire government and people against you. You destroy Mary's position and kill any hope she has of getting anything it of Anglcyn. You make yourself out to be the villain to every nation and person (terrifying unregistered soul mate). You lose your working relationship with Uniquities. 

      Even if you had her nailed to the wall with irrefutable evidence, that course of action would be terrible since there's still a procedure to things.

    My only other thought besides the obvious ones that others mentioned, was that the pain stick makes you act impulsively, or maybe angrily, besides just making you feel pain. I can imagine these feelings helping being used to get confessions.

  So one thing that occurred to me after reading this is that Hyacinth had no reason to sign onto the Yarrow plan or to foment it, because her foe is currently negotiating her surrender. So, since we know that it's from her faction, what if this represents an internal dissent within the faction, and Hyacinth winds up flipping over it?

  That would be fascinating, and a great moment for Juniper. By which I mean it would piss him off even more and I would laugh.

  - u/scruiser:

    She might have intended for Yarrow to engage in a quick peak and subtle manipulation of Joon’s soul, only for Raven to be immune to the sleep, forcing one escalation in that they had to make it a brief kidnapping and then Yarrow to be rendered catatonic making Zinnia decide to escalate even further.

    A scenario with Hyacinth turning on Zinnia and Yarrow (and possibly Onion) seems plausible, but I think it would be less she flips in favor of Juniper and more she scapegoats and backstabs Zinnia/Yarrow/Onion.

  In the moment, I didn't see a way out of the dilemma for Juniper. Doing anything disruptive is fundamentally a political error.

  Until the reveal, I thought the joke was going to be a René Magritte special complete with "Ceci n'est pas une pipe"

  This then leaves the possibility for it to be anything, including *nothing*.

  After I was done reading, I did think of a third option, to just leave. Per previous points it would be weird, an overabundance of caution that would be presented as paranoia by any opposition.

    Consider the following:

    * The name "Arthur" comes from Artorius, meaning "Son of the Bear". Arthur called himself Uther, father of Arthur, conceptually connecting himself to the Bear.

    *  Arthur has a large presence in conceptual space, and can manipulate his own presence therein and use it to fight other concepts. So these Kabbalah-style connections may be more than simple word games.

    * The word "bear" simply means "brown". The proto-indo-european word for bear, "rkto", dissappeared from many nothern languages because people feared that speaking the bear's actual name would cause it to appear.

    * Arthur has an entad which teleports him to the last person who spoke his name aloud. 

    * When Juniper first pumps up soul magic to 100, he notes that he can't change his true name, but that it used to be possible to do so. Arthur is history's greatest soul mage.

    * Shia LaBeauf's ability to appear when his name is spoken is not part of the original RPG. Nor is it one of Juniper's inventions. It's something that *Arthur* came up with.

    * We don't actually know what the summoned Shia beast looks like. We do know that he wipes out all witnesses and can become arbitrarily strong to overcome obstacles.

    * Arthur was noted to be able to pull new magic and abilities out of thin air to just barely overcome any obstacle thrown at him.

    The conclusion is inescapable. Arthur became convinced that Aerb was not meaningfully real. In a desperate attempt to escape from the Narrative, he severed himself from the concept of Uther, changed his truename to Shia LaBeauf and now tries to wipe away all further evidence of his existence.

  What a fucking rollercoaster set of chapters holy hell. I can only imagine how pissed Juniper must be feeling cause I echoed that sheer rage in what was happening to him.

They were attacked on neutral ground during peace talks, as far as I'm concerned the enemy deserves no mercy. I understand why Juniper hesitated but fuck when I just imagine Yarrow's smug face as he sets up his stupid joke before trying to kidnap and soulfuck Juniper unprovoked I lose any compassion for anyone associated with them. Should have just gone with Juniper's suggestion ages ago and just burned the Lost King's Court to the ground.

    I'm on team "everything is easier in hindsight, and people who try to do the rational thing in the moment still screw up sometimes."  But to try to dig down a little deeper here:

    Because this was to a large extent a socially oriented con, which isn't really playing to Juniper's strengths.  Because he was under time pressure, and he came up with a potential solution quickly and then got a bit fixated on the dilemma between using that solution or letting Yarrow proceed.  I think in Juniper's mind the two choices of what was happening was innocuous or serious attempt at attack, and  maybe it was hard to dial down to more moderate responses when any response at all is acting on the belief that there's a serious attack underway.

    But mainly I'm going with hindsight bias and time pressure.

  Oh, ffs.

  /u/alexanderwales, that capture scene was made out of bullshit and railroad tracks. That's the first time in the entire story that I've felt that way; every other mistake that the characters made was perfectly sensible based on their characterization and what they knew at the time, and it added a lot to the story to see the main characters being imperfect. This one was just nonsense. Juniper had JUST SAID that he would take action if Yarrow tried to light the pipe, then Yarrow lights the pipe and Juniper just stands there? His choices weren't "kill the guy" or "do nothing". Off the top of my head, he could have:

  * Used blood magic to make a tendril that grabbed the pipe and snatched it away
  * Used still magic to prevent Yarrow from moving
  * Used air magic to blow out the lighter
  * Used unicorn bones to set a savepoint before the pipe lit 
  * Used passion magic to knock the pipe out of Yarrow's hands
  * Used the vine armor (and yes, he should have been dressed for war; he was a damn bodyguard)
  * Used any of the ink items that he should have had that would allow him to disable someone
  * The obvious one: walked over and physically taken the pipe away. It took multiple seconds to light it, so Juniper had plenty of time.

  Seriously. He walked completely unprepared into a dangerous situation with a major antagonist, recognized a threat, warned the guy, then did absolutely nothing to stop it.

  His lack of caution in all the other chapters is excusable -- he's probably being affected by passion magic to make him more emotional/reckless and less logical/forethoughtful, plus he was in a very risky situation where time was of the essence, plus he knew he had a lot of ways to survive damage. The capture thing? Unless we get a justification later ("he was being affected by an entad that there was no evidence of") then this was the laziest writing I've ever seen on this sub, let alone from you.
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    I didn't read it that way. June is aware of those other options:

    >. I’d said no demonstrations, and I’d said that I would attack him, but I didn’t know where to draw the line. Surely I would at least have to stop him if he tried to light the pipe. He stopped when the tobacco was in the pipe, looking it over, and then looked up at me. “Have you thought that from my perspective, letting my decisions be dictated by someone who pretends not to have any particular limits on what grievious violence he would inflict means that I would end up ruled by threats, even when those threats would never actually be carried out? It would be terrible policy.”

    >I stood where I was and slowly drew my sword. I had other options, like trying to slice the entad from his hands, but he was right that this really wasn’t what I was here to do. 

    June's concern is that there is a good chance that the play in progress is that Yarrow's trying to provoke him into an aggressive move that would trigger safeguards from the castle robots, or generally have some reputational effects. Once his 'if you still try to do this after my threat, you must be malicious' argument is rebuffed by the 'yielding to threats is bad strategy, so I may attempt to do this even nonmaliciously' counterargument, he really is trapped in a situation which he can't defuse with his low socials.

    .. though he probably could have just walked out - but that means abandoning Amaryllis.

    Thus he gives permission for the demonstration:

    >“Go ahead,” I said, with my sword drawn.

    Hoping to react fast enough if it is an attack.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I should say upfront that I really, really hate "character spends lots of time going through their options in a scene that realistically happens over the course of about thirty seconds", not just because I think they're generally boring and unrealistic, but because they're murder on the pacing of a scene and don't convey the actual speed at which things happen and how little time you have in the moment to react.

    That aside, most of Juniper's concerns here are *political*. He's worried that it's a trap of some kind, a deliberate provocation that will put him in hot water, deprive Amaryllis of an asset, escalate toward other violence, etc. Almost all the options for stopping Yarrow either constitute assault or aggravated assault by the standards of English common law, or result in only a delay.

    Further, Juniper is both confident in his abilities and has a narrow window of weaknesses, meaning that even taking narrative and DM fuckery into account, whatever the pipe does is not necessarily going to instantly incapacitate him, if it does anything at all (which it might not, if it's intended solely as a provocation). The pipe is a trap of some kind, but Juniper doesn't know what kind of trap it is, and a wide variety of actions might constitute walking into that trap. Better to wait to see what it does and react afterward with full moral and legal authority as the defender, especially if the attack surface is very small. Juniper says after, in the blacksite, that he's especially pissed off because they shouldn't even have known that sleep was what he was particularly weak against.

    (You could probably do some kind of probability distribution with regards to expected intentions of Yarrow and outcomes, but you wouldn't be able to realistically do it in the moment without pulling numbers from your ass.)

    I'm sorry if the scene didn't live up to your expectations for either the characters or my writing, it just felt like a weak place for munchkinry to me, especially when the focus was (in my mind) more on the political side.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      Another point is that most of the methods he would use to stop Yarrow, namely air, bone, blood, ink, and passion magic, he doesn't have legally. He would be revealing to an acknowledged opponent that he is breaking Imperial law, which could probably land him in more hot water than making a political scene, and would be harder to escape the consequences of.

        All he really needed to do though was to just grab the pipe out of his hands. It wouldn't even be assult, just thievery. Or he could slice the pipe in two, that just would have been destruction of property

        - u/sicutumbo:

              Well, yeah, but what happened was far-fetched too.

              It's easy with hindsight to say "he should have grabbed the pipe", but if he'd grabbed the pipe and been captured that way, people would say "Joon had the idiot ball, while would he grab the pipe, the guy was obviously baiting him, he should have done X instead".

              Point is, given that Joon didn't know what would happen in advance, and he had less than 10 seconds to react. It makes sense he wouldn't immediately guess the right answer.

          the latter would have been brandishing a weapon against an imperial prince in a room with armatures during intense negotiations on hallowed ground, the former would have been the smart move but realistically resulted in the same as Zinne and Yarrow would have accurately claimed that a guy threatening to kill you and then rushing towards you is grounds for self-defence  

          Joon was basically screwed the moment he made the threat towards Yarrow instead of say rushing out of the room or jumping him before he had a chance to react. Or succeeding in  a social roll to ask to go to the bathroom.

          - u/TheColourOfHeartache:

            You're assuming that Joon drew a sword and threatened him. 

            There's no reason why he couldn't have told Yarrow to put it away then immediately remove it from his hand when he doesn't.

        - u/TheColourOfHeartache:

    - u/uwu-bob:
      ```
      What felt frustrating when reading the scene was that Joon said, "If you use an unknown entad around me I'll stop you" and then just.. doesn't do it. That's what feels like railroading.

      If there had been a paragraph where he pointed out he's bluffing, won't stop the prince for political reasons, and is confident in his ability to resist any harmful effects, then it would be fine.

      The problem isn't taking suboptimal actions, the problem is pointing out the right-in-hindsight action and then not taking it for unclear reasons.
      ```

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      I feel like given this answer Joon's actions make even less sense than they did when I read the chapter. 

      If Joon's worried about the political consequences of his actions, drawing his sword and threatening to kill a prince is far far far more politically costly than half the actions on eaglejarl's list. Walking over and taking the pipe (or the lighter if he's worried about touching an entad) out of his hands would be better politically and practically.

      He's already got a bunch of political capital from being threatened with an unknown entad; no matter how much Yarrow tries to play it of as a joke we've just had a couple of chapters making it very clear that paranoia is institutional an court politics. Politically speaking that pipe was taking out a gun in what should have been diplomatic talks, Joon was well within his rights to take it and put it on a table then demand concessions for being threatened.
      ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      I think people (myself included) are evoking the idiot ball not because it's completely unbelievable that Joon would have a moment of indecision based on political concerns or overconfidence in his own abilities, but rather it wasn't convincingly established in the text leading up to it. What /u/eaglejarl summarized is essentially a textbook drawback to the protagonist having too many options (specifically including many mental enhancements that are hard to quantify and fairly lend to overestimation). So while there are plausible defenses for Joon's oops moment, it still *feels* like an unsatisfying idiot ball moment to a higher proportion of readers because expectations have been set and there's a lot of pressure on making every decision nigh unimpeachable. Whether this is fair on you, like we're setting you up to fail as some sort of Pygmalion effect, is debatable, but once you have a big enough audience, you'll naturally have readers who are liberal with backseat-gaming-ish calls of 'this decision was stupid, *nobody* (i.e. me) would've done this'.

      If I had to do an ass-pull probability distribution, it'd be heavily in eaglejarl's favor of Joon using one of his many non-lethal interventions, after weighing the choice points on both sides:

      ---
      > +Characters don't get to realistically review their multiple choice answer in a split second(s). 
      > 
      > +Juniper has a preference and priority for resolving Mary's business non-violently. 
      > 
      > +Joon is confident in the confidence interval of effects that can affect him. 
      > 
      > +Joon wants the moral/legal high ground.
      >
      > +Yarrow outplayed Joon socially with the game.
      >
      > +Joon was conservative about leaking information versus the small range of effects that could incapacitate him.

      ---

      > -Like /u/foveros said, the false dichotomy stuck out to me. In text, the exact moment is the line "I was, after all, threatening to end his life." Joon had a lot of magical options, but he also had simple choices. 'Fight or flight' doesn't usually mean 'kill or wait'.
      > 
      > -In text, Yarrow was confrontational from the moment they entered = strong prior.
      > 
      > -Joon/Raven just brought up the inevitability of narrative railroading in the previous chapter - where is Joon's appreciation for Murphy's Law in a world ruled by narrative?

      > -Repeated narrative build-up of not letting enemies have the first move advantage.
      > 
      > -Joon wasn't born in Aerb yesterday, nor was everyone else in the party. Joon is *the* entad specialist, but all of the party are experienced and should have a healthy protocol for unknown entads (diffused responsibility during this entad-gun-cocking?). Personally I would've preferred gradual social cues during the game that Joon could've acted on before Yarrow 'blindsided' him with a slow-to-act but high i-factor entad.

      > -Other points already raised above

      In hindsight, the politics angle might've been a bit of a narrative trap that pigeonholed Joon into forgetting his priorities (value of his life).

      But also in hindsight, I don't think this matters in the big picture - the following chapters were a great, immediate leg up and slaking the action drought made Joon's lapse a lot more forgettable. And thanks for slaking the actual chapter drought during the holidays! I really miss the days of a chapter every other day but the chunks have also helped with my reading habits now that I don't have a constant incentive to stay up-to-date.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        I do agree that it's much more of a writing failure than anything else, particularly in capturing Juniper's mental state and priorities, and it's unfortunate that for a lot of people, the only takeaway from ~45K words is that one moment. It *is* meant to be a mistake, just not in the sense that some readers are taking it, i.e. a lack of caution.


        I think another part of the problem, from a writing perspective, is that Juniper's gut reaction is right-in-hindsight, which people will find unsatisfying. It should be clear why Juniper made the threats that he did, and also why, when that threat failed, he decided that he couldn't follow through with it. I don't know that this is clear enough in the text right now. Unfortunately, there's also the question of taking some weaker preventative actions, which muddle the issue, and which I didn't (and don't) think would actually strengthen the chapter, except insofar as they would *maybe* help avoid these kinds of reactions/conversations.

        I probably won't be rewriting the scene to help clarify Juniper's thoughts, partly because I detest the backseating (as opposed to discussion of how and why characters make the choices they do) and don't want to even remotely encourage it, and partly because I doubt that I could write a replacement that would actually satisfy both me and the people who are complaining.

        (Regarding unknown entads ... there are a lot of them, and part of the reason that Heath/Aster/Basil make an appearance, other than to flesh out the court, provide exposition, demonstrate conflict avoidance through threat, set up some future stuff, etc. is to help show that entads are very common and expected. Yarrow himself is wearing obvious entad armor of unknown function, which has *hopefully* been shown as the norm, given several examples. Juniper himself is wearing four or five visibly: you can't treat every entad whose function you don't know as inherently dangerous and/or a threat. There *is* reason to here, obviously, and especially after the fact, but that has to be weighed against the fact that everyone is carrying unknown entads all the time.)

        - u/nytelios:

          Don't worry about it - it's just negativity bias peeking its ugly head out. Even knowing it (like they say, knowledge ≠ immunity), I was disproportionately bothered despite recognizing the legitimate explanation. I think there's a complex cocktail of reasons for the spotlight - besides the contextual stuff I mentioned above, it's a moment that felt inevitable but readers still built up the anxiety of when/where/how and when it finally happens through a fluke and Joon's explicit failure to act, it's like an unsatisfying anticlimax. Readers are invested in Joon and, like passion mages, Joon's subsequent powerlessness and frustration might be getting channeled here.

          Re: the 'mistake' - I think the interpretation of least resistance for us readers was a lack of caution. It's a high stakes situation where, if past episodes serve as a guide, there can never be enough paranoia. Besides, there's always a strong narrative preference of action over omission. 

          Now that you mention it, all the Caledwich entad references (fashion and function) were a really nice touch that sadly went over my head (but it's not too subtle, I just missed it). I don't think it's enough to beat out the other dissonance, but the high variability of entad i-F is also a pain in the ass to write around.

          Anyway, sorry about the backseating and harping about details. I support not rewriting because it's not worth the drain on you mentally and time-wise. Maybe someday if/when this is getting published, someone more qualified than us can chime in.

          Happy new year. Still in awe that we lucky few have more a million words worth of a great story. Thanks for the marvelous gift.

      I never said he had to go through all the options,I simply pointed out that he had a lot of them. The best would have been to use air magic to prevent the lighter from working but pretend he was doing nothing -- just stand there and watch as Yarrow fails to make it work. Maybe say "Looks like your lighter is dead. Do you need to get another one?" Completely deniable, no diplomatic consequences, prevents any possible issue from the pipe. Why give someone with an unknown entad a free shot, no matter what your resources are?

        Hindsight is 2020. The pipe could have been a distraction while Zinne pulled out the real trap or just an empty threat meant to provoke Juniper into revealing his hand or a clumsy attempt to attack one of his many many unknown defense easily countered and tipping the political negotiations in their favor or a setup for the next dumbest entad demonstration. Yarrow could have been blackmailed into making himself a target, someone publicly known for never backing down from a dare etc. 
        This outcome was *overall* much more improbable than a fight breaking out in the middle of Caledwich and causing a scandal which would have arguably been worse than what actually happened. Wanting the protagonist to be smart is one thing. Wanting them never to be wrong is quite another.

      I just want to note that authors of serials are placed in a unique position where they receive a lot of feedback in the midst of their story, and that there's a certain response bias in the type of person and the type of comment they are likely to receive.  I've noticed that the author of The Gods Are Bastards has, more than once, tailored parts of subsequent chapters to be pretty direct replies to comments that have bugged him.  I'm not sure I love the idea of a vocal minority having that much influence on a writer!

      Which is my long winded way of getting around to saying that my read on the chapter seems to match up with what you say you were trying to get across: that Juniper was put in a difficult social situation, which he wasn't really prepared for---worse he fell victim to a carefully planned (and perhaps repeatedly executed) con.  That he wasn't sure what the consequences of assaulting or interfering with Yarrow would be, that he was leery of the consequences of outright fleeing and abandoning Mary.  That given his defensive abilities maybe the risk wasn't so great.  That decisions are tough in time pressure.  That social pressure is a real thing, and that it can be hard to push back against people making an effort to be friendly and nice to you, and who have already gotten you caught up in a friendly conversation/game. 

      Which is my longer winded way of saying that at least some of your readers think the chapter worked well as written, and was consistent with Juniper's capabilities and character.

      The Pipe Dream not interact with Still Magic was what was surprising to me. I'd rather Joon not have reacted or reacted clearly wrongly than try and fail in a way that seemed to conflict with what I thought I understood about Still Magic.

      Is there any exposition about that incoming? Because clearly Joon was under the same impression.

      The lead up was a lot of fun, though. I've learned more about aquatic dinosaurs and the etymologies of their names in the past few hours looking for puns than I would have ever done otherwise. No regrets.

        I agree it feels a little narratively unsatisfying that Still Magic 100 got no-selled so hard by a mid-tier mook with a trinket, but they had just discussed how the DM was likely to railroad them into conflict no matter what decisions they made.

    Yarrow put Juniper in a no-win situation. Joon could either sit back and take the entad attack, or he could do any of the things you suggested and cause a diplomatic incident that would worsen Amaryllis's position (because, no matter how reasonable and proportional Joon's use of force is, Hyacinth is _obviously_ going to spin it as an unprovoked act of assault, theft, and/or vandalism).

    Now, if Juniper had known _exactly_ what the entad did and what would happen to his party as a result, he would have obviously stopped Yarrow and dealt with whatever consequences followed. But Joon is operating under uncertainty. From his perspective, it's equally likely that the entad is a weapon meant to damage his party as that the entad is harmless and the _real_ attack is political, a way of baiting Juniper into throwing the first punch. Because he is protected by still magic, among his numerous other abilities, and he has powerful allies in the room, Juniper makes the call to allow Yarrow to make the first move, betting on his party's ability to tank the first hit and strike back from the moral high ground if Yarrow is indeed planning to attack them. Unfortunately for Juniper, the entad _just happened_ to attack him in one of the few ways he is vulnerable to harm. As he correctly notes in the next chapter, this is _bullshit_; there is no way they could have known Juniper is vulnerable to sleep, and the chance that they would _just happen_ to use an attack that bypassed Juniper's defenses is microscopic. Obviously the DM's hand was at work here. Is poor Joon to blame because an omnipotent deity is clearly railroading his life in the interest of placing him into more interesting situations?

    Cliff notes version of the last ~25 chapters:

    Joon goes to the Atheneum of Sound and Silence to learn Still and Vibration magic. Harold the spirit magic thingy attacks the people of the city with the aid of an organization that wants the world to end. This happens as Joon is finishing his time in the temple that lets you learn still magic. Harold causes large numbers of people to form a summoning choir that immanentizes the Mome Rath. Fortunately, the Council of Arches murders Harold and the end-the-world people with the aid of the unkillable demihuman from Uniquities, but unfortunately, the Mome Rath is successfully summoned. In a really cool fight scene, Joon climbs up on the Mome Rath and uses blood and bone magic to massively debuff it, allowing Bethel to stab it to death. The tuunglings help with the cleanup. During the fight, Joon discovers the Still Magic capstone. When he tries to use the Jenner's eye tattoo to never have to sleep again (allowing him to keep Still Magic 100, and thus Prince's Invulnerability and the temporary soul magic skill buffs, up forever), the DM excludes Skin Magic to within a couple-hundred-mile-radius of the city.

    The Council of Arches claims the Isle of Poran and dumps the tuunglings on it, declaring it the sovereign Republic of Miunun. Bethel rapes Joon, who straight up resorts to soul magic to deal with it. The rest of the Council of Arches decides that Bethel is a bit too evil for them, but Valencia figures out how to defuse the situation and left with Bethel to do counseling/therapy/teaching-how-to-be-a-valuable-non-sadistic-community-member on her/it. 

    The Isle of Poran is visited by dragons, who point out that Bethel violated a flight ceiling dictated by the Draconic Confederacy while fighting the Mome Rath. They want them to kill Blue-in-the-Bottle in two months. The Council of Arches has not made any progress on that front yet. Also, we are abrubtly informed of the Schlossvolk and the lengths that one has to go to to remember their existence for extended periods of time. Also, Joon's bipolar mom teaches him water magic, which is a weird depression metaphor. As you can probably tell, I did not like that update very much.

    Via the Warrens, the Council of Arches goes to Anglecynn. Amaryllis's childhood diaries have been published by Rosemallow.

    Then the chapters that have just been released.

    Ongoing things that need to be taken care of: Blue-in-the-Bottle, Draconic diplomacy, getting a food source for Miunun, industrializing Miunun, Anglecynn political stuff (Rosemallow, Amaryllis's inherited stuff, Hyacinth), Schlossvolk (maybe; not urgent), perhaps some of the lingering fallout from the Mome Rath incident.
