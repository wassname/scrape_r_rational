## [BST] Help me abuse physics

### Post:

In my [universe](http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com/), I have established in canon that its possible to create an Over-Unity Engine using a special material called [aetherium](http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com/post/124725708247/aetherium).

It's currently known that you can use a very simple application of Aetherium oxide to produce lift. This is done by mounting a mass of Aetherium oxide to the end of a flywheel. On the lower half of the swing, an electric current is run through the material to reduce its mass. As the mass swings upwards, the energy is discharged and the weight of the material returns. This imbalance in force produces lift. 

Now, I'm certain that using similar principles, a form of over-unity engine could be conceived of that somehow outputs more energy then it takes to run, but I can't actually puzzle out in my head what such a thing would look like. I imagine broadly speaking, it would be some sort of mechanical engine that when electrical current is applied to some portion of it, produces torque to power a generator, in the process producing more power then was input in the first place. This is of course in violation of real world CofE, but in my fictional world, it should be possible given the special characteristics of the fictional material. It's a case of [minovsky physics](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics), and I'm curious how far it can be taken. Its meant to be broken, and I'm curious as to how exactly one could go about breaking it.

  You can easily generate energy with this. Have a dumbbell with two spheres (lumps; shape is irrelevant) of aetherium oxide. Rotate the dumbbell. After a sphere gets past the bottom and begins to ascend, run the current to reduce its mass. This is easy to lift. As a sphere gets past the top and begins to descend, stop the current and let it return to normal mass. In this manner, the falling sphere is always more massive, so you've produced a torque to rotate the dumbbell. You need only pay for friction and the electric current; the rest can be extracted through a generator.

    How would you take advantage of that outside of a gravity well? Would you mount the entire machine to a centrifuge ring?

      Sure.

      If you do this you need to have a counter-rotating thingy on the opposite site on the ring so you dont get movement of the ring.
      ```

      - u/Sagebrysh:

        unless you *want* movement of the ring. The mass gradient could also be used to produce thrust as well as power.

  Any reactionless drive with an efficiency greater than 300 MW/N can be used as a perpetual motion machine. W/N also works out to m/s. If you have something moving faster than its efficiency, it produces more kinetic energy then it uses energy, and if you add in regenerative breaking you have a perpetual motion machine.

  Others have pointed out a more efficient way to do it in your case, but I like to answer the general problem.

  The creation of Over-Unity Engines is energetically favored, and there is a half-life-per-cubic-centimeter rate at which space spontaneously becomes transformed into suns. Once created, they release energy into the regions around them which, while subject to the inverse square law, still provide energy to use to accelerate the process in the surrounding space since it has a higher energy density to use to spontaneously cause the transformation.

  Your universe catches on Over-Unity fire and burns down immediately because you made hard vacuum flammable and the kindling point absolute zero. We have thermodynamics for a reason. Don't violate it.

    That doesn't mean that the process to reach that point doesn't take billions of years and the evolution of systems powerful enough to perform general computation.

    > and there is a half-life-per-cubic-centimeter rate at which space spontaneously becomes transformed into suns

    Objection. Assuming point not in evidence.

    > you made hard vacuum flammable and the kindling point absolute zero

    Objection. Assuming point not in evidence.

    Counterexample: Greg Egan's _Clockwork Rocket_ series.

    This is a very dull and meaningless sentiment, formed out of a reactionary attitude towards crackpots.  We have not observed any systems that output more energy than they take in, but this doesn't imply that such a thing is impossible: only that it doesn't spontaneously generate very often - rather like life, which we've only observed one instance of.  The lack of something in nature doesn't imply that it's impossible to build - nor does our difficulty in figuring out how to build it.

    Conservation of energy is not a wall for humanity to turn back at, but rather a problem for us to solve, like death.

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      We have extensive experimental and mathematical evidence for a lack of systems that can decrease entropy on net and output more energy than they take in. We have no particular reason to believe that it's possible, any more than we have a reason to believe we'll later discover that creationism is true and gravity is a lie.

- u/varno2:
  ```
  You need to put this into the context of Noether's theorem. The thing to note here is that energy is not conserved the laws of physics change over time, as the conservation of momentum is broken in the manner in which you have chosen to demonstrate the laws of physics change over distance and over space.  

  Congratulations you now have a dimension where there is magic. Biology will happily evolve to function using this aetherium. As there is a preferred distance and location general and special relitivity are out of the window. As similarly quantum mechanics is significantly changed, and conservation of information probably does not hold.
