  Has there been any books made with all of the articles in it?

    If you mean a compilation of the articles, I could make one.

      Thank you for the offer, but you don't need to go to the trouble to do so. I was actually wondering if there was anything already made by the writer(s) on the site since it likely would be professional quality. If no such book exists, then I would prefer to create it myself to best customize it to my tastes than accept a fan-made version from anyone else.
