## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  You know what would be a really cool justification for the "medieval stasis" trope?  Whenever a civilization becomes too advanced, dragons/aliens/ect become worried they will soon advance even more and be able to fight them, and so immediately wipe them out and burn their libraries and technology, and even attack their neighbors just in case some technology or knowledge had spread.  Thus, an extreme taboo against technology rises.

    Interestingly, we actually see this to an extent in real-life with nuclear technology, not just for weapons but also for energy. Most smaller less-developed countries are pretty content to just not even try to develop it because of the potential international shitstorm it would cause.

    As one example, Iraq makes for an interesting lesson of how a mere allegation of nuclear weapons development could be used as justification to bomb the country, overthrow its government, and execute its leader, causing about a million civilian excess deaths and creating two million refugees. Iran is another interesting example, one of the few who are openly trying to develop nuclear energy (and allegedly weapons) and they've been hit with trade sanctions, Stuxnet, multiple assassinations of their nuclear physicists (allegedly), and the constant threat of being subjected to an Israeli airstrike and missile barrage potentially backed up by a US invasion.

    In a fictional setting, I imagine much of this might be similar. Perhaps elves tolerate the humans as trading partners, but once they see their air and water becoming polluted by industrialization, they demand that the humans shut down their factories. If the humans are weak, the elves will simply invade, lay siege to their cities, burn their libraries, and destroy every factory they find. If the humans are strong(er), the elves impose trade sanctions, assassinate industrialists, sabotage factories, scare off superstitious workers with bad omens, and threaten to attack if the humans don't back down.

    As another possibility, maybe dragons claim dominion over all of the land and tolerate humans only as a useful way to extract gold, gems, and silver from the earth. As long as the humans maintain regular shipments of treasure to add to their hoards, the dragons will spare their fields and cities from being lit afire. However, each time the humans try to industrialize, develop gunpowder weapons, or attempt to unite their kingdoms, the dragons see the humans as a threat and basically go on a rampage, killing and destroying enough to set the humans back at least a few hundred years or so.

    Practical Guide to Evil has this with its Gnomes, though they don't form an important part of the plot in any way.

    It's also strongly implied that the stasis is maintained by the setting's capricious Gods, who view the world as a source of entertainment, gambling, and a philosophical testbed.

  If a healer existed who didn't need resources to restore peoples health existed, but was limited by touch, would the healer mostly be moved around or centralized?   Because the bigger the area/population the healer serves the more it becomes a need to get all the injured/sick to them instead of the healer to the masses.  Is my thinking correct?
  ```

  - u/AlmostNeither:

    I think that's usually true, but maybe not always.  Places with infrastructure will maximize the absolute number of people who have access to the supernatural healer, true.  But whether that's what you want to optimize will depend on what sorts of healing are most important.

    For example there are considerations like disease eradication.  A lot of the holdouts keeping the last enclaves of polio from being eradicated are regions where it is very difficult to build infrastructure or transport enough equipment and trained personnel.  A supernatural healer with less logistical overhead might be the ideal candidate to reach places like this.

    I could also imagine somebody with an ability like this being deployed with a global rapid response team to hotspots where new plagues are emerging.  Depending on the details of their ability, they might be really helpful in containing potential pandemics or even smaller but still serious outbreaks of infectious diseases before they can spread.

    But if all you're concerned about is maximizing patients treated or coordinating access, I think centralizing makes sense.

    It depends on how much time it takes them to do the healing, the type of healing they can offer, and the relative speed, cost, and safety of your available transportation methods.

    If the healing can be done instantly upon contact, then you'd ideally want some kind of setup which allows people to reach the healer as fast possible. This might favor centralizing the healer at a purpose-built facility, perhaps with the healer on one conveyor belt, and people to be healed moving along on two adjacent conveyor belts traveling in the opposite direction. If it takes anywhere from a few seconds to a minute, then on-site logistics are no longer a chokepoint, so you could plausibly have the healer traveling to reduce the logistical burden of transporting millions of people to them. If it takes hours or days to do the healing, then the logistical burden for transporting people to the healer becomes small, and there's a relatively greater advantage to having a consistent place for the healer to be so that the people in greatest need can be triaged and seen first.

    Regarding the type of healing, if they can fix literally anything - blindness, amputations, nerve damage, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, strokes, obesity, etc., then every city in the world could benefit from them. This was my assumed case for the paragraph above. If they can only heal 'injuries', like cuts, burns, gunshot wounds, broken legs, then the ideal approach might be to station them in areas with the highest expected need; probably large cities with high crime rates in peacetime, and then switching to secure locations near war zones or other conflict areas when such events occur.

    Transportation is the only other issue that I think would impact things. Obviously, losing the healer in a car accident would be devastating. I would expect road travel to resemble a presidential convoy, with police blocking off all side-streets and clearing the roads ahead of the healer's motorcade. Travel by air would need to be done with multiple redundant safety systems which are re-certified before every flight, with parachutes available, appropriate equipment for dropping into water or in dangerous territory, equipment for signalling rescue teams, and of course, having high-speed search-and-rescue teams on standby. Travel by ship would be risky due to the possibility of rogue waves, so it would have to be done exclusively in calm seas, avoiding storms at all times, and having evac available on the ship in case of unexpected weather changes. Higher transportation costs favor moving the healer to reduce the transportation burden, and higher transportation speeds also favor moving the healer since it takes less time out of their available time for healing.

    It depends on how powerful the healing is and how common comparable services are.

    If itâ€™s one person in the whole world and there are no other ways to be healed: they stay in place and have an administration around them to organize everything.

    If there are comparable services everywhere then the healer probably moves around to wherever their capacity is needed the most

  Hey all!  Back for more brainstorming on applications of antigravity crystals in a fantasy/steampunk setting.  


  Setting is floating islands held aloft by "magic" crystals.  the crystals are shards of a massive obelisk that shattered in a past cataclysm, and now  drift in orbit around it.  The crystals lift is proportional to their volume, so small slivers (3 cm) can be held in a heavy vial, and large crystals (2-3 m) can hold up an airship.  massive crystal complexes embedded in rock support entire islands that can sustain life. 

  Crystals emit an audible vibration, pitch based again on size, and exert a weak but wide range attractive force around them (akin to another form of gravity), allowing islands to stick together and causing condensation of water vapor in the immediate area.  this allows for weather cycles in the vicinity of large crystals and formation of permanent bodies of water on the islands. 

  Islands drift haphazardly and over time mini-continents will form and break apart, much more rapidly than earth tectonics.  this has allowed for migration between different islands by various species over the centuries. 

  Not 100% clear on what the planet below is like, been toying with it just being a gas giant with increasingly dense clouds giving way to a hot ocean the further down you go.  Behemoths prowl the depths, making exploration dangerous. 

  Tech level of civilizations is just barely post-medieval, with a recent Di Vinci style renaissance of flying contraptions and simple machines.  

  What kinds of fun contraptions might you expect that leverage this tech level and physics?
  ```

    If the islands are only loosely bound together through magical attractive forces, I think you would have people planting trees and other plants to attempt to bind islands together more than they naturally are. Failure of this system could mean that whatever polity is located near the edge would immediately lose some substantial amount of farmland, or possibly towns or cities. But until that happens, huge swathes of land dedicated to old growth forests isn't particularly profitable, so there's an individual incentive to turn that land towards either pasture land, or to turn all that lumber into something. This is very profitable until it suddenly isn't. Could work in various analogies for the destructive nature of clear-cutting, coastal erosiom, any number of things really.

    It really seems like earthquakes would be extremely common, though probably not as destructive overall. You might see architecture styles more similar to Japan even with an overall European aesthetic.

    You could leverage the floating crystals for architectural uses, if your population density is large enough to justify it. This could range from huge bridges that span far longer stretches than would be ordinarily possible, to impossibly tall but otherwise ordinary buildings, or any number of things.

    If levitation if not powered flight is relatively easy, I think you would see something equivalent to a crow's nest on ships, but for cities and towns. Communication speeds with medieval tech are the speed of a racing horse under normal conditions, but it's possible to get much faster speeds if you have long sight lines, like with mountains, by using some light source to send signals. If you just have rotating crews of people on platforms suspended hundreds of feet in the sky, you could replicate this and send morse code with large mirrors (or selectively blocked fires at night) to other platforms, dramatically speeding up communication speed. Tether the platforms to the ground with rope, have people go up and down ropes with small levitation platforms and then just pull themselves up the rope... I think it could work well. There's some obvious ability to perform scouting and surveying with this as well.

    The military uses of levitation are obvious. Lift rocks, drop them on approaching army. Any city could have a ring of platforms just for that purpose. Any artillery pieces would have ludicrous range, though you would have stability issues. The tether holding those platforms to the ground would be vulnerable, but also pretty hard to hit.

    I think you could have much better naval transport utilizing the floating crystals. You don't need deep water ports, sail boats could go far faster, rowing would be more effective since there's not nearly as much drag from the water, or you can just haul much more cargo. Obviously depends on substantial rivers and seas, but I think the ability to control your direction with oars would give these ships an edge over airships that need something more complicated to fly in opposition to the wind.

    Your world is going to have some huge elevation differences on its land, as individual islands don't precisely merge with the level of the main continent. Highly mountainous terrain, or equivalent, is going to incentivize relatively stagnant political maps over the large scale, because mountains are really, really difficult to move armies through. This may also stifle trade, and would lead to very interesting hydrology. The hydrology will probably need to be worked out in a bit of detail, because the rivers and oceans that connect different places are going to seriously affect political dynamics.

      lots of awesome thoughts, thanks for putting some time into this =) 

      The last point about hydrology and differing plateau levels is super interesting from a world-building standpoint.  Having massive waterfalls as common features could lead to advances in hydro power and mills as commonplace.  I hadn't considered this element but I like it a lot. 

      Securing the soil is also a major environmental concern that would be interesting to explore.  Poor farmers would be literally pushed to the "edge" of society, and be left scrabbling at loose earth with risk of losing chunks of their farmland to errant sky quakes. 

      Levitating artillery to increase range is also something I hadn't thought about much.  I have some ballistae already worked into some of the armies as common weapons, having batteries of them on levitating platforms would be pretty dope. 

      great ideas, lots to consider!

    What stops crystals from flying upward infinitely? If you left go of a raw crystal, would it just sail upward into space eventually?
    ```

      ```
      The obelisk is a special object in the history of the universe, it played a part in the creation of this world.  it is massive and fixed in it's position, and the crystal shards are attracted to it, resulting in eventual orbit at the same altitude. You can think of it as a mini solar system within the atmosphere of this planet
