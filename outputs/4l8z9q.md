  Short chapter. I wish there'd been more on how the Protectorate alternately stifles and aids in Parahuman uses of powers in the civilian side of things. There are some implications in canon and WoG that governments try to reduce the economic disruption of powers by stopping capes from using their powers in the private sector, which I thought this section was hinting at, but it was pretty short.

  Good part at the end with the way good people cooperate.

    Good to hear you thought it was short. When chapters don't feel long enough, you know you're improving.

    (Particularly since this was the longest chapter so far.)

  Taylor's insistence on returning to school continues to grate on me. I mean, she mentions how much of a waste of time it is each time it gets brought up, so why the fuck is she still doing it? She's literally signing up to waste her time ferrying heroes for the sake of being able to go waste time in (a more prestigious) school. What, does she think that her secret hero identity will not be able to find work because she doesn't have a school certificate? It would have been more believable if she was shown to have some incredibly important reason to not just drop out, but I just don't buy that explaining her situation and motivation to her father is that fucking hard for her. I guess I can just chalk it up to her being an idiot, but I was hoping to be able to hold her to a higher standard.

    For someone who strongly self-identifies as intelligent and upstanding, doing something as low-status as dropping out of school is very difficult. To Taylor, dropping out is something gang kids and would-be prostitutes do (oh my!), and in doing so herself she'd be associating herself with a thing associated with a bad thing, and thereby associating herself with a bad thing.

    Besides that, her father would *never* be okay with it, even if she were bringing in ten million dollars a day. All those arguments go even further for him, since he's had decades longer to associate school with virtue and dropping out with its absence.

      That's Amy-tier bad reasoning. It's not implausible for people to be that stupid, but seeing an [RST] tag sets my expectations for non-brain-deadness of characters to certain levels, and I'm disappointed when they don't live up to them. You'd think someone who strongly self-identifies as intelligent would have enough intelligence not to play meaningless status games for zero benefit.

      I can kind of see her doing it just for father's sake, but it doesn't sit well with me. I wouldn't behave like that, but, more importantly, I'd rather read the drama involved in Taylor having arguments with her father about it, than about her meekly getting into bad deals with Piggot and wasting her time on useless bullshit. 

      Well, nothing to be done about it, I guess. Hopefully some arsehole comes along and informs her of the opportunity costs (preferably measured in dead children) associated with her school bullshit. Would make for a satisfying "The Reason You Suck" speech at the very least.

        I haven't read the fic beyond the first chapter when it began (I was actually checking the comments here to see if I should), but beyond her father's sake, I'd think staying in school for her *mother's* would make more sense.  Annette was an English professor.  I could easily buy a line of reasoning where her mother had imparted a sense of the value of school and graduation as an end in and of itself.  "Dead mother's most sincere wish for her daughter's future" has enough sentimental value to overcome an enormous opportunity cost to staying in school.
        ```

          Hmm. Good point about Annette. Still, sometimes the sentimental mush is not really worth it. I hardly think that Taylor places such a huge terminal value on attending school, that the decision is a deliberate one and was made with decent understanding of the trade-offs involved. It looks more like she's just being an idiot, which is quite disappointing in a rationalist work.

          Room to grow is good too, though, so I'm not too salty about this. Sooner or later she'll have to realise how much of an idiot she is being right now.

        Honestly, that type of bad reasoning isn't the exception, it's the rule.  It also isn't conscious, it's almost entirely sub-deliberative, manifested in flinch reactions and nebulous feelings. If you don't spend a significant amount of time regularly investigating your mind and double checking your plans for flaws like that, you'll never notice they exist and never have even a chance of getting better. We just have high enough standards that the typical main characters of stories in this subreddit would never make a mistake like that.

        EDIT: So, I guess what I was trying to say was that, yes, it is a hilariously bad way to reason, but it's also really common, so it's entirely realistic that even a smart and somewhat rational person could make that type of mistake.

  I'm really enjoying this so far, mostly because I think there's not enough logistics and paperwork in fiction.

    Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

    Ahem.

  By popular demand, I've added a bit of clarification as to Taylor's decision to join the Logistics Register. If you're curious, search for "I wanted to groan."
