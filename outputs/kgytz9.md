  Doing God's Work is a fic about the gods. All of them. Every one of all the pantheons humanity has ever worshipped.

  Some time ago they all got into a war of dominance. Yaweh won.

  All the rest are now consigned to one level or another of Yaweh's oppressive corporate structure, answering prayers and otherwise being forced to use their powers or domains in the service of how Yaweh thinks things should be ran.

  Hardly anyone is particularly happy with this situation, least of all Loki, and their friend Lucifer.

  Story-wise there is almost no fairplay who-dunnit involved, as there are just so many gods coming in and out and suddenly being able to negate one or the other aspect of physics or reality that it's not really possible to anticipate who is going to shake things up next.

  The main characters do make solid plans however, all of which has to take into account shape-shifting, short-term prophecy, mind-reading, magic, and the temperments of everyone involved. A lot of negotiation and what's-in-it-for-me is involved, and is a great exercise in watching backstabbery and thinking one level higher, on all sorts of stakes.
