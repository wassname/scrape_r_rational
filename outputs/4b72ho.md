  ```
  The first several thousand words of this is all worldbuilding in report style -- "resources became available", "new volunteers were sent". Does it ever include any dialogue, characters, or plot?  If I'm going to read a story where the Nazis are the heroes, I would like there to be an actual story instead of just someone's worldbuilding notes.
