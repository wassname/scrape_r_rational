  Any hint of a suggestion of mental/hypnotic powers would jumpstart a very short feedback loop ending in omnipotence.

    I'm assuming there's a limit on how powerful he can be.

    This would have been an excellent super-villain character in Worm.

    EDIT: [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/31ki80/wp_you_are_placebo_man_your_superpowers_are/cq2wi40) what the author had to say on the power limitations

    >I didn't think of meta-powers like believing in infinite range. Clever, but I'd say no, his power is exploitable enough as it is. Believers have to be within the same room or a bit further - close enough that he can make use of powers near a group of enemies, far enough that he doesn't keep his powers between encounters. Having two conflicting beliefs is an interesting case, I'd say it goes by simple majority.
    Needing a majority would probably be the main limit on his powers. It would mean that he works best on small groups. Until he's established enough that people know him by reputation, fighting in a crowd will get his power drowned out by people saying "Placebo Man? Never heard of him."

      As far as we know, that might have been Sleeper's power.
      ```

        ```
        And then people believe he's extremely powerful, and then they believe he's the most powerful Stranger in the world because he can't be that powerful, and then he is.
        ```

        - u/Farmerbob1:
          ```
          And then they believe that since he isn't ruling the world, he apparently doesn't have any desire to do so.  So he doesn't.
          ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    My first assumption was that he had one, specific power that's dependent on whether the people around him believe in it or not; not that he's functionally omnipotent but just needs to convince someone of it first.
    ```

    ```
    Their power probably has an inbuilt limit to stop that kind of thing. Or maybe their shard adjusts their personality so that they don't think of that.

  ```
  Jenny Awesome in [Citadel](http://unillustrated.wordpress.com/). Still waiting for big fuckup by being among supervillains but a couple of smallish caused by social context are already there.
  ```

  - u/SkyTroupe:
    ```
    Oh thank you. I needed another Worm.
    ```

- u/Farmerbob1:

  Poor Jenny.  The power makes her miserable because it's always on.  It also makes her very vulnerable to people who have been conditioned.  Jenny would be the absolute last hero you would send to go deal with a cult, for example, because she would join it instantly if surrounded by enough true believers.

  And, inside her own head, as her power made her do whatever cult-y things she was doing, she would be perfectly aware of what is going on.

  It's actually a rather frightening power.
  ```

  - u/WalkingHorror:
    ```
    Oh hell yeah it is. Villains, cults and generally religious and troubled/delusional people aside, how long would it take for one of her fanboys to think "it would be awesome if I could sleep with her", with the speed of her popularity growth? She needs entourage of people aligned with her actual desires at all times and needs to be forcefully kept away from crowds.
    ```
