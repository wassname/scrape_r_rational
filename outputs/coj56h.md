## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have a store of energy. By touching an object and speaking a one word command, you can infuse it with some of this energy, which will be used to move said object in order to fulfill the command. The object moves autonomously; you cannot control it further than the initial command without touching it again and giving it a new command.
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Can I command an object to "serve" or "obey", so it can then take further commands? What happens if I tell a computer to "improve"? Can I tell a lump of uranium ore to "separate" to get bomb-ready material? Can I tell a piece of paper with an unsolved theorem on it to "prove"? Can I tell a piece of paper with an algorithm written for an infinitely fast computer on it to "execute"?
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    This is a similar power to BioChromatic Breath in Sanderson's Warbreaker; the major difference is the "one word command" bit. 

    A lot of the implications would be similar, like resurrection (as has already been pointed out).

      As of now, I'm thinking roughly 20 thousand J maximum, regenerating at roughly 1 J per second.

        I think you're gonna need way more than 20,000 joules. Isn't that like 5 Calories worth of energy? What could you do with that?
        ```

        - u/Duck__Quack:
          ```
          20kJ is enough to, for example, accelerate a two-ton car from rest to jogging speed/just over 3 m/s. Or enough to slowly lift a 50 kg human (or shoes that contain one, such as yourself) up by 40 meters. You could increase the air pressure of a 320 sq. ft room by a quarter of a percent or so. You could bring two gallons of water to boil from room temperature.

          At one joule per second of replenishment, you could do one of these every six hours or so. Or less feats more often. For example, a 150 ml cup of tea every seven minutes or so.

          This is to say nothing of the implications that come with presumably violating Newton's third law. All sorts of our thoughts about inertia would go straight out the window.
          ```

          - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
            ```
            Oh ok I get it you can do some minor things. I understand now. Can you show me the calculations for the car and two gallons of water to boil from room temp? I tried to work the numbers but for the first one I got K=(1/2)mv^2=(1/2)(1000 kg)(3 m/s)^2=45000 J. Could this be solved by the replenish rule you have? If so does it work while the object is under the influence of the command you imparted?
            ```

    Before I munchkin, I want to point out that a one word limit is more arbitrary than logical. If the autonomy of the infused object has limited processing power, that should still allow it to follow multiple word commands. There are plenty of one word commands that are more complex conceptually than entire sentences. "Kill Bob by strangling him" has a smaller conceptual space than "Think."

    Since corpses are objects, I could bring people back to life with the command "resurrect". (I assume that the infusion doesn't work on living things, since that's a little too overpowered)

    Second, I could probably infuse my clothes to "Fly" or "Hover". If I couldn't control that, than it would at least be useful in certain scenarios.

  You have become a werewolf. Every full moon, you transform into a wolf that is your own weight (mass is conserved) at the instant of syzygy (when the sun, earth, and moon are in a straight line). You can maintain the werewolf form until you fall asleep, when you will transform back. During your transformation, your intelligence is preserved.

    What's my goal? 

    Because thinking of who I am right this moment....... i'd probably do weird sex stuff, play frisbee, go to a dog park, swim, go to the forest and try and track animals, that sort of thing. Purely recreational. Maybe see if I can help with unsolved crimes, but that'd be a bit difficult to do anonymously.

    Oh, and put myself forward to win some of those paranormal challenges.

    Oh, and if I do that, do hollywood stunt work though I can't imagine that being very lucrative. I'd be a small wolf but I'm guessing it's easier to change perspective than it is to CGI a whole wolf / train a dog.

    If you put on a dog collar right before transforming and then walk around while wagging your tail, you could go almost anywhere. This could have a variety of useful applications.

    If you're extremely obese, you will presumably just turn into a large but otherwise healthy wolf. For people who are too fat to walk, this could be a good way to periodically regain some mobility.

    You could probably make a decent income by setting up a YouTube channel called "Genius Wolf", and publishing videos of you doing things that appear shockingly intelligent for a canid.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      > If you put on a dog collar right before transforming 

      You don't even need to have good timing, just wear an (appropriately loose) collar about a day before you expect to need it and you'll transform into it! People will think you make weird fashion choices but that's a life I have already resigned myself to.

      (True story: I have a very expensive hairdresser who is extremely cool, like, SO cool. I walk in one day and she says "Weasel! I love your outfit today! Colour blocking, huh?" and I nod and go "Yes! Colour blocking is a thing I do as a fashion choice! Thank you for noticing this intentional fashion decision" and later on I googled it and it means wearing clashing colours on purpose, so basically, fashion has finally become accessible to me)

    Have a SNAKES ARE SENTIENT? moment, because if your intelligence is preserved when you turn into a wolf, who's to say that other animals aren't also sentient?

    Granted, it's a bit of a leap of logic, but you are now in a unique position to greatly advance animal rights, albeit through deceptive methods. Just get a cooperator to exhibit wolf-you like [Clever Hans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans), showing off your human-level intellect in animal form to make the public believe that animals are sentient.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      The thing is, one wolf doing intelligent things isn't going to get people to greatly change animal rights. There's too much cognitive dissonance in our relationship with animals (carnism). 

      Intelligent people won't do relatively simple things like not eating meat, and we have good evidence that pigs, chickens, cows have real emotional lives and suffer for real. People already care about dogs, and without it being replicated in other dogs/wolves, I can't see one Clever Hans bringing in a new vanguard of animal rights unless it's as a figurehead for a wider campaign, especially since Clever Wolf is only available for appearances 1-3 days a month depending how long you can stay awake for.

  I have two characters that have an ability resembling magnetism between them. One is a normal human man with the squishness that implies. The other is a woman made of metal. The drag goes both ways it is just hard to notice it hitting her because of how heavy she is.

   The force of the magnetism is strong enough to drag the man towards the woman at a fast but survivable (without damage) speed. The two always know the exact distance and direction between them. 

  I was thinking having the man grab others and use the ability to drag people to her in fights. Do you know any better ways they could Munchkin these abliltys ?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    I assume that they have the ability to turn the magnetism on and off? Otherwise the man would be glued to the woman permanently.

    Another question is whether the force drops off quickly over distance like actual magnetism. If so, at what distance is "The force of the magnetism is strong enough to drag the man towards the woman at a fast but survivable (without damage) speed."?

    I would have the man armed and armored to attack enemies directly rather than just dragging them to the woman. After all, if the force is strong enough to drag the man's entire body, it's strong enough to push a blade into an enemy. Have the man and woman run around trying to get enemies between them then activate their ability to have the man charge at the enemy with great force and with a blade pointed at them. If swordsmanship is a problem, consider wearing spiked armor.
    ```

      >I assume that they have the ability to turn the magnetism on and off?

      This is correct.

      >Another question is whether the force drops off quickly over distance like actual magnetism. 

      I am not sure about this one. I was thinking have it at maximum draw in a ten acre area and start dropping off after that. The ability should cover a entire battlefield. Although ten acre might be a bit much.

      >If the force is strong enough to drag the man's entire body, it's strong enough to push a blade into an enemy. 

      I had considered this but are you sure it would be ? An unfit human can run at 20 mph I was thinking 30 or 40 would be the fastest he could get dragged without much damage. Please correct me if you think he could move faster. 

      Wouldn't that just push an opponent who is armored to a similar level as him ? If he is fighting unarmored opponents I agree it would be a good method.

  You can have any superpower that could generate a maximum economic value of under $500 a week (to be adjusted in the future for inflation.) What do you choose? For the sake of sanity, this economic value doesn't include the value of notoirety: money you could make just be demonstrating the power to a telivision audience doesn't count.

  If someone, including yourself, ever proposes or thinks of a way to use your power to make more than $500 dollars, you lose the power.

  So for example, the ability to randomly find $500 in lost bills and change per week, but only in scenarious where it was plausible, would qualify.
  ```

  - u/Rowan93:
    ```
    If you can include restrictions, drawbacks and weaknesses in the description of the power, you can just have any arbitrary power with the drawback of "but it can't be used to make more than $500/week" stuck on.

    So, just picking an absurdly OP power on that basis, I'll go with "the ability to travel between universes, including to fictional universes, and bring goods and people with you, but you're magically prevented from using the power for economic gain".
    ```

    - u/pldl:
      ```
      Yep, this was roughly my first thought. In general, anything you do that would *affect* others in any way can be used as a generation of economic value. And if it can't affect others, then most superpowers would be worthless. And with the hard cap of $500 a week, any superpowers with any sort of utility would be identical in impact.

      I think the two Munchkins would be either:

      Take advantage of the notoriety clause, and choose something that would maximize entertainment with minimal utility. For example, the power to allow people to experience books as VR or illusions that only make entertainment media better/immersive. This would be generating economic value, but the exception clause is super vague.

      Maximize self-interest while minimizing its ability to affect others in any way, which would look something like you can freeze time in the "real world" to enter a separate self-generating multi-verse where you are all-powerful, near-omniscient, (can seed creations of universes, can live vicariously through copies/imitations of stories and self-memory manipulation, etc. etc.,) but you cannot bring out anything other than vague memories and exactly $500 dollars. If you want to leave for some reason, haha.
      ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      That's technically possoble, but "prevented from economic gain" gives massive latitude with powers to some supernatural deciding algorithm very, very broad powers to achieve very specific goals. In essence, you've made a paper clip minimizer-- it must keep the number of paperclips under five hundred. Maybe it does that by destroying the paperclips. Maybe it does that by destroying humanity.
      ```

      - u/Rowan93:
        ```
        That seems like a problem with the specific wording more than a problem with the approach; I was thinking of some transactions and power uses just arbitrarily being impossible like crossing invisible walls in a videogame, not active destruction of wealth by magical forces.

        Although, acknowledging that saying a complex thing magically happens implies an optimisation process means I can hand the wish specification problem over to an aligned superintelligence just by adding an "as it would be interpreted by a superintelligence aligned to my values" clause. In which case, giving it massive latitude with powers is better than any specific mechanism I could come up with.
        ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          There's doubtlessly *some* way to break the power; I did after all post this in the munchkinry thresd for a reason. But the specific worsing, I think, will be difficult to make foolproof. You're up against a malicious genie. Except that genie is you.
          ```

          - u/Rowan93:
            ```
            Well, that's the point of adding an aligned superintelligence is that it makes it a benevolent genie. "magically prevented from using the power for economic gains beyond $500/week, with any decisions involved in applying this this restriction being judged as they would be by a superintelligence that's aligned to my values" means that any loopholes in the wording are going to be used by a benevolent genie to bend the rules in my favour, insofar as that's possible without tripping the threshold for losing the power.
            ```

          - u/Gurkenglas:
            ```
            Here's my wording: Omnipotence, except whenever you would make 500$ except through notoriety, time stops, and you can travel freely through the branching tree of timelines that you have existed in yet, in order to select a point to continue from.
            ```

  - u/Palmolive3x90g:
    ```
    A passive power with universal range that will work after my death. The goal here is a power that benefits everybody equally and I have no control over meaning dispite benefiting from the power I gain no economic advantage from it. Also pick a universal power that will destroy or masively shrink the economy so that it can't be used to make money at all.

    There are probably better ones but this is what I just thought up: The power to have every human to form into a soft hive mind where everyone has perfect empathy and the abilty to conceptualize the whole of humanity and how actions affect them. It also gives everyone a bunch of minor superpowers and reverses entropy as well.

    what does this mean 

    if you use your power to generate $500 in gold, when the value of gold goes up, does your power turn off? 

    what if you use your power to make $500 which you then invest, or gamble with, and make more money 

    if people pay to watch you create gold from nothing, isn't that making more than $500?
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      >if you use your power to generate $500 in gold, when the value of gold goes up, does your power turn off?

      If your power generates exactly $500 worth of gold, pegged to the situation you find youself in at the time (e.g., it generates more gold if you're somewhere gold is common, but less if you're where gold is rare) then no, you keep your power. If it's just a fixed amount of gold, and that gold is ever worth more than $500, they yes, your power is disabled.

      >what if you use your power to make $500 which you then invest, or gamble with, and make more money

      Only the economic value of your power's direct output is considered.

      >if people pay to watch you create gold from nothing, isn't that making more than $500?

      The notoirety effect of "having a superpower" isn't considered, although "providing entertainment" is evaluated at market rate. If your power can be used to generate entertainment, that plays into how much its worth.

          Watsonian: because supernatural wish-granting beings are already a (covert) part of the economy and therefore their services are priced in, so since this one is on a tight budget, it can't give you too much power or it has to eat ramen noodles for a week.

    How many chains of consequence does this superpower manager look at?

    * First-order results from your power (eg conjuring art and selling it for $500)?

    * Second-order results (conjuring $500 worth of art materials, selling the art for more than $500)?

    * Third-order results (conjuring an art book, teaching yourself art, then getting an art job that makes more than $500/week)?

    Because depending on how careful you have to be not to let your power "cause" you to generate over the allowed limit, it severely limits what kind of power you can ever have so as not to let it change your lifestyle.

  Once again, we're using [a setting](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8rjwz5/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/e0te2ui/) from a short story I read, with one difference: the instant you're exposed to this location, you can no longer create things in it with excuses. How will you munchkin this, using either the things created by your existing excuses or perhaps getting other people to make excuses that work for you? Note that if you bring anyone else in, they also lose their ability to create through making excuses.
