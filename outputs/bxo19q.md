    Yep, autocorrect got me and I didn't notice.

      I was actually hoping it was intentional and -the link was going to be 4 hours of whale song.

        That would have been hilarious if I had thought of it.

  Hey, this is the mostly unedited audio from a project on rational fiction I did for AP Language and Composition a few months back. Thought people would be interested in hearing some of the thoughts of a prominent rational fiction author. The reason I went with the raw recording is due to not wanting to accidentally misconstrue anything as well as remove bloat added due to it being a school assignment.

    is it possible to give question timestamps? an hour long is a bit too long for most.
    ```

    - u/UltimateRockPlays:
      ```
      Give me a few and I'll create them.
      ```

- u/MadVaughn:
  ```
  Oh my gosh, thank you both for doing this project. I'm so excited to listen to this; I've been reading Worth the Candle, and ever since the stuff with Mome Rath, I've been looking into info about the Author who created this world. I'm so looking forward to this :D

    if this excites you, you should check out the 50 episodes of the [Rationally Writing podcast](http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/) which he co-hosts.

    ```
    Your post made notice that Arthur/Uther sounds rather similar to "author". Coincidence?  ʘ‿ʘ
    ```

    - u/Chelse-harn:
      ```
      This is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence
