  Is anybody still reading, or like me, we are waiting for at least a functional plot?
  Edit - What I said was rude, I apologize.

    My interest has waned. I felt the beginning 8 or so chapters were of a fairly high quality and the standard has been dipping since.

      That is where I am at, as well.

    I am still reading and enjoying the story. Not sure what to complain about.

      We're fairly deep into the story and there has yet to be a clear antagonist. We don't really know what the protagonist is striving for; we don't know what challenges he needs to overcome. We don't really even know what events are good and what are bad for him. In short, the fundamental conflict and goals of the story is still very unclear. 

      Don't get me wrong, it's interesting that we're still guessing what's happening. This could be a useful approach that accurately reflects the sense of confusion and being lost in a big world that the main character must be feeling. But... I'm increasingly worried that the story will never start coalesce. It's gone on for quite a while now.

        I may be in error but to me the demons are the big antagonists (there are also lesser things to overcome like the prejudice of the upper class etc.), the goal is to save Simone and the world and there is lots to be discovered about the world, the school, arcanum, society etc. 

        In the sense that it does not conform to the roles and steps of "the hero's journey" 100% I guess it is unclear, but I (disclaimer: personal taste) don't think that is a requirement for a good story.

        Is it fair to ask for clarity in these things in an /r/rational story?  There are at least two aspects here.  

        One is that rational readers generally enjoy more subtle hints as to the true nature of the world - multiple readings are practically mandatory so that there are significant hypotheses to strike down as part of discovering the world.  

        Another is that by and large reality presents itself without such clarity, and a big part of rationality is recognizing how often we impose structures and definitions - sometimes helpfully, sometimes not.

        I'm interested in people's thoughts since in my own writing I actively try to present scenes that have multiple readings.

          Well, I could reasonably argue that the rational genre doesn't obviate the rules of good story-telling, but the honest truth is that I won't judge this story till it's done. These confusing narratives and unclear antagonist may resolve in a really interesting way that brings together everything to a fitting whole. Or, they may not. We'll have to see.

      Ah, well not meaning to complain, more wanted an answer of, it's good and you should continue, or keep waiting.  I have not given up and still maintain my intent to read it, but for me I started gettig the feeling that after each chapter my mind was going aaaaaand?

        Perhaps partly a symptom of a web serial? In a conventional novel you would just keep reading to get the next piece of the puzzle, now you have to wait for next chapter to be released.
        ```

        - u/ColeslawHappiness:
          ```
          Yes, webserials will be my undoing, truly.  Rational webserials are the pringles of the literary universe, and truly should be treated like a controlled substance to the uninitiated.

    For the moment, but probably not for much longer. It seems to have lost its spark.

    A few more words of clarification, in case the author watches these threads. The storyline about the demons and the other place bores me. It bores me because it doesn't directly threaten the protagonist or his goals. Also, his goals seem to have become nonexistent. As have his study habits. I was kind of looking forward to a good study-fantasy. I wish it could have stayed that way.
