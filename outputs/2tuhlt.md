## [Offtopic] YSK about a place for rational relationship advice called /r/punchingmorpheus.

### Post:

Hey all, just wanted to spread awareness about a subreddit I moderate that people here might be interested in: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/punchingmorpheus

It formed specifically to present a bastion against the toxic attitudes and memes circulated by places like The Red Pill and similar worldviews, but we've worked hard to make it more than that and make it a safe place to discuss relationship and gender dynamics calmly and intelligently.

Just something I thought the rationalist community should be aware of, and /u/eaturbrainz gave me the greenlight to post to it, so feel free to check out the sidebar, subscribe if you'd like, and join the discussions there.

(PS: The next chapter of [Pokemon: The Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) is almost done, and should be published within a few days!)

  Honest opinion?

  This seems more like re-reactionary politics (reacting against reactionaries) than "rational". What is the relevance of this to people who don't care about theredpill in the first place? Isn't this basically a petri dish for [toxoplasma](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), which only tends to increase the net visibility of extreme views? (You know something is toxoplasma driven when you primarily hear about it from people who dislike it...)

  This is not a "boo" for what the subreddit stands for. I "yay" the egalitarian side of gender politics (even if i sometimes cringe at those who yay alongside me), generally think better of you after learning you are a mod for such a subreddit, and so on. I just don't see the relevance here nor the general net benefit of cross pollination. 

  Remember what happened to Lesswrong after they started entertaining reactionary ideas? To entertain *either* side of an ideological war is to invite the other side, and then everything of substance drowns in the resulting argument. 

  10th Law of Power: "avoid infection". I don't usually like the laws of power, but I do think they apply here.

  This is *fascinating*. And a bit surreal. I'm asexual, you see. I certainly know *of* romantic and sexual relationships and gender dynamics. My friends talk about them sometimes, so I've developed enough of an abstract understanding to fake having meaningful input. But it's easy for me to forget just how big a deal this all allegedly is.

  Here we have *thousands* of people discussing thoughts and opinions and desires and worldviews and entire emotional spectra that are utterly incomprehensible to me, and its all fundamentally important to them. I've never been immersed in an environment dedicated to that.

  You're all crazy. Good crazy, mostly, I guess, but crazy. I'm going to remember this the next time I read about aliens who are less alien than everyone around me.

    Interestingly enough, we get posts by asexual people too, such as [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/PunchingMorpheus/comments/2jzg3e/when_the_sexual_desires_in_a_relationship_are/)! 


    But yeah. Hormones n' such. They be crazy ;)

      Honestly, romance is way more bewildering to me than sexuality. Drugs make sense. But even on calm reflection, lots of people still feel quite strongly about some kind of bizarre exclusive reciprocal siblinghood/friendship-with-benefits 2.0 thing, also gender is important somehow. So even that post is alien to me.

      You guys seem to pursue your weird goals reasonably and fairly, and you try to avoid hurting anyone. I know lots of young people who have been burned, but I don't know any old people who regret it. So, hey, have fun!

        It really does sound strange and unappealing when viewed objectively :) I described it like this to someone there once when they were expressing their frustration over having trouble finding a romantic relationship:

        >>> But I never really had to "work" to have friends, yet I don't take them for granted either. Creating and maintaining friendships throughout my life "just happened." With women, I don't know why, but it feels so much different.

        >>There are in fact a number of differences between romantic relationships and regular friendships that make one much harder than the other.

        >>For one thing, a romantic relationship is mostly exclusive. Imagine if, of all your friends, you had to choose just one of them to be your only friend, and *they* had to choose *you*. And as long as you two are friends, you can't do certain fun things with anyone else, and if you're friends long enough, you have to move in together and merge your finances.

        >>Sounds kind of silly right? I mean even without the sex and physical attraction aspect, friendship would be MUCH harder if it was anywhere near as restrictive as monogomous romantic relationships. That's a large part of why the two feel so different: friends are fairly easy to acquire and maintain, because the stakes are relatively low. The stakes are very high for dating, especially dating for a serious, lasting relationship, which immediately makes it much more competitive and difficult.

        It does feel great when it clicks into place. Whether it's worth the heartache and headache involved, of course, is a question that has echoed throughout human history :)

          You're describing color to the blind here. My friends get frustrated when they say things like that, and I can only think, "Then... don't do it that way?" Clearly that's not how it works. I mean, I grew up in a culture where marriage is a thing, so I've learned all the rules that evidently are supposed to be natural, but yeah, it's all kind of silly. But even if much of it doesn't come naturally to me, I do understand trust, and empathy, and communication, and often that's enough to build some kind of framework for thinking about any kind of healthy relationship, from lovers to coworkers.

            >You're describing color to the blind here.

            In that I'm successfully communicating, or not? (That expression is commonly used to mean "wasting time" or "attempting the impossible.")

            >Clearly that's not how it works.

            Yeah, most people can't stop themselves from wanting what they want, especially for something so deeply ingrained at a cultural level, at least. Polyamorists are rare and frowned upon, despite many of them having healthy and happy romantic lives, and culturally polygamy has a terrible image thanks to traditionally male-centric cults that practiced it.

            Personally, while some part of me still feels drawn to the "special someone" perspective, I've been able to recognize the value of non-monogamy to the point of feeling open to the possibility. I've yet to meet a girl in meatspace that is too, but think I'd be as happy in either relationship type as long as the people involved are the right ones.

            >But even if much of it doesn't come naturally to me, I do understand trust, and empathy, and communication, and often that's enough to build some kind of framework for thinking about any kind of healthy relationship, from lovers to coworkers.

            Yeah, trust, empathy and communication go a long way in every relationship :) The peculiarities of romance only matter to others who are specifically looking for them, in which case it's no different than being friends with someone who doesn't reciprocate their romantic/sexual attraction. Since I've managed to have not one but two lifelong friendships with girls I've fallen in love with that didn't reciprocate, I can attest that it doesn't impede the friendship at all as long as the person who does feel the romantic longing is mature and secure enough not to let it.

              You're communicating better than many. I meant it as an actual metaphor. You're describing experiences that, to the best of my knowledge, I don't have, and most of my thoughts are just "Why?" with varying levels of emphasis and incredulity. That's fine, I think, just talking about our respective perspectives.

              I understand some natural reluctance towards polyamory. There are historical and cultural reasons, and jealousy is a real emotion that can cause real distress^(1), no matter how much you would prefer to feel compersion. Even if it is the obvious solution to, like, half of everyone's relationship woes. The weird thing is that saying things like that has gotten me in trouble among more emotional company.

              Love is said to *feel* like the strongest relationship in the world, but it *looks* like one of the weakest, and people *act* like it's fragile and could easily fall apart. Some of the less introspective people I've encountered don't just defend their relationship, they defend the *validity* of their relationship, as if that were in doubt, as if it were all lies and the whole house of cards might fall. I'm pretty sure it's more material than that. Humans are weird. But this behavior is hardly exclusive to love.

              > I've managed to have not one but two lifelong friendships with girls I've fallen in love with that didn't reciprocate, I can attest that it doesn't impede the friendship at all as long as the person who does feel the romantic longing is mature and secure enough not to let it. 

              Oh, tell me about it. Like half of my closest friends have asked me out^(2), including one who, after a few drinks, freely admits they'd still like to meet someone "like you, but available". I'm not quite sure how I'm supposed to take that, but I've friend-loved the lot of them for like fifteen years.

              ^(1) My only experience with jealousy is, like, my dog responding more to someone else, and me being very slightly upset for maybe one second. Imagining love-jealous rage is like imagining bad-kerning rage. I can't get into that headspace. I just acknowledge that the sliding scale evidently does go high enough to cause real distress.

              ^(2) Dating! A pox on whoever invented the thing. I have trouble even pretending to understand it. I've never been able to pin down the actual difference between dating and hanging out, aside from all parties agreeing on what word to use. But I've seen loving couples agree with me on that. The *culture* of romance is the *most* incomprehensible.

  Looks interesting. I may check it out and see if there are interesting reads. I don't think I understand "Redpill" enough to argue against it. It relies on assumptions or common experiences I don't have.
