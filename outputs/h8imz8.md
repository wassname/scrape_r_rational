So, to preface: I write CYOA stories, featuring pictures. The readers of the story suggest what the protagonist should do, and I write the next page accordingly. This may or may not count as rational fiction (I'm still figuring that out); the audience by and large mostly make what I would call rational decisions. Mostly. Usually. There's also a definite degree of genre savviness and min-maxing, both from the readers themselves and the characters in-story.

Without further ado: [My Delirium Alcazar](http://mda.wtf), my current story about dreams, anxiety, algorithms, body horror, fascism, video games, and a squad of crime lesbians. It takes inspiration from Persona, Silent Hill 2 and Dark Souls among other things, and is my steaming hot take on isekai stories (as someone who grew up with *Captain N and the Game Masters*). It's also me loudly accepting my own dare to write as many genres as possible simultaneously like a lunatic.

I've also started uploading a sort of archive version to [Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33093/my-delirium-alcazar), if you prefer that to my janky website. I only take protagonist suggestions from the main site, though. If you like MDA, it's a sequel to another story I finished last year called [Blood is Mine](http://bloodismine.com). Thank you for not tearing me apart

  I think rationality would be more dictated by how you interpret reader commands and the ensuing narrative rather than the commands themselves. How much of the sidebar does your story fit?

  ***

  Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.

  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

  Presence of these particular features is not necessary: overall impression of the work is more important.

  Adjacent tropes: Rational stories tend to include certain narrative elements. Though their presence doesn't make a story more rational, this community highly enjoys them. Most important ones include:

  Fair-Play Whodunnit: story's mysteries could be solved by attentive readers ahead of time.

  Absence of Deus Ex Machina: established story rules are never broken.

  Deconstruction: genre tropes are re-imagined in a more realistic manner.

  Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit their world's rules in creative, non-intuitive ways.

  Genre Savviness: characters are familiar with common genre tropes and try to avoid or exploit them.

    As a person who's read the comic so far (I actually recommended it in the most recent weekly recommendation thread): 

    It fits quite a lot of the sidebar. 

    * The characters are fairly intelligent. One thing you don't see in a lot of rational fiction is that they're also *emotionally* intelligent - the main character is aware of the times when her thinking isn't necessarily at its best due to anxiety or what have you, and takes steps to fix that first (of course it helps that there's a hivemind giving her input). 
    * A lot of the story revolves around *figuring out* the motivations of the antagonist / non-protagonists. The main characters themselves have fairly simple goals and motives. 
    * Dunno, the story hasn't gotten to the climax yet. IMO the payoff of the previous story (Blood is Mine) was pretty good though. 
    * As mentioned before, the main character is pretty good about figuring out when her mental state isn't great and taking steps to fix it. So far she hasn't done much about improving her reasoning, but she has kept herself from digging below baseline. 
    * The reason why I recommended this story is because quite a lot of it is about the characters *figuring out* what the rules are. So far, they've been consistent and intriguing. It's fun!

    For the adjacent tropes, this is (as mentioned by the author) sort of a deconstruction of a video game isekai story, with touches of munchkinry and genre savviness - the MC basically makes not-YouTube videos about video games, and then gets isekai'd into a videogame-like space in her dreams.

    It's hard to say if this is a fair-play whodunnit since we don't have many answers yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone who's read Blood is Mine would be able to make some guesses. My guess: >!Personally I think it's pretty clear that the Spooky House is someone's leftover Red, and it's attempting to communicate with Plaire through her dreams, though I dunno to what purpose!<

      This basically covers it (and I'm way more comfortable having an outside perspective make this kind of call, rather than me the writer trying to be objective about how rational and consistent my own writing is), but I'm going to add I'm definitely *angling* for a pretty fair-play whodunnit. There will definitely be some big goofy twists on the way there, but I fully expect everyone to start piecing the answers together as more and more context is revealed. Some of the readers have already answered a couple of the story's questions and don't even realize it yet.

      Whether I'll *execute* that smoothly has yet to be seen, but I plan on it being that kind of mystery (or mysteries, I guess). Also thank you IICVX

  I haven't read either of your stories yet, but it looks really interesting. I'm just commenting to ask, why are you posting the sequel to Royalroad, but not *Blood is Mine*? Just seems a bit odd.

  EDIT: Whoops. I just realized, *My Delirium Alcazar* isn't complete yet. I assumed that you were posting one 'book' and not the other. Instead you were uploading chapters as you are writing the story.

    Yeah, I started uploading MDA to Royal Road because it seemed like a way to get more eyes on my ongoing project. If I get caught up on uploading MDA I might start uploading BiM, as well, but the ending on that one's a little sloppy.

  I'm enjoying this since it was recommended in the weekly thread.

  Can I ask how you find this community? Did someone specifically point it out to you or did you follow a referrer back to here?

  Definitely won't tear you apart! I started reading just now and am enjoying it so far!
