## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

    If you're in the mood for some seasonal horror, you can't go wrong with Alexander Wales' The Last Christmas.

  My uncle has Parkinson's disease, and I attended Secular Solstice last Saturday.  My soul is writhing in an unusual amount of impotent rage at the injustice of the universe this week.

  How do we destroy Parkinson's Disease?

    What IS secular solstice? I saw a post for it on the main page, but I I have no clue what it actually is.

      Not sure if it's got its own website.  It basically seems to be "LW does ~~Christmas~~pagan winter-time sun worship".

  What questions would you put in a FAQ of everything? If you wanted to explain the world and, ideally, how to navigate through it?

    Nice try, Skynet.

    ...I have no idea how to make a 'general' one. Step one is usually to stop and think about who your target audience is. If your target audience is African farmers, NASA engineers, Chinese businessmen and everyone else everywhere, that makes things a little difficult. Maybe a tl;dr version of the most popular wikipedia articles?
    ```

    - u/traverseda:
      ```
      Targeting a particular audience would definitely get better results, but half the fun trying to make it at least somewhat generalized.

      I think starting out with a mini-lesswrong section on navigating reality.

  Reposting this because it probably wasn't seen and I think it's interesting.

  Check out this paper about quantitative style features of more and less successful literary works:
  http://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D13/D13-1181.pdf
  I am most surprised by the fact that more successful books are found to use more prepositions. Does that resonate with the wisdom of the writers here?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Their most successful metric was unigrams (basically, word choice).

    > Interestingly, less successful books rely on verbs that are explicitly descriptive of actions and emotions (e.g., “wanted”, “took”, “promised”, “cried”, “cheered”, etc.), while more successful books favor verbs that describe thought-processing (e.g., “recognized”, “remembered”), and verbs that serve the purpose of quotes and reports (e.g,. “say”). Also, more successful books use discourse connectives and prepositions more frequently, while less successful books rely more on topical words that could be almost cliche, e.g., “love”, typical locations, and involve more extreme (e.g., “breathless”) and negative words (e.g., “risk”).

    A lot of this is just "show, don't tell", which is the very first rule that you hear if you're a novice writer walking into Creative Writing 101. You don't say, "John wanted the bread," you describe how John is hungry and express his desire in other ways. It's basically the same reason that you're supposed to avoid adverbs. I sort of think this might be why prepositions are so favored; they represent markers for time and place, manipulations of other words.

    The finding that increased readability is not correlated with success is also not too surprising to me, mostly because readability comes with tradeoffs in terms of prose style and sentence complexity. I think I would have liked them to separate that out into a graph that measures readability against success, but they only say "increasing readability decreases success", so my guess that there's a trade-off is pure speculation.

    I don't know, I don't think quantitative analysis at this level is all that useful because of all the confounding variables involved, which is probably why most previous attempts were qualitative.

  I started reading Polyhistor Academy a few days ago (It's been posted on here, which is where I found out about it). It's about a university of magic where murder is allowed and only 10% of the students are allowed to survive to graduate. I'm one semester into the story and I don't see why anyone would send their kid there if they didn't just want an abortion 19 years after conception, but if you just set that aside it's entertaining. No idiot balls so far, and the forum readers get to vote on lots of decisions, from which classes to attend to hobbies to independent magical research. They have been wise enough to make the MC learn how to magically make himself better at learning, and have seemingly maxed 'learning speed' in just over one semester. Sadly, they also spend like half the MC's time painting, which gives them some illusion magic and the chance to flirt with second best girl. Clearly a better choice would be to let the mad shark toothed doctor install interesting upgrades and get the chemistry teacher best girl with a crush on him to secretly teach him advanced magical chemistry.

    That sounds interesting, but is the story compiled anywhere? I can't stand to read shit online extensively. I need to lounge, dammit.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      Also as is the case with forum stories the author posts many things that reveal more about the world and how they made their decision in non-story updates included IRC chat logs and the such.

      One of those things that not reading as it is posted you miss out on a fair bit.

      Sorry, don't think it's in one piece anywhere, and it's still ongoing. It also requires an account (free), which is why it took me so long to give it a try. The link to the table of contents is [here](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/), though you need to make an account to see it. It links to all the chapters, so at least there is no need to crawl through old forum threads.

      You can covert to mobi/epub from nearly any source with the FanFicFare Plugin in Calibre. I found this interesting, and I also like to lounge, so I grabbed a copy. 

      I uploaded it [here](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=31934790331961111069) as it took almost 30 minutes for the story to download. Story is 568,000 words long, not the longest, but it is up there.

    I am more confused by the lack of violence the other kids seem to give. If I was going there I'd get whoever my parents were to make me a nuke before I came along, and in that opening assembly where every student was gathered just nuke it. Then you can sail through the rest of the things with the only requirement being the minimum pass grade.

    Can't remember where I was (pg 100+ in the forum) in but I've put it to the side for a while, the growing feeling of missing information by only reading the story updates and using the forum as a reading interface was becoming a pain.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Yeah, it's a little rough that the forum readers seem to somehow know what all the slots and options for magic are. A brief summary would have been nice.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I read through it when it was posted here and thought it was a lot of fun.  Initially I was a little afraid the story was born of a fetishistic desire to write about gore and violence but that turned out to be not the case at all. 

    And, like you, I was somewhat disappointed with the romantic choice made by the readers.

  What does 'politics is spiders' come from?  I have the general sense of the term, but not the full meaning or etymology
  ```

  - u/DataPacRat:
    ```
    It's just a mild adaptation of https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Politics_is_the_Mind-Killer .
    ```

    - u/None:

      With the added implication that, like spiders, sometimes politics is part of real-life even if it freaks us out.

  Something I truly don't understand: if ISIL has a fearsome presence online, why do governments want to lockdown the Internet instead of fighting back? Why aren't they trying to have a counter-propaganda campaign?
  ```

  - u/Murska1FIN:
    ```
    They are, though propaganda against ISIL pretty much writes itself.

    Governments want to lockdown the internet simply because the internet can be used for all sorts of subversive activities that are difficult to control. Being able to regulate things better would make a lot of things much easier for governments.
    ```

  - u/BadGoyWithAGun:
    ```
    It's pretty interesting, most ISIS propaganda also functions perfectly as anti-ISIS propaganda if you're not a sunni muslim. So there's really no need for it.

  I got *Godel, Escher, Bach* for Christmas (and a second Hofstadter book called *Metamagical Themas*, which I suspect I won't get to until much later).

  Is anyone else starting to read it? It would be great to have a reading/discussion buddy. I remember there was an attempt at a community read through here last year that seemed like fun.

    I had a January term class in college that was all about that book. January term is the thing that some colleges have where you have a single class for a whole month rather than taking four or five classes over a semester. So we'd spend a day or two on each of the chapters, talking about them for several hours each. It was one of my favorite classes I took, though there was nothing particularly practical about it.

    Though I think that if I reread it now I would just say, "Well duh" to a lot of it, since I've now read so much of the material that came from it. Sort of the same phenomenon as [Seinfeld Is Unfunny](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny).

    My friend says this book is "like The Secret, but for nerds".
