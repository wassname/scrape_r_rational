      Well, and Worth, of course.

      I liked all of it except for the "top kek" line, that one just didn't feel right. Not the right kind of joke/reference for the situation. Do people even say that out loud?

        I guess it depends on your milieu?  Out in California, where Marco is ostensibly from, you can hear people say it (mostly ironically or sarcastically, as in this chapter).

        It's not super common, but I had a subgoal of outing Marco as a *memester* in this chapter.

          But why.......

          Also, that the Arn can make people infection-proof seems really important and/or game breaking. It can't be that much harder than making humans into kandrona producers.

  Alright! Another awesome chapter! Let's get to it...

  > After an embarrassingly quick twenty-minute flight, we had passed out of the forest and into a kind of low, desert scrubland 

  Looks like everyone elected to morph into bats to fast track things. So I guess we're *not* addressing the gigantic powerful morph that everyone got at the end of the last chapter. Chekov's gun?

  Okay, is this a *deliberate* reference to Rickoning or did TK17 and I just independently converge on the same idea?

  > if you’re trying to trick somebody into blowing up the world, it’s a lot easier to get them to flip the switch if they’re already willing. 

  This is an amazing quote. May I steal it? It's one of those classic rationalist insight-porn kind of quotes that compresses a lot of ideas related to deontology vs. utilitarianism, and also ideas about strategy and information security.

  > ‹*Couldn’t?›* Jake snapped, and for a moment the laser lost focus, swelling to fill the room with fire. 

  I sense that Jake is getting increasingly war-weary and broken. I hope the Animorphs can figure out some kind of therapy later on. Morphing would be *amazing* for therapy.

  > The Marco was lying flat on his back, a look of surprise frozen on his face.   
  >  
  > ‹Acquire him,› I said.  ‹Somebody acquire him.› 

  Okay, wait, first of all, when was it established that you could acquire dead bodies? Second of all, if that's possible, it seems weird to me that the idea hasn't explicitly come up before now as a tactic to use - I feel like it could have made a difference somewhere before this, but maybe not. Third, I hope some of the auxiliary animorphs figured this out and are currently acquiring every recently deceased or terminally ill person they can find for the purposes of future resurrection (Alcor is *so* out of business now). Fourth, I wonder how little of a person's body you need for this to work? Just the head, maybe? Fifth, when exactly did this Marco die? It seems like it's recent. If V3 kept this Marco alive for a while, that would give time for Marco's memories of the TPK to solidify so that the animorphs could actually figure out what happened, assuming that dead bodies can even retain memories (maybe the morphing tech can fix up degraded ones or something).

  > She tried to kill me once, you know.  Well, more than once, but once she almost *succeeded*.  Such a tiny little hole in my control—the ability to close one eye.  

  Straight out of canon!

  > What if we distribute the Yeerk? 

  So *that's* why so many Marcos were brought along. Not to die - to be a hivemind for Visser One! Wow, I did *not* predict that. I thought this chapter was going to end with cloned Howlers wrecking everyone.

  > Speaking of immune to infection, this guy figures he’s probably  resistant to being morphed, too.  He predicts I’ve got about ten minutes  in here before the control Yeerk starts to rot away, so maybe we want  to hurry this up? 

  Can't you just demorph and remorph the Arn? Wouldn't the morphing tech fix the degradation every time?

  > She’s seen the Ellimist.   
  >  
  > There are gaps—places where she wasn’t able to see, or where she forgot—time travel, alternate universes—*she’s been a Controller for four years.*  She knew Elfangor!  Knew him in human morph, on Earth! 

  Oh *snap*. More of canon holds up in Reckoning than I realized. And, wait - time travel? Alternate realities? So, what you're saying is, theoretically, they could meet the original series Animorphs? Assuming these are confirmed from her memories and not Marco just spitballing. Well, this just leaves plenty of room for spinoff fanfics of Reckoning.

  > the Ellimist probably isn’t going to send her back with us 

  Okay, so how *are* they getting back? "Hey Ellimist? Yo. We're done? Give us a lift?".

  Also, was Helium's only purpose on this mission to confirm to V1 that this wasn't a V3 ploy? I guess they aren't back yet, so maybe there is more to come.

  Anyway, yeah! Awesome as usual. Are updates still on schedule for the next few weeks?

    Chekhov's gun.

    I definitely read The Rickoning in every version of the timeline, so it might've seeped into my subconscious.  I think you Incepted me, because it feels like it was my own idea.  =P

    You can steal the quote.  =)

    > when was it established that you could acquire dead bodies?

    Cassie acquired a dead squirrel waaaaay back when she was hiding in the valley, after her parents were taken.  She passed that info on to the rest of the group.  It's every bit as good as acquiring a living person if you do it *right then*; much like cryonics, it gets rapidly worse over the following minutes, hours, and days.  

    You need the head, which is why the Marco said to shoot the Arn in the chest.  This is because the morphing tech does a molecular scan in addition to grabbing DNA; if you just tried to acquire from a finger what you'd get is the morphing tech's best guess at how the DNA ought to express itself (a kind of fucked-up feral mutant human).

    > Can't you just demorph and remorph the Arn? Wouldn't the morphing tech fix the degradation every time?

    Yep, you could continually do so, but it means you only get like twenty minutes of control each time, which is annoying.  Interestingly, if I've understood the implications correctly, this means that you can get a cloned Quat in like half an hour—the Arn body rots the controlling Yeerk tissue away, and presto.

    Wonder what would happen if the morpher then tried to demorph??

    > Okay, so how are they getting back? 

    Jake mentions explicitly negotiating their return trip, but it happened offscreen and we already saw that the avatar is sneaky, if not outright duplicitous.  Knowing the exact wording of the agreement would help, but the reader doesn't have that info.

    Updates are ... well, "on schedule" is as good a word as any, I have about 40,000 words of content to deliver and expect to make an update in two weeks and at least one more two weeks after that, and also I'm still writing.

    But.  Uh.  Haven't made up my mind what to do about the fact that 37,000 of those 40,000 words are a single chapter that really feels to me like it only works in one chunk.
    ```

      The morpher's pocket dimension hasn't collapsed...or does it collapse when the controlling Yeerk tissue disappears?

      Depending on how the pocket dimension is linked to the controlling Yeerk tissue the morpher could be stuck there for 90 more mins, helpless, until they vanish. Not the most pleasant way to go...what kind of sensory input would they have in there?

      If Seerow (was it Seerow or another Andalite?) thought about some edge cases maybe it tries to recreate the morpher's body at/near the last known location that the Z-space link was linked to, taking into account things like how the link's anchor was travelling through spacetime. A related edge case could be 'what if the morphed body is vaporized due to a big-ass bomb going off'. But Andalites don't seem to be as creative as they should be, so maybe he didn't.

      EDIT: Then again, if the morphing tech is smart enough to try and take a 'best guess at how the DNA ought to express itself' maybe it *can* recreate a morpher's body if the morph is removed from existence. Or take a best guess at it...
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        It does not collapse when the Yeerk tissue disappears, but my current thinking is that the nanohardware that "gates" the morpher's flesh into and out of the pocket dimension may or may not be screwed up by that happening.
        ```

        - u/daytodave:
          ```
          We saw right after Ventura that you can emerge directly from the gate, with no construct body or controlling Yeerk tissue. Unless the Ellimist was spending move juice to fake the control tissue?

          I wonder if the Chee can do fine enough nanosurgery to remove the gates from a construct body? Let the morpher demorph with nothing to disassemble and the construct walk away?

          The Arn could be a way to rapidly harvest E/C memories.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Maybe the E/C only moved the gates. They could execute "demorph" command using the nanites in the construct and only change the destination, which doesn't necessarily mean you can demorph *after* the nanites are destroyed (for *that* to be possible, the E/C might need to emulate the nanites in the control tissue).

            &#x200B;

            Edit:

            >The Arn could be a way to rapidly harvest E/C memories.

            Assuming E/C is "Ellimist/Crayak", how?
            ```

            - u/daytodave:
              ```
              That would mean the nanites have the ability to teleport the body themselves, as it's emerging from Z-space; I don't think we have a reason to think they can do that.

              You could morph the Arn repeatedly, wait for the control Yeerk to die, and demorph after or during the process.
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                What if the E/C change the memory of the hypercomputer after the nanites signal to demorph? The hypercomputer could potentially start rebuilding the body at arbitrary coordinates, even though the process itself is still being micromanaged by the nanites (assuming the coordinates of every particle are encoded in the first stage as (e.g.) center of mass + offset, and not in absolute coordinates).

                The nanites themselves can then be teleported in the same way, since they have to change their location anyway since the original body has different shape/size than the morph, so instead, the hypercomputer would move them at the location of the original body.

                >You could morph the Arn repeatedly, wait for the control Yeerk to die, and demorph after or during the process.

                Oh, right, I didn't realize the visions could be memories.
                ```

                - u/daytodave:
                  ```
                  At least the most recent one, when Helium woke up, is one of the Ellimist's earliest memories straight out of canon.
                  ```

      Was that onscreen? Maybe it's just been a while, but I don't feel like that was onscreen, or at least not more than a passing mention. I feel like that concept should have had its own entire scene early on, because it seems very important.

      > Haven't made up my mind what to do about the fact that 37,000 of those  40,000 words are a single chapter that really feels to me like it only  works in one chunk. 

      Well, two weeks from now is nearly Christmas, so I expect many people will be on break around then. A 37,000 word chapter would be a great Christmas present, and people might actually have the free time to read and digest all of it.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        It was onscreen, but it was a single line in a long paragraph of Cassie's morph experiments.  It's plausible that in a second-draft pass through/edit/cleanup I would highlight it a little more, but I think there haven't been that many times when it would have mattered up until now.
        ```

      - u/daytodave:
        ```
        Seconding that a 37,000 word r!Animorphs chapter would be a Christmas miracle.

      > Yep, you could continually do so, but it means you only get like twenty minutes of control each time, which is annoying. Interestingly, if I've understood the implications correctly, this means that you can get a cloned Quat in like half an hour—the Arn body rots the controlling Yeerk tissue away, and presto.

      Could you extend the time by acquiring a bunch of Quats off of each other, to build up layers of other people's control Yeerks to rot through before yours is effected? Another thing about morphing Arn is that the copies you acquire off of each other will all have up-to-date memories, so if you make a new backup every time you use the Quat morph, it's even more like having a real Quat around than a normal morph.

      > Wonder what would happen if the morpher then tried to demorph??

      The control tissue is made from the construct body's DNA, right? So when Garret tried to morph Aftran, that control tissue was getting absorbing into the sharing as it was created? If I have that right, the fact that he was able to demorph implies that the nanites work independent of the control Yeerk.

  Creating four new Marco-and-V1 Collaborator shards seems like a pretty big win for team Harmony. I wonder what team Unity got or was hoping to get out of this?

  From chapter 50:

  > The whole point is for you to be placed into situations where your decisions are philosophically relevant—situations where you are free to choose, where the *constraints* on your choices are primarily *your* constraints—your morals, your values, your tradeoffs.

  So what were the *choices* the kids made in the last two chapters? What would have been the absolute best outcome for Crayak, and for the Ellimist, if those choices had gone differently?

  Are we supposed to know what mechanism V3 is using to precommit to keeping his promises? He might be in trouble with one of his own failsafes, now that Quat has been killed by a threat alien to the Arn world. Is V3 still bound to keep is promises to Quat morphs, just like the real thing?

  Oh crap, I just realized: The kids now have access to a morph body/mind that has spent significant time with V3, under Leeran Hypersight **and** has an eidetic memory. That means they have a complete copy of V3's mind up to the point when he made his deal with the Arn.

    ```
    I don't think the kids have any power to "choose" one path over another. Like, both E&C can simulate a million Marcos if they want, so Marco doesn't really have any ability to surprise either of them.

    The importance of their choices is that they constrain E&C's moves. Eg Marco's power isn't to say "I'm going to go that case", it's to say "I'm a bishop, and these are the only cases I'm willing to go to."

    Or, the way Jake puts it:

    > “If we are being jerked around,” he said.  “By the Ellimist, or Crayak, or whoever—if you’re trying to trick somebody into blowing up the world, it’s a lot easier to get them to flip the switch if they’re already willing.  If they’ve already made up their mind what would get them to do it. [...] I’m saying it’s a lot harder to trick you into blowing up the planet if you’re not the kind of person who goes around blowing up planets.  If you’re—if you’re humble.  Or scared.  If you’re not willing to do anything that drastic in the first place, because you’ve been wrong before.”

    So I think whatever negotiation took place between E&C to teleport the Animorphs to that planet, it had to factor in the fact that they were extremely unlikely to do anything *but* capture Visser One alive, when it came down to it.

    The only mechanism seems to be that Esplin sincerely intends to keep the promise (and Quat knew that), so he doesn't have to worry about any punishment for failing to do so.

    I think he's bound to the promise forever though, regardless of Quat's status. He thinks Quat is going to die eventually, but in his own thoughts he considers the planet untouchable indefinitely. It seems like he's bound to protect the planet itself rather than Quat or even the Arn as the whole.

    I wonder how far that really goes though. Like, if this is closer to an unbreakable vow than a pinkie swear, blackmail might be on the table. Once the Animorphs get back they could call Elena in a Bug fighter and tell her to use the Z-Space engine to ~~blow up~~ very slightly damage the Arn homeworld on their say so, and then tell Esplin they will only call it off if he commits in Leeran hypersight to stop being a jerk. Would that just work?

    Some of them are pretty easy to miss if you don't remember the books. Like, that bit about Elena almost killing Visser One by closing one eye is lifted straight up from *Visser*.

    Also, it's probably not a coincidence that Marco makes his "ruthlessness is seeing the line from A to B" speech in the same chapter Visser One is introduced in, much like in canon (sort of).
    ```

    - u/None:

      What happened with the closing one eye thing? I don't remember and failed at Googling it.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        One of V1's first hosts in *Visser* is Allison, a physicist woman for whom V1 kind of gets Lima's syndrome (before getting her pregnant, giving away the children for adoption, and murdering her, because it's that kind of book and V1 is that kind of person).

        At some point, V1 gives Allison control over one eye, to see what she'll do with it. Allison somehow hides that she realizes this, and tries to kill herself by closing the eye at a crucial moment while driving, to try and provoke a car accident.
        ```

          Eh? I'm pretty sure that interaction was with Eva; Allison was the drug addict that she just controlled with heroin.

              Wow did that pun actually exist.

                ```
                Oh no, that wasn't a pun, that was her nickname. Her description opens with:

                > Jenny-Lynne Cadwalader. Everyone called her Jenny Lines

                And it almost immediately goes on to explicitly say that the only thing she's interested in is drugs, and when she learns that she's being infested, her first question is if she can still get drugs.

                Even for the series, that book was *hardcore*.

  What exactly was the point of the 2^n naming scheme again? What advantage does it have over memorizing a simple ascending number or the date of transformation?

  Like, I guess it works as a method of proving when that Marclone was made, but only if he's never had access to a calculator or a piece of paper in the intervening time which can't be proven. I guess it's sort of an internal self-proof? But why would he need that?

      No, he made them over time.  Sometimes in small batches, like convincing a room of four cancer patients to all pitch in, but over time.

      The higher the 2^n number, the later in the original Marco's life the clone was made.

        Man, the more you think about it, the creepier the Animorph's resurrection/cloning scheme becomes. And he's done it ~30 times too.

  Amazing as always. I really thought, going into this chapter, that my biggest questions at the end would be, "Why are E and C constrained in Their ability to intervene?" and, "What does each god hope to get out of intervening?"

  (Elfangor and V1 met the gods directly on earth and came away with restrictions on their memories and behavior; maybe the gods precommitted to not messing with them directly in the future? Maybe that's why the kids had to be teleported a minimum distance away from V1? That could mean Chapman was significant to Their plans as well, which makes the fact that Rachel, who got the Chapmans killed, is "not supposed to be there" suddenly a lot more relevant. Or maybe V1 and Elena meeting the kids was a pure Ellimist goal, and Crayak's goal was for everyone to die in the mist. Maybe C's simulations predicted that that was the most likely outcome, the payoff of millions of years of E putting tree roots in front of fleeing Pemalites and tweaking supernovae so Howler ships fly just a little faster. A thousand tiny nudges later, Crayak's probability models are just the *teensiest* bit more optimistic than they should be.)

    > "Why are E and C constrained in Their ability to intervene?"

    EC are constrained because they fed themselves into a neutral "machine" which will now kill them if they violate the rules, basically, and they accepted this because they each thought they'd win in the end and playing out the game in this way would leave them with more matter to have fun with afterward.

  Something I didn't note in the beta read is how much I love the Multiple-Marco-Complete-Coordination-Sweep (There are probably cooler names for it that they would come up with). It not only makes sense as a thing that would happen if you had multiple clones of yourself working in tandem, but it's also badass and hella useful.

  So... yeah, I'm curious to know what's going to be stopping the animorphs from ALL making a bunch of copies of themselves out of terminal patients now. Maybe not all of them would be able to adapt to it as well as Marco, so maybe if the limiter is amount of terminal patients it would make sense to just keep letting him do it, but it's just such a powerful strategy that it seems like they really have to keep doing it, moving forward.

    > so maybe if the limiter is amount of terminal patients it would make sense to just keep letting him do it, but it's just such a powerful strategy that it seems like they really have to keep doing it, moving forward.

    Could the yeerks catch on that lots of terminal patients are disappearing, figure out why, and then either eliminate, move, or trap them?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Sure, but why would that be worse than not doing it? The only irreplaceable thing risked is the cube, and there are ways to protect that. Not foolproof, but not being willing to take risks when you're losing is how you ensure loss.
      ```

      - u/nipplelightpride:
        ```
        You said the limiter was the amount of terminal patients. If something brings that limit to zero then clones could no longer be made (or at least as easily)

    It's meant to be accessible without knowledge of canon, yeah; lots of readers here haven't read the original.  Give it like 2-4 chapters to find your feet?  At that point, you'll know whether you like it or not.

    - u/notgreat:
      ```
      Can confirm- haven't read the books except for maybe one or two over a decade ago and don't remember a thing about them, but I was able to follow along almost completely fine.

      Having introduced this fanfic to someone with more Animorphs knowledge did give me insight into some of the many in-jokes though. I particularly liked how >!maple syrup was derived from an actual canon plot point!<.
      ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Yeah, I'm asking because I kinda had opened the first paragraph and it was a bit intimidating. Yeerks? Elfangor? I'm really clueless about the context.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Yeah.  Think of it like a movie, where you start off sort of disoriented in the middle of an action scene, but once you're ten minutes in everything should make sense.

        But no pressure if it's too weird.

  I forget if this has already been covered or not (I'm long overdue for a complete re-read), but has the story described how Vissers who aren't Visser Three work? In other words, is "Visser One" an individual Yeerk shard, or is she a whole pool and the Animorphs are only bringing a small part of it home? Or is it a halfway thing where she's a shard that mingles with her native coalescion but has a special status not afforded to the rest of it?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    It hasn't been described in-text, but it's the last thing you said—they're shards from a particular pool, but those shards tend to stay largely the same between visits to the coalescion—the pool reconstitutes the same "Visser One" shard every time with like 99+% fidelity.

    In this case, though, the shard is "far from home," so yes, the Animorphs are bringing just that one single Yeerk with them.
    ```
