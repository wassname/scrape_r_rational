## [D][BST][Q]A battle of physical gods.

### Post:

Here is a thought experiment. Take two mostly mentally/cognitively human physical gods.

They are made nominally of matter and their minds depend on its organization.

Each of them has access to infinite energy that can be applied to the universe perceived by them as any expression of energy including creating raw matter out of nothing and space time curvatures.

They consciously must do this and understand what their doing.

Complex molecules require working through the setup.

Making dna out of nothing would be laborious, require intense focus and be time consuming.

Making globs of nitrogen, carbon etc and trying to spark off amino acid formation is substantially easier.

They are in opposition to each other. 

Their powers cannot directly effect the volume of an opponents body. Magical Space time curvatures can't intersect a body, momentum can't just be applied to every Atom of an opponent.

How do you expect them to attack each other and defend from such attacks?

  Relativistic antimatter neutron stars, and building up from there to relativistic shotgun swarms of black holes and naked singularities and bolo lariat cosmic strings.

- u/None:
  ```
  For defense, a white hole event horizon. They can't create anything in the volume of my body, and so surrounding that volume with a horizon means nothing they create can ever affect me in any way. I no longer exist in the same axis of time as they do. Either of us might choose to count this as a win, as this effectively causes solipsism to be true.

  And on the off chance that my opponent for some reason doesn't immediately do that as well, I simultaneously make a black hole horizon around his volume, and solipsism doesn't have to be true.

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    Peppering them with relativistic (but conventional) naked singularities would be just as effective and probably safer, because you're less likely to destroy the universe if you screw up.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This sounds a lot like the setup for all my favorite giant mecha shows.  Basically, I expect them to throw large meteors of elemental metals at each-other for sheer kinetic weaponry, since that minimizes the cognitive strain that actually imposes a cost on their reality-warping capabilities.
  ```

- u/fljared:
  ```
  Assuming they can't teleport or move in more than three dimensions,  throwing a enough matter next to them until a black hole forms should warp space time enough naturally that they're trapped.
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    Well they can't teleport per say. But they can probably just expand space in various ways faster then the speed of light in specific localities. 

    Or make a worm hole. Or just turn the blackholes inside out.

    I'm mostly looking for creative point and counter point methods.
    ```

- u/Murska1FIN:
  ```
  The interesting part is that they must understand what they're doing in order for it to work. Depending on how this is defined, and what sort of people our 'gods' happen to be, it's quite possible they won't be able to throw around exotic singularities or even antimatter.
  ```

- u/Nighzmarquls:
  ```
  For my part I started on this line of thought with realizing the alcubbiere drive is an excellent shield.

  There literally is not a way to fire through one.
  ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    The only way to stop a bad guy with an Alcubierre drive is a good guy with an Alcubierre drive?
    ```

    - u/krakonfour:
      ```
      Maybe a reversed drive that de-folds time in front of the opponent's Alcubierre drive?
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Well, assuming negative energy is a thing that exists. You specified the gods have infinite energy to work with, but that doesn't help them make negative energy.
    ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  Step one is cloning themselves into (presumably nonmagical) body copies a bunch to generate more ideas.

  An easy way out would be to go directly away from the other one at practically lightspeed. I'm not sure whether this automatically gets you out of trouble with the other god, or has a bottleneck in G forces, or through time/space dilation devolves into a game of "whoever says the bigger number wins".
  ```

- u/Chronophilia:
  ```
  Run away. As far as possible, faster than light if I can do that. The enemy can't kill what they can't find, unless they're willing to destroy the universe to stop me. If they are... well, I'll only have to worry about that particular problem once.

  Once I'm far enough that I think I haven't been followed, settle down on a quiet planet in a randomly selected galaxy and try not to do anything that can't be explained away as perfectly normal aliens playing with Kardashev Level II technology.

  Settle down for some hardcore research, like I'm writing a PhD thesis in godhood. Test my powers, see if I can reshape my body or back myself up or make tools that tap into my divine powers. Do some physics experiments, invent some new weapons, check if there's any possibility of tapping into time travel or parallel universes or FTL signalling (if I don't already have those). Maybe track down some actual aliens or a helpful Singularity and ask them for more ideas.

  Edit: Oh, and learn how to make food. Starch and water are easy enough, but they'll get boring very fast. It would be very embarrassing for a god to die of malnutrition.

    This response is  giving me ideas for a "physical god academy" I had planned for a setting.

    Thank you.

    Primary safety duties include maintaining a net around the galaxy to catch godlings and various super fast masses/spacetime contortions that they accidentally throw around.
    ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  Presumably, the godlings become empowered at the same time and in the atmosphere of a planet. Assuming I have first mover advantage (if I don't, I've already lost), I simply apply as close to infinite momentum to each atom within one meter of their head as I can, on a vector which intersects the center of mass of their head. It's a simple enough attack that I could absolutely understand how to apply it without first having a PHD in physics and it obliterates my foe in less time than it takes for the nerve impulses to be interpreted by their consciousness.
  ```

- u/Empiricist_or_not:
  ```
  Is finding a way to press C and make it painfully clear that your opponent gains nothing by pressing D an option?
  ```
