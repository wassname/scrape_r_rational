## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I just want to say I *think* I may have a new boyfriend (I do not know the French mores on when someone is a boyfriend or not, but, *bof*, just a matter of time) and what made me "like" his profile on OkCupid was that his favourite stories was basically a list of the /r/rational greatest hits. 

  So yeah, uh, a big thanks to this subreddit for being in the chain of causation.

  This my *Animorphs: The Reckoning* encouragement mini-thread, inspired by a conversation I had at lunch when I recommended the fic to someone.

  To u/TK17Studios: if you need any help and/or encouragement, here it is! We totally believe in you, and we know that whatever you post, it's going to be awesome! I myself can't wait to read what follows last chapter's cliffhanger.

  To everyone else, if you've recently felt the need to post anything related to r!Animorphs or whatever, or if you want to encourage the author yourself, this is the thread.

    u/TK17Studios dude, I have read the entire story up to this point at least twice and my girlfriend makes fun of me because I've been checking for a new chapter every morning since November. It's such an amazing story, and I really wish the canon book series had been this satisfying. Thanks for writing it, I had a jolt of excitement when I read that comment about the next Ax chapter being done and you working on Marco's.

  How do you think Hollywood movie production will change as China becomes an increasingly large market? They have 5x the population of the US, so if they begin to watch movies as much as the US, Europe, etc.  it'll become much profitable to target them as a demographic. Will franchises like the MCU slowly shift over to asian characters do you think?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I think the tokenism you see in current Hollywood blockbusters is more or less how it's going to be going forward. There won't be *all* asian characters, but there will probably be more of them. Partly I think that Hollywood isn't going to be able to out-China China, if that makes sense, and it really doesn't seem like the current state of affairs is hurting consumer response in China, at least so far as I can tell.

    Current trends:

    * Token characters who are Chinese and/or big names in China
    * Minor Chinese characters who have a larger role in the plot in the Chinese cut
    * Awareness/avoidance of Chinese taboos or things that the Chinese government doesn't like (no Taiwan, Tibet, Tienanmen Square)
    * More movies that adapt Chinese history and/or mythology
    * Elements of Chinese propaganda and/or changes to meet Chinese government approval
    * Movies set in China
    * Chinese product placement

    I think all those are on-track to continue, but I'm skeptical that we're going to see Hollywood succeed at catering to the Chinese audience by being more Chinese in other ways. One high-profile failure was *The Great Wall*, which failed to capture the market share in China that it was hoped to. More attempts will obviously be made, but if you're going to have a full Chinese cast with a very Chinese story, it doesn't make sense (to me) to have it be made in/by Hollywood at all. (And I personally think that Hollywood is better off not having much of China in their films, given how much the Chinese government likes to regulate the appearance of China and Chinese characters in their films, which really constrains the kinds of stories that can be told.)

    I mean it seems like to a certain extent it's just more of the big budget, large amount of special effects type things, ala the Transformers movies or i dunno the Warcraft movie did pretty well overseas. I've heard that if anything the lowering of the story elements and increasing of the more Action Movie plot made it do better in China although it could just be that over time there are more people watching movies in general. But even from last year the Hollywood movies that sold the best were like Infinity Wars, the Jurassic Park movie, Aquaman, Venom. And from this year it's much the same in terms of big ticket action films with impressive special effects.

  Is there something like a chapter synopsis of the Sequences?

  I've finally got around to start reading them, but I find myself forgetting some of the earlier chapters I've read, it doesn't help that many chapter titles aren't very indicative of the content, and often it takes a while for Yudkowsky to get to his point. So I was wondering if is there a table somewhere with just a few words to help me remember whenever I forget something so I don't need to scan through several pages to remember.

    There's a shortened version of RAZ called Rationality Abridged, which summarizes each chapter into a paragraph or two. At the end of the fifth book of RAZ there's also the interlude The Twelve Virtues of Rationality, which summarizes most of the book if you've read them.

  I know this is more suited to the Monday thread, but I've just caught up with the Cradle books and am looking for something else to sink my teeth into.

  My main requirement is that its something that can distract me for long periods of time so ideally something long (right now I'd prefer series to standalone books unless the books are really long) but also not so challenging to read that it needs to be read in one chapter chunks. It doesn't have to be rational or rational adjacent, I've just seen a lot of people here share my taste in books.

  Things I've enjoyed (list not exhaustive): hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, most of Terry Pratchett's stuff, Neil Gaiman's stuff, The Gods Are Bastards, Worth the Candle, Worm, Sanderson's books, Meiville's book, The Magicians series, Mother of Learning, Ready Player One, Ender's Game series, Dune

    I've got a bunch of long things to inhale.

    * The Symbiote by farmerbob1, guy gets a biocomputer AI in his body, then upgrades himself and earth. 

    * The Suneater series by Christopher Ruocchio, has 2 books so far. It's like the name of the wind in the universe of Dune. Prose can be a bit purple sometimes but it's high quality.

    * The System Apocalypse by Tao Wong. System apocalypse story with some neat ideas for litrpg. Characters are pretty good for the most part. Fun power fantasy.

    * The Games We Play by Ryuugi and Forged Destiny by Coeur Al'aran. Both are fanfiction of rwby but might as well be separate stories altogether. 

    * Twig and pact by wildbow. Twig is better than pact.

    * Savage Divinity by Ruffwriter. It's an english wuxia with transmigration. Easy to binge.

    * Zombie Knight Saga by George M Frost. Cool powers and they're used very interestingly. Some of my favorite superpowered fights outside of worm.

    - Codex Alera would suit you. It's a six-book series, where each book is a standard long-ish fantasy novel.
     - If you haven't read the Belgariad/Mallorean yet, those are fun as well, if a bit tropey (partly due to age, partly just because they're like that, but these are classics for a reason). I'm mostly recommending this because the tone is ever-so-slightly like The Gods Are Bastards (Tellwyrn occasionally seems near-indistinguishable from Belgarath).
     - The Long Earth series is quite neat, and is a Terry Pratchett/Stephen Baxter collaboration iirc. It's more sci-fi than fantasy.
     - The Powder Mage trilogy is fairly good. I'm most of the way through book 2 at the moment and I'm enjoying it so far.
     - [The Iron Teeth](http://www.ironteethserial.com), a webserial about a cowardly goblin who falls in with outlaws. It's a great deal of fun, even though the technical parts of the writing can be a bit weak. If you enjoyed Mother of Learning it shouldn't bother you too much though.
     - I'm not sure exactly how to best describe it (gritty crossed with idealistic?) but David Gemmell wrote quite a few books that I really loved (my username is drawn from one of his characters). A good starting point is *Legend* - if you like that, ping me and I can recommend a reading order if you want, or just go through in whatever order catches your fancy. Other than the Waylander and Skilgannon books, I don't think the order in which you read them matters much.

    I'm happy to elaborate on any series you're intrigued by and want more info on too.

  I've joined the Search & Rescue team for my county as a means of volunteering & learning useful skills. Team members are asked to share their skills in training sessions, and while I haven't been tapped yet, I'd like to have something to teach if and when I am.

  I'm a novice at most of the outdoor skills that the group practices (technical climbing, river rescues, tracking, etc.) The one thing I think I could bring to the team is tactics for eliminating cognitive biases and fallacies which could get in the way during a crisis situation.

  What tools would be most useful for a group of people who often need to operate as a team in dangerous circumstances? DaystarEld's "problem debriefing" from OoS, in which each team member brings forward the things they did wrong & could improve on, seems perfectly suited to this. Any other suggestions of tactics, or of different topics that a bookish rationalist could usefully teach a group of hardy outdoorspeople?
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    You would probably want to classify your skills as planning, rather than something specific and obscure as eliminating biases. You don't want to try explaining why some processes could be biased during an emergency situation, that would be insane given how long it could take, you would want to be one of the people who sets up the procedures that are taught to everyone for emergency situations. Although it's an open question as to whether those procedures are currently biased enough that you could meaningfully improve them in a short time.

    Honestly it just doesn't seem like all that applicable a skillset. Maybe try doing some cardio at the gym so that even if you aren't skilled in what the group does, you wouldn't be physically left behind.

        Better start lifting and running with weight for S&R. Where I'm from it means a lot of stretcher carries, running with your pack of gear, lifting people, moving obstacles, and stabilizing spines/breaks in awkward positions.

    Personal opinion here: rationality is overrated.

    I mean, if you know a good briefing/debriefing system, it *is* something worth sharing, but otherwise, specific domain knowledge beats general rationality almost every time.

    One failure mode of rationalism and other self-help domains is trying too hard to apply a few specific techniques in situations where they don't really bring anything.

    If you wanna go that route, I'd recommend looking into crisis management advice from other emergency workers (eg emergency triage, risk-taking, advice on communication in crisis situations) and look for applicable exercises.

      Perhaps better to phrase that as "thinking hard is overrated". In this case I agree with you that domain knowledge wins. Because we agree on this, I propose that having / relying on domain knowledge is the rational thing to do - and us deciding whether to rely on domain knowledge, or to question it, is us being rational.

    >What tools would be most useful for a group of people who often need to operate as a team in dangerous circumstances?

    (Things that seem useful, seem like things you'll already be doing.)

    Work on the skills\*\*\* you need to use - individually, and as a group.

    Work on team work/team effectiveness. (Make sure everyone has what's needed to communicate. I don't know how Search & Rescue operates or how likely it is for the team/individual members to get lost, but sensible ways of operating might prepare for this (communication devices\* such as walky-talkies) and prevent it (buddy system + navigator tech &/or skills\*\*\*\*).

    Other answers mentioned domain specific knowledge.\*\* This might be what you're looking for. You could try research, and talking to people - **do you know anyone who has done this?**

    \*Only thing I might add here is backup batteries. Also might be a good idea if you won't necessarily be back somewhere you can charge stuff for a time. Generally make sure you have everything you're supposed to have. (Use a checklist?)

    \*\*If I were to make this point, I'd say, knowledge wise, the goal isn't re-inventing the wheel - it's getting up to speed. I started this with skills and equipment because those will probably be needed, and are how preparation/planning cashes out - they're what you need to achieve the goal.

    \*\*\*I'm not sure if this is your job (find out), but depending on the circumstances, in addition to *finding* people, if they're injured/too cold/too hot/starving/thirsty/etc. or some combination thereof, having skills to recognize the problem + stuff to fix it might be useful. Emergency blankets, basic first aid (skills and supplies), etc.

    \*\*\*\*I don't think you'll end up needing to navigate using only a paper map (perhaps best sealed in a bag, so it's safe from water) and a compass, but I could be wrong.

    I wouldn't work for the government. I would be a high end courier who can take your package directly from your door to it's intended recipient in a flash. I would charge enough that I could cover a reasonable standard of living for myself as well as hire competent people at decent wages to deal with the legals, client management, etc. 

    Perhaps I would do a combination of private couriering door to door as well as m9ve bulk deliveries internationally (maybe transporting produce to far off countries saving on refrigeration or whatever else is involved in transit). 

    Part of the job of the people I hire would be to ensure I never transport something I find ethically questionable like weapons, I would probably carry a scanner to check on things or require a visual inspection.

    I think I would also not necessarily need to make a lot of money if I didn't want to. I could have a tent I pitch up wherever the weather's good, teleport to public toilets wherever they're cleanest, bathe in hot springs, forage food from several countries or eat at temples where food is free. I think at 16 something like this would have been appealing to me. It's also appealing to know you can afford to turn down work cause you'd always be fine anyways.

  I've been wondering- is there some sort of updated map/link directory to other rationalist communities?

  And I don't mean Slate Star Codex or Lesswrong. I mean international communities. 

  Various political terms, 'famous' people references, references in general, meetup locations and CFAR made me realize- I am an outsider here, in practical terms. It's an American site with (mostly) American people, referring to events and terms local to you. It'll be nice to find a place where a theoretical meetup wouldn't require getting a visa and crossing the ocean.

  Other than that, it'll be fascinating to see how does this community connect to others- rationalists are focused on global issues, and it's hard to work on those alone.

            Not really, but I've heard enough similar arguments that I think I can still make the point. You may need to elaborate.

            We certainly don't have enough evidence that every possible reality exists to make any sweeping statements about reality, if that's what you're hinting at. If anything the anthropic principle strongly suggests otherwise, boltzmann brains notwithstanding.

            That's all esoteric enough that it's not really going to be useful though. We try to stick to the practical.

              How about "every possible reality that contains us"? Isn't that the basis of probabilistic reasoning?

              >If anything the anthropic principle strongly suggests otherwise, boltzmann brains notwithstanding.

              How, exactly? Isn't the anthropic principle just "we find ourselves in places where ~~it's possible for us to~~ we exist, no matter how a priori 'improbable' that would be"?

                No? Nothing about probabilistic reasoning implies any kind of splitting, or any support for a many-worlds interpretation of reality. We use probabilistic reasoning simply because we can't take perfect measurements of reality, not because there are multiple realities to be measured. It seems your arguments (?) are predicated on a multiple-worlds interpretation of reality. There's just no real evidence for that.

                But without really understanding what point you're trying to make with the whole "universal dovetailer function" thing I can't really elaborate.
