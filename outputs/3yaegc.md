## Trying to write a rational yugioh or yugioh gx fic, for the zillionth effing time

### Post:

So I've been attempting to start a rational yugioh or yugioh-like fic, over and over again for the past year or so, and have been utterly failing at it and I am out of my mind with frustration.

Let's go over some of the issues, shall we?

The anime metagame is both completely different from the real life metagame and it seems like metagames are too complex to make up an entirely new one from scratch. That's assuming any metagame remotely like the one in the show is even POSSIBLE. Not just whether it's balanced, but whether a metagame that fits the plot is even possible. In the anime, Duel Monsters does involve at least some skill, but in the real life metagame there's barely any skill involved at all. After a certain minimum amount of skill level is reached, it becomes all about who has the most money and better luck. If your opponent is a decent player and gets the right opening hand, you're pretty much certain to lose. Because of this, newer and inexperienced players can sometimes have an overwhelming advantage against long time veterans of the game. 

I know that if a card game falls out of the laws of the universe it doesn't have to be a particularly good game because reality doesn't optimize for balance and fun and game design. But really, the way the game is now is SO unbalanced, and gaming skill is SO overshadowed by money and luck, that even if the game was "cosmically significant" (whatever that even means), no one in their right minds would want to play it for fun if there were other options, and no one in their right minds would play it competitively unless they had enough money, and that's true even if you take the "heart of the cards" into account. The "King of Games" doesn't even need to be a really good gamer! He just has to be halfway decent enough and have a lot of money. And as far as I can tell that's almost always been the case with yugioh tcg at least to some extent.

And the whole idea of the "heart of the cards" just screams at me that it's a blatant excuse by those who win in the game to justify their victories. Virtuous people believe in the heart of the cards, and so win more of their duels, and wicked people don't believe, and therefore don't win as much. It's blatantly propaganda, and the fact that so much of the series' worldbuilding depends on it just makes me shudder.

But at the same time, everything needs to come down to a card-game based showdown.

Unfortunately, there are ONLY TWO tabletop customizable strategy card games that exist which aren't ridiculously expensive to play competitively and where player skill actually matters: Mage Wars Arena and Mage Wars Academy, both created by Arcane Wonders. 

But Mage Wars Arena's game length is way too long for a yugioh story. The game takes 1 or 2 hours to play, and it takes even longer to narrate it.

And Mage Wars Academy only has two mages released so far, the wizard and the beastmaster, and the card pool is too small for a yugioh story. In yugioh, characters are introduced with and identified by their strategic playstyle. For instance, in the original show, mako tsunami always uses fish and water cards. Yugi prefers to use mostly spellcasters and warriors. Katsuya Jounochi uses luck-based strategies (!!!!!!!), Kaiba uses dragons, Kujaku Mai uses harpies, etc.

That kind of diversity seems to be rather necessary for a duelist kingdom sort of scenario to even be possible. If everyone's using a wizard or a beastmaster every single chapter, things will get stale fast.

Of course, in Arena the game is a bit more complex and their are a lot more cards and strategies to choose from. There are practically infinite strategies you can use for a wizard in Arena, and practically infinite strategies you can use for a beastmaster in Arena. And in Arena, you can actually be creative and design your strategies. However, because of the tiny card pool and simpler gameplay in Academy, coming up with new decks is a lot more like a word search with a bit of fill-in-the-blank than actual deck design.

I keep getting ideas for rational yugioh or yugioh-like stories, and they keep failing. This has been going on for about a year or so. Please help!

### Comments:

- u/storybookknight:
  ```
  Think of The Origin of Species  (the Pokemon fic, I mean.) It makes the setting more rational. If Yugioh is actually a bad game, invent the world where the game is actually fun to play and makes sense.
  ```

- u/Vebeltast:
  ```
  Go the opposite direction. From what I understand, the heart of the cards is supposed to be similar to Spiral Energy in that it rewards duelists that "believe". So make your story *actually* rational, rather than *mostly* rational in a way that confirms expectations, and examine the Heart of the Cards as claimed. Is there really such a thing? If so, why has nobody seriously examined it or questioned it? How does it work? For the love of Bayes, *why*? And, finally, how do I use it to win, maybe not just in the game? The existence of such a thing implies some very odd things about the cosmology, especially if you're using shuffled decks instead of some kind of randomizer. Why would someone that can pull that kind of crap be sitting around doing it to *card games*?

  As for the game, I think I agree with /u/storybookknight. Change things to make the game fun. Same way the anime did it, same way MoR declared that things like the fidelias charm didn't exist, that kind of thing.

    But that then leaves the issue of making up a completely new metagame from scratch. Metagames can be very complicated, and making up an entirely new one might not be feasible if I'm trying to make it in any way realistic whatsoever.

    Then again, Mage Wars Academy, while lacking in diversity, might not be too difficult to conceptualize a fictional metagame around. But that doesn't have heart of the cards. In fact it doesn't even have shuffling. All cards in your deck are accessible at any time in Mage Wars Academy.

    To be honest, I'm not sure I actually *can* answer all those questions about the heart of the cards. If such a thing exists, the only possible explanation I have been able to think of so far is that the matrix lord likes to play card games, and when they discovered the existence of sapient beings in their simulation, the matrix lord created some special algorithms for one of the card games that humans created which the matrix lord liked, in order to spice things up. But that seems really narratively unsatisfying. Especially since if the matrix lord is smart enough to even make and mess with a simulated universe like that in the first place, they should be smart enough to put in a better game. If they don't like how much of an impact luck would otherwise have on the one true children's card game, why wouldn't they just create a better one true children's card game where luck doesn't have as much impact, and insert that into the simulation, rather than creating a patch to fix the luck factor (the heart of the cards)?

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      The illusion of a metagame shouldn't be too hard to create. In the original show, the main character always won unless the plot demanded, anyway.
      ```

      - u/xThoth19x:
        ```
        Exactly, the meta in the anime was based on fake rules that weren't codified bc the game came out after the show. So the rules were made up on the fly.
        ```

    - u/Vebeltast:
      ```
      That's fair. I think the anime skates by by simply not having enough space with which to actually show enough cards for it to have a metagame that can be analyzed and outdone by the fans.

      Another option is to take a meta from a few years or decades ago rather than using the current meta. Might require some archaeology. For example, if I were running a similar thing with MtG, I'd probably restrict myself to a meta from back before Urza's because it seems like the meta hasn't dipped back below turn-4 kills since then.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I think you have the impression that any rational writer that includes a game in their stories needs to actually design a full game from scratch. You really don't have to do it, just make sure that you don't end up contradicting yourself.

    http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fidelius_Charm D= Wow, yeah, that's extremely problematic

    tl:dr; it could be used to make any given fact unknowable. Yes it could be undone by bribing the designated secret keeper, but it's not that hard to find a secret keeper either wont take the bribe or can't be identified.

  ```
  In the show, the rich people carry away all the victories as well (why else is Kaiba the champion?). The only way the protagonists can beat them is by the power of magic, or through rare cards they acquired via special circumstances. The original show's protagonist admits at the end that he is straight up cheating every game via magic. Add to that the fact that people regularly create cards to personally benefit themselves...

  It's also clear that you have a strong personal dislike of the actual yugioh community and don't perceive any skill in the actual game you're trying to write a fic about. As such, what kind of skill are you hoping to see in your protagonists? The original "king of games" regularly exploited the rules rather than used skill to win challenges; you might want a game where out of the box exploits are more possible, perhaps a game where some degree of real action is important like the "entertainment duels" of Arc-V.
  ```

- u/MadScientist95387:
  ```
  My interpretation of "The Heart of the Cards" is that it's magic.

  Magic is repeatedly shown to exist. The millenium items. The shadow riders. That time Yami Bakura used a card with ropes in its art to tie up a security guard. Whatever the seal of orichalcos is.

  So what does Atem mean by "The Heart of the Cards"? Probability manipulation magic. It's his ability to nudge reality into letting him draw the cards he wants. Maybe people who form emotional attachments to their cards are better at controlling them with luck magic. It's flimsy, but would fit with the strange name.

    This is canon. Drawing the card you need is a practicable skill in-universe. I seem to remember they even have a class on it in Yugioh GX.

- u/Anakiri:
  ```
  This seems to be a common pitfall for aspiring rational fiction writers. Your metagame emerges from the mechanics and the card set and card availability, so clearly you need to figure all that out before you can even begin writing the story, and...

  Mention enough of the theory to get me to trust you. Make sure that everything I see is consistent enough that I can make predictions based on it. Then declare everything else by author fiat. HPMOR never presented the Grand Unified Theory of Magic, because Eliezer didn't have one. Those details wouldn't deserve screentime anyway. You want to be an author, not a game designer. *Cheat.*
  ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    Thanks. I think this was really helpful advice. In that case, I'll probably stick with Mage Wars, since that's what I like most and am most familiar with. The next question is whether to use Mage Wars Arena, Mage Wars Academy, or my own version? If I use Arena, I would have to cheat past the long game length somehow. Games of Arena normally last 1-2 hours. Maybe if I don't show the whole duel every time? Maybe I could show the opening moves, move the perspective to things taking place outside the game for a while, and then say things like "They had been at it for over an hour, and things were finally coming to a head" or "So-and-so was losing badly," and then describe the current state of the game, or something.

    Alternatively, I could go with Mage Wars Academy. The thing with that of course is that the card pool for that is rather small at the moment, and there are very few options for viable decks, so introducing characters with their preferred playstyle might not work that well with Academy. However, Academy is simpler and easier to explain than Arena. Hmmm...
    ```

- u/Vebeltast:
  ```
  ...I wonder if you could simply replace the card game entirely with Magic. Just substitute it entirely mechanics wise. Keep the flavor, keep the bit where for some cards there are only four in existence, etcetera. A well-commentated game of MtG is potentially ten major events worth commentary, which feels right.
  ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    Maybe. But then the whole idea of it originating in ancient egypt doesn't work, because there aren't hidden trap cards in MtG. Though I suppose in some ways it might be more thematic. After all, a LOT of the earlier yugioh cards seemed more medieval-fantasy themed, so the whole ancient egyptian connection would have seemed to be pulled out of the author's a** if it weren't for the millenium puzzle.

    MtG still has the problem of money overshadowing skill by a lot, but it's definitely not as bad as it is with yugioh.

    In MtG, how well-built a deck is has a bigger impact on game outcomes than card access, card access has a bigger impact on game outcomes than in-game skill, and in-game skill tends to have a bigger impact on game outcomes than luck, though I remember reading somewhere that games are lost to mana drought and mana flood a third of the time, and I've experienced quite a few games of magic like that and it is very frustrating.

    Unfortunately, even the best deckbuilder in the world probably wouldn't be able to make a competitive deck without at least $300 to burn, but someone with at least $300 can just netdeck.

    And while I kinda like mtg, it's not really very exciting to me anymore. I was burnt out on MtG quite a while ago, and I've tried to go back a few times because it seems to have such a stranglehold on tabletop gaming culture and it's apparently a really useful way to meet other tabletop gamers because EVERYONE plays it. Maybe I would like it if I picked it up again. Maybe I should have stuck to limited formats like booster draft and sealed deck, although then you can't really customize your deck as much.
    ```

    - u/Vebeltast:
      ```
      AFAICT, Magic gets a lot better if you play one of the random draft formats. I just got back into it after going to college, but the people I know that play a lot without burning out (or burning money) tend to play a ton of limited and sealed. 

      Maybe make up some kind of in-between format, where you bring ten cards and draft the other twenty, or bring fifteen and can use up to eight? Potentially a nice middle ground, and allows some comboing, but you have a tradeoff between running your nicely tuned combo and building something that actually works with what you drafted, and another between bringing cards that'll work generally and cards that need you to draft particular other cards, and so on and so forth. "Did you hear? X brought a *Stasis*!" "What?! You think he's actually going to use it?" "Yeah, he's nuts."
      ```

  I'm sorry, but the way you wrote this post makes me feel like you don't like Yugioh at all, and you're writing this more to prove a point than you are to make a legitimate piece of work???

  I'd love to be wrong about this guess of mine. Tell me why you want to write this so badly that you've obsessed for a year about it?

    I like the yugioh anime and the manga, and I really like the premise of high stakes card-battles, and my memories of watching the yugioh anime are very nostalgic to me. It's just that when I tried to play the real life version of the game it was so unbalanced and there was so little freedom to be creative and there was so much less skill involved and money and luck were too big of a factor by comparison...Aside from the whole heart of the cards thing I really like the premise, I just kinda became disillusioned with the real life game because its flaws make it not very fun and there's very little freedom to customize your strategy and still have it be viable or even playable.

    And when I try to imagine an anime version of the metagame or something analogous that could actually be realistic and be balanced *enough* to have a sufficient amount of skill, strategic and playstyle diversity that a decent rational yugioh retelling deserves, I come up short. I don't think Kazuki Takahashi knew anything about what metagames are or how they work, and it shows.

    For instance, in the show there are only 4 copies of Blue Eyes White Dragon in existence, it has no special effects, and it's 3000 attack points are supposed to be a really big deal. This should mean that effect monsters tend to have lower attack/defense than normal monsters, but that was never really true--not in real life and not in the anime. And the show never involves any siddecking. The shadow duels are never shadow matches. This means that a villain who is at all familiar with yugi's deck could just make a hate-deck and defeat yugi with it easily, since he can't sidedeck anything. Except that would only be true if Yugi (or any of the other characters) actually had a coherent strategy instead of "I play this random card because the plot demands it, and not because I actually had a good reason to put it in my deck."

    Long story short, I think the yugioh tcg is a game that could have been really good but isn't because the people who make it screwed it over. And trying to create a fictional metagame that's actually fun is like fantasizing over a game that doesn't and will never exist. Since I don't enjoy the real life game in the ridiculously broken form it has been constantly forced into since the very beginning, it's hard to be enthusiastic about a version of the game that I would really like if I could actually try it in real life, but can't try in real life.
    ```

    - u/Drazelic:
      ```
      I'm just gonna say that your problem doesn't feel like a problem that can be solved with a fanfic, of all things to try to solve it with.

      >And trying to create a fictional metagame that's actually fun is like fantasizing over a game that doesn't and will never exist.

      Have you tried it? Game design can be fun! Of course if you don't try to create it, it'll never exist. Same goes for fics, though; it's not like any fic you write is going to overthrow the dominant paradigm of YGO meta or anything, so...?

      >Since I don't enjoy the real life game in the ridiculously broken form it has been constantly forced into since the very beginning, it's hard to be enthusiastic about a version of the game that I would really like if I could actually try it in real life, but can't try in real life.

      Again: it REALLY sounds like what you want to do isn't write a story, what you want to do is design a game.

      So... design a game, then? It's honestly NOT that hard to come up with a game more balanced than YGO, because you, unlike Konami, are not constrained by market forces demanding that you make molochian tradeoffs of fun for profitability. Seriously, give it a shot!

      -------

      That said, there's definitely something interesting to be said for the fact that literally every single person you EVER meet in the yugioh anime has their own archetype. No realistic card game could possibly be so diverse; there's definitely something going on with that. Maybe it's worth exploring? Maybe in your version of the setting, people create their own cards and just get the cards verified and encoded into the game by some sort of superintelligence-equivalent-entity that lives in the duel monsters dimension, who's responsible for maintaining competitive balance?
      ```

- u/GaBeRockKing:
  ```
  Just revert to one of the more skill based formats. Goat control is a good one.
  ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    Would goat control format have enough playstyle diversity to fill the entire yugioh duel monsters series?

    Also, where can I play goat control? I googled it and I still haven't found out where people play it online.

    Also, where can I look up a list of successful decks in goat format? According to the banlist on duelistgroundz level limit area b is forbidden, but it is listed in one of the decks here:

    http://formatlibrary.weebly.com/goats/goat-control-deck-gallery
    ```

    - u/RolandsVaria:
      ```
      You can play Goat Format on Dueling Network, all you need to do is go to Unlimited and advertise for Goat Format, and people will show up in a couple minutes. But there is definitely not much variety in that format, there are like 3 competitive decks and 70% of those decks are the same.

      As for your problem, I don't think it's much of a problem. Why? Because, in the anime it's plainly apparent that people can manipulate the probability of their draws. Therefore, decks that would normally be unviable, become viable. Why would a character not simply use the most well constructed deck at any given time? Simple, if you want the Heart of the Cards to work for you, you need to be using a deck that you genuinely love, not just the most competitive one. Something like that.

  ...Woah there. Arcane Wonders [is by no means alone](https://boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=rank&advsearch=1&q=&include%5Bdesignerid%5D=&include%5Bpublisherid%5D=&geekitemname=&range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D=&colfiltertype=&searchuser=Roxolan&nosubtypes%5B0%5D=boardgameexpansion&playerrangetype=normal&propertyids%5B0%5D=1002&familyids%5B0%5D=4667&B1=Submit) in that domain.

  Not that I would suggest using a real card game; that was just my gut reaction. It is very hard to make a comic about strictly-defined boardgames, because of the pace and barrier to entry, and considerably harder to write a novel about it, because of the lack of visual aids to track game state.

  YuGiOh the early anime & manga effectively played like a squad tactics game, with victory defined [not by clear-cut rules](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewRulesAsThePlotDemands) but by whether your mecha-gorrilla's armour can protect him from my acid rain long enough for it to topple my demonic monolith. Pokemon with card game trappings. That seems much easier to write and much more entertaining to read.
