  [Here's](https://wildbow.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/an-end-to-the-twig-experiment/) a link to Wildbow blogging about his experience writing Twig. He even mentions that he'll be posting short interim chapters for the next few weeks as a bridge between Worm and Worm 2. So be warned if you are going in expecting Wildbow's usual mega-sized chapters and only find a short chapter.

  So technically this isn't the first chapter of the sequel yet, but thanks for posting anyway /u/Saxifrage_Russell.

  Forgot about Worm's formatting. At first I thought OP had managed to link us to their personal login :/

  I really need to finish Worm. I stopped at some point after the big battle in India, and never started again. It was good for a while, and then started to drag. I'm not sure exactly what it was. I still recommend it to others.

    I'm in the same position as you. After the Slaughterhouse 9 showed up, the story just became too harrowing for me to find continue. I like superhero fantasies and the pre-Leviathan arcs appealed to me in that way, similar to season 1 of Daredevil, but after that it seemed to transition into the genre of survival horror and I don't find that enjoyable to read.

      I got to the same point as you did it seems, once the S9 showed up in just kinda lost interest. Seeing the super-hyped serial killers losing repeatedly in their early appearances with the knowledge that the S9 arc is insanely long killed my motivation to read any further. 

      Which sucks, cos I loved the Leviathan arc.

        I liked Leviathan at the time, it arrived rather abruptly but it was an fitting way to upend the status quo. The problem I have with it is that it utterly derailed the direction the story was heading in by killing so many people and reducing half the city to rubble. 

        That’s when the story stopped being a drama about a angsty teenager struggling to do good in her situation in order to escape her abusive school life, and instead is just about surviving each day in a nearly destroyed city filled with terrifying monsters.

        Seeing characters I like get tormented at every turn for arbitrary reasons is painful to read. Breaking Bad had characters who did objectively despicable things so I was okay with seeing them get screwed over, but Taylor is so sympathetic that I need to see her succeed to feel satisfaction.

          Post-Leviathan was when it went downhill for me too. I thought undercover-hero Taylor was much more interesting and sympathetic than brutal-warlord Taylor, and once she lost my support I just stopped.

          To be honest I'm fine with characters I like suffering if something comes out of it in the end. But if it's pain for the sake of pain, then I'm going to become detached because what's the point?
          ```

            I 100% agree. The Way of Shadows is one of my favorite books of all time because it takes me down a dark, disturbing, and disgusting road to the deepest pit of despair only to pull me back up into the light of hope. I can’t recommend it enough.

            Kylar endures far more abuse than Taylor and does far worse things, but the fact that he ultimately develop even more determination to do good and stronger moral clarity makes me idolize him as much as sympathize. The book is even darker than Worm, but uses it to tell a more satisfying story.
