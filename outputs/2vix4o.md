  "We got pings from *weUvCtxfeko2MnDh*. No sapients."

  "Then that's all of them, right?"

  "Should be."

  "That's anti-climactic. So what's the total?"

  "Five Eganed out, seven Strossed, twelve other stupid AI events, a couple hundred nuked themselves, a slightly smaller number ran out of resources, about twenty did both, eighty to eighty-two from pandemics depending on your definition, and three volcanoes."

  "So that covers the Fermi paradox?"

  "Well, here at least. The bottles more or less match up, but we haven't observed any oscillators yet. There should be at least a dozen according to the models. The *KReeYHrs535H6oPh* descendants are already launched towards everything in the Virgo Cluster."

  "Things going around in circles aren't exactly that interesting."

  "That's the entire cosmos in a nutshell. Honestly, I'd be bored out of my mind if valuing 'actual' observations wasn't hard-coded in."

  "Then it's all a crapshoot for Team Reality."

  "If you lived through Old Earth, you realize that's always been the case."

  "How often do non-solipsist cultures turn up in the bottles, anyways?"

  On a higher plane of existence, a counter incremented by one.
