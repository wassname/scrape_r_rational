## [Biweekly Challenge] Definition

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8udp2g/biweekly_challenge_cult/), the prompt was "Cult". Our winner is /u/eniteris, with their story, ["Burn Before Reading"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8udp2g/biweekly_challenge_cult/e1xrsiq/). Congratulations to /u/eniteris!

##### This Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Definition**. The definitions game often makes up a large part of rational debate, and it's a fond pastime of this subreddit to endlessly debate what words mean as (charitably) a method of getting to the heart of what we actually mean to mean when we speak to each other. This is especially important when that definition is going to be put into some kind of rules-based system, which is going to do useful work with that formal definition. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit!

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, July 25th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided. (This mostly applies to calling for outside parties to vote.)

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Uplift**. Per [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_(science_fiction\)), this is the transformation of a less-intelligent species into a more-intelligent species, but the usage has extended a bit beyond that, encompassing social, intellectual, or technological change as well.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 7/25**. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [is available here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8y5rp3/challenge_companion_definition/)
