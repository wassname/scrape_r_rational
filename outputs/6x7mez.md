  This was great :) Particularly loved the "moral crises" the doctor had and Alice's response.

  Fucking hilarious. Nice work.

  ```
  Well done! An interesting concept of quote-unquote mutually beneficial cultural exchange.

  Rarely have I laughed so hard.

  That doctor needs to get out more if he considers *that* unenthical

  > Since all communication by an instance of SCP-3171 can be overheard by neighboring instances, SCP-3171 developed a rudimentary version of public key cryptography to communicate privately.

  So, uh, how would this work, considering that the private key wouldn't actually be private?

    Diffie-Hellman key exchange creates a key that both parties know without an outside observer being able to figure it out. It relies on some clever mathematical "tricks", and on the difficulty of reversing some mathematical operations.

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's completely possible that I'm very confused here (my understanding of crypto is weak) but why wouldn't the private key be private?
    ```

      ```
      Aaaand that's why I shouldn't make comments while sleep-deprived.

      Carry on.
