  I like BoC but does it really belong on the sub? Have a hard time squaring that one. From the protagonist's perspective, he just wants to farm and becomes OP by coincidence. The animal characters definitely aren't rational.

    I agree that it isn't a explicitly rational, and I wouldn't want to see constant posts of updates (especially since the author puts out four a week). But I personally really enjoy the updates and come back to it once a week. It's wholesome, and also a good inversion of some common xanxia tropes. My two cents - it isn't rational, but a lot of readers here may enjoy it anyway.

    IMO, it fits in the weekly recommendation thread, but it doesn't need its own update threads. Still, I wouldn't want this post removed because it IS a series I think a lot of readers here would like.

      My 2Â¢ is that, if it isn't rational, there really shouldn't be an update thread for it, and it should at least be removed for having the RT tag. 

      Especially because we have threads for all sorts of other things things, from non-rat fic to off-topic discussions, the other threads should be reserved for actual rational/ist fics.
