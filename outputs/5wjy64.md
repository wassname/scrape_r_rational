## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

[It looks like AutoModerator didn't do their job, so I've decided to post instead]

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

-    Seen something interesting on /r/science?
-    Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
-    Figured out how to become immortal?
    Constructed artificial general intelligence?
-    Read a neat nonfiction book?
-    Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

    From a normative perspective, all of this is fairly standard stuff, most of which I agree with. From a practical perspective, however, it's often quite difficult to successfully obey the guidelines presented, and attempting to do something halfway can sometimes be worse than doing nothing at all. In particular, I find the first sub-heading ("Recognize and eliminate inconsistencies") to be cause for concern. Quite often, internal inconsistencies are a sign of a deeper disagreement between different parts of *yourself*, and as such investigating them more carefully can lead to valuable self-insights. Much like the Straw Vulcan pitfall of ignoring one's emotions in favor of cold, hard "rationality" (which, I should note, I'm very happy to see this document caution against, even if said warning amounts to little more than a footnote), there's also a stigma against holding inconsistent positions, despite the fact that, as humans, both the former and the latter are virtually unavoidable. Yes, of course you should aspire to be as internally consistent as possible--but when you *aren't*, there's often a reason for it that's worth meditating on. Unless you've already performed such a meditation, I'd caution against following the linked document's advice on eliminating all inconsistencies as quickly as possible. Don't be so eager to [bludgeon part of yourself into submission](http://mindingourway.com/youre-allowed-to-be-inconsistent/).

    [It's been slacking elsewhere, too](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/5wgtj3/automoderator_missed_scheduled_post/). It's also a bit sluggish at flairing things too for reasons unknown.

      I would bet it's related to the AWS outage.

  I finally put together a review of the logistics / classes of the CFAR workshop I volunteered at [here](https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2017/02/28/cfar-workshop-february-2017-review/). CFAR is currently doing a blitz of workshops, so if you're on the fence, my review may be of interest.

  From where science is standing now, is it likely that at least read-only timetravel is theoretically possible? By that I mean not actually changing the past, but recovering information directly from it, that is otherwise lost. If it is, what are chances that some AI in future creates copies of all people who ever lived from right before the died, effectively creating heaven?

    It seems impossible to isolate a system enough to actually simulate physics backwards (e.g. turn a dissolved salt crystal in a specific glass of water back to the original salt crystal), let alone do so for the whole light cone out to any reasonable distance.

    However, a possible alternative would be to look for naturally occurring amplifiers/information preservation mechanisms that lock information in time *before* entropy becomes too bad. Specifically, interstellar vacuum is notoriously empty, and blocks a very small fraction of photons passing through it. Once the information about your atoms leaves the atmosphere, there is very little further distortion over long periods of time.

    If we are very lucky, perhaps there is a way to resolve the positions of individual atoms at every point in history by careful examination and cross-referencing of interstellar dust. The tricky bit is that a lot of entropy would occur for most signals pertaining to those atoms, before they escape the atmosphere, e.g. atmospheric physics.

      Fiction ideas:

      1. People become immortal when they leave the atmosphere, thanks to the reduction of thermal noise. Astronauts who go on spacewalks can be resurrected, but nobody else.
      2. People only become immortal when they venture sufficiently far into deep space away from solar noise. Only some astronauts (who make trips to the far side of the moon, or further) qualify.
      3. Gamma ray bursts from nearby supernovae cause everyone at specific moments in history to be resurrectable. Depends whether they are in the correct region to intercept the beam.
      4. Beyond some specific number of decades, the necessary math becomes uncomputable, even with galaxies worth of computing power. So there's a time limit for trying to save loved ones, and protagonist has to orchestrate the construction of a huge dyson sphere scale computer / sensor array within that time.
      5. The mechanism needed for resurrection carries huge privacy risks. People with dark secrets they don't want to answer for, financial interests dependent on unbroken cryptography, etc. are constantly trying to thwart the project.

    The arrow of time is usually taken to be thermodynamic (or quantum information-theoretic, at bottom) in nature, so the Second Law (entropy is nondecreasing in a closed system) pretty much closes off reading information directly from the past.
