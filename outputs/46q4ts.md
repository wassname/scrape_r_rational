    > Decent, but I felt like it gave Harry too much power with the whole "no wands" trick. Didn't really buy it that a 14 year old can take down experienced Death Eaters.

    So -- abuse provides super powers? Kind of like being an orphan. Harry with the proportional strength and speed of an orphan and the proportional magic boost of abuse.

  >Shuddering with pent up emotion, Harry grit his teeth as new tears threatened to stream forth, and choked them down with a fierce, hot anger. Lurching to his feet, Harry wobbled dangerously for a moment, before snarling, a strange and chilling expression on his little six-year-old face, and stalking towards the school building with a purpose.

  The purple is palpable.

  >I will never cry again. He silently promised himself.

  No. "Strange and chilling." "Never cry again." "Silent promise." I mean, maybe he can think it. But that's just not happening.

    Yeah, it's extremely over-the-top, moreso as it goes on.  Eh.  I like it anyway, for some reason.

  The sequel was horrible. Its ending was very disappointing and abrupt.

    Yeah, the first was enjoyable in a non rational way. The second was pure garbage, but it did have an interesting idea about magic.

      I think I've heard that it was a crossover with something, but I don't recognize it.

  Wow.  It gets a LOT worse.  And the author is about as smug as I can imagine in their author's notes, particularly re: being self-satisfied about how much better their writing is than everyone else's.

    Yeah, but I thought it was interesting how the author put a lot of effort into making the harry behave like a person who was abused like that actually would.

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Yeah.  That's what got me hooked, at first.

  On the first chapter so far.  Writing is fairly clunky, but the sort of ... beautiful truth? ... behind it shines through.  Enjoying this a lot, thanks.

  >"THERE WILL BE!" Geroge Granger shouted, "SO MUCH SCIENCE!

  I need a spin off fic of this

- u/Roxolan:
  ```
  It's a shame the author can't write credible adults. I enjoyed the fic in the early chapters where Harry hogs the spotlight while being asocial. But then McGonagall crushes a wineglass in anger at a faculty meeting, Dumbledore is casually cruel, McGonagall explains Harry's life story in public without his consent, everything about Petunia, etc. etc. I see what the author is going for, and it could work. But they don't have the skill to do more than cartoonish stereotypes.
