    Magnitude tells you how much mana mage had when he was born/young, but the mana reserves grow with time and thats why Zach went from 50 to 250ish (reserves can grow anywhere from 3x to 5x, if I remember correctly) . So with the crown QI has 10x more mana than Zach.
    ```

    - u/Zorian42:
      ```
      >reserves can grow anywhere from 3x to 5x, if I remember correctly

      But that's just what they say today based on 'normal' people. Zorian also said that in his case this didn't work, because he worked really hard on his shaping skills (=lowering the mana cost of spells).

      So in case of 1000 years old lich we can expect him to have like 5x-7x mana growth just by practicing while also having some additional bonus from extreme shaping skills.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Magnitude just measures your mana reserves. Shaping skill allows you to go farther with that Mana, but it doesn't give you additional Mana capacity. Measuring Zorian's growth is hard only because he spent a lot of time getting better at the simple spell they use to measure Mana capacity, but his actual reserve haven't been changed by that. He can go a lot farther with that same Mana than a pre-loop Zorian would, but we have no reason to suspect that Zorian's Mana reserves have grown to abnormal levels, nor that there are easy methods of doing so.
        ```

        - u/Zorian42:
          ```
          > Shaping skill allows you to go farther with that Mana, but it doesn't give you additional Mana capacity.

          In the extreme case you manage to have shaping skills so good every single spell costs you half as much mana as for other people, you effectively doubled your mana reserves and regeneration. Yes, we don't know what the exact limit of this is, but if we estimate something like ~20-40 % cheaper spells due to good shaping, that would mean ~1.25-1.666 bigger reserves and mana regeneration.

          > Measuring Zorian's growth is hard only because he spent a lot of time getting better at the simple spell they use to measure Mana capacity

          You are correct with this, but while Zorian managed to master that one simple spell, he also practiced whole bunch of different shaping skills - if we estimate that he's currently in top 10 % mages considering dimensionalism skills, that would mean that he's able to cast any dimensionalism spell cheaper than 90 % of mages ...

          At this moment the only spell he mastered is the magic missile, his second most trained spell is probably teleportation. He hasn't trained all the other spells he knows that hard - he trained them by getting very impressive shaping skills in different magic fields.

          btw would magic missile be even cheaper if he learned it like a shaping exercise - without the use of his hands? There still is some difference between reflexive spells and unstructured magic (source https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2017/08/10/basics-of-magic-spellcasting/ ).
          ```

    - u/CaptainMcSmash:
      ```
      I feel suspicious of QI's admission though. Like why would you just tell your enemies you have 10x more mana? ZZ told him the truth of how the orb stores a functionally infinite amount of memories, so I have a suspicion that the crown also holds a functionally infinite amount of mana and QI just said 10x so they would underestimate him. He's probably been storing and building up mana for the past thousand years or for however long he's had the crown.
      ```

      - u/Tserri:
        ```
        He said it to intimidate them. And I have no doubt the crown can stock an infinite amount of mana, I think he just gave an estimation of how much mana he gathered up to now.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > I have no doubt the crown can stock an infinite amount of mana

          That would break everything we know about mana. It's like storing an infinite electric charge; not just "we don't know how to do that" but "so long, physics, and thanks for all the fish."
          ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > why would you just tell your enemies you have 10x more mana?

        Several reasons:

        - He agreed to exchange information so that he could learn more about the orb.
        - The crown is not an Achilles heel; he's still exceptionally capable and has abnormally large mana reserves without it.
        - It's useful to be able to say, "I clearly have the power to do anything to you I want, but I haven't done it, therefore you can relax and actually talk to me without looking over your shoulder the whole time."
        ```

      - u/aeschenkarnos:
        ```
        He may also have been spending it. I wonder if it's possible to compound mana (and gold) in this system? You can in some CRPGs: invest the mana (and gold) into building an artifact, disenchant it for more mana, or sell it for more gold.
        ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      At this point it's simply unlimited mana for combat purposes, as all the spells are designed for much lower magnitudes. It can only make difference in truly massive custom rituals, like maybe gate creation.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        It can make a difference in combat too. We know of one magic that costs ridiculous amounts of mana to cast: time magic. QI's massive mana reserves is probably what lets him haste himself in combat without needing to be in a black room.
        ```

        - u/coldinchitown:
          ```
          Zorian has hasted himself previously- it doesn't require a black room. The black room is what allows for more extreme temporal acceleration.
          ```

          - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
            ```
            Oh. When did this happen?

            (And if hasting yourself is that easy in terms of mana cost, why don't more mages do it? Or have a permanent haste effect on themselves?)
            ```

        - u/Zorian42:
          ```
          It's still possible that he knows some very good offensive spells but he hasn't shown them yet. What if he knows that pitch black beam the god touched hydra used, or some similary powerful yet expensive spell?
          ```

  - u/therealflinchy:
    ```
    when was it hinted that zach did it.. many many chapters ago?
    ```

  - u/Zorian42:
    ```
    I think they're quite confident in reaching Blantyrre now without help - they know how to 'easily' steal and operate the airship (now without damaging the core = at full speed); once they get there and find a Bakora gate, they don't need the airship anymore (they already have Bakora gate at Ziggurath and in Koth).

    Btw I don't think QI fully knows how to operate Bakora gates - he doesn't use the one under Cyoria. I think he just realized what does the icosahedron do (from studying his own blessing) and how to apply it to self-made gates.

    I can't find at the moment how exactly does the mana cost scale with the distance of teleport, but I suspect it's more than lineary (because 'mages chain teleports when going bigger distances' [ch. 65] and 'costs increase exposively with the volume being teleported [ch. 69])

    Or over here 'people chain teleports all the time instead of simply teleporting to the destination outright' [ http://mother-of-learning.wikia.com/wiki/Word_of_Domagoj ].

    So even if we estimate QI's mana reserves to be 16x bigger than Zach's 
    (both same base, both divine blessing, QI +10xbase from crown, let's guess QI +6xbase from practicing shaping and having bigger reserves by using magic for 20 times as long as Zach) and we guess (for the sake of this argument) that mana cost increases quadratically with distance, that means that QI can teleport 4 times further than Zach (4^2 = 16). 

    That doesn't really get him to Blantyrre (that should be far away). Although one of the biggest problem with teleporting is that you have to divine where you want to teleport - which is way easier if you've already been there. Maybe QI has some additional bonuses in this area :-D

    btw would QI pass ALL of the shaping exercises that Xvim would think of? (I specifically remember him being awed at Xvim deflecting one of his attacks with his hand :-D )

      Even with some huge range increases, there's no teleporting to Blantyrre. The maps show the island chains from Eldemar to Koth, and there if Zach can't skip most of those islands, then there is no way for anyone to teleport across the much larger distance to Blantyrre.

      > btw would QI pass ALL of the shaping exercises that Xvim would think of? (I specifically remember him being awed at Xvim deflecting one of his attacks with his hand :-D )

      That reaction could be surprise that someone else can do something so impressive, not necessarily that QI couldn't do the same thing.

      - u/jaghataikhan:

        Yeah, I got the vibe it was more of a "puny mortal just accomplished what took me 500+ years to accomplish" deal
        ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      Zach has a divine blessing? It'd make sense and account for his mana reserve. I can't remember this being mentioned, maybe it was?
      ```

      - u/LucidityWaver:
        ```
        He has an abnormally large mana reserve that is, iirc, equivalent.
        I'm not sure, but I don't think it was established why and how; whether it was a divine blessing or a result of the time loop process or something else.
        ```

      - u/ZeroNihilist:
        ```
        Does Zach remember when he acquired that blessing? I'd imagine that he might not, given that it could be subjective decades ago.

        But it would be interesting to know if he did actually win over an angel with a feat that was subsequently removed from his memory (or simply forgotten), and if Zorian might discover it upon Zach letting Zorian read his mind.
        ```

        - u/Banarok:
          ```
          he got memory whiped remember?, but what seems likly atm is that some divine entity (angels?) sent Zach through the gate to help deal with the release of the primordial, something they don't want to happen. but it's just speculation.
          ```

  - u/cidqueen:
    ```
    Knowledge of Blantyrre wasnt a guarantee the way doubling mana reserves was since Q alreafy relinquished that information. Much of the tension of thw encounter came from what each side didnt offer as questions like when Zorian didnt ask about Q's gate stabilization design.

        If QI learned that he's in a time loop, he would become a new level of dangerous. He would likely attack them immediately, to subdue and study them, and with his skill in necromancy he might even succeed.

      Honestly, I think the backers might be an angel. It was mentioned in this chapter that they can also place divine blessings on people, and the reason they wouldn't be able to communicate with Zach is because their realm is cut off from the Gate universe.

        One or two lessons in one specific area / several spells, then ask something different next restart. He has to know so many things! And they can trade the very same divine artifacts for those!

            Especially considering QI know about SO MANY different topics.

            Alanic knew about fire magic and soul magic (Zorian studied both at once)

            Xvim knew about shaping (with Xvim's methods it took Zorian years to exhaust all of it)

            In both cases once Zorian mastered it, they became suspicious.


            QI knows about:

            * soul magic
            * all kinds of combat magic, which can be studied independently
            * a lot of history stuff that could be helpful
            * dimensionalism magic
            * divine artifacts / blessings / gods intel
            * I do bet he has to have some really cool shaping exercises 


            Z&Z could spend 2-3 restarts on every one of those topics without QI becoming suspicious about them knowing too much ... just offer him some divine artifacts and information in return!
            ```

      - u/DerSaidin:
        ```
        This is one of few cases the time loop doesn't reduce risk so much.

        They know where to contact him (address on the card).

        This can definitely be left until outside the loop, or never.
        ```

        - u/I-want-pulao:
          ```
          It doesn't reduce risk, yes. But this possibility exists thanks to the time loop. I really doubt they can approach him outside the time loop at all.

            - u/I-want-pulao:
              ```
              Yeah but they won't have that much to tempt him with. That Divine artifact that they tested? They can trade it multiple times in the time loop. They can only trade it once outside, and it would be a terrible trade then.
              ```

              - u/mcgruntman:

        - u/Crazy_Demon:
          ```
          Then risk is the same but in the timeloop they can trade the same priceless artifacts (like the divine dagger) or secret magic over and over again for new gains from Qual.  Just imagine what Qual would be willing to trade to get the Orb!  That is definitely something that should be exploited.
          ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      I still think they would do it. Possibilities are quite significant if they manage it right.

- u/Crazy_Demon:
  ```
  So in chapter 62, we find out that Zach started as magnitude 25 and appeared to have it doubled without affecting his mana reserves.  In chapter 8, he says he maxed out at magnitude 232.  In this chapter, Quatach-Ichl basically said he followed the same path...so if he's being truthful about the crown's powers, he could have a magnitude of 2000+.

  2000+.  He's basically like a demi-god among men at this point.  It makes me wonder how much magic he has at his disposal that's simply too mana-exhaustive to be practical for others to cast.  He probably could cast the much vaunted "dragon magic" at this point.

  It does make me wonder if its a potential weakness though.  In chapter 26, Zach is able to knock the crown off Qual's head.  Does that mean Qual lost access to his stored mana?  He still would be magnitude 200+ ofc, but Zach has already shown to become exhausted during a battle, even with his doubled reserves.

  I also wonder if the crown would work if Qual absorbed it into his body like he did with the dagger.  I'm skeptical though, since if there would possible, it would be silly to risk leaving it on his head so that it could be knocked off like in Chapter 26.
  ```

  - u/Zorian42:
    ```
    One thing to note is that the crown works as a battery. 

    For a trained mage it takes around 30 minutes to replenish their mana reserves from 0 to 100 % [ https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/ ].

    So if we say that QI's mana reserves without the crown are the same as Zach's, that means that their mana replenishes at the same rate. 

    With the crown: QI needs ~5 hours to fill it, then he has 10 times more mana than Zach, but same replenishment rate.

    So Zach + Zorian + Alanic + Xvim using some mana-efficient defense while keeping QI trapped (anti-teleport + soul trap field) can still theoretically force QI to go out of mana.

    Even though some people suggest this after current chapter, we still haven't seen QI use any offensive spell so overpowered that Xvim/Alanic would have no defense against it. Might be still hidden up his sleeve, though.
    ```

    - u/akaltyn:
      ```
      > we still haven't seen QI use any offensive spell so overpowered that Xvim/Alanic would have no defense against it. 

      he's never particularly needed to before though. In all the past fighs we've seen in him during teh invasion he was fighting against pretty standard mundane enemies he could defeat easily. 

      He did the soul magic thing that started this all off very easily, and thats probably beyond every other soul mage we've encountered so far. If he can do something of that level as a spiteful whim he could do a lot more if he was actually feeling threatened.
      ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Remember how time magic works? Tons of mana is needed to accelerate something, and even then, to reduce the mana cost, you have to seal off the space you are accelerating in a Black room.

    Yet QI is able to cast time magic on himself, without any sealing, to speed himself up several times in combat. That probably costs insane amounts of mana, and now we know how he can fuel it.
    ```

    - u/Zorian42:
      ```
      IIRC speeding up by factor of 3-5 is normal, when you want more you have to seal off the space.

      Doesn't change the fact that it should be very expensive and he uses it several times during combat, though.
      ```

- u/loonyphoenix:

  The lich seemed totally unaware of the possibility of a time loop, despite being 1000 years old. Huh. I always suspected he at least knew about the sovereign gate system, though didn't expect one to be active (since it apparently hasn't been for a while and since this one was started one month ahead of schedule).

          Okay, so this is a bit of a stretch, I admit, but I think an even bigger stretch is that, as Zorian suspects, he got a functional copy of the marker broken in *just* the right way to get around its copy protection entirely by accident. It sounds as likely as when you flipped two random bits in a binary and got around copy protection in a game without meaning to, which I believe would be vanishingly unlikely.

          I envision the following scenario:

          1. Everything is as it appears, Zach brags, the lich responds thinking exactly what he is saying, and then starts the soul melding process.
          2. While he's doing that, he notices a weird marker. He examines it, finds lots of copy protection, intricate work not commonly seen. Then he remembers an old tale about the sovereign gate and time loops, remembers that the loop is supposed to start during planet alignment, which is exactly now, and puts the pieces together. "That would explain what the guy was saying even better. Can I get around this protection?" he wonders, and alters whatever he's doing to try to replicate the marker in Zorian whithout triggering the copy protection mechanisms. Being the best necromancer around, he succeeds. Zorian seems not harmed significantly.
          3. Then he decides to copy the marker into himself. But first he needs to make sure that if he does something wrong, he will have another chance. So he tries to modify Zach to become his loyal servant / stamps some notes into his soul and adds a mental compulsion to visit him next time he wakes up / does something else invasive to Zach's soul that trips the anti-tampering protection that triggers a new loop.

          Now, I'm not entirely convinced by this theory (this giant coincidence is the basis of the whole story and might be excused as selection bias -- we wouldn't even have a story if it hadn't happened), but it is narratively compelling as well -- seems like a neat twist. Though this latest chapter did lower my evaluation of the probability of this theory a lot.
          ```

          - u/jaghataikhan:
            ```
            I also feel like Zorian getting in by pure accident to be incredibly unlikely, but I feel like it's more due to divine meddling. There are some subtle hints so far (zach s doubled reserves, the artifacts, story about the founder of the Ikosian empire, the artifacts, zorian's presenxr, how zorian is almost the perfect complement to zach and fills out his weak spots, etc)

              But the looping world is disconnected from the divine planes. How would the angels or whatever even know that their intervention is required?

              - u/jaghataikhan:
                ```
                I don't think it's the angels. Instead, I think it's from even higher up, direct from the gods. True, they've gone silent for a few centuries... to the best humans can tell. What if they've been meddling more subtly behind the scenes?

                Even the loop isn't beyond the reach of the gods if it's true that it was created from a primordial as implied a few chapters ago
                ```

                  ```
                  to add to this it might be the god that originally creating the sovereign gate.  as far as z&z know (and they have look/asked/investigated) the gate hasn't been activated since the original emperor.  the gods are whimsical as we know but if something you created hasn't been touched (or you intentional made it difficult to use) in hundreds of years wouldnt you want to check on it an see whats happening.

                  i mean shit for the gods who have pulled away, this would be an epic movie that could/would completely alter the world.  id pay to watch that movie so its not too far to suggest that the gods would watch as well.  unless of course they are all dead, which is possible

                  i'm starting to wonder if red robe might not be an agent of the gate primordial, being turned into a gate is probably plenty horrible and freeing a brother that might have the power to break it out seems like a good plan.

                  however the priordial might have very limited power over itself after it's gateification, so it did what it could, it kept one person from getting wiped to make sure his brother is freed, something the angels having sent Zach is doing their best to prevent.

                  but it's just speculation, since i have no proof of the theory at all atm.

    To be honest I was half expecting him to be a previous looper.  Not due to any sort of rationality or hints dropped, it's just a semi-expected plot line.  Of course, that means that it's just that much less likely to be the case for this story.

        Spear of Resolve actually hadn't heard of it.  She found out because the Ghost Serpent (who, as a spirit, could be eons old) told her about it.

          I've reread Spear of Resolve's confession letter, and you're right, she specifically sought out Ghost Serpent to get that information, so she didn't just happen to know things.

          But in any case, the fact that an incredibly old being that does not seem particularly connected to the whole Sovereign Gate story knew about it supports the theory that it didn't use to be a really big secret in the past. Maybe another incredibly old being will know about it as well? (Granted, he's a sample size of 1.)

    He could still be aware of it. Just sees no reason to bring it up. He gains nothing by revealing knowledge to them. 

    If they are loopers then he can fight them and/or defend himself far more effectively if they don't know he knows. If they aren't then he also gains nothing by making them aware of the possibility. 

    We have no particular reason to believe he's being entirely honest, especially when he says that he doesn't know much about the special abilities of the crown. Which seems a bit implausible if he's a super powerful sorceror who has had it for centuries.

  There's still something about 'mana cores' we don't know about.

  -the Pearl of Aranhal 'boasts an experimental power core'

  -Silverlake's home is in area with weak ambient mana - too weak for her heavy wards + maintaining medium sized pocket dimension

  -Silverlake claims that 'the whole orb is potentially achievable through familiar mortal magic. Yes, even the power source thing.'

  The airship could potentially have crystallized mana engine - just more advanced than trains. Silverlake's home could run on souls - whatever. But I don't think either of the two mentioned things powers the orb. So what is the secret?

  So to summarize what we know about increasing your available mana:

  1) Using souls of others -to power magic items (Z&Z won't use) - either killed people or already 'prepared' souls (from soul-eating plants, or stealing from necromancers (from Sudomirs wards...)).

  2) Engines running on crystallized mana (too risky for combat, very easy for enemies to detonate once they know what they're dealing with).

  3) Some unknown power source (definitely used in orb, maybe in Silverlake's cottage?).

  ^ all those should give you unattuned mana - only for magic items (=items with preset spells)

  4) Divine blessing - enhancing your soul (icosahedron+soul magic around your soul which stabilizes it). Enhances both maximum mana and mana regeneration (by the same factor).

  5) Your own mana battery (which is recharged when you don't use mana and the stored mana is kept attuned). Enhances maximum mana, but doesn't change mana regeneration.

  ^ these two should give you mana to use as you please.
  ```

  - u/Tserri:
    ```
    Your point about Silverlake claiming that the orb is achievable through mortal magic makes me think that all of the artefact can be 'reproduced' -with more or less success. What is not reproduceable though is their 'hidden function', that only time looper can use. 

    Considering this, there is a high possibility that Silverlake created a similar object to the crown which would poser her pocket dimension. It would just work with ambient mana instead and maybe it can't be moved/requires extremely rare materials.
    ```

    - u/Zorian42:
      ```
      From what Silverlake said I think that all the artefacts WILL be reproduced - expect Z&Z&friends having their own, weaker crowns in a few restarts!

      tbh I think even the hidden function is reproducible, but considering that there is no living soul mage who can create such complex soul marker and then you need to bind the function to the marker ... 

      > Silverlake created a similar object to the crown which would power her pocket dimension. It would just work with ambient mana instead  

      The interesting thing about the crown is that the mana remains attained to the mage. Ambient mana is unattained by default, so it would just be a big mana core that would charge in mana-rich areas and then power the wards. It would still require Silverlake to move her home to mana rich areas once in a while ...
      ```

    - u/GodKiller999:
      ```
      No for something as complicated as the crown, just having a soul core producing ambient mana and a normal mana battery would do the job.
      ```

  - u/scalymonster:
    ```
    It's possible that the mana could be being drawn somehow from deep within the dungeon. If there was a way to get past the way the deep dungeon interferes with teleportation/dimensionalism spells (perhaps with a stabilization frame like the Bakora gates or the Ibaasan's gates) then the high ambient mana could easily be siphoned though a dimensional gate to power a pocket dimension, warding scheme or airship.

    There would be a risk of some magical creature coming along and destroying whatever used to stabilize the gate (if anything is needed) on the dungeon side, but that can be mitigated by having multiple gates for backup. The other risk would be the creature using the gate to attack you, but that could be reduced by making the gate very small - just big enough to suck mana through, but not big enough for anything to enter - or having other defenses against magical creatures.

He could've made a mana battery and then lie that the crown actually only doubles mana reserves.

  I also wonder if this exchange means that QI will immediately confront them during the invasion, disrupting any plan they might have for that time.

  looks like we have a solid lead on a new tier of magical fuckery. QI's blessing is made out of divine power, whatever that actually ends up being, which is impossible to detect except for very uncommonly experienced soul mages. this type of energy could pretty easily answer questions about how the bakora gate spirit works, as it seems to act like a spirit, but isn't detectable in any normal way. that gate opening ritual the aranea sorted out might be Zorian's lead into actually interacting with things made from divine power.
  ```

  - u/distrofijus:
    ```
    I've actually asked the author about divine magic in the comments of worldbuilding site (about magic types) and his answer about divine magic was:
    It is indeed not accessible for non-divine entities. Even the angels are basically drawing upon certain blessings and mechanisms left to to them by the gods rather than being innately capable of it themselves.

    No new tier magic. Maybe one can learn something from it, but no way to influence it. It is very unlikely that bakora gates are created with divine magic so don't think it will influence it a lot. 

    I also think that  2x multiplier is for massive mana pool people like QI or Zach and 2x rate is a massive simplification so it is easier to understand for people how this blessing works. All it does it stabilizes the mana. Chances are it would give larger boost for smaller mana pools (lets say 5x, more) since the smaller pools are easier to stabilize. There aren't that many people with divine blessings and the it's not like you can accurately measure mana pools anyway. It is all rough estimates.
    ```

    - u/Zorian42:
      ```
      >  2x multiplier is for massive mana pool people like QI or Zach (...)

      I actually thought about this in terms of the crown, too.

      From what we know, their current magnitudes (in terms of magic missiles) are:

      * QI: ~250
      * Zach: ~232 (can he cast invisible ones now?)
      * Zorian: ~35 (also before he could cast invisible ones)

      If QI says that the crown makes his reserves 10 times larger, that would mean the capacity of the crown would be ~2250 magic missiles (in terms of people who can cast missiles effectively).

      Fully trained mage in area with sufficient ambient mana can fully restore their mana in 30 minutes. So Zach or QI wearing crown can fully restore in 5 hours, while Zorian would need about 40 hours.
      ```

    - u/silver7017:
      ```
      think of it like material science, in which each sort of distinct magical energy is a material used to build something. mana is used to build common spells, and is also burnt to power them. sometimes physical materials are used (in spell formula) to support and stabilize things made of mana. primordials seems to be made of something distinct as well, as primordial essence is used to create some effects which the story suggests are not possibly with normal magic alone. souls are made of something different. It is only detectable using soul sight, and it clearly has different properties from mana - it doesn't seem to be usable to make any sort of spells, it can nourish spirits and magical creatures who consume it, it can produce mana, and it can be made functionally indestructible (this is assuming only one magical material is used to make souls, which might not be the case). divine power seems to be another distinct sort of building material. the frame around QI's soul is made from it, which means that it can apparently be made into something which can stabilize soul material. its other important quality is that it cannot be detected even through typical use of soul sight. this is the important quality which potentially reveals the mechanism for many things in this world which weren't yet explained: the perfect ability of divine artifacts to resist any sort of magical analysis, the perfect concealment of the bakora gate spirits. there may be more, but those come to mind mainly because they are both perfect concealment effects. it seems to me that an excellent reason for why these things cannot be detected is if they are created entirely from this divine power material. I am not suggesting that any mortals would be able to do much with divine power, but that the bakora gate ritual might be the key to developing an interface to detect and interact with existing divine constructs.

      also, bakora gates require some obscure means of contacting the gate spirit which is unknown to modern magic as well as a convenient means of mentally communicating with the spirit to receive and transmit the gate code. that is quite a high bar of personal ability and one which humans don't meet. plus they are extremely widespread, meaning that whoever built them probably was not a small, elite group but instead a population. if they weren't made by and for gods, I am not entirely sure what sort of horrifyingly powerful entities they were made for.
      ```

      - u/FishyBinder:
        ```
        What makes you think the gates weren't made by the gods for humans?  The proper method of using them was probably just lost at some point, and the spiders accidentally found a method that is close enough to the lost method to work.

      - u/distrofijus:
        ```
        You are looking at the wrong material science. For me the best analogue for mana would be science related to electrical networks (EN). Not sure  if you had any exposure.

        Souls are... well, mana sources. So in EN think of them as of generators/energy sources. 
        Mana shaping or magic formulas are the pathways to limit  the flow. A schema in EN. you think what you need to do and you start designing schema. At least I'd think author had some inspiration for electrical networks. Unstructured magic/mana shaping exercises allow you create such schemas on the fly. Some time ago (like 25-30 years), the domestic appliances like TVs came with their own EN schemas attached. If something was broken and you were knowledgeable enough, you could fix the item. 

        Mind magic - the best analogue would be networking/pcs. You find the node you are interested in, check the ports, perform some remote flaw exploiting technics and you are intruded on someone elses PC (mind) and you either steal stuff or just mess everything up (mind bomb). There are different OSes (aranea / whatever), so the approach for different species is a bit different. 

        For soul magic I cannot come up with exact analogue, but it's something like electromagnetism. The changes in electromagnetic field phases/whatever can generate electricity. You can see electromagnetic fields. The soul well is the huge electromagnet which tries to pulls various random electromagnetic entities (souls). If you can see magnetic fields, it is much easier to avoid impact. 

        Now the divine magic is something totally different. It's like metal making industry, where gods can build a factory and do some heavy metal working (like building metal pots, spoons, knives, whatever). The general public (or even the lesser forms) can put some use to it, can maybe break the stuff, but have no way to the metal furnaces to create something from metal. Angels that left are able to create something like blessing because it's like form created by gods, and they have access to furnace, so they can fill it with hot metal and know how to cool it, can produce something. 

        While someone can get some aspirations (like try to create knife from stone or whatever), the science for this is way beyond and there's no way to replicate the whole industry until you ascend from ant/critter to the god level and then you may start fiddling with industrial stuff. 

        Can you understand hardness of diamond without microscope, without knowledge of atomic structure, etc. I guess the similar limits apply understanding divine magic. 

        As for contacting gate spirits, the easily understood material networking technique is "port knock". If you want to connect to something on port you need D, first you need to contact port a, wait a second, contact port b, wait two second contact port c. Only if you follow the correct prior sequence, connection to port d will be accepted. No need for divine magic.

  One mystery is unraveled (the Zach 2x mana - divine blessing), but conspiracy/background story got even more complex. According to QI the angels are really stingy with divine blessings - the forces behind putting Zach into looping  (or opposing to it) are very heavyweight. I don't think it's a "compassion/compensation" due to loss from weeping from church/angels. 

  The whole interacting with QI avenu gives options of easily slipping "banish lich" trojan horse. Come to his location, ask him to trade knowledge. give him divine dagger, ask some questions, get some knowledge. give him another three items to choose from, all of them booby trapped - he might pick it up out of curiosity and they would easily gain a crown.

  I've got some pet theories I'd like to share as well. The current main problem for Zorian is how to get out of the loop. And the funny thing is the author already explained how this happened ages ago. It's... souls bond. The Zach and Zorian will bound their souls, with Zach being as anchor. They already got soul fragments and machine does not care much about souls. So as soon as they get full key unlocked, Zorian should be able to piggy back on Zach to the real world. There's plenty of literature to research (including massive library he found hidden but never read up in Knyazov Dveri on his search for soul mages. Looking how rational everything is and heavy foreshadowing from author I'll be really surprised is the anything else will pop up as means to escape loop for Zorian. This level of trickery  - huge approval from me. Nice done. 

  As for current invaders/QI  dilemma, there is actual solution for the problem as well. Let me elaborate on this a bit more. 
  The problem for Ulquaan Ibasa / necromancers is they live in very bad location. Nothern bare islands (cold/etc). Also the necromancers are not welcome due to well... undeads, etc. The solution Z&Z can come up with for the big shots of Ibasa - create a gate to Blantyrre (preferably the furthest away region) with QI and migrate everyone from there. Blantyrre is ruled by lizardman. Previous attempts to conquer it  failed spectacularly. By flying the ship to Blantyrre, getting portal open with Arachna in the closest side, then finding the furthest away portal and getting password from there - Zorian needs to open gate for QI in there and offer: I'll open the gate for you, you transfer your operational gate to blantyrre instead from Cyoria and conquer that continent. No one gives a damn (besides some local lizardmen). Win-win-win (besides huge loss for lizardmen, but who cares about them ;) )

    soul bonds are really bad though, as zorian says one of them will become a dominant partner (zach) while the other one becomes basically a copy of that parter.

    so with a soul bond we wound end up with 2 Zachs but one being psychic and one not, it's not a optimal solution to anything.

    if they get the key the could just both leave, as long as Zorian leave before Zach that is, since the gate won't stop operating while the operator is inside, and Zach is recognized as the operator.

  I've been wondering if there's any possible technique that could be used to circumvent Mind Blank. Because at this point it's pretty much a showstopper for Zorian's effectiveness against all of his current major opponents.

  Maybe if you can figure out where I mind should be (for example, by touching somebody) You could forcibly connect to their mind.
  ```

  - u/Nickoalas:
    ```
    I think Mind Blank can be taken out by a strong enough dispell. We know it works for mind shielding, and it is a spell like any other.

    In most situations dispelling mind blank wouldn't be your highest priority if you're close enough to touch them.

    Edit: I keep forgetting he has soul sight now, so at least people can't sneak up on him with mind blank.

    If he really needs to, I think a dispell should do the trick.
    ```

    - u/distrofijus:
      ```
      Mind blank is "disconnect". You cannot influence something/someone who is not connected. So nope, there are no ways to influence/dispel it. 
      There are obvious downsides to mind blank (harmful) - it has been explained already.
      ```

      - u/Nickoalas:
        ```
        Mind blank is a disconnect from 'the great web', which means there is nothing for mind magic to target. 
        A dispell is just regular ol magic. Mind blank won't protect you from being physically targeted by other magic.

        In the early chapters, in the classroom when they discuss dispelling, Ilsa says "Disruptor spells are the simplest form of dispelling, and virtually every spell can be disrupted if you put enough power into the disruptor, but sometimes disrupting the spell can have worse consequences than letting it run its course. This is especially true for higher-order spells, which almost always react explosively to disruption because of the vast amount of mana that goes into their casting"

        She also says shortly after when the students try to dispell the magically started fire
         "This is another weakness of disruptor spells. They break down mana constructs, but any fundamentally non-magical effects caused by the spell are unaffected..."

        I am curious to know if Mind Blank is one of the exceptions that falls under 'virtually all', but I still think it should be able to dispelled if it's a magically maintained effect.
        ```

        - u/nobody103:
          ```
          Mind blank can be dispelled. Being connected to the 'great web' is a natural state of a mind in MoL-verse, hence why getting separated is so harmful for them in long term. It's just that dispelling a mind blank cast by someone like Quatach-Ichl is easier said than done. Especially in the middle of a chaotic battle.

  For a millennia-old archmage QI kind of sounds like a laidback dude in his 20s, which broke my immersion a bit. His dialogue is almost indistinguishable from Zach's. Maybe he was deliberately affecting a Zach-like style to get a psychological edge, or something.
  ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    I agree. Subverting expectations by having QI be reasonable and charismatic was neat but the overtly casual manner was a little off putting. The millenian old lich rolling his eyes for example seemed...off.
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      I have to agree. Xvim has a very different way of talking to everyone else (enough about the easily discouraged... was a beautiful line! Sounds so Xvim like) And I was disappointed to read QI sound so casual. So it's not like the author can't do it. Or maybe he is trying to go for a more hip QI instead.

  They gave a divine artifact to a soul mage. I wonder if that dagger will still be in the orb next loop, and if not, there will be a very surprised lich with a mystery in his hands.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    - Even the Key pieces are reset by the loop.
    - Zorian has destructively disassembled the dagger in previous iterations to study it.
    ```

  - u/LucidityWaver:
    ```
    Hey, that's an interesting theory! If QI is 'attaching' the dagger to his soul in some way the loop decides to carry across, it could be an indicator to QI about the loop.
    I doubt, however, both that the loop 'reset' would work in a way that carries to dagger across for QI and that it would disappear from the orb if it did.
    ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      > If QI is 'attaching' the dagger to his soul in some way

      Now why on earth would he bind an unknown divine item to his soul?
      ```

      - u/LucidityWaver:
        ```
        That is indeed part of why I think it's unlikely. 
        Though it would be a great way to store and retrieve items he values and wants to ensure he keeps hold of more than his body. And he probably has more protections on his soul than any real place he could send such an item. Except the place his soul resides. Though teleporting an item directly to your soul sounds more dangerous than creating a well built and secure soul based storage interface...
        Words I'd never thought I'd type or say.
        ```

    - u/countless_argonauts:
      ```
      The loop indeed does not work that way.  It creates the entire world, including new people with new souls copied from the originals, runs it for a month. Then it destroys everything, killing everyone except the marked souls.

      So even if a QI instance does something permanent to his soul, the next instance will have a newly generated soul without the change.
      ```

- u/lostatnet:
  ```
  I love this chapter, especially as it highlights the impact of morality. 
   Zorian is dedicated towards saving Cyoria as a result of the sum of his actions.  This is exemplified by his hesitance towards using mind magic or soul magic on innocents.

  Contrasting this attitude with the Zorian that exists outside the time loop shows just how much he has changed.  I can imagine the previous Zorian arranging for himself to leave the country, with a minimal effort to try to get his brother Fortov to safety (so he can say that he tried).

  In regards to the incoming war, I'm interested in how Zorian will react when it starts.  Though it is unlikely that the story will cover it, it has repeatedly hinted that the current peace cannot last.  Zorian might not believe that war will come but his perceptive is skewed.  He has lived his whole life in the "eye of the storm", a peaceful intermission of the Splinter Wars, & the time loop has artificially extended this peace from Zorian's perceptive.
  ```

    > Contrasting this attitude with the Zorian that exists outside the time loop

    I wouldn't blame him. OOL Zorian isn't actually skilled enough to have any say in world events, running is pretty much the only option available to him.
    ```

    - u/crazyfoxdemon:
      ```
      Not to mention his lack of world experience made him...... more..... callous is a good word.
      ```

      - u/appropriate-username:
        ```
        I'd go more for "ignorant." It's not that he didn't or wouldn't care about what was going on around him, it's more that he was unaware of and uninvolved with the many plots.
        ```

- u/Tserri:
  ```
  So Zorian seems very interested in Divine Blessings. It appears that he won't be able to have one in the time loop but understanding them might be a key to understanding the isocahedron stabiliser. He just has to find people with divine blessing who would agree to share information. Alanic might be of good help to find them.

  Many things are being set up for this particular loop. Hopefully their intereaction with QI will be fruitful since they can't afford to contact him like that in each loop: he is unpredictable and might attack them instead if they're not careful. They might do like Red Robe and side with QI in some of the loops. I feel like it would be the smartest way to gain intel and skills. I doubt Zach would be okay with that but they can still end the loop before the attack anyway if it bothers him too much.
  ```

- u/feha92:
  ```
  Why were they talking about the divine blessing sounding familiar? I seem to have forgotten this point, and the only one I can think of with high capacity but doesnt suffer in shaping is zach, who I dont remember mentioning meeting any divine beings?
  ```

  - u/Zorian42:
    ```
    >Ha. Well, it's not just that," Zach said. "The fact I was able to keep up with the academy curriculum at all, even before the time loop, pretty much shuts down the theory I'm just lucky. I'm magnitude 50 in terms of mana reserves, but I can shape my mana as if I was magnitude 25 at most. That's too… convenient to be natural.

    source: chapter 62 ( https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/62/Mother-of-Learning )

    so it's not 'divine blessing sounding familiar', it's 'doubling mana reserves while keeping shaping potential' which is familiar.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Yup, thanks for the direct quote.
      ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Because that's exactly what Zach's situation is like. His mana reserves are abnormal AND he did not lose control of his mana proportionately. It explains his situation perfectly. Combined with Zach being the loop controller (the loop clearly being of divine origin) and the theory of Zach being some (unknowing) champion of divine forces looks very strong.
    ```

  - u/JiggyRobot:
    ```
    Zach hasn't met any divine beings (that we know of) but that is almost certainly what Zorian was thinking of. I'm leaning towards it being a blessing on one of Zach's ancestors that has since become a blood line.

- u/TheTheos:
  ```
  In the previous chapter I thought that Silverlake ratted them out - like it would make sense that 2 ageless beings have at the very least neutral standing between each other and do some communications. But now I think what if Alanic never quit being necromancer and is doing a goodie priest act to gain blessing and then to become a lich with higher mana reserve - just like his teacher QI.
  ```

- u/SnowGN:
  ```
  Seriously not a fan of how Q was written. He sounds and reads like a fellow teenager, even saying "oh come on" at one point.

  Nobody desperately needs an editor who can help him give characters distinct voices. This did not sound like an ancient entity, just a fellow ordinary human raised in modern times.
  ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    It can be retconed though that Q emulate contemporary young personality for undercover visits to outside world. Or just always. Q effectively transhuman and transhuman can not be predicted or explained by ordinary humans.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      He was fishing for info. Zorian *knew* he could expect deception. For QI to seem relatable and approachable is a sensible approach given his aims.

      Remember what QI's soul looked like? Completely calm and smooth. Dude has basically perfect self control. His behavior was exactly what he decided to make it for a meeting with two precocious teenagers.
      ```

    Perfect disguise really. If he's secretly interacting with the modern world he has to at least keep up appearances. I'm honestly surprised he couldn't also erase his accent completely.

  Quatorian's state of being:  

  Zorian didn't like to be ever vigilant, it's stressing him out. But, he's quite open to another heart to heart at further date. This, in part, was due to Zach expressing great interest for such occasion. His statement may suggest he was interested in the person himself, to Zorian's ire, especially since Zorian knew Zach's taste very well. But in the end, he kept things as they are, preventing himself jumping to conclusion. Thinking too much about possiblity of Quazach, he thought, will surely mess everything up.

    ```
    The author has commented several times that the series are divided into 3 arcs, all of which were *roughly* equal in length. As the lengths of the arcs have been 26 (I) and 28 (II), and the third arc is now up to 27 chapters, it should be drawing to a close soon. 

    Although I personally believe the third arc to run on a bit longer than stated, mostly because there is a good deal of major goals left to adress before the story can wind down to a satisfying conclusion.
