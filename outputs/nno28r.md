## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  The world is stuck in a very, very long time loop. Every 20.000 years, the world resets to slightly before 18.000 BC and human civilization has to start from scratch again.

  Each century during this period, one Immortal is born. These Immortals have low grade healing powers, they stop ageing around their early twenties, don't get sick and don't die of starvation or dehydration. They can still be killed in combat or die in an accident, but when they die they are reincarnated in the next cycle with their memories and skills intact.

  Each Immortal is born in the same year every cycle, so the first immortal is always born near the start of the cycle, the second one a century later and so on. The reincarnation process picks a body at random from the people born in this time window, without regards for gender, skin colour or any other physical traits. If nothing close enough to a human is born within that year, the immortal skips this cycle. 

  Immortals can sense other nearby immortals (within approximately 100m) and if they met in a previous life they also instinctively recognize each other, regardless of their current appearance.

  On their fiftieth birthday (approximately halfway between their birth and that of the next immortal), each immortal gets a vision that explains the specifics of the time loop and their abilities.

  You are the 197th Immortal, so you will always be born near the end of the cycle, having at most 300 years to live each time. You're being told all of this by the 193rd immortal (born in the fifteenth century). She tells you that the world is currently in the second cycle and that she suspects humanity went extinct in the first cycle before either of you were born. She doesn't know whether any other immortals are currently alive. What do you do?
  ```

    Trying to find some older immortals and get a lay of the internal politics is an important long term goal.

    The advantages you have are that you’re generally less likely to be killed than older immortals, and that you’ll probably be better acclimated to the present era than other immortals. For example, in this life you might be one of the few who have a good, intuitive understanding of modern technology. If the other immortal is correct about this being the second loop (I’m dubious, how does she know that but doesn’t know if any other immortals are alive?) then it’ll take things a while to settle down as farming gets invented earlier and earlier. 

    The later in the loop, the more divergent things get, so you should assume that each life you have is going to be completely unique. Thus, you should be trying to learn anything that you’ll want to have in the future. This should include things invented due to a fluke (penicillin?) and pieces of information that are relatively simple to remember but have potentially large effects (theorems and proofs, useful algorithms, philosophy, transistors, etc). Of course this should be focused on things that are likely to be useful in the modern era - hopefully you never have to introduce crop rotation or plumbing. 

    Also, learning survival skills and some crafts will definitely be beneficial eventually.

    At first I was disappointed that you wouldn’t get to influence human history that much, but the benefit is that you’re going to be able to spend many lives with modern luxuries and few without. A fun consequence of being so late is that the food will be wildly different each time due to crops being cultivated differently and cultures being different.

      It's possible that she met another immortal previously, but hasn't heard from them in many years. Which would explain why she doesn't know if they're alive or not. And if the immortal she met also has no memories of previous cycles (Or only has memories of one previous cycle) she can make a guess that this is at least the second time through. Though you're right that if this is the case she has no guarantee that there weren't more cycles before the previous one.

      It's also possible that she found out in that vision on her 50th birthday that this was the second cycle.

        That one, yes. The vision spells out in which cycle the world currently is, so you know how many cycles you skipped. I had it in the original draft of my comment, but I removed it in the process of cutting down the comment to a more reasonable length.

  You have a small block, about ten centimetres across, which can produce a force from nothing. The anomalous force acts on the block and causes it to move.  This violates conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. The amount of force it produces can be controlled by some simple automatable mechanism. There's no upper limit on how much force it can produce, but for practical purposes if you request too much force it will just break whatever you connect it to. The block itself is indestructible, but easily lost if you accidentally bounce it off into space.

  The main limitation is that there is only one, and will only ever be one.

  It can be used to generate power of course, but doing the obvious thing of connecting it directly to a turbine shaft won't get you all that much more than a conventional nuclear power plant. Good but not amazing.

  It can be used in spaceflight, but at very high risk of losing it forever.

  What's the best application for this thing?
  ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    Lift *very large* masses very slowly into low orbit. A slow trip to low orbit with it in the center of a huge and hard to lose structure is unlikely to lose it like other space travel would, and if you can get heavy stuff into orbit like that using conventional methods to go anywhere else is fairly easy. For anything further away it's only worth it once the mass you're moving is to large to move any other way, and even using it on an extremely low acceleration is worth it. Probably, it's main use would be terraforming, especially very slowly altering orbits of things that you cant use conventional rockets on *because the reaction mass is pulled back to them by gravity*.

    If you do want to generate power, rather than use it directly to spin something, pushing it *through* something like a planet or iron star to create heat repeatedly, then using geothermal power form that heat, is probably more efficient in the long term.
    ```

    - u/longbeast:
      ```
      I guess you could *very slowly* use this to get Venus spinning again and try to give it a day/night cycle alongside more conventional terraforming.

      Perhaps more realistic for people who don't want to wait that long, you could adjust Earth and Mars to have exactly 24 hour days, much to the relief of anybody who has to code anything using time standards.

      This is what I was thinking too. Putting stuff into space, specifically Earth orbit, is one of the most expensive things we do as a species. By lifting large masses up and then using them to build orbital infrastructure like skyhooks, space elevators, or similar, you could singlehandedly give humanity a foothold into the next age of civilization.

      If you just stick it on a lever connected to an axle to drive a generator you could probably get a few hundred gigawatts out of it before you run into limitations of material science. That's not a bad result, but it's hardly going to change the world either, and I suspect there are better ways to use it.

      Even if your goal is power generation, there's probably a smarter method of harnessing it.
      ```

      - u/plutonicHumanoid:
        ```
        Hm, I’ll assume that’s true. Does the mechanism controlling the force also control the direction of the force? Also, is the mechanism part of the cube or is it remote with a range? It’d be pretty hard to change the amount of force once it’s moving if it’s part of the cube, but not impossible.

        I wonder if this could be used to stop tsunamis or hurricanes.
        ```

        - u/longbeast:
          ```
          The force is always in one direction relative to the block. You can control the magnitude of the force, but if you want to steer it, you have to rotate the block by some other means. There's nothing stopping you from turning the block around however you choose to do so, but it won't do it by itself.

          Let's say that the interface for controlling the block is by applying a small voltage across part of it. You can glue a simple circuit with an antenna to the block to make a remote control if you like, but your interface device won't share the block's indestructible nature and can get crushed by impacts or by acceleration.

    This is kind of reckless^*, but could you use it to fix global warming? Push the Earth's orbit out until the extra distance from the sun cancels out the extra CO2 we've been pumping into the atmosphere. Set it on a large rock formation to brace against. Of the top of my head, I have no idea how much force this takes though.

    ^* Vast understatement
    ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      Any force is sufficient, it just takes forever with any kind of reasonable force. SpaceX's Starship has a thrust of 72 MN, if you had a million of those all pointing in the same direction it would accelerate the earth by about [1.2×10^-11 m/s^2](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281000000+*++72+MN%29+%2F+%28mass+of+earth%29+in+m%2Fs%5E2)

      With that much force it would take about [780.000 years](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.01+*+earth+orbital+velocity+%2F+%281000000+*++72+MN+%2F+%28mass+of+earth%29+in+m%2Fs%5E2%29) to change earth's orbital velocity by 1%^*.

      If you want to do it in a more reasonable time frame, you could use the force of 100 billion Starships to get it done in about 8 years, but then you'd have to find a rock formation that can withstand the force of a hundred billion Starships all pushing against whatever surface area one side of this cube has, which is probably not trivial.


      &nbsp;

      ^(^* I have no idea by how much you have to increase orbital velocity to decrease the amount of sunlight hitting the earth enough to counteract our current levels of carbon emissions, but single digit percent seems the right ballpark)

  What are the usual ways to munchkin matter creation/manipulation magic? I'm trying to do a reconstruction of the Schools of Magic trope by making them more predictable so I can commission some art to post on r/magicbuilding.

  Let's say mana is some kind of non-relativistic aether that is always measured to be at rest in vacuum, but is otherwise repelled by matter unless converted into more stable forms. 

  Give it three laws:

  1) **Mana cost is super-exponential in information density**. So e.g., cells are completely out of the equation, but perfectly arranged carbon nanotubes are fair game, paper/leather/resin all stop mana much better than metals do, no use trying to make computers more powerful than, say, finite-state machines, etc.

  The meaning of information density here is roughly in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. In particular, let's assume all kinds of matter can be described by at most 1 MB of text. Then, we can rank the mana cost of creating various kinds of matter by how easy it would be to compress such a description.

  2) **Mana cost is cubic in momentum-energy**, and **time to cast is linear with mana cost**. A building made of simple, inorganic compounds takes months to build. But manifesting 1 mole of carbon-12 takes one second. Furthermore, if you try to instantiate some complex object without the requisite mana cost, nothing will happen except wasting your mana (thus, build incrementally!)

  3) **Magic is atemporal**. That is, by 'magic' we mean transporting ourselves to a parallel universe where its effects have always existed. So throwing a fireball means teleporting into a universe where the only difference is that there's some hydrogen-oxygen mixture that's currently burning in front of you, rewriting everything else so that this is physically plausible. 

  Let's peg the specialised forms of mana into twelve different schools (codenamed with zodiac signs for now):

  1. **Aries**: the ability to convert mana into matter

  2. **Taurus**: the ability to "see" causal connections between pieces of matter; so less fortune-telling and more animal tracking

  3. **Gemini**: the ability to apply magic to mana itself; e.g., Gemini can use Taurus to predict how a given volume of mana will be used

  4. **Cancer**: the ability to create non-quantum light, i.e., everything that proceeds from Maxwell's equations, so for example, you can use the ultraviolet catastrophe to make light bombs

  5. **Leo**: the ability to define finite-state machines on matter; e.g., implement Maxwell's demon

  6. **Virgo**: the ability to wear mana as a metaphysical 'mecha suit' to enhance bodily abilities, e.g., speed, endurance, strength; somewhat similar to Glory Girl's force-field

  7. **Libra**: the ability to create ectoplasm that LARPs matter; think simulacra in MoL which do not have internal structure but otherwise act as if they do; this is also subject to Law #1 so making anything with a brain is prohibitively expensive

  8. **Scorpio**: the ability to transmute one kind of matter into another, following equivalent exchange-like rules

  9. **Sagittarius**: the ability to add deltas to a piece of matter's position and its derivatives

  10. **Capricorn**: the ability to change the mechanical properties of matter. See [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_materials_properties#Mechanical_properties).

  11. **Aquarius**: the ability to 'restore' matter to a previous set point

  12. **Pisces**: the abiliity to 'stop' or 'end' things; e.g., turn a volume of space to absolute zero

  As it stands, there's a lot of ways to munchkin these abilities already. So some of the limitations I decided to move over to worldbuilding, such as:

  * Each mage can only convert raw mana into one of the twelve types. Also, to affect matter you need to keep it in contact with the corresponding mana form so that mana shaping becomes an extremely important fundamental skill for mages.

  * Mages have paltry mana regeneration capabilities. Most mana is thus sourced from SCP-like entities which only carry specific forms, and as such *mana is dangerous to obtain and is really hard to come by*.

  * Magical tradition is young. Only 1 in 100 000 people are born with the potential to learn magic (though it can be taught given enough exposure), and so it took until the 1800s for there to be enough people to start a proper magical tradition. Since Law #3 means all magic is locally reality-warping, it's really hard to do science on it so there are various competing and mutually contradictory theories still.

  * Corollary of the previous bullet point: Want to do some megaproject? Tough luck: there are only ~77 000 mages in the world and normal people forget magic as soon as they look away from it.

  * There's an anti-munchkin league of powerful mages who are very much inclined to end your life if you become too powerful, and they employ the largest collection of Taurus mages. So secrecy and subterfuge is paramount if you want to end the world.

  ----

  Some possible munchkinries that I may or may not want to curtail:

  * recursive self-improvement
  * simulacra apocalypse
  * creating an armament of Little Boys
  * going Scrooge McDuck on the non-magical economy
  * piece of ground + magically-enhanced aerodynamics + relativistic speeds = kinetic bomb
  * using the reality adjustment clause to speed up technological progress, since e.g., creating nanotubes in vast quantities retroactively manifests factories that can plausibly deliver you such quantities 
  * expelling vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere to speed up global warming and force non-mages to fund your space elevator 
  * changing the viscosity of the hotspot under a supervolcano to bring about the next mass extinction event
  * a lens-based mosquito targeting system

  Anything else I should watch out for?

  EDIT: mass -> momentum-energy

        Oh wow, this completely slipped my mind. Strangelet hypothesis, huh.

        So the only physically plausible mechanism we know of producing strangelets is by scooping them up from the interiors of neutron stars right? If so, then making mana cost be cubic in __momentum-energy__ would fix this, right? Because otherwise there's a lot of potential energy stored in having a bunch of free strangelets running around.

        In fact, someone should try this in the story lol, thanks for suggesting it.
        ```

        - u/meikaikaku:
          ```
          I’m not sure that the momentum-energy thing would suffice to prevent their production. The inherent energy of strangelets isn’t that high. Strange quarks are largely the same as normal (up and down) quarks, just a bit more massive. In fact, a mass of strangelets would be dangerous precisely because it could be more stable (lower energy) than normal matter, making it thermodynamically favorable for the normal matter to convert to strange matter (and releasing energy in the process).

          However, if you want the strangelet bomb to not work, you can just have the surface tension of strangelets be low enough that they are not actually more stable than normal matter at the boundary. That surface tension is a physical constant that we haven’t been able to measure yet, so you could just say “turns out that the surface tension is low enough that strangelets just evaporate rather than converting normal matter”.
          ```

        - u/Valdrax:
          ```
          Why would your universe that has aether-based magic have antimatter or strangelets or even quarks at all?

          I feel like having the standard model in a universe without relativity is just a bizarre mismash, and I'm not fond of settings that real-world physics violating magic over real world physics that go beyond that which is observable without complex instrumentation.

          Then again, that's probably the part of me that gets mad when people try to combine game abstractions and real physics in minmax ways to do things like make a [peasant railgun](https://tabletopjoab.com/the-legend-of-the-peasant-railgun-in-dd-5e/).  It's the same sort of spirit of having two sets of rules and picking and choosing between them to your advantage.

          I hate to use the bandied about terms "verisimilitude" and "immersion" that really just translate to "I don't like this and want to make my preferences sound like the only conclusion an intellectual could make," but that sort of thing really takes me out of a story.
          ```

          - u/hxcloud99:
            ```
            Well, I was trying to make a plausibly consistent system by giving the different schools a common interface, which is matter.

            It’s not that physics is violated per se—hence the rule that magic is *atemporal*, or more specifically a system that exists outside of the universe—it’s just that it is constrained to stay on its own level, if you will. Notice how all forms of magic are functions of the form* Mana -> Matter (or Mana -> Mana) but never Matter -> Mana except in the way mages deplete the local concentrations thereof.

            I guess it all boils down to preference in the end because that peasant railgun idea sounds fucking awesome to me. I try to write stories where out-of-the-box thinking is rewarded, even if sometimes the Author has to choose what they find ‘outside’.

            (*): Libra and Cancer can be thought of as physical interfaces to abstract mana constructs, so that for example ectoplasm isn’t really there but the dents and scratches it makes are simulated to appear in reality anyway.

      Oh, because I'm trying to write urban fantasy lol and I feel like there's a lot of potential in magic + antimemes fiction.

      EDIT: I don't think there's actually a way to reconstruct urban fantasy in a satisfying way without having some sort of reality-bending element to be frank. Being able to hide the effects of magic from a large segment of the population for long periods of time is completely bonkers, and the standard solution of "let's just memory wipe everyone all the time" is: a) even more ethically dubious, and b) too prone to compounding errors to be reasonably plausible.

          ```
          Hmm, interesting. What would you consider to be elegant solutions to the Masquerade problem then?

          I'm thinking:

          * magic is imperceptible to non-mages (can't do this 'cause material effects)
          * magical power derives from secrecy (which means any Chaotic alignment mage can completely disassemble the entirety of magical society)
          * some government entity takes great pains to keep it secret (this goes against a natural incentive for arbitrary long periods of time; implausible)
          * you need a high IQ to understand magic (hilarious, but no)
          * "But the authorities won't believe me!" (lol maybe, until you show up in their office with 64 kilograms of uranium-235)
          * magical realism (but then it's not urban fantasy anymore :/)

          But admittedly I haven't read much of the genre to know any better, so...
          ```

          - u/plutonicHumanoid:
            ```
            How about magic requires secrecy in a more individual level? If you try to perform magic in front of a normie, it won’t work, and magical constructs are destroyed when seen by normies. That way, magical effects can only be used in normal society indirectly.

            There’s still the problem that someone could demonstrate that they can do impossible things, but now they literally can’t show them how. Not sure how to get around cameras though.

            The original idea just seems to have too many consequences. If I conjure a fireball, there’s no reason it shouldn’t overwrite my own brain to think I bought a flamethrower, because I did in this universe. Or if mages are exempt, there’s no reason that the cops wouldn’t be tracking me down for illegally buying a flame thrower. And the changes obviously have to backpropagate, which should make a bunch of unrelated things completely different in the present too.

              Hmm, not sure how to tell a story where people reenact [WARNING: Worm spoilers] >!Taylor's cafeteria scene!< all the time though. Although I could see the appeal of Copenhagen wavefunction collapse as a Masquerade-enabling phenomenon...

              > Or if mages are exempt, there’s no reason that the cops wouldn’t be tracking me down for illegally buying a flame thrower.

              Oh...yeah that...actually is a thing. So there's this one character who does some clearly illegal magic so he can get sent to a maximum-security prison where he'll be safe from assassins.

              > And the changes obviously have to backpropagate, which should make a bunch of unrelated things completely different in the present too.

              Yup, definitely! So that's another source of difficulty in advancing magical tradition because it's hard to compare what's physical from what's not if the physical keeps changing under one's feet. 

              My biggest concern is "how do I add magic to civilization without it blowing itself up to smithereens?" and my solutions to the usual genre conceits tend to be downstream of that. If anything, having local reality-warping is also a metatextual reconstruction of "why the hell do things keep happening to our characters?" which is an aspect of simulation-style fiction that I haven't seen addressed very much.

              Plus, I expect it to be a natural source of hilarity lol, although I realise that I'd have to work twice as hard then to make it fit r/rational's standards.

              EDIT: Oh yeah, mages are definitely exempt from the antimeme.

  You have a computer program which can create ’bots’ according to broad parameters you set and which will then do things on the internet/places which could practically be influenced from an internet-connected device.
  This is how it works:
  You have one main field, in which you can type up to three words in English (or your native language if you prefer, but only one actual language is usable for the program’s ui) plus up to one optional proper name. The words will be interpreted by the program in accordance with the usual grammar of English in the same way that fluent human speakers would go about interpreting it. This field is for setting the main, primary, purpose/personality of the bot. For example, you could write ‘Shakespeare enthusiast’ or ‘elderly automobile mechanic’ or ‘teenage creative writer’ and that will be the core part of the ’bot’s’ schtick around which the ‘bot’ will organize its behavior and to which it will integrate anything you put in the other fields. 
  There are three other, optional fields, in each of which you can up to five words to narrow down the bot’s personality/etc a bit. ‘Devout Catholic’, ‘speaks three languages’, ‘migrated from Argentina to Canada’, stuff like that. The bot will integrate the stuff in these fields into its behavior as appropriate but will still be using the thing in the main field as its primary motivating behavior. 

  Once you have filled out the main field and such of the optional fields as you choose, the bot will be created with a turing-test-passing persona and will go onto the internet and behave like a human with that persona might plausibly behave. It will make every effort to seem like a real human and avoid revealing that it is actually a computer program, and will be no more good, no more evil, and no more effective or less effective in its goals than a human is capable of being, and its only ability to interact with the world is through the medium of internet-connected devices. You, when creating it, can only influence it in the broad way described above, or by talking to it once it is created, or by deleting it. 

  The program can operate up to ten bots at one time. If you delete one and create another using an identical description, the new one will not be exactly the same as the old one; e.g. the Shakespeare enthusiast might be a 50 year old Scottish man the first time you make it, and a 15 year old Canadian woman the second time.

  **You are Isekai'ed onto a pristine world devoid of humans**. Nothing but nature around. You need to survive 10 years until you are sent back to the real world.  


  You wake up nude, unarmed, on a nice forest clearing in what appears to be Canadian-like woods. The weather is warm, no threats around.. yet.  


  The Gods of the Prompt grant you one tool: a **machete that is infinitely sharp and indestructible**. It will effortlessly cut through anything except your flesh. (well, not 100% effortlessly, there is slight resistance to make it easier to work with).   


  How do you use that tool and your wits to survive a decade?

    Does the shardblade machete not cut through my skin at all or does it function like a normal machete when it comes to me? 

    I any case, I don't know how much the machete is going to help you here, at least initially. It'll save you a lot of hard work, but it won't really let you do much you wouldn't be able to do without it. 

    Some ideas of the top of my head:

    - **Using it as a weapon.** Good as a last resort if you are being attacked by wild animals, but not that helpful in hunting anything that can run away faster than you can chase it.

    - **Digging out a cave for yourself as shelter.** Useful, but still quite a lot of work, the machete can presumably cut through rock without effort, but you'd still have to move all the mass out of the cave yourself. Probably a waste if you're trying to conserve your energy early on.  

    - **Creating smooth stone bricks.** Like the above, this is useful, but dragging bricks around is hard work and probably takes too much energy early on. 

    - **Crafting stone tools.** Anything like axes or knives is unnecessary because you have the machete. You can probably make some extra sharp stone arrowheads or spearheads, but without a reliable way to attach them to a spear or an arrowhead you are probably better off sticking to sharpened sticks. Your best bet here is probably making some thin throwing spears made entirely out of stone for hunting.

  You have the power to materialize an invisible sensor anywhere on the earth, which you can see and hear via (replacing your normal sight and hearing while doing so). You can place/relocate the sensor up to once every 5 seconds, and can place it either by specifying a location (such as “1 meter behind that wall” or “100 meters above the top of the Empire State Building”) or by specifying a person with either their name or a mental image of them (ambiguities in names produce the sensor next to a random person with that name). 

  EDIT: When placing the sensor at a specific location (rather than at a person), you need at least a rough idea of the target location. For example, the “above the Empire State Building” prompt would fail if you don’t actually have any idea of where the Empire State Building is, but having a map of NYC with the ESB marked on it would be enough to place the sensor above it, but not enough for a specific location like “inside the north-most elevator of the ESB”, though you could get to that before too long by looking around through the sensor. The only way that the sensor makes use of information you don’t already have is when using the “find a person” mode of placing it. /EDIT

  You are in a deathmatch with another person with this power (and you two are the only people with powers). Neither of you know who the other is as the beginning, but upon seeing the other person either with your own direct eyesight or through the sensor you will be able to identify them as your opponent by a colorful aura surrounding them (and vice versa them you). To prevent the game from taking thousands of years, both you and the other person live in Manhattan and cannot leave Manhattan for the duration of the game. How do you identify and then kill your opponent (with no regard to the consequences afterward, so no need to keep the killing secret) before they find and kill you?

    I make sure to always carry an umbrella when I go outside so that I can't be seen from above.  After that, I hire a bodyguard and don't worry about it.  The chances of bumping into them on the street randomly are very low.

    Instead, I use my powers for other things.  Options include:

    * Work as a private detective
    * Work with the police to help on investigations
    * Spy out the details of security systems for purposes of penetration testing
    * Spy on corporate executives to get inside information that allows for making money on stocks that are about to make major product releases, or fail (go short on those) etc

    EDIT:    I'll leave papers scattered around me at all times saying "I won't bug you, you don't bug me.  We've both got better opportunities with this power than to risk getting arrested for murder."

      > You are in a deathmatch with another person with this power

      I think you are severely underestimating the threat you face here. The sensor isn't just a remote scry, it's an omniscient information gathering tool. 

      If I were your nemesis, with just my first statement **"relocate sensor over the Identity Card belonging to the nearest person having the same power as myself"** would allow me to see your photograph portrait, your full name, your home address and date of birth.

      You think an umbrella is enough?
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Where are you getting an Identity Card from?  The OP said:  "[by]specifying a person with either their name or a mental image of them (ambiguities in names produce the sensor next to a random person with that name)."

        Regardless, that's why I've got a bodyguard.  Oh, extra thought:  I'll leave papers scattered around me at all times saying "I won't bug you, you don't bug me.  We've both got better opportunities with this power than to risk getting arrested for murder."  I'll edit that into my original post.

        EDIT:  Oh, wait.  You meant 'Identity Card' as in a driver's license.  Yeah, that's in my wallet and the scrying doesn't see through physical objects.  Also, nothing in the description implies that it can do omniscient locations like that.
        ```

          For the “let’s not bug each other” idea, I’d say that that doesn’t really answer the prompt. If a more concrete justification than “because that’s the game” is needed, then let’s say that the Dictator of the World arranged this for their amusement and will give you a cushy retirement if you survive the game (and might kill you both if you are boring and try not to play).
          ```

      - u/meikaikaku:
        ```
        The power doesn’t actually have omniscience itself. The only method that allows you to place it in a location you don’t already know is via the “find a person” modality. In the examples above, if you didn’t already know where the Empire State Building was, you couldn’t specify it as the location. 

        Similarly, “relocate sensor to the location of my lost phone” would fail, because the power can only find places you didn’t specify in the case of people (e.g., “relocate sensor to my friend Will Edderscmitz” would work, even if you don’t know where he is).
        ```

        - u/fish312:
          ```
          Hmm, guess you should be more specific on limitations of the sensor's own knowledge, as it stands it's rather ambiguous given your examples, since the existing prompt doesn't mention anything about it being limited to your own current knowledge.

    Scry my way around to get the launch codes and hack the relevant systems to launch a nuke at manhattan, then hide as far down as possible to make sure I survive a few milliseconds longer than my opponent.

    What? You said "No regard for the consequences".

    The safest way to make money I can think of would be the stock market and insider trading. Crypto is easy to trace, and I’m honestly just not sure how I could do bank fraud fully remotely without getting caught. The stock market steady form of income in the short term, especially as I’m figuring out how to use it effectively. Calling in bounties (like the location of FBI’s most wanted) would be enough cash for a few years, but would attract a lot of attention. The FBI would probably freak out if I called in more than 1, possibly if more than 1 was called in in a single year. Although being an ESPer for the government would be a solid way to have constant protection, but if my enemy did the same thing it could get really thorny.

    Putting that aside, I’d stay in my home 24/7, getting deliveries of necessities through a trusted proxy (so the enemy can’t use that as a way in). Ideally this would be an apartment that’s not visible from the street so the enemy can’t just methodically look at “the apartment behind that window” and find me. Even more ideally, it would be somewhere that doesn’t show up on public plans/maps, but I’m not sure how I would go about that. Possibly blackmailing some rich people. 

    Another strategy would be living somewhere more public but inherently better defended. Finding a way to live at [740 Park Avenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/740_Park_Avenue) without attracting attention would be good, it’s pretty secure and it wouldn’t attract additional attention to hire private security. The problem is I’d expect to be found pretty quickly, it’s a well known building and it’s somewhat of a logical option if you have lots of money and blackmail (which are trivial to get with the power). So I’m not sure it’s a good idea.

    I’d also purchase guns and trap/alarm my apartment, and possibly get the building to get better security. This way, even if I’m found by the enemy, I still have a chance of winning.

    In terms of tracking down my enemy, I’m not sure. Regular monitoring of Manhattan areas, a progressive sweep of all homes in the area (which would take at least 42 straight hours based on 750k households and 5 seconds to move the eye), checking the news for crimes likely committed by them or unusual stock activity. It’s interesting that it’s a symmetrical problem, I’m not sure how to break that symmetry. At least I’d find eaglejarl pretty quick - I wouldn’t be using purely birds eye views all the time, and an umbrella would stand out if it’s not raining.
