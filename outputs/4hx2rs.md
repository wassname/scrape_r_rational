## [Biweekly Challenge] Romance

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4fq36r/biweekly_challenge_cat_and_mouse/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Cat and Mouse". The winner was /u/ZeroNihilist with their story, [Trapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4fq36r/biweekly_challenge_cat_and_mouse/d2orgkj). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/ZeroNihilist! Because this is your fifth win, you're getting special five-time-winner flair, and you're entitled to pick the prompt for an upcoming challenge (just PM me).

##### This Time

This time the prompt will be "Romance", one of the most consistently irrational genres out there. This was originally going to be the prompt for Valentine's Day, but I then I forgot all about it until after the fact. Here "Romance" should be understood as a shorthand for "Romantic Relationships", since you're free to travel outside the traditional genre boundaries. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, May 18th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time we're going to do something a little bit different (because who doesn't like doing things different?). The challenge is this:

There exists magic which can create objects *ex nihilo*. Over time, this has led to a build up of garbage, as wizards create a set of chairs for a dinner party then never use them again, or discard their leftover magically-created food. A counterpart spell was created which vanishes unwanted things. Your story should involve the discovery, exploration, or exploitation of the Plane of Garbage some centuries later. (The nature of magic and specifics of the plane are left as an exercise to the reader; remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.)

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 5/18.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4hybac/challenge_companion_romance/).

  Not rational at all, per se, but I shall post it purely for Megumi's mature, level headed approach to speaking with Erina about her unrequited crush. Downvote at your leisure!

  A bit of background: This is a future scene in a fanfiction I have started to write. I haven't gotten very far into it yet, and I'm trying to avoid too many spoilers, so the characters are only identified by pronouns here. Two of the main themes of the story are alienation and relationships, and so I thought I'd cut a slice of two of the main character's future as I see it and put it down as an example of how I see them acting.
