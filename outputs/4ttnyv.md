  An interesting revelation, it will be useful at the end, but for now, how much does it really help Zach and Zorian? They still have the same basic intractable problem of escaping the loop. I'm glad we got to see more Xvim, though, that guy is great. Also Zach spending a bunch of loops trying to date all the classmates, that's really amazing. Zorian would never be so inefficient. I guess for most of the time Zach wasn't really feeling like he had crosshairs on him but it still seems very... Zach.

    > how much does it really help Zach and Zorian?

    A lot!

    Remember, RR doesn't know Zorian's identity - but they now know his. If the marker remains on their souls when they leave (which it might, since the Guardian explained that there is already a mechanism to designate an old marker as non-functional), then Zorian might even be able to find him with the marker tracking ritual. Then Zach can beat him senseless, and/or Zorian can loot his mind of everything he knows about the loop and the invasion.

    Ideally, Veyers wouldn't even suspect that they're coming for him in the real world. However, he hated Zach's guts to begin with, and we know he holds grudges, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if his first action in the real world is to ambush Zach.

    They can also check out in the in-loop Veyers to determine his status. Did his Controller soul get swapped with his template, turning him into a regular loop denizen (probably)? Does he start each loop soulless? Or something else? Is it even, perhaps, possible for them to persuade the Guardian that he has menaced his template and should be switched back (admittedly a long shot)?

    And this is clear proof that Zach's memories have been altered. Maybe that will persuade him to let Zorian into his mind. We know that RR was very much a novice of mind magic; what if Zorian can find traces of Zach's old memories? Like whatever loop instructions he was given, so they know how to use their Controller powers? And the reason the loop was started, and why it was started early?

        What do you mean? Controller!Veyers has left. What's in the loop now is probably either Original!Veyers, who *can't* leave (no marker - the Gate wouldn't even react to him), or a soulless husk.
        ```

          ```
          Well, if the loop has been recreating him with the back-up soul each loop, then presumably they could use whatever method Red Robes originally used to gain the marker. If Marker2!Red Robes then tried to exit the loop, there is no telling what the system would do.

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    The only reason I feel like he might be is because of the all the build-up for Damien. Boranova fits the bill right now, but it feels like Damien has a role to fill.

    Then again, if Damien was revealed to be RR before this, we'd probably be arguing he was too obvious a choice and questioning why this Boranova guy had a single mention and then never came up again!

      The problem with Damien is there is no real connection with Zach.

      My main thought when we got to the chapter about the door was that Chekov's brother was written in so we'd have someone to talk to when we had to chase down the different parts of the key, after all that seems like a situation where it'd be handy to have magic Indiana Jones along.

  >Zorian was tempted to bring Zach to Silverlake after this, just to show him the true meaning of annoying. At least Alanic and Xvim were each helpful in their own way in addition to being hard to deal with. He wondered if Zach was good enough to deal with the grey hunter… he probably could kill the beast, but could he do it in a way that keeps the eggs intact?

  I think /u/nobody103 is just trying to get people to stop asking if Zorian had thought of that yet.

  I love Xvim so much.

  >"I did experience a few unexpected restarts while sleeping, but I'm pretty sure those were due to assassinations."

  I wanted Zorian to respond with "Yeah, that's always annoying."

  Veyers Boranova all but confirmed as RR, that was possibly one of the most difficult tasks if they didn't get lucky.

  [Called it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3eju9z/mother_of_learning_chapter_39_suspicious/ctjvwis)

  I didn't catch it on my first read, but on my second read-through (which was about a couple days after my first), it seemed very suspicious that a fellow student who was a massive jerk was mentioned but then never showed up again.

  Zorian's search for another time traveler (mostly among other students) specifically excluded him by accident, and he

  > He was pleasantly surprised that one particular asshole wouldn't be joining them this year – apparently Veyers Boranova lost his temper on his disciplinary hearing and got himself expelled from the academy. He wouldn't be missed. Honestly, that boy was a menace and it was a disgrace they hadn't expelled him sooner. Fortunately, it seemed there were some things that just couldn't be overlooked, even if you were an heir of Noble House Boranova.

  Veyer's reaction during his disciplinary hearing reminded me a great deal of Zach's numerous spats with his asshole caretaker, and  the third time-traveler obviously couldn't hiding in plain sight (Zach and Zorian experienced first hand that they would go crazy or detected doing that.)

  Evidence:

  1) The time traveler is almost certainly someone who would have been near Zach during the original summer solstice, when the spell was originally cast. This could be a fellow student, teacher, or diplomat at the party.

  2) Zach and Zorian have demonstrated that it's nearly impossible to do the same thing over and over again. They certainly couldn't/wouldn't do so without showing their increasing skills. 

  3)If Red Robe was present at the school, he would have noticed Zorian becoming better, and eliminated him. So he can't be someone who is present during the story.

  4) Zach starts most loops by kicking Tesen's ass. Zorian started hating Kirielle for her annoying actions at the beginning of the loop, before he got to know her better. This sounds awfully familiar to Veyers losing his temper, although this could have happened before the loop.

  5) Veyers is a briefly mentioned character, at the very beginning of the story, who never appears again. The author doesn't put in unnecessary details very often--he was mentioned for a reason.

  6) He's mentioned as decidedly unpleasant character, although early Zorian was sometimes an unreliable narrator.

  7) He's a member of a noble house, which we have just learned in the last two chapters (actually further back), may have reason to hate Cyoria, which has shifted power from Nobles to first-generation mages.

  I expected this reveal to happen when Zach and Zorian finally compared notes (as we've known Zach's memories have been messed with for quite a while), or more recently, when Boranova suddenly showed up to school (if he's a copy, and he left the loop, IIRC, that means he and his original soul switched places.)

  Damien has always seemed like a red herring to me. He's too far away for Zach to reach him early, he's a blatantly obvious suspect, and Zorian was originally extremely biased against his family.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > Boranova suddenly showed up to school

    Nah, not this. He was expelled before the loop starts, his original self still won't turn up.

    But they should certainly go to his home and investigate.

      >He was pleasantly surprised that one particular asshole wouldn't be joining them this year – apparently Veyers Boranova lost his temper on his disciplinary hearing and got himself expelled from the academy.

      The way it's worded, we don't know exactly when the disciplinary hearing happened. I took it to mean the hearing happened during the last month...during the time loop.

      >"I am Ilsa Zileti, from Cyoria's Royal Academy of Magical Arts. I'm here to discuss the results of your certification."Color drained from Zorian's face. They sent an actual mage to talk to him!? What did he do to warrant this!? Mother was going to skin him alive! "You aren't in trouble, Mister Kazinski," she said, smiling in amusement. **"The Academy has a habit of sending a representative to third year students to discuss various matters of interest. I confess I should have visited you sooner, but I have been a tad busy this year. You have my apologies."**

      Zorian was visited at the beginning of the time loop by a representative of the mage academy, who said they send representatives to discuss "various matters of interest." This easily could have happened to Veyers, with a result more similar to what Zorian apparently expected.

      It's possibly it happened during the last school year, but that brings up the big problem of how he was able to join the loop with Zach early on. They've both been in the time loop for decades now. I suppose it could have happened when Zach initially tried to convince everyone of the time loops existence, but he would have to track down Boranova to wherever he lives.

      It would be much easier if he was simply attended the school to start with, because he kept his temper during his hearing.

        >He got expelled from the academy before the time loop began, but he had technically been our classmate, so I thought…

        From this newest chapter. It's possible that Zorian is wrong about when he got expelled, but I think he is probably correct.  It doesn't make sense for a decision like that to be made too close to the start of the school term.

        Damn, this feels almost like too easy a reveal for RR.  Though it still doesn't explain how he would have ended up with a marker that didn't expire and let him leave the loop.  I guess I can bury any Daimen as RR theories I had, which is good, because it never made much sense for him to support the invasion.  I could probably still suspect Daimen of activating the Sovereign's Gate by fiddling around with the Key(s).

          See, I agree with you that it sounds like a much too easy reveal for Red Robe's identity, even if Voldemort does sound like an asshole. That's why I don't think that it will be him. However, I do believe that he's related somehow. I think that RR may be one of his acquaintances, or an acquaintance of his family. I think that his role will be to become a key in finding RR's real identity, and that Zach was made to forget so that he wouldn't be able to set on this path in the first place.

          Touche. Although, that's probably just based on the info he got in chapter two from Benisek. It's not like he's though about Veyer's since then. 

          I suspect we'll find out in the next chapter.

        Ilsa had visited Zorian early in the morning on the 1st day of the loop. The latest day the disciplinary hearing could have been held is the day before that, and that's out of the loop's boundary.

        - u/SpeculativeFiction:
          ```
          If she's the only representative, yes. I suppose Veyer's might have had to come in to the college to have a disciplinary hearing, but either way it's cutting it close.
          ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > we don't know exactly when the disciplinary hearing happened

        Not exactly, no, but Zorian learned about it from Benisek on day two of the loop. Even if we assume that the hearing was on day one (and how could Veyers get himself into an academy disciplinary hearing before he's back at the academy? Causing trouble over the summer would be a police matter, not academy), that's probably not long enough for the formal process of expelling someone. It just doesn't fit at all. I'm pretty sure that the whole disciplinary process was months earlier.

        Besides, RR has been looping for years/decades at this point, and he's shown himself to be abrasive and arrogant. He's really going to sit around for a school disciplinary hearing? No way.
        ```

    It was mentioned several chapters ago, in the one where he actually manages to learn invisible magic missile, that it's so damn efficient he can't really measure his mana reserve by magic missile count. He can possibly outcast Zach in terms of magic missile

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > he can't really measure his mana reserve by magic missile count

      That's my point; if his efficiency has now peaked, then maybe he can start tracking magic missile again. He still won't know exactly how he's tracking compared to his pre-training base, but he'll be able to observe the future trend, at least.
      ```

      - u/Cheese_Ninja:
        ```
        I don't think nobody103 wants us too reliant on thinking in terms of reserves, but I don't see why Zorian couldn't use it as a benchmark.

        I'd say a perfected magic missile is either half-cost or slightly lower.  Zach's aren't quite perfect, but they are very good, since he's probably cast the spell at least 50,000 times.  

        Zach can cast 232 in a row, I'd expect Zorian's eventual max to be around 64-70, which doesn't sound that impressive, but if you consider that he initially thought his max casts would be 32, is pretty good.

        I'm still hoping Zorian can fuse his loop soul to his real soul to double his max mana capacity and strengthen his mind magic abilities.  But I'm not sure it works that way, and he'd probably have to logic trick the Guardian of the Threshold to even attempt it. Nobody103 has said a few times that soul splices can cause insanity, but he's always talking about mixing different souls instead of two the same.

          - u/Cheese_Ninja:
            ```
            I completely forgot about that girl.

            She could she just be a normal school friend of Neolu's that transferred into their class once Zach interfered.  Even in chapter 7 after 7 months in the loop Zorian didn't know who she was, so she shouldn't have been an usual classmate, but in chapter 6:
            >Like he suspected, the two girls Zach hung out with during Zorian’s original month were nothing special without the Noveda heir there to help them out and hang out with them (and asking people about them led to some pretty annoying rumors being spread around; honestly, can’t a guy ask about a girl without everyone assuming he’s got a romantic interest in her?)

            So apparently that girl was still around in Zorian's loops 2-7, but he never actually learned her name?

            It's possible that we're underestimating just how little Zorian interacted with others due to his unchecked empathy and general assholeness at the beginning of the story, but that doesn't explain why Akoja wouldn't know the girl's name either.
            ```

            - u/Xtraordinaire:
              ```
              As a class representative Akoja had to know every transferred student and all that, but she did not. Overall this is a bit muddy. I took it as Zorian asking mainly about Neolu and failing to ask meaningful questions about 2nd girl. What would he ask? "Hey, do you know this girl that kind of was hanging with Zach a several time loops ago?" Yeah, fat chance. 

              As a confirmation we have chapter 7:
              > "Ah," said Zorian. He supposed that he knew now why Zach involved Neolu so much the first time he went through this month. **He still didn't know who the other girl was**, though, and didn't know how he might work her into the conversation.
              ```

              - u/Cheese_Ninja:
                ```
                Actually, now that I look again, I don't think that girl was in their class, I think Zach, Neolu, and that girl were hanging out together outside of class.  Akoja mentions how Neolu finished her test in a half hour, but she never mentions the other girl's, just that "The point is the three of them do nothing but waste time together and antagonize the teachers and get perfect scores anyway. They even refused the chance to get transferred to 1st tier groups"

    > now it's too late for them to do anything about it...

    I disagree. They can check the status of the in-loop Veyers, which may give them clues about what he persuaded the Guardian to do to let him out. They can also go after him immediately when they return to the real world; we know Zach can take him in a one-on-one fight, and even Zorian should be able to trounce him unless he gets a Mind Blank up.

    Identifying Red Robe was Zorian's priority #3 goal, listed in chapter 55. Priority #1 was determining how long they have left, which is done, leaving only #2: getting out.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      They can also give the mark to the Veyers left behind and have him overwrite red robes soul by leaving again
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > give the mark to the Veyers left behind

        Er...not to put too fine a point on it, but this sounds to me like a terrible idea. Even assuming that they could find a way to mark others reliably, which actually seems unlikely to me. Zorian was marked by an extremely dangerous lucky accident, and RR probably used something equally risky (because after all, if it hadn't worked, his soul would have been reset anyway). I think that placing some lesser markers on helpful individuals and eventually getting themselves out will be the most they can manage.

        If there was any possibility of Veyers cooperating, then this might not be a totally crazy idea. But as it stands, I reckon he's just bad news, and shouldn't be touched with a ten-foot pole (although Controller!Veyers in the real world is a different story. Whack him around with a pole all you please, he'll doubtless be trying to kill you first).

          Sounds like a great idea to me. Eliminate your only real world threat especially since they can use memory manipulation to turn Veyers into their slave

            This is exactly why he would have used anything that might possibly have a chance of working. Risks wouldn't matter when your soul will otherwise be reset at the end of the month.

    > f course, now it's too late for them to do anything about it...

    I mean. Not really.

    Remember, according to Ghost Snake, the Loop exits into the normal timeline basically 1 attosecond or similarly small timeframe after it begins. Even if Red Robe exited, he has literally 0 perceivable time to act before the loop ends for real and Zorian/Zach exit (assuming they find a way to do so).

    They can exit at the same time, with a perfectly prepared plan of attack, which they have literal years to plan out contingencies for, and which Red Robe necessarily will be completely unprepared for, as he will assume that they ceased to exist.

    At this point, Red Robe took the easy exit, but because that gambit didn't work, Zach/Zorian have a monumental advantage. The only winning move for Red Robe is if they fail to find the Key before the loop runs out of energy.

    It could still be a red herring of some sort.

    Also, you missed a chance to link to a relevant Eminem video.

    I'm surprised he has such a clichéd appearance and Zorian didn't get to suspect him. Sounds like a Red ~~Robe~~ herring.
    ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    It's almost a surprise he wasn't a suspect earlier, when Zorian was wondering about the rest of his classmates.  A guy who hates everyone, is hated back, and gets expelled from the academy.  If being a classmate warrants minor suspicion, that list of traits warrants alarm bells.
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:

      But if he was expelled, why would he be around to find anything out?  I can see how it wouldn't come to mind until he confirmed just how far abroad Zach went with the story.

        I can easily see Zach thinking "I guess I've tried convincing all my classmates. Well, not *all* of them..."

      He was, by virtue of being mentioned.

      He was a suspect but people dismissed him because sometimes a jerk is just a jerk.

  [^^I ^^told ^^you ^^so!](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4726w4/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_49_substitution/d0ajt0h?context=3)

  Ahem. This chapter hinted at something far more interesting than Red Robe revelation, and apparently everyone missed that.

  The running theory was that Red Robe mindwiped Zach about the specifics of the time loop (its purpose, who created it, why Zach was choosen, how to control it) after copying Zach's Marker onto himself. And yet...

  Zach remembers running around in panic, trying to convince everyone he knows that he is stuck in a crazy time loop. Supposedly this is where Boranova got him.

  Except why would Zach run around, if he knows what the loop is about? Either he originally had other reasons for approaching Veyers Boranova, independent of asking his help with the invasion, or Red Robe was not the first who scrambled Zach's memory originally. Or did Veyers mindwiped Zach so thoroughly he completely forgot about his first restarts, and repeated them, so that what Zach remembers is his *second* round of first restarts, and the rest of his problems with memory were caused by Quatach-Ichl's spell alone?

  Or was there even anything *to* scramble? If not, what created the loop, and why?

  ^^Something ^^something ^^Daimen?

    That doesn't mean anything since Zach's entire early memories are suspect. We know he was worked over quite thoroughly by a mind mage and I doubt Veyers only had Zach's memory of himself removed. All Zach has is some ambiguous recollection that was probably left to keep him distracted and might even be false entirely.
    ```

- u/Shiraigami:
  ```
  I really wanna know about Zorians mysterious past where he knows how to picks locks and eventually makes a magic version of lock picking, not to mention he has no qualms about stealing from the "bad guys". I am for some reason under the impression that these previous time loop interesting bits somehow involved his grandmother and would love it if we met her at some point.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Every mentioned Noble House in this story has some secret trick or magical specialization. It would make sense that there is a House that specializes in soul magic. It's just Zach's luck that when he took the loop as an opportunity to befriend his worst enemy, the enemy happens to be a scion of a soul magic Noble House.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > It's just Zach's luck

    And his quest to befriend everyone he could find. And the fact that there is probably a correlation between "person who hates everyone" and "person willing to perform forbidden and dangerous magics on other people's souls for personal gain".
