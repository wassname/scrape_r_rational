## [D] Worth the Candle seems to be gone

### Post:

# EDIT: see response [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8cppyk/d_worth_the_candle_seems_to_be_gone/dxgv09w/) (tl;dr patreon links needed to be removed)

I get a generic "Sorry, you don't have permission to access the page you were trying to reach." whenever I try to access Worth the Candle.

Anyone know what's going on? /u/alexanderwales ?

  Edit: The story appears to have been restored.

  Not to worry (much), just bureaucratic stuff that's mostly my fault. Here's the e-mail I got 11 days ago, which was auto-filed to a folder that I don't check.

  > The AO3 Policy & Abuse committee has received a complaint regarding your work "Worth the Candle", stating that it violates the AO3 “no commerce” rule. 

  > Section IV.B. of our Terms of Service states that “promotion of commercial products or activities is not allowed”. Additionally, our ToS FAQ explains: “We want the Archive to remain a non-commercial space. That means that it isn’t the right place for offering merchandise, even fan-related merchandise. Linking to your personal page (not, for example, an Amazon author page) is fine, even if the personal page includes some items for sale, but the Archive is not advertising space."

  > Linking to a personal website or blog/social network where you are taking donations, posting commissions or mentioning published works is permitted, but advertising it directly on the Archive is not, nor is using language which one might interpret as requesting financial contributions. For example, you can say something to the effect of “check out my Tumblr if you want to know more about me and my writing” and include the link to the site, but you cannot specifically state anything about donations, commissions or sales on the Archive.

  > As such, we require you to edit out all the offending content from your account within 7 days. This includes anything that might be in any other works and in your profile. If you fail to delete the offending material by the date given, we’ll hide this work and any other violating works so they are only visible to you. If the works are not edited within a week of being hidden, an Archive administrator will delete this work and any other violating works.

  > When you created your account, you agreed to comply with our Terms of Service, including our “no commerce” policy. A formal warning has now been placed on your account; failure to comply with the terms of this letter, or further violations of the ToS, may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account. You may consult our Terms of Service FAQ for more information regarding warnings and suspensions: archiveofourown.org/tos_faq#content_faq.

  I didn't actually read the ToS, and I'm not really involved with the Ao3 community, so my first warning of this was the story being hidden by the admins. I've removed links to Patreon from the story (in the summary, and in the most recent chapter), and responded to the e-mail that had languished in the folder; we'll see what kind of turnaround time there is.

  I'll choose to believe that the anonymous report was from a Good Samaritan who wanted to ensure that Ao3 is able to achieve its objectives, rather than just someone who hated the story (or me personally) and was being vindictive.

  (Worst case scenario, I'll have to change hosting to my own website, which would be an utter pain in the ass that would eat up writing time.)

  In the meantime, if you'd still like to read the story, this will have to do for now:

  [HTML](http://www.alexanderwales.com/WorththeCandle.html)  
  [PDF](http://www.alexanderwales.com/WorththeCandle.pdf)  
  [EPUB](http://www.alexanderwales.com/WorththeCandle.epub)  
  [MOBI](http://www.alexanderwales.com/WorththeCandle.mobi)  

  These will not stay current, and will probably be taken down once the story is back up.

    It is reasonably likely that out of the entire Ao3 readership, someone bothered to set up a bot to listen for Patreon mentions.

    Glad it's just bureaucratic silliness. My day gets significantly happier every time I see a new WtC chapter. This is the story that pushed HPMOR out of my top 3 web serials!

    hahahahahaha I didn't realize you were the author of Worth the Candle.  I've been reading it but not by being linked to from reddit I guess, and your Ao3 username is different.

    I really enjoyed your Metropolitan Man and Last Christmas, and finding out you wrote Worth the Candle is really funny to me, it's like finding out that CS Lewis was a pseudonym of Tolkien for example instead of a different guy.

    Not that I'm comparing you to those guys because, well, hey.  But still.  I'm quite tickled now.

      It was actually a secret here too for a while. If you go back through the chapter posts on the subreddit you can find the one where Wales revealed his secret identity and blew our collective minds.

    Thanks for letting us know. I'm starting a new project and had been intending to publish it on AO3, but now I will know better. 

    To add my voice to the choir:  WTC is my favorite web serial at the moment, by a large margin. I look forward to the next chapter.

    In case people wondering why [the skill name in the character stats in chapter one already has the blank filled](https://i.imgur.com/f1z6AoO.png), it's because the original has custom css to hide them (color it white). That's also the case for the PDF version (can't check EPUB or MOBI).

    You can try royal road, it is site to hosting web novel, and not only allow patreon, but even encourage authors to use patreon by generating button to patreon in the end of chapter , and if creator allow this button is active with link to author patreon page. Royal road have good and big community , sensible interface and is free for authors and readers.

      Royal Road has a nasty habit of redirecting their mobile website to spam sites though.

      I second the Royal road suggestion, that site has a much better readability and comments system as well.

        I mean system, sure. Userbase... first five pages of comments tend to be people trying to get first or saying "thanks for the chapter" and nothing more.

    Aww man, I hope that you don't have to remove it from AO3. That would be really annoying.

    Is linking a Patreon really that bad? I wonder what you can even do about it. Can you say, "support me at my website," which has a link to you Patreon?

    Definitely annoying, but I see why they don't commercial stuff on there. It could ruin their whole deal.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      You can just say "visit my website" with a link, and then the website has a link to Patreon. I think that this case *isn't* bad, since it's Patreon for an original work, and there's debatably not a problem with intermixing of fan and commercial works ... but it's easier to have a blanket policy that everyone follows, rather than trying to judge on a case-by-case basis that inevitably results in bias, perception of bias, and blowback.

      I'm fine not having a link, or just having a link to my website (since they explicitly allow that), and would have just done that if I'd known that I was supposed to. I *like* AO3, and the Organization for Transformative Works, and would only move the story if I was forced to.

      (As far as monetization goes ...

      Well, a little more than two years ago, I quit my job as a software engineer to be a stay-at-home dad to our son, who had just been born. It was something that my wife and I talked about a fair amount before we did it, and a decision that we made with the understanding that we'd be going from DINKs (Double-income, no kids) to living off just her salary. For the most part, we've made this work without it hurting too much, mostly because we were already living fairly frugally.

      I try not to think about the intersection of money and writing all that much, because I worry about giving myself anxiety, but there's going to be a point, a few years from now, when my son starts going to school and I'm going to have to figure out what I'm going to do as far as rejoining the workforce goes. I'd *really* like to write full time, if I could justify it, but it's not clear whether I'll actually be able to justify it -- and that's what I think about, when I think about not linking to Patreon anymore.)

      Apologies for the long and somewhat tangential response, I think I'm just in a talkative/contemplative mood.

        Yeah, that makes sense, and is technically a good idea for them if a bit annoying for you.

        It's good that you're not *too* annoyed about it, though.

        >Apologies for the long and somewhat tangential response, I think I'm just in a talkative/contemplative mood.

        Naw, it's fine hearing about one of my favorite authors. :)

        Btw, I saw some people in this thread noting that other people complained about the DM showing up and just wanted to say:

        I actually really liked how you did it. I didn't think of it as a ROB at all, and it felt really well done and well justified. Don't listen to the haters, your fic is going as strong as ever. Keep up the good work!
        ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        I still say you should offer higher Patreon tiers. It doesn't even have to be really useful stuff, my server's patreon offers discord roles, user ads and custom channels and it still gains more income than WTC's with 25% of your patrons, which is a shame.

        I definitely think you could swing at least $1000 a month with your current userbase if there wasn't only a $1/month tier. Someone a while ago gave you a better gameplan, something like a really low tier, another tier that you're hoping the average user aims for, and an expensive tier to make the average tier look cheap.

        It just feels like a shame to me that the top royalroadl writers can live off their work and you can't.

        You could potentially do freelance software development from home to supplement your wife's income. Stuff like web design, writing apps for mobile devices, etc. Things that can get you money and still allow you to work from home and not be tied to a business's schedule. It wouldn't be writing full time, but it also would allow you to set your own hours.
        ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Well, AO3 seems to be handling this in a very reasonable manner. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why you should always *read* the terms and conditions before you say you've read them!
    ```

    - u/Omnibuser:
      ```
      Do you actually do that?
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Yes, and if I find something in there which I do not accept, then I won't accept it.

        It's actually often quite an interesting read, if a bit dry.

- u/MaddoScientisto:

  He mentioned in the patreon monthly report that the negative feedback after the introduction of the ROB demotivated him greatly and the long time between updates after that and now this...
  I'm sad, I really enjoyed the story
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    I doubt he'd take the entire story down just because of negative feedback, and it has mostly tapered off since that chapter (at least the actual constructive feedback if you know who I mean). 
    In any case, I don't think you can consistently make it to the top of /r/rational with a significantly flawed story. 

    I also enjoyed the story and hope this is all just a glitch.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      That's my thinking as well. If he had truly decided to stop updating the story, we would be told through a text post on this sub or his personal site, and he wouldn't take the archive of the story down.

      Plus, the timing doesn't make much sense. A few days after he posts two chapters that largely got good feedback? If someone was so dissatisfied with their work that they felt the need to delete it, I would expect it to be after a significant hiatus.
      ```

        Nevermind it was just ao3 being ao3

  - u/Trudar:
    ```
    That's stupid, since the main aim of main protagonist is to be one. It has been in his quests, to met the gods, so *sooner or later it had to happen*. No one ever suggested, that it has to be in-universe.

    I think it's cool the way it was done, and crew's reaction was over the top.
    ```

    - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
      ```
      The characters framed everything in terms of "how do we please the unseen puppetmaster?", and even justifiably within the story. But I think that's a narrative dead-end, unless he gives us a sign.

      IMO, the DM character doesn't exhibit even as much power as is implied by all the speculation of our protagonists. Much better to have the DM write himself out of the story than leave him hovering in the background.
      ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    ROB?
    ```

    - u/Friedoobrain:
      ```
      Random omnipotent being/bastard. A catch all term for the gods and sundry that like to throw ordinary people into other universes in a lot of fics/fanfics.
      ```

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        I wouldn't call the DM an ROB, if only because he's not random. There feels like a purpose to his presence. 

        I've never made the connection before, but Dungeon Masters are surely of the same mold as ROBs, being omnipotent beings/bastards and all.

  I'm sure it's a bug/mistake.  In the meantime, I ripped the raw text for ch1-87 when I was making that list of magic types.  Said text can be found here [1] for the truly desperate ;-)

  The story and world-building of Worth the Candle is absolutely staggering!  Don't let a vocal minority get you down!

  I got fairly busy in real life and stopped reading since chapter 53 with plans to get caught back up at a later day. Since I had some free days this week I binged read back up to the current chapter and must say that the story has continued to be excellent and I love the direction it is going. I love binge reading to get caught up when I get behind since it is so satisfying to have 35 chapters to read all at once. :)   

  This story continues to be my number 1 recommendation to readers in the litRPG subreddit for good reasons. :)

  Worth the Candle is my favourite currently updating story on AO3. Probably my favourite including completed stories too, but it's possible I've forgotten something truly spectacular. In any case, I'm glad to hear it's a temporary removal, not an abandonment.
