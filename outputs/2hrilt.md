  Whoa whoa whoa. Whoa. Being able to split up, read two books, and then reintegate and remember both is a *drawback*? It's like if you were lost in the woods and scared of bears, and you found a radio, and all you could think of is how to use it to kill bears.

    Very good point.  This is one of the main things I need to clear up if I ever go back and edit the story: Maria is one of the relatively few people who can actually be split at all.  She's a power source for the same reasons she's a pilot, and this is not common.  I kind of explained this by having Maria's waking routine in Ch. 6 begin with checking for reintegrations, when Ratio's waking routine hadn't in Ch. 5, but it needs to be more explicitly stated.  (If any of the scientists could split, they definitely would.)

    (I should probably also specify at some point that the amount of energy gained from integrating two branches increases with the "distance" between the branches, to explain why they don't just constantly split and integrate one person over and over again very quickly.)

  I'm on chapter 10 now, and quite enjoying it so far. Is this complete?

  Edit: No, it is not. And while I liked it, I think it "suffers" from some of the same drawbacks that *Ra*/*Fine Structure* suffer from, which is that the story is told without a coherent narrative thread - we are instead given the story in bits and pieces and left to figure out things for ourselves and fill in the missing gaps through inference. I think that more or less works for psychological horror, where part of the point is keeping the reader just slightly off-balance, but it's a style of writing that I like better when I can engage in a running commentary with other people so we can clue each other in.

    So ... Sounds like we should start an update club.

      Weekly thread?

        Or just a new post whenever it updates. But given that all 21 chapters seem to have been put up at once, I have no idea what the author's update schedule is like, if there is one at all.

          Hi, author here!  I appreciate all the comments here and am flattered by the attention.

          Until a few days ago Floornight was being posted only to my tumblr -- then I dumped it all on AO3.  The updates are in 1-3 chapter blocks, and the schedule is erratic and based on when I feel like writing.  If you want a sense of what the schedule has been, see the tumblr page [here](http://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/fiction).  (If you click on an individual update, you will be able to see when it was posted.)

          The first update was posted on July 5 2014, which works out to a rough average rate of around 1.5 chapters per week, but of course I can't guarantee that will happen reliably every week.
          ```

            Cool! I'm enjoying the story a lot - I'll probably be following on AO3 and posting new chapters to this subreddit as they come out. Looking forward to reading more.
            ```

            Thanks for writing this! It's been a fun read thus far.

  I'm really enjoying this story! I like the characters and the disconcerting nature of it. I feel more emotionally invested than with Ra, both in the world/science and the characters. My only complaint is the "Ratio" character seems a bit too much like Sherlock from the BBC mini-series, it's hard to divorce the two in my mind.
