## [BST] Expendable Sentient Clones

### Post:

A while back, we had a writing challenge about clones. I didn't submit anything for it, but found the idea really intrigued me. So, I thought up a magic system. I won't use the actual terms I want to use here, because they're confusing and not finalized.

There are a lot of details, but they inhibit discussion of the main premise: By giving up x hours of your life by going into a coma for x hours, you can create a magic item that, when triggered, summons a perfect copy of you at the moment you entered the coma and sustains it for x hours. Anyone can trigger it.

The system also includes a way of becoming "immortal" as a kind of lich, theoretically available to about 10% of the population. Various factors make this both less appealing and less available. If you aren't in the 10% and try, you turn into an insane murderlich. If you are in the 10% and try, you still turn into an insane murderlich if you haven't been trained properly. And even then, there's a chance.

I'll edit in the answers to any questions below this line, to avoid wall-of-text-itis as a discussion-killer.

  Fun!

  The first order of business would be crafting a sort of personality and worldview where you would be inclined to help yourself. You'd want your clones to be willing to use every ounce of their lifespan to fulfilling your joint goals, rather than just sitting there and crying about their imminent death.

  So once that's out of the way, and you have a mindset that allows you to believe in a unity of identity and purpose, you'd want to stock up on a variety of clones. Having twenty or so five-minute clones means that you can win most fights that last less than five minutes, at least if you're fighting against someone who doesn't have their own stock of clones. That's only 100 minutes of coma.

  There's a decreased marginal utility on clone time. Ideally, you make the clones when you're well-fed and well rested, which would allow you to have a clone that keeps going until just before it would get sleepy. If your clone has to sleep, that's wasted time. I can't really think of many applications that you'd need a longer-lived clone either, at least not ones that are efficient.

  Questions:

  * Is the coma restful?
  * How large is the magic item?
  * How hard is the magic item to activate?
  * Is the clone physical? Can you eat the clone?
  * Do clones come in naked or clothed?

    [_Kiln People_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln_People) (which is by the way totally relevant) dealt with that by having the duplicate able to be re-merged with the original, so if your clone is well behaved it gets continuity of experience by merging, if it goes rogue it just wears out and stops working.

    1. No. You cannot use it as a sleep replacement. It does not reduce metabolic costs or oxygen needs any more than lying very still would, either... which is actually pretty good, if you're looking for a way to pass the time.

    2. The magic item must be light enough to hold in your hand and large enough to see. You could use grains of dust, if you wanted to risk losing your clones. You could use a ring, spoon, pot, shovel, or chainsaw, possibly a car wheel, but not an engine block or anything larger.

    3. Depends. It gets easier with training, and you can enter a trance that cuts off perception of everything but the magic item to make it even easier. It needs to be done one at a time, so as long as it takes to focus on something and flex a particular mental muscle. Think of it like firing a bow. There's actually an entire school of magic focused around this called invocation, which includes such things as conversing telekinetically with liches and preventing liches from manifesting on their own.

    4. Yes, until it disappears. This would be a bad idea, for reasons you can probably guess.

    5. Naked. No non-biological materials included.

    This is the full system. Any contradictions are a result of me changing my mind by accident: https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/41vw08/cuttings_branches_graces_and_ghouls_cloning_is/

      What is the exact mental state of - rather, what are the type of brainwaves experienced by - one during the coma?  If you don't define that rigorously, then it may have effects similar to meditation, in which case I could sleep for three hours, wake rested, enter a coma for *x* hours, and again wake rested with a fully fresh and alert clone to boot.

  I'll try looking at this from the other direction.  What can you do with an at-will coma, that has very useful effects?  

  Are you just sitting in a carriage, waiting to arrive?  Make clones!  You have soldiers hired, but no war right now?  Have them make clones!  You work in a seasonal job?  8 months of clones, and 4 months of tripled work!  Rainy day? Clones! 

  You basically have the ability to send labor forwards in time.  Choose the most useless times to send "from", so that you have enough for when you really need it.

    This is basically what I was thinking. It's like a time machine, only backwards... and without memory transference. If memories were merged back into the original, you could save up some clone time over the summer so that you could take twice as many classes in the fall. You wouldn't necessarily be "doubling your learning power", since you've given up an entire summer of experience for the chance.

    In fact, without memory merging, you're shortening your lifespan by the amount of time you clone. I'm suddenly struck by the image of a child savant who starts banking time at the age of five, and winds up a physical adult who has only matured by a few years. And not even that, since apparently all his waking hours would be spent eating and sleeping and not doing the normal child things that result in emotional growth...

    If this is a modern Earth-style setting, you just know there are teenagers who would trance themselves straight through to the legal drinking age unless their parents and peers put down some very strong incentives against it.
