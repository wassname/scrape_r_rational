Print book and Kindle Unlimited version should be available in a couple of weeks or so. For Amazon reasons, when I put up the Kindle Unlimited version, the Gumroad version goes down for 90 days.  So if you want the platform-independent version, get it at Gumroad within the next week.

If you have no idea what genre this is supposed to be in, one of the better light novels I've read online is [Evil God Average](http://oniichanyamete.wordpress.com/index/evil-god-average/).

I don't have a sequel plot in mind (just a handful of ideas) and you're welcome to stake an opinion on what should happen next.

  Yes!

  This makes me very happy.  My only complaint is that it is short!  :P

  Thank you very much, Eliezer!  I appreciate you taking time from your life to write - it's a rare treat to read really high level rational fiction!

  Also, FYI, looks like some formatting didn't carry over on the Amazon description - I'm seeing underscores in place of italics tags.

  Always love to see a story that ends with the *true* victory condition, [](#s "the protagonist being pleasurably violated by tentacles every night,") as every story should.

  Splendid.

    [The cover on Gumroad](https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/5369921260514/asset_previews/64be5d316715dc606bc64d8ebd18f5e9/retina/LN_Cover_401x.jpg) seems to have some text inside the author's name. "Victory" in "S", for example. Doesn't look like a text from a novel.

    Is this some sort of easter egg?

      It looks like generic fantasy ipsum.

  This was delightful.  I'm glad I subscribed to the email updates on hpmor.com.  Given this character, I can't imagine the next few months of her life being anything other than trying to assemble a ramshackle version of the internet, because she's going to go into withdrawal soon.  If you've ever watched Humanity Has Declined (an anime about life in the far-off future where humanity's population is dwindling and has to meet an equilibrium with fairies whose primary motivation is sweets), the episode where humanity rediscovers yaoi manga and starts up conventions around it would be a great reference.

  I highly recommend [Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?!](http://turb0translation.blogspot.com.au/p/blog-page.html).  It's about a girl who gets resurrected as a giant spider in the middle of a labyrinth, and promptly has to run away to avoid being eaten by her spider family.  Given that none of the monsters around her can talk, almost the entire story is carried on the back of her internal ramblings as she slowly goes crazy.

  The translation above has most chapters, but since that translator isn't a native speaker of English OR Japanese, it can get a bit wonky, so there's a retranslation project going on [here](http://blastron01.tumblr.com/tagged/kumoko/chrono) that has around fifty chapters done, and there's another translation project picking up where the original non-native translator left off [here](http://raisingthedead.ninja/current-j-z/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka/), for 237 chapters of the main story and a lot of side story chapters.  There's also a [manga adaptation](http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka-r17709/) that just started.

  Thanks for bringing us more content!

  I'd be curious to see your take on chinese xianxia (pronounced "shin-shuh") webnovels, such as "[I Shall Seal the Heavens](http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/)," "[Martial God Asura](http://www.wuxiaworld.com/mga-index/)," "[Tales of Gods and Demons](http://www.wuxiaworld.com/tdg-index/)," "[Battle Through the Heavens](http://www.wuxiaworld.com/btth-index/)," "[Against the Gods](http://www.wuxiaworld.com/atg-index/)", "[Coiling Dragon](http://www.wuxiaworld.com/cdindex-html/)," and "[Stellar Transformations](http://www.wuxiaworld.com/st-index/)".

  They all take place in worlds where martial cultivation allows you to become, for all intents, a superhero.  Cultivation is ranked on a scale and requires meditation and time to increase through the rankings.  The main character inevitably A) has some sort of power or artifact that allows him to progress at an extremely fast rate, and B) get into fights with people who look down upon him and are promptly trounced.

  They're the literature equivalent of junk food: not high culture by any means, but still enjoyable to consume.

  But if you don't enjoy xianxia stories, don't worry.  It just means you had eyes but couldn't recognize Mt. Tai.  ;)

      - u/MultipartiteMind:
        ```
        (I'm reminded of how--I think in Against The Gods--'You're courting death' (said or yelled) gets very repetitive. which came across as funny for me due to the somewhat loquacious(/refined?) nature of the word 'courting' in English.)

    ```
    OH MAN ARE WE TALKING ABOUT XIANXIA? XIANXIA IS MY JAM.

    I have been ingesting copious amounts of xianxia stories as of late (read: past 6 months or so) in hopes of actually coming up with something interesting to say about the genre. I love the aesthetic of the novels, but they really ARE mostly junk food, which makes me really really sad.

    Translations of xianxia novels are definitely difficult to do, due to several factors. How would you even translate 金丹 or 元婴? All literal translations of this sound absolutely ASININE in english. Golden egg? Golden elixir? Spirit fetus? These phrases do not convey the impact of the phrases at all. All of Xianxia really suffers from this sort of problem, because it isn't enough to just translate the characters, you also have to pick translations that convey the appropriate depth of 'importance'.

    (I've been working on an attempt at a personal translated lexicon of Xianxia stuff in my off-time. Highlights of it include translating both 炼化 and 修炼 as 'Refinement' with contextual information telling the reader whether we're talking about refinement of artifacts or refinement of the self, translating 吐纳 as 'Aspiration', and translating 修士 as 'Aspirant' or 'Pursuant' as an attempt to make the semantic network of translated terms more compact.)

    The concept of the Xian is really, really suited to optimization and rationality, though. Xian basically fulfill the role of angels in chinese mythology, as relatively benevolent supernatural forces of unearthly beauty and power fighting against demonic forces, but whereas in judeochristianity angels are created by god, in chinese mythology the Xian are all uplifted humans. The fundamental premise of the Xian is a promise that if you work hard at your supernatural kung-fu and devote yourself to following a Way (not THE way; there are generally three thousand unique Ways in most Xianxia settings), you will eventually escape your mortal bonds and ascend to boundless youth and power. Transhumanism as invented by feudal chinese scholars, pretty much.

    God I could talk for EONS about how cool Xianxia settings are. There's SO many cool concepts baked into Xianxia settings that I'd love to be allowed to export into you folks' brains.
    ```

    - u/tamagawa:
      ```
      This sounds really interesting, and I'd really like to hear details of the cool concepts and settings. I don't think I have the patience to read the stories, but could you distill some of the awesomeness into a post?
      ```

      - u/Drazelic:
        ```
        I'm working on it right now. There's a lot of stuff to go over though, and it's honestly taking me quite a bit of time!

        Mostly I'm stuck on figuring out how to make it relevant to r/rational's interests. Just describing a genre doesn't really make it relevant as a post; I also have to come up with some way to connect it to rational fiction in general, I think.

        I'll figure something out though!

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        Man, every translated novel I (try to) read either reads like (bad) fanfiction or extremely dry, academic work. I know I shouldn't expect too much from fan translators doing this in their free time, but I'd honestly prefer inaccurate, much more americanized transliterations that follow the plot, but not the exact sentence structure.
        ```

        - u/abcd_z:
          ```
          How do you know those aren't accurate translations?  Maybe the underlying work reads like bad fanfiction or extremely dry, academic work.

          I mean, yeah, the fault might be with the translators, but you don't know that for a fact unless you read chinese, and if you do, why are you wasting time reading the translations?
          ```

          - u/GaBeRockKing:
            ```
            >How do you know those aren't accurate translations? Maybe the underlying work reads like bad fanfiction or extremely dry, academic work.

            I'm not saying they're *innacurate,* I'm saying that by rigidly sticking to the source material, fan translators sacrifice good writing on the altar of accuracy. It's like the subbed versus dubbed debate, but I'm on the end that's opposite from my regular stance. Japanese writing, for example, has a habit of telling, not showing, which isn't necessarily bad in any particular case (it's permissible in manga to stop stories from getting bogged down), but it doesn't exactly mesh with western sensibilities. And to clarify, it's not a Japanese thing so much as it is a foreign language thing-- each culture will have it's own trends and writing styles, and reading directly translated work therefore feels awkward.

            >why are you wasting time reading the translations?

            well, I can't exactly read the originals...

        Thank you very much for mentioning the Disciple webnovel!  As a result I went to take a look at it out of curiosity, and so far it's been hilarious!  (Sometimes in some quite insightful ways.)
        ```

    - u/Pakars:
      ```
      As much as Tales of Demons and Gods got me into wuxia/xianxia, it's definitely very weak.

      I second All_in_bad_taste's recommendation for anyone who would check the genre out, even if wuxia/xianxia are very much the junk food of fiction.
      ```

  - u/hyenagrins:
    ```
    Wow, no idea these things are being translated actually. 

    Xianxia genre is mostly a bastardization of traditional Wuxian (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong), which probably better deserves rationalization (although to be fair, some selected few works already qualify as rational fictions).

  Oh, look at that.  The Kindle Unlimited rules have changed; now you're allowed to be in it with a book priced at $0.99; used to be that you had to be between $2.99 and $9.99.  On the flip side, it also used to be the case that you could make 30% of it available for free and that's now been reduced to 10%.  

  I need to make a point of reviewing the terms more often, but at least I checked before offering incorrect pricing commentary.

  [Having the ending be] (#s " 'she got off on a technicality' was pretty unsatisfying (both puns not intended >_>), but everything before that was AWESOME.")

  [Also, two small gripes (this spoiler is very minor)] (#s " with the 'lust isn't a sin' scene.") [First,] (#s " when the angel put forth the possibility that Earth's rejection of lust being a sin was a result of its collective lack of moral fortitude, our protagonist should've rebutted by explaining that her world /used/ to be like this one, until a bunch of smart people thought it over and discussed it for a few centuries and were eventually forced to conclude that, no matter which way they looked at it, it just didn't make any sense.") [Second,] (#s " the aforementioned development (read: achievement) was far more than just deciding (read: discovering) that lust isn't a sin; it was realizing that sin is inherently a fictional, useless concept that pointlessly hamstrings any otherwise productive discussion of morality.")

  [Edit: actually, I just thought of an expansion to the first gripe above (spoilers still just as minor):] (#s " she could prove her point using the other world's own logic. 'Of course,' she could say, 'ANY desire could drive a person to commit evil acts in pursuit of that desire, but that doesn't mean that any and all indulging of that desire is evil by definition. In fact, you yourselves already know this on some level, even if you don't acknowledge it. You consider gluttony to be a sin, right? But you don't think EATING FOOD is always automatically evil. You don't even think that ENJOYING food is evil, or if you do, it's only because of what it might lead to. No, the only thing you REALLY object to is eating so much that it negatively impacts your health. Why? Because that's when it starts CAUSING HARM, which is what morality is REALLY all about. The only thing the people of my world did was realize that the exact same logic applies to ALL potentially enjoyable acts.'")
  ```

  - u/t3tsubo:
    ```
    I think the laws of morality in that universe are more akin to the laws of physics in our world - as in you can argue with the angel all you want about what should/shouldn't be sin, but you'd be analogous to B.o.B. arguing the world is flat.
    ```

    - u/Tommy2255:
      ```
      But that changes what's actually meant by the word "morality". To us, it has to do with what you *should* do, and it doesn't make much sense for that to be associated with some arbitrary rules made up by angels. To them, morality is all about making angels approve of you, and improving society or optimizing outcomes is at best a pleasant side-effect. If "good" is defined by the approval of angels, then it's unclear why we should always endeavor to bother being good, and we would need different vocabulary to discuss actual morality.
      ```

      - u/t3tsubo:
        ```
        The reason to have angels approve of you is presumably to access good side magic
        ```

        - u/Tommy2255:
          ```
          Which is why I said "always". And the secend you've had a dick in you or your dick in someone else, that's out of the question anyway, so it doesn't provide sufficient reason to make it the foundation of all moral reasoning for everyone.
          ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        You're right. A committed human utilitarian would not see committed non-human deontologists as automatic allies or trustworthy moral guides.

        But this story takes place in a middle-ages fantasy world where semi-divine entities go around being *nice* and saying things that match human instincts and are *mostly* right in a very authoritative tone of voice (while leveraging supernatural powers). It would be very hard for a native to notice the difference between utilitarianism and deontology in this environment, and impossible to do anything about it if you do.
        ```

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  Yay!

  Trivia: I think I'm the one who originally suggested Evil God Average for this community (in late [last august](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3hutyd/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cub54ef?context=3)'s general rec thread), which corresponds to when EY left a comment on Book of God 06 over on the translation there.

  You may find manga "[Yuusha Gojo Kumiai Kouryuugata Keijiban](http://mangafox.me/manga/yuusha_gojo_kumiai_kouryuugata_keijiban/)" very interesting, btw. It takes common tropes like "summoned hero" or "hero vs demon lord" and the like and proceeds to explore, invert and deconstruct them in many fun and interesting ways in a series of short and loosely-connected stories.
  ```

- u/PL_TOC:
  ```
  I understand the attitude was playful in its handling of certain tropes, but the writing was lazy. I wouldn't recommend this to others at any price point.
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    The writing seems pretty standard for the genre; are you comparing this to novellas or other LNs?

    I guess at least in part because it's so short the writing style didn't really bother me, despite not really being a fan of LN writing in general.
    ```

    - u/PL_TOC:
      ```
      No. The quality of the text changes dramatically when the main character is considering aloud ways to munchkin the situation and it seems like this is the only part of the story given such consideration. That's my biggest gripe. Apparent lack of effort.
      ```

      - u/Takashoru:
        ```
        I mean, given Eliezer's previous work with HPMOR, it's quite clear that the low quality writing style is intentional.

        I expect it due to either a stylistic, stream-of-consciousness kind of thing, or a calculated optimization wherein Eliezer reduced writing quality in favor of brevity and ease of writing.  It might also be a common style in the Light Novel genre - Anderkent's comment seems to suggest this.

        As far as the low quality editing and vocabulary/word choice is concerned, as with the title, I am over 90% confident that this is as a result of attempting to create an authentic Japanese Light Novel translation experience.

        I agree that there are very noticeable flaws in the piece that prevent it from being a masterpiece, but I think it very cleverly optimizes for a rationalist audience:

        1.  Eliezer has many things on his plate - the faster and looser the writing style is, the easier and faster he can write it and release it to us.

        2.  By focusing heavily on the rationalist elements of the story, it provides, at a relatively low authorial cost, a hit of rationalist fiction that fulfils the basic requirements of the genre.  Since that is the element so many of us struggle to find consistently, while other literary needs can be met elsewhere, at a small cost to general utils, this story neatly optimizes for low-cost distribution of very specific utils.


        I did feel it was quite short, but then, I've been reading Worm and associated fanfiction for the last few months, so anything under 100k words feels unbearably short.

        If you are the kind of person who hungers for rational(ist) fiction, I think this LN is perfectly appropriate, unless you find a lack of quality to be an undeniable blocker to your enjoyment.
        ```

- u/elevul:
  ```
  While I greatly enjoyed your previous products and will be eternally grateful for starting this whole current of rational fiction, I don't think selling your stories like this is a good idea, as it puts them into the realm of products, rather than support for the creator.

  Might I recommend setting up a Patreon profile and provide all your stories to the paid supporters?

  I don't mind giving money to you, as a thanks for kicking off the genre that rekindled my love in reading, but I do not consider paying 0,99€ for such a short story to be worth the cost, as there are many other products that provide better value for the money.
  ```

  - u/trifith:
    ```
    So, you want to signal that you value EY's work and fiction, but do not want to demonstrate that you value them more than you value, say, a cup of coffee, or a candy bar.

    By purchasing a good, you demonstrate that you prefer that good to all other goods you could purchase with that money. By refusing to purchase this book, you demonstrate that you prefer some other good you can purchase at a similar price to the book. 

    By complaining here in the way you have done, you are attempting to signal a preference you are at the same time demonstrating you don't have.
    ```

    - u/elevul:
      ```
      As a rationalist I do not value EY's work a priori, but on a case-by-case basis, as it should be. From reading the first 4 chapters I have evaluated that the product is not worth the price for me, and as such I have no interest in paying for it.

      But, as said above, I am grateful to EY for what he did in the past, and I am willing to support HIM for that, but as far as this specific product is concerned I do not consider it worth paying for.
      ```
