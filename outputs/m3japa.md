## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I have been passed over for the same promotion at work five times; it's a bad minimum-wage manual-labor job and I don't like it, only working there because it's currently what fits my schedule needs. It's not  realistic for me at the moment to work somewhere else, at least not for a long time, and most places i could work at in the short term would probably just be worse. I'm not desperate for money, I'm able to get by without issues but if i got the promotion i'd probably be making substantially more than double what i am now and it'd help so much.

  I'm outperforming all my coworkers in very quantifiable ways (and I think in most subjective ways as well) and I keep getting passed up. Socially I'm on good terms with my coworkers and superiors; I've been super direct to management that I'm eager to move up. I keep getting brushed off anyway.

  I'm so bitter about it; everyday i need to interact with the people that have been moved up instead of me, they're very nice people, as is my management, i'm just at a loss at the unfairness of it all. I feel dumb for placing my self-worth on this but i can't help it. I've asked management directly what else I could do to improve my chances and I continually get the same answer that I'm doing perfectly and there are no further improvements for me to make; other people are surprised that I haven't been moved up yet (or at least they're telling me this to make me feel better, I don't know anymore). I have a reputation for being a hard worker.

  How do I stop feeling personally hurt about this? It's making me so depressed.

    Other people are getting promoted where you are not. You are, as per your own report, working hard in all the ways that can be expected, under rational rules, to lead to a promotion.

    This leads to the idea that perhaps the rules are *not* rational. Perhaps there is some common feature to the people who are getting promoted that is not the case for you? It might be worthwhile to see if such a feature can be found. It's possible that, for example, the people who get promoted are the people who share their lunch with the boss, regardless of actual work done.

    Or it's possible that your direct boss's bonus depends on how much work his team does - and he's always promoting the people who do *not* contribute to his bonus, to get the useless slackers out of his department and keep the team that actually does the *work*. This is counterproductive, because it rewards people for slacking off and not doing more than the required minimum work; but if it is happening, then that's a possible explanation.

    Another possibility is that the people who are promoted have some paper qualification that you are lacking (such as a BA in business administration or similar); even if the course teaches you nothing that you don't already know, getting a BA might make you a better candidate for promotion.

    If you're a good competent worker you're more valuable working than managing.

    &#x200B;

    There are studies that show that people that work faster get perceived as having a lower time value, more things will get asked of you etc. If an employee takes 3h to do something and another takes 1h, the one that does it in 1h will get a lot more done, and his time will be seen as less 'valuable' because more of it is available and smaller quantities of it generate more returns.

    &#x200B;

    This means more things are asked of him, he's got more work, more stress, more chances to fail and make mistakes etc. I know it's weird but as an employee you should try to be above average, more than that and it's counter productive.

    &#x200B;

    Do you have the qualifications and expected age to be promoted ? Do you dress and have the general appearance of someone that'd be a manager in your company ?

    &#x200B;

    Other than that depending on how capable you're, look into alternative income sources. Affiliate marketing is fairly simple if you can use a computer. Do your own research, trading time for money is not ideal, depending on things you can't control like who your boss feels like promoting is not ideal. Transition gradually and play a different game if the one you're playing doesn't favor you.

    Breaking out concrete "what would change if I was promoted" might help; is it money? different day-to-day work? feeling recognized? etc

    Not knowing what to do about it def contributes to a feeling of helplessness. It sounds like having actions to take + way to evaluate progress is what you're lacking at work, can you come up with your own plan? Like, "I will leave in a year if there's no pay change"

    Would it be extremely impolite/social faux-pas for you to grab one of the relevant bosses for a conversation and ask them directly: not what you should be doing to get promoted, but why you weren't promoted before?

    It seems that they just aren't keen to promote you, and it is hurting your mental health and self image, so it might be worth to do it simply to try getting a true answer, even if it won't help you to get promoted. Just asking "I need the money, I get good reviews, I'm good at my job, why haven't you promoted me when you had the opportunity?" I understand it may feel/seem like whining, and maybe damage the way they view you, but it seems you are starting to need the answer more than you actually need the promotion. 

    If this seems too daunting, I suggest starting with the other answers, specifically trying to note everything in common with those promoted that you're missing. Do they hang out in the same pub? Do they have more seniority? Do they seem similar physically? Have some formal qualifications? There might be legitimate reasons you're missing, or it might be politics/sexism/racism, and nothing that you can really solve. It's entirely possible that shitty people are doing shitty things to you, and you may need (in your current situation) to bear it, and the only thing left to do is work to maintain your mental health, and carry on. If you're willing to give more details in private, I can try to give another perspective (and maybe think of something you missed, or suggest other work venues that you skipped over).

    Edit: I thought of another suggestion: if you're so good at your work, and it may be that they don't promote you because you're more valued in the current position, ask for a raise. They may or may not be willing to more adequately compensate you. If a simple raise is not possible, perhaps suggest some bonus scheme for particularly good stats?
    If this continues with no proper compensation, consider simply keeping your head down and putting in less effort.

    Are you a woman or nonwhite?  Or are you not "charismatic" because you use multisyllable words and don't sports?  But that's just so I can confirm my personal biases.

    Can you find something better?  Because I think maybe you should feel personally hurt about this and you should let it motivate you to make some hard course corrections.

  I haven't bought any groceries since November. 

  In a combination of poor and good foresight, I'd seen where COVID was going while it was still in China, and stocked up to last out a potential lockdown/lack of service. Only, while the first wave was as bad as I'd thought it would be, delivery service picked back up more rapidly than I'd thought it would, and I went back to regular grocery shopping through the online app. Come winter, most of the non-perishables were still in the cupboard as I'd just been going through the stuff I'd bought to top up through quarantine.

  So I've been working through the backlog, and I'm *still eating it*. Dried beans and mushrooms, frozen vegetables, pickled goods, canned tomatoes, jarred sauces, UHT milk, rice and pasta, and a decent amount of alcohol topping up the caloric limit. The slightly worrying thing is that I'm still not short on options. My diet is as varied as it was before, and it's entirely what I'd before thought of before as 'emergency food'. The UHT milk is something I'd literally never bought before, but it's *so convenient* and I've developed a taste for it. I don't think I'll bother going back to fresh when I can just buy a few gallons and leave it there for a few months instead.

  Have I genuinely just been throwing money away for years, buying food that only keeps for a few days on the marketing value of 'fresh', when long-lasting, still-tasty stuff is cheaper and easily-available? Is there some X-Factor I'm missing that makes produce-aisle spinach expiring in two days better than the frozen spinach I can toss into a sauce more than a year after purchase?

    If you’re eating a lot of preserved food, you might be getting too much sodium in your diet. That’s the only potential downside I’m sure of, don’t know about the harm of preservatives in general or what benefits fresh food has. I’d miss fresh fruit though, dried fruit is pretty good though.
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Preserved food is more interchangeable than fresh food, so more producers can compete for the sale, so the market drives the prices down, and the margins with it. So the stores you buy from have an incentive to push fresh food, which has higher margins.

    Nutritionally, some of the nutrients of preserved food will leech out to the preserving liquid, but if you're including that when you cook then I don't think you're missing much. You're also eating more preservatives. If too much salt and vinegar aren't going to be a problem for you, I don't think it's a problem.

    Culinarily, some foods benefit more from fresh ingredients than others. You mentioned tossing frozen spinach into a sauce, and that's an ideal case for a preserved food. Sauces, stews, roasts, and really any slowly cooked or thoroughly mixed dish is going to be fine with preserved ingredients. Raw or seared foods would do better fresh. Salads or grilled vegetables would be dishes I'd expect to taste better with fresh ingredients.

    Also, food generally takes longer than two days to go bad. If the food you're buying at the grocery store goes bad in two days, it's not really that fresh to start with, and that does impact the flavor. That missing X-Factor in your fresh spinach might only exist if you get it from the local farmers' market or your garden.

      > Nutritionally, some of the nutrients of preserved food will leech out to the preserving liquid,

      IIRC, frozen vegetables are *better* than fresh ones, because the degradation from freezing and being stored in a freezer is less than the degradation from being stored fresh (including shipping time).

  - u/PastafarianGames:

    There are a lot of foods that are perfectly fine frozen or canned, and more foods that can be cooked in ways that are perfectly fine etc. It all depends on how you're cooking! If you're throwing stuff into sauces with pasta, basically everything is gonna be fine. If you like a lot of crunchy or fried foods, not so much; I wouldn't want to, say, pan-fry zucchini from anything other than the farmer's market if I had that option!

    I'm very much not a nutritionist, but I suggest checking that you're getting enough micronutrients of the various types. Consider that some citruses for example will keep for several weeks in the fridge, and are a good source for vitamin C. It may be best to simply find a valued nutritionist around to consult with on your diet.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    If there *is* some factor that makes the fresh stuff better, then one immediate solution is to grow a small amount of fresh stuff in your own garden. That way (a) it's even fresher than anything you find in the store, and (b) it's *still* not a vector for Covid-like pathogens.
    ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    Frozen: hell yes, it's fresher than unfrozen; just avoid freezer burn.  


    Canned: depends upon method of preservation and the specific foodstuff in question.  For example, anything with vitamin C will degrade over time, exposure, and heat, so it needs to be frozen or eaten fresh.  You'll see added ascorbic acid in orange juice, etc., because its vitamin C content degrades very quickly after juicing (and for standardisation  of product nutritional value as well).

  I just finished Under The Dome by Stephen King. I'll be posting about it in tomorrow's thread because it's extremely fertile soil for munchkinry, but I wanted to recommend it here first and invite any discussion from others who have read it. I wouldn't call it fully rational, but in almost all cases the characters act according to their goals & capabilities, and it's a fascinating "what-if" scenario with a lot of implications that are satisfyingly explored. 

  For what it's worth, it's also a deeply insightful examination of tyranny and the psychology of tyrants.

    By the way, the Netflix show with the same name is just that: a show with the same name. And the same premise. And a few character are similar, too.

    It diverges pretty quickly from the book, in all the bad ways: no character development, no clear goals, "evil" characters are just generic assholes, die in stupid ways when the actor's contract expires and minor spoilers: the writers somehow manage to introduce a new character in the third season, in what's supposed to be a walled off community.
    ```

    - u/TyeJoKing:
      ```
      I got to correct you on one thing; it's not a Netflix show. I mean, I guess it's a show that is apparently now streaming on Netflix, but it is not produced by Netflix, like a initially thought you meant.

      This sent me down the memory lane of watching it as it came out (on actual tv!), almost eight years ago. And yes, it was pretty bad, especially after the first season.
