  This is kinda neat as a fake Wikipedia article, but it doesn't really tell much of a story. Once you remove the purely factual background material on hash functions, there's only a few paragraphs that boil down to "either someone has a megaultrasupercomputer, or SHA-256 has been broken."

  Also, speaking as a cryptographer: hash functions being broken is generally surprising, but not the sort of thing that shatters your view of the field. Hash functions in general are usually not based on hard computational assumptions in the way RSA depends on factoring.

    I think you're skipping over the interesting parts of the story. Someone found a vulnerability in SHA-256: sure, but that's just the setup. They announced this with a huge data dump of reversals for *double-*SHA-256, which were all of a particular string format with no explanation why. It was distributed via torrent and 75% went missing, and no one is sure why. The unknown method is mildly interesting; the unknown *motive* is fascinating.

      My problem is that the motive has no evidence towards any particular solution. I think that the article is neat - but I wouldn't call it a story, because the only thing there is a mystery box.
      ```

  - u/Galap:
    ```
    So, why are hash functions difficult to reverse if they aren't based on hard computational assumptions?
    ```

    - u/JohnKeel:
      ```
      There are a bunch of heuristics used when creating hash functions, most of which boil down to “we’re pretty sure this defeats a known method of attacking hash functions.” In today’s commonly-used hashes (the ones that are practical to use), they’re also accepted as probably secure because a lot of skilled cryptanalysts have failed to show weaknesses, rather than because of formal proofs.

        > a lot of skilled cryptanalysts have failed to show weaknesses

        Or have at any rate failed to publicise weaknesses, which we all pretend is basically the same thing.

        (despite knowing that NSA et al both find *and introduce* weaknesses in common crypto...)

  That was very good. There's a nice bit of humour at the very end too.

  I love this sort of fake website worldbuilding - not to mention the juxtaposition between cryptographic verification of the collection and its inexplicable, impossible origin.

  rip to bitcoin tho

    The resulting Bitcoin Next would appear to survive, although only time would tell if the damage from Basilisk would kill the trust and hype long-term.

  Mathematical cosmic horror.

  ```
  This has a Mystery Flesh Pit National Park-like energy to it.
  ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    Yeah, or the better SCP articles-=. Not in being supernatural, but in telling a story without a clear answer, and only seeing the results on the outside. Very few articles that go that route do it well, but this one does.
    ```

  ```
  Fascinating read! Also, I now learned about partial hash inversions :D
