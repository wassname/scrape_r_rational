## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  The Day After Ragnarok is one of the most interesting RPG settings I've found with a ton of interesting story hooks for nearly every flavor of pulp adventure. In 1945, Norse mythology returns to the Earth as the Nazis summon the World-Serpent to kick off the apocalypse. The atomic bomb ends up stopping it, but leaves Europe flattened beneath the continent-sized corpse, the Eastern half of North America devastated by the venom released into the atmosphere, and earthquakes that wake up Loki and the other sleeping frost giants who ally with Stalin.

  It's got post-apocalyptic survival in The Poisoned Lands, political intrigue in stable counties, decentralized war against both Nazis and communists, dungeon crawling in the World-Serpent for materials to build sci-fi tech, and supernatural elements to include as both mysteries and well-understood forces. It's ripe for stories of all kinds, but in reading the book and researching Norse mythology I've discovered how difficult it is to rationalize myths assembled out of a handful of ancient stories that have been largely corrupted by Christianity.

  I really like this setting, but I want to come up with consistent explanations as to where the myths came from, why they faded into myth, what the events that occurred indicate about the mythology, and what the different possible endgames are. This turned out to be pretty difficult since the folklore is actually pretty vague about a lot of important details. As much as I've criticized Unsong, it at least knew how to take a bunch of crazy ideas and make them it's own within a thematically consistent mythology.

  For some reason, I'm actually worried about coming up with explanations that are *accurate* to both real history and the folklore. I can't even do what Tolkien did and transplant ideas he liked into a new mythology that made more sense. I feel an obligation to adhere to the in-game lore and even explain the parts that contradict the obscure details from Norse myth like the giants not being Fair Folk-esque beings from another planet. So I'm not quite sure what to do.

    First point on rationalising myths - Assume that the details are wrong. Stories have been twisted through the centuries, losing and gaining bits in the retelling. Sometimes, the stories are flat-out propaganda by one of the mythological features. This allows you to contradict inconvenient obscure details at will, while sticking with *convenient* obscure details. (Have your protagonists trip over this early, so that the reader is warned).

    Second point - a lot of the details will be missing. Lost or forgotten in the interval, or flat-out misunderstood from the start. So the giants are from another world, getting to Earth only over a rainbow bridge? Perhaps that other world is a low-gravity planet (thus explaining their size), and the Rainbow Bridge is some alien portal generator (and the only reason they haven't been seen around in the past few thousand years is that they managed to lose the coordinates for Earth (Loki managed to get admin rights on their system?)), with the ones still on Earth putting themselves in cryostasis in the hope of surviving until their species manages to find their way back here. Now they're awake again, unable to reenter cryostasis (lack of supplies? Medical reasons?) and very very upset at how long it's been since there's been any contact from their home planet (is their species still even around?)...

      I don't think Sufficiently Advanced Aliens can apply here. Aside from the question of why they'd make a giant space snake, Serpentfall also brought magic and psychic powers to the world that line up with Norse folklore. There's a reason I compared this setting to Unsong.

      These myths also seem a bit odd for propaganda considering how the gods are portrayed as flawed and specifically state how they will die due to their inevitable failures. At the minimum, there'd have to be an explanation of how the stories got started and why they were allowed to fade into obscurity.

      I liked the idea of the mythology being descended from an older Indo-European religion, but that comes back to the problem of building a cosmology where Serpentfall and the events that come of it make sense. The entire setting hinges on that weird thing happening, but not many big events afterward.

        ...fair enough. I don't actually know much about the setting you're describing.

        Easy. They were started by the Frost Giants, or by Loki on their behalf - the propaganda was designed to make them look weak, not strong, and make the Frost Giant's eventual victory appear inevitable.

        - u/trekie140:
          ```
          Aside from how that contradicts a bunch of other myths that also existed at the time, which weren't considered to be competing narratives or alternate interpretations, why did all these beings care about spreading them and then stop caring? Serpentfall indicates that these beings' existence and their power is independent of humans believing in them, but even if spreading propaganda among humans was important to their goals then how come the stories don't have significantly different versions that cast characters in different roles?

    Have you considered applying the Simulation Hypothesis to the setting? E.g. our world is indeed a simulation, but it's had many different "builds" over the ages, each operating under its own set of laws. The modern era build runs on Physics, the previous one implemented an (internally consistent) Nordic magic system. Whenever reality is shifted to a new build, its denizens retain some ancestral knowledge of the previous builds, which is how we have mythology. 
    What the Nazis did was, in fact, exploit a bug they found in the fabric of the simulation, tricking it into booting parts of a previous, deprecated build.

  Somebody with the top tier flying brick powerset (telekinesis over their own body with no upper limits on power, as well as total invulnerability to basically everything and no need for any form of sustenance), has taken control over the world by just forcing government to obey him at gunpoint. Not-superman's goals are to solve coordination problems and shift laws everywhere in line with whatever political ideals you the reader possess (he believes the ends justify the means regardless of whether you do though).                  
  If governments don't cooperate he'll fly into cities and other strategically valuable places and just blink his eyes at extremely close to the speed of light, causing a explosion of any size he chooses and possibly irradiating the area to some degree from all the gamma rays.                 

  Not-superman has planned this all for quite a while beforehand and implemented a pretty good plan and major governments are following his orders for solving coordination problems, not-superman is completely ruthless (but not self interested) and can't be deterred from his task by anything, nor significantly influenced. He's also not lying about the fact that he just got his powers seemingly completely at random and what his goals are. Not-superman should also be assumed to have access to a number of loyal subordinates in whatever areas of expertise are relevant to this sort of global reform.

  Now the question is, what do you expect a world like this to look like?                   
  How does the culture react to what may seem like an absurdly obvious evil force having total control? With people having little way to rebel except by attacking their own governments who are only acting because they have no choice. And what do you expect the reaction to be in areas where not-superman's reforms significantly increase their own living standards?

    Part 1: General consequences

    So, !Superman is essentially an invincible terrorist with god-like powers trying to enforce an arbitrary political ideology. However, he's not omniscient, so he's going to have to get his information from somewhere, presumably mostly from his loyal subordinates.

    Without yet getting into the details of any specific ideology, we can easily predict what's going to happen in general. Think of !Superman as a government unto himself. If you can persuade him/his subordinates that something is good or bad, or that something is true or false, you gain power through him. !Superman is about to get mobbed by lobbyists (for lack of a better word) trying to present him with problems to solve. Media narratives are about to change drastically to adjust how !Superman and his subordinates think about the world.

    At present, we already have to deal with political think tanks trying to come up with propaganda techniques which will work well on certain voter blocs, or which will put pressure on certain politicians' bases. With !Superman, we now have a place for psychologists to analyze everything he's ever said and done to understand his thought processes and how to direct him in useful ways.

    You say !Superman can't be significantly influenced, but that's an impossibility. He has to get his information from somewhere in order to know whether or not his policies are being implemented, enforced, and carried out properly. However, when every single information source is geared towards manufacturing his and his subordinates opinions, he will be manipulated.

    Just think about yourself as a journalist in this world. Are you going to write anything that will make !Superman kill a fuck-ton of innocent people? Now imagine yourself as a statistician, a police officer, a politician, etc. The world will rapidly become a place where everyone thanks !Superman for fixing all of the problems everywhere as they grin through gritted teeth.

    To draw an analogy, the world would probably become much like China. Sure, there's all kinds of strict policies and the government issues stern punishments at times for basic things like speaking out against it. Unsurprisingly, nearly everyone says how much they like the government and trust the communist party. But then at the same time, nobody gives a fuck about the laws. Corruption and bribery is rampant, and practically everything from traffic laws to building codes merely earns a shrug as it gets ignored. It's an odd hybrid of totalitarianism and anarchy.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Some people try to bribe NotSuperman in a variety of ways. Good-looking women (and the occasional man) try to influence him. More subtle people try to control what information gets to him. More ruthless people take his aging mother hostage. Corporate types try outright bribery; some of whom try vast supplies of money, while others try to bribe him with their cooperation in one thing in exchange for his cooperation in another (some of these last might even be successful on occasion).

    Major governments might be following his orders, but they're also running covert, hidden programs to try to repeat the random accident that gave him his powers.

    Loud politicians are bemoaning the fact that he's not following *their* political ideals, and pointing to the death and devastation that he causes as a sign that his politics are evil. Voters who don't like losing what little power they have will tend to give lots of votes to governments that don't *like* him and make it clear that they would immediately stop following his policies if doing so didn't result in such swift and sure retaliation.

    Many people would try continually more and more convoluted ways to kill him, and it would be clear that most governments would immediately stop following his policies the instant he dies.. Some people would like him; some people (probably a good deal more) would claim that he's concentrating his efforts on helping those people over there first and it's not *fair* that he's not helping *us* first. Many people would notice their standard of living improve, but reach the conclusion that is is despite NotSuperman, not because of him (a narrative that their local politicians would push as hard as they could). People knowingly violating his policies would go to significant effort to hide it (and people living in such a place would go to even more effort to hide it, lest they get blown up).
    ```

  - u/MrCogmor:
    ```
    Depends very much on the particular not!Superman, how opinionated he is and how much respect he loses for other people.

    One possibility I see is that the superman largely avoids politics except to attack nations that perform human rights violations / break UN treaties.This would have an interesting effect on world politics. North Korea and various Arab countries are in for a rude awakening. UN peace-keeping becomes a lot easier. Once all nations are raised to a semi-civilised state then announce that all nations are to voluntarily decommission their heavy-weight military vehicles, missiles and nukes. They are also to cease production of new ones. If they don't comply then N!Superman will be unhappy and forcibly decommission the military equipment.

    Would also probably end up creating patches and modifications to prevent abuses in certain western democracies. Maybe have a go at instituting score runoff voting.
