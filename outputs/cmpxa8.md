  Even after 2 rereads of MoL these are quite entertaining.

  Is this official, or fan-made?

    I am a professional narrator on audible. I contacted the author and we discussed the production of a free podcast of me narrating Mother of Learning. He agreed and we have progressed from there.

      And after listening to the first ten chapters, I *really* appreciate your work, it's a really really good performance and an excellent new way to introduce the story to friends who don't often find the time or willingness to read but greatly enjoys podcasts.

          How much practice did you need to do to be able to enunciate clearly?
          ```

            I'm very lucky and naturally have a British BBC accent (hammered into me by my mother). Enunciation can be helped by speaking slowly. This has actually taken a few books worth of practice to get.

    Hahaha! I was trying to work out what you were talking about. Do you have an image you recommend?
    ```

      ```
      If you need something with the same dimensions, [this](https://i.imgur.com/TX724ZP.jpg) would do. Not super high quality, but at least related to the story.
