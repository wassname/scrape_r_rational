## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I know there are a few well-respected ratfic interpretations of the world of Pokemon here.

  Has anyone considered, though, a different treatment of Pokemon: a *xianxia* treatment?

  * Pokemon is a world where humans cannot cultivate†, but certain types of cute, fluffy little animals can.

  * The ability to cultivate is what makes these animals "Pokemon" rather than animals. Regular, non-cultivating animals also exist—people and Pokemon both canonically eat animals, but only rarely do either eat Pokemon.

  * A Pokemon's "evolution" is simply it moving through the traditional xianxia stages of cultivation (building its foundation, forming its core, etc.), and reshaping its body as it does so.

  * Pokemon—at least evolved Pokemon, but perhaps many non-evolved Pokemon as well—are as intelligent as humans. They cannot speak any human language, but they do *have* intelligible language (judging by some in-setting characters' abilities to interpret for them) which they use to communicate complex thoughts demonstrating a human-like awareness of the world. So they really are cultivating in the sense human cultivators do (i.e. honing their skills and their understanding of the universe.) They're not simply growing in size/power with age like xianxia *demon beasts*/*spirit beasts* do.

  * As in xianxia, the top cultivation stages are impossible to "stay in" all the time—thus mega-evolution, Z-moves, etc.

  * Rare Candies are literally 灵石 (spirit stones/crystals), consumed to increase one's cultivation.

  * Various rare materials must be internally refined to enter a new cultivation stage when following a certain Dao. For example, a Moon Stone.

  * Pokemon who consciously *consider themselves* cultivators in the "pass down traditional cultivation arts" + "*noblesse oblige* to protect the ordinary people of the world" sense, are called Fighting-type Pokemon. In the Pokemon setting, humans have learned various martial arts *from* these Pokemon, rather than the other way around. It is likely that Fighting-type Pokemon have a whole sect-based martial world going on somewhere.

  * Dark-type Pokemon are evil/demonic cultivators. They aren't inherently evil; rather, they are the same "type" as Fighting-type Pokemon, but they have learned a particular cultivation path—a particular Dao—on which they can only advance by committing evil acts. Those that choose to not do evil are abandoning their Dao, and will not grow stronger. There is a natural enmity between Fighting-type and Dark-type Pokemon, just as there is between orthodox and unorthodox cultivators.

  * Normal-type Pokemon are a lot like Fighting-type Pokemon in their physical make-up, but they don't have a society and traditions that allows them to share and pass down any fancy qi-manipulation arts. Really, "Fighting-type" should be called "Qi-type"; while "Normal-type" is more deserving to be called "Fighting-type", since regular body-practitioner skills is all they have going for them.

  The fun thing about this interpretation is what it suggests about what the job of a "Pokemon trainer" really is. You're not a human with pets who puts them through pit-fights. You're a literal coach+manager for self-motivated animal martial-artists, there to 1. feed them the resources and training they need to advance, and 2. act as matchmaker to schedule fights for them as often as possible. When you *don't* do these things, your Pokemon will get upset, and perhaps demand to be traded away to someone that *will*. Just like a professional athlete would, in the same situation.

  ---

  † Well, okay, the gym leaders of the Psychic-type and Fighting-type gyms often *seem* to be human cultivators, at least in the anime. Maybe there are lots of human cultivators, and they just don't come up much in the life of a Pokemon-obsessed 11-year-old protagonist.

    This is basically how I've described what an actual "rational sapient pokemon world" would look like, yeah. And I would love to read a good story like that, though I think it would very quickly break the traditional "fantasy" of pokemon for most traditional fans of the franchise.

  Probably my favorite thing about My Hero Academia is that Deku *earned* his quirk. Tons of shonens give their "ordinary" protagonists secret special powers that undermine their theme that anyone can be a hero if they believe in the power of friendship, hard work, love, blah blah blah. See: Naruto. (Started from the bottom now we here, except the bottom is winning the genetics and ancestry lottery.) Yeah, Deku has his own secret special power, but its not his because he's special or because of destiny, or whatever, but because of the choices he made and the choices All Might made.

  I really appreciate that; it's very meritocratic, compared to an often very aristocratic genre. What I'm wondering is, though, why is that so uncommon, even if you look in Western works aimed towards young boys and girls? Why is it so often that works give their protagonist some inherent specialness specifically because of who they're descended from? See: Harry Potter. I won't claim that *most* works are like that, but enough are that, in the context of our modern, republican societies that it weirds me out.

    I remember when I started watching MHA, and I was just disappointed when he got his quirk. I was hype for amateur batman/ironman, but he basically gets a powerup on a silver platter. Sure, in universe he worked for it sorta, but as a story it just seemed cheap for me.

      > I was hype for amateur batman/ironman, but he basically gets a powerup on a silver platter.

      The thing is, Batman/ironman have unspoken tinker and brute powers. No actual human could do what they do, and pretending as if one genius is capable of creating that much advanced technology cheapens the work of the scientists and engineers in the real world. So honestly, I actually prefer properly superpowered heroes, because at least they're honest about the dumb luck that brought them to where they were. That's life-- it's chance that decides your starting position, but it's you that decides what to do with it.

        >The thing is, Batman/ironman have unspoken tinker and brute powers

        So do humans in MHA. It doesn't avoid having these things, it just has them in addition to normal superpowers. When intangible man and blood boy can both fight as if they have super strength, despite **not having super strength**, then that's just as bad as if not worse than ironman and batman, since it's contradictory. Especially contradictory when, in universe, people without Quirks are said to be much less capable fighters. If blood boy can easily break through thick pieces of ice the way he does, without a strength quirk, why can't Jonny mcnoquirk? It's just sloppy.

        It doesn't make it a *bad* show, but it is something I dislike a lot. Your comment kinda treats MHA as if the above isn't true, so I guess here you go?

  So last week I went on my first date ever. I think it went pretty well, and we'll be having a second date once exams are over.

  I like her, and for whatever strange reason, she seems to like me, and honestly I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm kind of terrified I'm going to screw this up, so any general relationship advice would be much appreciated.

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Don't get too attached and be aware that dating usually gets easier as you get more experience, and your first time is rarely your best.

    If you're the kind of nerd that reads rational fic and asks for dating advice for reddit, there's a decent chance that you have the kind of brain that produces all sort of inventive, unconventional ideas in new situations. Now, what you want to do is take that creative, quirky part of your brain, and *ignore every single thing it tells you to do*. Do boring conventional things, like going to the cinema, eating in moderately classy restaurants, or hanging out in parks. Try to say inoffensive, generically pleasant things. Don't mention fanfiction or effective altruism or AI safety unless your dates goes there first.

    Over time, you'll figure out how to be creative and unconventional without coming off as an a maladjusted creep, but your second date *isn't the time for that*.

    Otherwise, talk about your common interests, your studies, or whatever conversation subject you think your date will be interested in. Be straightforward about your feelings, and don't think dating has to be an intricate of N-dimensional chess. Know what you want, ask her (delicately) what she wants, and try to find common ground.

    Read the first few pages of r/relationships to get a mental map of the big red flags to avoid. It won't teach you how to be popular, but it will give you a pretty good idea of what are the worst case scenarios.

    Congratulations! I'm happy to offer you some general tips.

    * Don't let your own flaws catch you by surprise. Get ahead of any possible mistakes by being completely self-conscious as possible at all times. That way you'll be as guarded as you can be against any potential screw-ups.

    * For related reasons, your date will really appreciate it if you do the same for her. A little bit of constructive criticism about her clothes, hair, and makeup go a long way!

    * Don't be completely negative! Be sure to pepper in some positive comments as well. Little things like "You're doing great, have you dated before?" and "You're on track for sex tonight" will ensure that she's doing her best to please you.

    * When kissing, lead with the tongue and go in deep. Kissing is all about tongue.

    * Wear a condom so you don't have to kill the flow to put one on after you both start getting naked. ;)

    * Remember, she's just as nervous as you are! Take the pressure off of her shoulders by looking at and even flirting with other girls. She'll be relieved to know that even if she doesn't impress you, you still have other options.

    * Use more tongue than you think you should even after reading the previous tip about it. Seriously. It's a lot of tongue.

    * Find out soon into the date what her favorite fanfictions are. If you share the same tastes, great! This can really move the date along. And if she has wrong opinions, at least you can end the date early.

    * Women are attracted to a man's natural smell. Don't bathe and don't use deodorant. When you get close to her, she won't be able to think about *anything* but the way you smell. ;)

    * Lube up your fingers before the date so you don't have to kill the flow when you both start getting naked. ;)

    Or if you're feeling intimidated and want to take things slowly, disregard the above, steal a few neat date ideas from the internet, wear something that looks decent on you (ask a female/gay/fashionable friend to confirm), and just try to be your best self during the date. If your best self is nervous and excited to be dating a cool girl, then that's totally okay! Though you do gotta relax a little eventually, can't be panic-sweating all night. ;)

    * A giraffe's tongue can stretch as much as 20 inches. She should feel like she is kissing a giraffe.

  Is [Goblin Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_Slayer) rational fiction? For those unfamiliar with the work, it is a Light novel/Manga/Anime; I am thus far only familiar with the Anime and my discussion mostly concerns that. The story revolves around the titular Goblin slayer, and his pursuit of slaying as many goblins as possible in the generic fantasy world that the characters inhabit.

  &#x200B;

  Why is it rational fiction? Well, the sidebar lists 5 features of ratfics, so I'll try and go through them one by one.

  &#x200B;

  >Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

  &#x200B;

  I wanted to address this first. Goblin Slayer takes place in a near approximation of a video game world, with an adventurers guild, quests and ranks, though it is not an explicit video game. Many rational/ist fics take place in deconstructions of such environments and GS is not much different. Essentially, GS asks the question of what would happen if the Lvl 1 enemies of a video game were real. How would a world deal with massive numbers of weak enemies? A video game never really stops to consider what might happen to the village once the hero moves away, and this is essentially what GS looks at.  Against undefended villages and naive adventurers the goblins are shown to be an extreme menace, for despite their individual weakness, in large numbers they are highly dangerous, and will raid, murder and rape their way accross any humans they find.

  &#x200B;

  This forms the central driving point of the plot, though it is also one of the main weaknesses as far as GS being a rational fiction is concerned. The story depends on the average character essentially considering goblins to be a non-entity, so easily dealt with as to be ignored. This allows them to raid and slaughter with impunity. Yet, if they were actually killing rookies and torching villages so often, they would surely be regarded as a much more dangerous threat and there would be many, many Goblin Slayers seeking out and destroying the pests. 

  &#x200B;

  Nonetheless, the deconstruction still works, and there are other aspects which contribute to it being rational.

  &#x200B;

  >Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  &#x200B;

  This is the most obvious aspect. As a near video game world, there is an adventurers guild, and 'ranks' obtainable by stronger adventurers. The Goblin Slayer has one of the highest ranks possible and is regarded as an elite adventurer (if also a figure of fun due to his obsession with the 'weak' enemy). Despite this, the character is shown to actually be a fairly mediocre fighter, and anytime he comes across a physically superior enemy he is usally beaten in one on one combat. Sure, against the average goblin he will slay without trouble, but the likes of Goblin Champions, Goblin Lords and so forth are shown to provide a great challenge to the man.

  &#x200B;

  Invariably, Goblin Slayer triumphs not through force of arms but through intelligent strategy and tactics. Most of his goblin slaughters are not one man masssacres but the simple application of fire, or poison, or similar. Early in the series, a powerful troll is beaten when GS uses a 'gate spell' to open  a portal to the bottom of the ocean, and the water pressure that is released simply annihilates the troll in front of him. At the end of the current season, GS organizes the defence of a town, successfully deflecting a goblin attack with almost no casualties, and defeating the golbin lord by crushing him between two "Protection" barriers cast by the priest MC. 

  &#x200B;

  The Goblin Slayer is not a completely rational character, as he is shown being able to recover from what would otherwise be lethal injuries through sheer force of anger, or something, but it is a fantasy series so some absurdities are to be expected.

  &#x200B;

  >Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  &#x200B;

  This is less well done. The Goblin Slayer himself has a very clear and obvious reason for his genocidal ambitions against the goblins, but thus far the other 4 main characters are not so well defined (though the anime has had only 13 episodes thus far). The priest is not shown to have any real motivation. The Elf archer seems to want to have fun adventures? The dwarf and the Lizardman are both unexplored, thus far. I will give GS a pass on this for now, but perhaps any readers of the LN or Manga can comment if it improves in the future.

  &#x200B;

  Given the above, obviously whether or not an intellectual pay-off is reached is not going to be clear just yet. I can also state that aspiring rationalism is not part of the story. Otherwise, I think it qualifies quite well as a rational fic
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    > Is Goblin Slayer rational fiction? 

    Well, Goblin Slayer himself is definitely not a rationalist. A combat pragmatist, sure, but not a rationalist. Source: he is failing to accomplish his goal.

    His goal is "exterminate goblins", not "be killing goblins", yes? In this case, he goes about it in a laughably inefficient way: by actually going out with a sword and personally killing goblins one-by-one.

    As opposed to, say, swaying a powerful sorcerer to his side and getting access a WMD with which he could destroy dozens of goblin settlements a week. Or joining military and rising in ranks until he could personally send out troops on systematic extermination campaigns. Or becoming a politician and swaying the public's opinion, making them (and other adventures) more aware of the threat of goblins. Or fully focusing on determining the origin of goblins and destroying it.

    Instead of doing any of the things that would let him make *actual, tangible* progress towards eradicating goblins within his lifetime, he is "eradicating goblins" in ways so unproductive he'll barely make a dent in their population by the time he dies of old age (at least, unless plot gets involved; I haven't watched past episode 6).

    It almost makes me want to write *[Effective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) Goblin Slayer*, a rational fanfiction.

    ___

    Regarding your actual question: I think it's rationality-adjacent in that r/rational enjoys Combat Pragmatism trope and this work's premise is "fantasy combat pragmatist vs. goblins", but that's the extent of the show's rationality.
    ```

    - u/Timewinders:
      ```
      >His goal is "exterminate goblins", not "be killing goblins", yes? 

      I'm not sure this is actually the case. He's driven by a desire for revenge, and he seems to enjoy killing goblins. It probably wouldn't be as satisfying to him if he wasn't doing the killing personally. I believe he has considered teaching others how to kill goblins more effectively, but I think he is concerned that since goblins have a high capacity to learn and grow if they survive long enough, if he introduced his tactics on a wide scale and some adventurers used them inefficiently (i.e. not being 100% thorough in killing every single goblin in a horde) because he wasn't there to watch over them, then those tactics would no longer be effective.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        > I'm not sure this is actually the case

        He stated this in one of the earlier episodes, if I recall correctly. Someone implied that he would be unhappy if goblins were gone, because he would be out of a job, and he replied that no, he would prefer if they didn't exist. It's definitely what he *intellectually* believes in.

        True, he is driven by revenge, and killing goblins personally may be emotionally satisfying to him, much more satisfying than winning arguments with politicians would be. But part of being a competent, rational person is being able to master your emotions when they get in the way of doing what you honestly wish to do.

        Besides, the struggle between doing something which *makes you feel* like you're doing good, and *actually* making a lasting positive impact on the world, even though the process doesn't feel as enjoyable — wouldn't it make for an interesting story?

        >I believe he has considered teaching others how to kill goblins more effectively, but I think he is concerned that since goblins have a high capacity to learn and grow if they survive long enough, if he introduced his tactics on a wide scale and some adventurers used them inefficiently (i.e. not being 100% thorough in killing every single goblin in a horde) because he wasn't there to watch over them, then those tactics would no longer be effective

        That seems self-defeating. By that logic, he shouldn't do anything either lest he misses a goblin at some point and ends up teaching them something. By that logic, there could be no improvement over the present situation whatsoever.
        ```

    - u/sohois:
      ```
      A fair point, though it does depend on the assumptions that these paths actually exist in the GS world. Though the generic fantasy setting does include "chosen heroes" and "ultimate evils", there is nothing to suggest that magic users have access to massive destructive power, or in general that Goblin Slayer could dramatically increase his lethality beyond his preferred methods of poison and fire.

      And powerful, organized militaries or influential politicians are both things that might not be found in a feudal fantasy world. It's safe to assume a mostly monarchical system is present, which would probably form a large barrier to amassing political influence or military independence.

      Not to mention that not every effective altruist will be best served by earning to give. There are always going to be those of average ability who simply cannot rise to high levels of income, and so more traditional altruist routes such as working for a charity can still be the best place for them. Similarly, Goblin Slayer might well be badly unsuited for a political or military position, and so his current application is the most effective that he can achieve.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Fair points regarding feudal fantasy and average ability. I fear the setting isn't consistent enough to support any serious political discussion, though.

        > there is nothing to suggest that magic users have access to massive destructive power

        What about that ocean-portal exploit? Pretty destructive. If this is something the protagonist got for a favour, imagine what kinds of weapons he could have acquired if he convinced the mage in question to fully support him.

        >Similarly, Goblin Slayer might well be badly unsuited for a political or military position, and so his current application is the most effective that he can achieve

        He seems to be very good at tactics and munchkinry. Off the top of my head, the most obvious path to power for him is: start going after more dangerous/"prestigious" threats, meet other powerful adventures, impress them with your skills, make friends/form teams. Use acquired money and influence to improve gear/abilities, take down ever-more dangerous threats; hit recursive improvement. Once your team is sufficiently powerful/large/tight-knit, ensure that they're spending at least a fraction of their capital/time on eradicating goblins.

        This has to be better than what he is actually doing.

  Hey, everyone! Do any of you play DnD?

  I've never had a chance to play before, but a few days ago I have discovered online communities that play DnD over discord, played a few games and it was **amazing**, the most fun I've had in a long time. It works super well, people are helpful and friendly, and it's ridiculously awesome.

  I'd guess that playing with rationalists would take it to a whole another level, can you imagine rationalist DnD game focused on logically extrapolating rules of the world and finding creative solutions to problems?

  I'm super new to this, but I really can't get enough of DnD. Do any of you want to play? Do any of you DM?

  I want to get to know more people who are into this, my handle is `lumen#7925`, feel free to friend/message me!

  Turns out there's a thing called "one-shot" games, where instead of running a long campaign you get to play one self-contained episode that lasts 2-5 hours. That requires way less scheduling and time commitment than a long-running campaign (think a short story instead of a tv show). The best servers I could find are [D&D Friends](https://discord.gg/vPFH5sQ) and [The Drakaise Battalion](https://discord.gg/Qw7u4jY), they sometimes run 4-5 games per day!

  Also if you guys will be interested, we could make a rationalist DnD discord server, just for funzies.

    The subreddit has a discord, [here](https://discord.gg/5sutD3W), which has a #looking_for_group channel. We spawn new channels for people who want to use it for roleplaying games. (If you want to advertise, I would do it in #general first though, then coordinate in #looking_for_group, and also get people from here.)

    ----

    I've been playing D&D (and other systems) for a little more than twenty years now, with the majority of that time as DM. I like it a lot, but I find it difficult to run a game as DM and actively work on writing a project at the same time, because I'm switching creative effort between the two of them, and they're both heavy on the time investment.
