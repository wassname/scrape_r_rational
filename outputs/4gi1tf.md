  Yugi's making some weird assumptions here.

  When things go dark and cold and still, what makes him think he's been "taken" anywhere?

  So Pegasus is all, "I want to duel you right now and I'm willing to pause reality with crazy voodoo magic to make it happen! I'll undo it *when we're done!*" Okay, sure, that's an alarming and frightening show of power... but it's not exactly a direct threat. Why is Yugi taking it as one? Did I miss some reason I shouldn't take Pegasus at his word?

  Why does Yugi think Pegasus can read his mind? What, just because he guessed one card and bluffed? Maybe he just *looked*. Which, I'm relatively sure, is cheating and grounds for disqualification - Yugi wins again without even playing.

  Okay, whatever, Yugi has to play with his cards showing because reasons, and he has to seriously try to win because more reasons. Isn't a stall-for-Exodia deck almost ideal for that? He just has to not lose *too* badly with the handicap until the heart of the cards comes through, and that's exactly what the deck was built for. Is the game *that* reliant on hidden information, that no possible strategy can even draw out a loss otherwise? Honest qustion. I don't know. But that's not what I would naively suspect.

  On a more literary level, what kind of person cries out in a panic, "Everything's grown dark and cold and the others aren't moving!" Pegasus knows, dude, he's there with you. Who are you narrating for? The actual narrator should be handling that.

  HAH! Fantastic. The show callout battle start was awesome. The online help part was a neat idea and other victims stepping up was in character for story antagonist. But if Sogekoge(whatever his complex name is) was an ex duelist, shouldn't he have some money and or social pull to make the whole situation go away? Either way please write more. I am not sure how to incetivise you to keep writing this, so name some things/wants you think I could help with.

  To specify, I am offering you a certain amount of favor/help, if said help will make you write more of this specific storyline. I may not have much, but I can try.

    I was thinking of making the explanation for that involve Yugi's conspicuously absent parents...

    I have an unfortunate history of failing to finish novels that I've started. I get too serious about them and try too hard to make them perfect and then they become work and no longer fun any more.

    For this story, I've decided that the most important thing is the rule of fun, and everything else is second to that.

    I'm thinking if I get stuck, or start going in circles with something, or things start to become less fun or no fun, I'll ask you for help and you can help me work through it. Sound good?

  Curious as to where this goes. One thing though, Yami would never just give up like that. IF you think about it logically, mind-reading isn't totally unbeatable in Duel Monsters. It's still possible to outplay your opponent even if they know everything you'll do. A trash deck won't win against a top tier one, even if you play with your entire hand revealed.

  It is kind of neat that Yugi already realizes that he's as strong as Yami.

    And what are the chances that Pegasus is playing a trash deck? He's the CEO of Industrial Illusions, the company that *makes* the game.

    I've been thinking that in this story, while money would have an unfortunate impact on the balance of the game, I've decided that the amount of skill level required would be more similar to that of Magic: the Gathering than of the real life Yugioh trading card game. In other words, while skill is not as important as card access to game outcomes in the competitive scene, skill is still fairly important. Someone using a cheap deck in this story is almost always going to lose when they're facing against an expensive deck, unless the expensive deck was poorly built, or unless the cheap deck is some weird rogue deck that will only work in the competitive metagame once.


    This is how I see MtG and Yugioh.

    In real life MtG:
    Quality of deck design>card access($)>skill and luck

    In real life Yugioh:
    Card access($)>quality of deck design>luck>skill.

    I would argue that if your opponent knows everything that you will do in advance, and you still win, it probably wasn't because you played better than them, but because you had a better deck or better card access.

    The therapy helps with that.
