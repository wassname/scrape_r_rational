  I cannot believe this updated! I was so worried that it was dead!

    Unfortunately, it looks like it won't be alive for much longer.

    And while I'd certainly prefer it get a satisfying ending while it's still going strong, rather than petering out into nothingness, it still felt to me like a story that had a lot more to say, and it's sad that it won't get to say it.

      Yeah, I'll really miss this one.
