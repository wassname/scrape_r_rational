## [HSF] The Slows - This story deals with the clash of value systems, the difficulty of seeing those with a different value system as rational, and the idea of humanity developing in ways that seem bizarre/grotesque/evil to us.

  I do not see how this could be a development that could be considered grotesque/evil. Bizarre, yes, though it would most likely not be by the time such a concept would have been developed. I understand the fact that some people would find having a child growing/maturing extremely fast abhorrent, but there should be much less people who would do so at that point in time.

    Do notice that it is implied that the procedure dulls emotions. The narrator finds it distasteful how the Slows "twist their faces wildly". and believes their rational thought is diluted by their "emotional exaggeration". A.O.G. evidently also removes "the swollen protrusions on [Slow women's] chests", which plenty of people of all genders might object to. If there's anything to be read into the black and green makeup the Slow wore in the narrator's honor, it might do pretty bad things to your complexion too.

      I don't believe I noticed some of those points. That would explain the reactions to the process.

    When it comes to values, it's sometimes really hard to understand other people's and cultures' point of view. There are people in today's world who think it's evil that homosexuality is allowed and women are free to choose whom they have sex with. It's far easier to understand why people would cling to the traditional way of raising kids because usually people cling to traditions even in far more controversial subjects.

    >I understand the fact that some people would find having a child growing/maturing extremely fast abhorrent, but there should be much less people who would do so at that point in time.

    When it comes to new developments, it's always possible to see similar numbers of people opposing those developments. I don't think it's that implausible.

    And yeah, I'm not yet sure if I'm ever going to be a parent, but something about slowly raising a child seems really fun. Seeing a few kilos of pooping and crying meat *really slowly* becoming one of the most effective general-purpose machines on Earth sounds kinda interesting.

    Incremental progress is really cool. If you've ever played [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) you would understand.

  Ooh, that was a fun read. I've always enjoyed the "describe something humans generally consider positive/neutral in a convincingly revolting way" thing.

  Also, I think /r/childfree would enjoy this. You should submit it there. (I will if you'd rather not, but I don't want to take your credit.)

    Only to troll them! The narrator says: "Whereas even I—who have spent years away from civilization in barren camps like this one—have managed to produce seventeen sons and daughters and a lineage of at least forty generations."

      I realize the author's intent wasn't to promote a childfree lifestyle, but I felt some of the community would relate to a narrator who doesn't find infants inherently valuable and is disconcerted by how much they take over the parents' lives.
