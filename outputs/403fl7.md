  The story begins [here](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/300693/1/shears/bridges-1).

  Basic info is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3te0fy/rtff_shears_chapter_1_rmlp/cx5d65r).

  This chapter was extremely tricky to write, but I'm very satisfied with how it turned out. However, I'm wary of the classic trap of an artist finding their work to be more transparent than it is to someone without their privy knowledge. The chapter is intended to be disorientingâ€”but please tell me if you feel it's too much so.

  Comments are greatly appreciated; Shears is considerably more popular in terms of views, ratings, and favorite selections than it is in terms of actual discussion. As always, thanks for reading!

    Nah, pretty transparent, though this one has the first event I don't see happening to me with the right lack of knowledge. (In the last chapter, I was surprised when she realized that she ought to pretend she had a preference.)

  This is a
  really

  good story.
  Nothing further to report.

  Well, one thing, actually. The story hasn't hit on its main themes yet, which makes fanart difficult. Any change you could give me a hint?

  Feedback: The pacing is very slow, I am concerned that perhaps the author is scared of starting the actual story. (Sorry Calamitizer.)
