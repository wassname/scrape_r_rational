## How different is Pith from the standard Grimdark story?

### Post:

I just read the first few chapters of Pith and was immediately reminded of Worm, both in a positive and negative way.

My question is, do the characters ever reach their goal or does the story go beyond the   „ and then it gets worse“ story style that most Grimdark style stories have?

I don’t mind a darker story, but if the protagonists in the story always lose or it always gets worse for them, then that’s equally as boring as a story where the good guys always win.

  I'd say that things always get difficult for them, but usually in a new way each time. I felt it was grim but not grim dark because the characters do grow and learn from their mistakes. I think that it is less grimdark than Worm was, but I also do not know your personal tastes regarding this

  I feel like the protagonists don't get the full win in the first book of Pith but they do get a victory. It's like one step backward, two forward kind of deal

  I don't think it's Grimdark. The world isn't that bad, but society is in a bad place, kinda like how it is after major crisis and wars.

    > The world isn't that bad

    IDK I feel like the inherent nature of power in the setting makes the world pretty awful. Maybe it could be stable in theory, but just thinking about it makes me vaguely anxious lol.

  It doesn't get much better from the part you left off at (boat party). I dropped worm and I ended up dropping pith too. The problem I have with both of them is that the heroes progress extremely slowly, and keep getting into fights they barely manage to survive. 

  For some I'm sure this is fine but after a while it got kind of depressing for me.

  Its definitely grim but its not like it completely lacks hope. None of the grimness felt undeserved given the setting to me. The resource restrictions, recent wars and concentration of power (magical or political); all create a world filled with both deep societal problems and personal trauma on a massive scale. Yet despite this you can still see that there exists good people and that characters are improving themselves on an individual scale. Maybe less so for the older characters, but another big theme of Pith is the long lasting effects of war on people. Personally i think it does a brilliant job of contrasting the standard fantasy school trope of sending kids into conflict and expecting them to come out of it better humans than they went in.

  To summarise, most of everything is messed up - as it should be given the background - but there's still good people in the world, who can hopefully enact positive change.

  That said i'd say its worse than worm in terms of depressing content.

  It's a dark story, but I think a key thing that differentiates it from Worm is that Pith doesn't escalate by pulling new threats out of nowhere. There's no Endbringer or S9 equivalent where something comes entirely out of left field to make things worse for everyone. Not to say that things never get worse, but all the key players and pieces are generally visible (to some degree) from the outset, so it's usually not a big surprise when the situation deteriorates.

  That's true of the first volume anyway, the second volume seems to be throwing in some mystery elements and cryptic threats so I don't know where things are going there.

  I haven't read worm, so I can't compare the two. I assume that the protagonists will win in the end or at the end of each book. However, it's a faint light at the end of a long dark tunnel.

  I found the first book of pith to be a real slog to get through. So much misery. And not just the protagonists. Every villain and side character also gets horribly traumatized along the way. There are multiple chapters in a concentration camp, for example, as backstory. Fun stuff.

    When does the first book end? I read until the end of the boat party, and until now it’s just  excessively miserable and dumb  „ then it gets worse“ stuff. 

    Like, really Spoiler >!He has to help his first friend, who helped him and had a really positive outlook to live „it can always get better“ person , commit suicide because they get the joy of live removed from their soul !<

      There's definitely a lot of tragedy. It's not grim for the sake of being grim, but it's grim. I think it does a lot for the stakes, personally.
      ```

      IIRC that's honestly one of the darkest points in the whole book
      ```

    - u/sunshine_cata:
      ```
      That's maybe a fifth or fourth of the way through the first book. It continues with that same absurd level of suffering pretty much to the end. 

       It's too bad, because I did like the worldbuilding and setting.
      ```

      ```
      If you want to know if it gets worse, I'll spoil the *tone* without saying any spoilers for future plot elements: >!It indeed gets better and never got as dark as that arc as far as the story goes so far!<
      ```
