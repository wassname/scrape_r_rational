  Beginning to close in on the doorway to what my new book calls 'Act III'.  Yes, I've bought a book on plot and structure.  I'll mention the name of the book, and the author, but no linkies.  It's on Amazon.

  'Write Great Fiction - Plot and Structure'
  James Scott Bell

  I highly suggest it.  He avoids using strange literary terms, and uses plenty of examples of solid writing.

  He also gives a name to two classes of fiction that I now recognize that I have been struggling to differentiate.

  Commercial fiction vs. literary fiction.  Just understanding those two terms helped me understand what I was doing, a whole lot more.

    Good book.


    One thing I noticed: your tense tends to whiffle about.


    >I only wanted it on the west side of the road was because I was planning to own the land on the west side of the road.


    > Having a cistern close to the road could have allowed me to establish a little roadside market where carriages and wagons could water their animals, and people could buy seeds, produce, eggs, or perhaps even swine culls.


    >Somehow, I managed to put them in my own pouch and not throw them back at her before I turned away and stalked back into camp.
