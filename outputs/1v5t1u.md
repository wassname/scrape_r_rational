  Nose goes as to who writes the sequel in which a literal court of kangeroos reviews the Simba.v.Scar case to decide whether Simba was or was not justified in throwing Scar to the bloodthirsty crowds and effectively murdering him.

  The musical "Twisted" was [posted on this subreddit a while back](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1sk17l/recommendation_twisted_the_untold_story_of_a/). If you like this kind of story, I definitely second that recommendation. That is exactly in the same style.
