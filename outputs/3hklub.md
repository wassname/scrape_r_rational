  I just love the last few lines:

  >*I created this list in five minutes. Until I came into this meeting I didn't even know what Project Ground Effect was.*

  >*A human being?* Draw up an international treaty outlawing that tosh. God help us, there isn't a worse idea in the world. We just created a brand new superpower and you're talking about bestowing it on a *human being?*
  ```
