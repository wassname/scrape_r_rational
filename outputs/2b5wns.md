## [RT] Atlas Shrugged [BST] / [Q]

### Post:

I don't know if anyone's taken on a re-write of *Atlas Shrugged*, but I feel like it needs it. Part of me wants to write it, but I doubt my writing powers are up to the ask and I don't particularly want to re-read *Atlas Shrugged*. But if nobody else wants to give it a try, I suppose I'll have to.

The problems that came to mind when I read it were:

* the good industrialists live in a world that can support endless growth because the plot/her philosophy demands it
* Sputnik was launched the same year as the novel was published, but there's no mention of space travel
* John Galt's engine could effectively produce free, limitless energy and end scarcity, but he instead cripples industrial civilization

My mind keeps coming back to John Galt. He's supposed to be the smartest man in the world, but he's not more insightful or imaginative than Ayn Rand. I can accept rational!Galt still being largely an Objectivist. Maybe even a purified Objectivist, with all of Rand's personal biases, foibles, and stupidities stripped away. I can accept him not going out to optimize the world. canon!Galt was basically offered a dictatorship of the world if he would fix it, and he turned it down. Maybe his understanding of the human utility function means that post-scarcity humans would fail to achieve eudaimonia, and that is more valuable to him, though that could be just a side note to the equally real but more important reason of he just doesn't want to. But I can't accept that somebody that smart not taking into account any of my points without good reasons.

tl;dr - The characters need to be smarter than Rand. Any takers?

  Oh good. I thought you were recommending Atlas Shrugged as rationalist literature. I.. didn't know how to feel about that.

  With the caveats that I really like the book and her philosophy and have no intention of taking up your cast gauntlet and have been drinking:

  1. Limited growth potential is more of an imagination failure than the other way around.  The most valuable resource is *design information*, which has at least near-umlimited scaling.  There was just a recent article claiming that currently existing tech could feed another 3 billion people, on top of current population.  There are *amazing* advancements being made in indoor farming.  And if a society ever did hit some hard limit on growth in things humans consider valuable, well, this is only one tiny rock in a vast expanse of resources...  Honestly, the fetishizing of growth limits seems rather Ludditish, and Rand would certainly be harsher.  And if you're going to extend the objection far enough to bring up entropy, that's rather like calling out the guy who figured out how fire works for not knocking off biological immortality too.

  2.  The novel was written and edited over something like 9 years.  There are also no jets, and television only gets a little mention near the end.

  3.  That's a bit of an exaggeration.  It was dirt cheap, super efficient energy, but that is still a far cry from actual post scarcity.  An interesting take for a rational rewrite might be to devise a plausible-ish method to how it worked, and discuss the potential ramifications, sort of how wind power used on a vast enough scale could take enough kinetic energy out of the atmosphere to disrupt or shut down weather.  Rand only ever really explains that it somehow draws static electricity out of the air (iirc), which I assumed to be somehow related to a proof my Advanced E&M professor once showed demonstrating that the atmosphere was functionally a kind of giant capacitor.  (My apologies to anyone who actually completed their physics degree or superior autodictats if I'm misremembering, or horribly mangling.)

  >Maybe even a purified Objectivist, with all of Rand's personal biases, foibles, and stupidities stripped away.

  That could be interesting.  I've always wondered just how the amphetamine use affected her.  Making Galt seems less... statuesque is the only word that comes to mind... while keeping the ideas relatively hardline would be a difficult writing challenge.

  > Maybe his understanding of the human utility function means that post-scarcity humans would fail to achieve eudaimonia, and that is more valuable to him

  She valued eudamonia highly (so Galt would too), but the bigger issue is post-scarcity not being on the table, any more than moving from manual labor to combustion engines put it on the table.  Eudamonia would still be viable even post-scarcity, though.  The issue would be approaching your hobbies seriously, and actually making the effort to do your best.  As an example, the only issue Rand ever had with motherhood was people who had babies as an emotional dalliance.  She thought it should be approached with the same degree of seriousness and study as a difficult career.

  I fully expect any effort at this to be even more anvilicious than Rand, but maybe the above might be of use to someone who cares enough to try.

    1. [There are some fairly hard limits on energy consumption,](http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/07/galactic-scale-energy/) and consequently economic growth.

    2. Technologies like rockets and atomic power were both in science fiction magazines as early in the 1930s but weren't really things until shortly after *Atlas Shrugged* was published. I can't fault Rand for not including them, but John Galt had a degree in physics and it would be keeping in his character to know about them.

    3. From what I've read, Galt's motor uses the Casimir effect in a sort of handwavy zero-point energy way. Thinking about it, you're right: automation technologies of the 1950s weren't enough to couple with the energy-crisis-averting motor to achieve post-scarcity. Maybe today, or in the next ten years, but that's neither here nor there.

    >  Making Galt seems less... statuesque is the only word that comes to mind... while keeping the ideas relatively hardline would be a difficult writing challenge.

    I feel like [this fic](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9514187/1/Breaking-Point) gives him a more humanizing alternate character interpretation.

      There's a difference between growth in energy use, and economic growth.  But if we're going to hit some maximal limit of energy use in the universe, well, I'd rather humanity get there to have that 5th world problem than stagnate into agri-feudal bucolic fantasies on this measly rock.  If you're going to tackle that in an AS re-write, I don't see any meaningful resolution aside from a brief "One more reason to make sure to teach our children to value physics, as if we needed any."

        Earth could hit that energy limit without space travel in about 400 years, which is why I think at least a discussion of space travel is needed. Energy consumption also ties into all the mistakes people were making in the 1950s*. They burned coal while a small handful people warned about the greenhouse effect and the need to switch to solar decades prior. They burned oil, a diminishing resource capable of being turned into all sorts of useful plastics. 

        By the way, did you read the linked fanfic, and if so, what were your thoughts?

        *I see AS set not in the future, but in an alternate 1957. Technology has too far advanced and Communism has too far retreated for it to be a plausible dystopic future.

  This is entirely off topic, but I'm going to it here anyway. I feel like it has the right mythic resonance.

  How does this sound for constraints?

  1) John Galt is still:
  a) A mysterious, underground figure, somehow known to all but only by name;
  b) A man who has dropped out of mainstream society to create his own, better version;
  c) Dedicated to winning others over solely through reasoning and demonstration of the fruits of his improved society--and still big on the long speeches
  d) Unfailingly adherent to his own moral code

  2) John Galt is no longer:
  a) A possessor of any Informed Traits/Abilities--any feat he works must be demonstrated/explained to the reader
  b) A two-dimensional character--his emotions and psychology must be realistically written

  3) The Strikers are still:
  a) Composed of talented individuals from every walk of life
  b) Centered around Objectivist tenants

  4) The Antagonists/other characters are still:
  a) Opposed to Objectivist tenants at the story's outset
  b) The majority

  5) The Antagonists/other characters are no longer:
  a) Strawmen
  b) Unrepentant
  c) Only antagonists or heroes; there are people in between the extremes.

  6) The plot still includes:
  a) The gradual abdication of society by its most talented members
  b) The resistance of one such member to said abdication
  c) The attempt of all the heroes to fix society
  d) The eventual success of this mission
  e) The Speech.

  7) The plot no longer includes:
  a) Anything that would not realistically result in those elements happening and working.

  Atlas Shrugged gets a lot of excessive flak because it isn't viewed in time it was presented. Rand IIRC, despite her flaws, was a refuge from communism alarmed at seeing it's potential to spread to the refuge she's found.  I've skimmed some good critiques of the utility of capitalism, but to paraphrase Churchill it's the least worst system so far. 

  That said this is an interesting project but one I'll have to look at again in about 3-4 years.
