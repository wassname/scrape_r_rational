  Thanks everyone for your comments - I'm glad you liked Weaver Nine! I probably won't be able to update often, but I'll see if I can manage to make an update once in a while.

  Also, to answer your comments:

  - Eliezer was pretty justified in guessing that it was complete - the fic was at a fairly good place for a stopping point (albeit a bit abrupt). That said, I personally don't have a preference for fics that are 'complete' vs 'incomplete'. Real life doesn't always have clear-cut endings, and if you write an interesting setting, there will always be more interesting stories to tell. So I'm not sure that I'll ever declare the fic to be officially 'completed'.

  - Thanks for your feedback about the fic in this and the previous thread, both the positive and the negative. You make a good point about the pace of the Leviathan fight. The fic isn't written in a way that makes it easy to do a perfect fix, but I have a few tricks in mind that should help me fix this a bit for a polished final version of the fic. I've been posting the edited/improved version on [FanFiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898446/1/Weaver-Nine) and [Archive of Our Own](http://archiveofourown.org/works/2776352/) chapter by chapter.

    My main problem with incomplete things is trying to figure out what's going on when it updates. Reading Weaver Nine, Tale of Transmigration, Security, and the Worm Time Loops means if I just read the latest chapter(s), I'll probably miss things due to not remembering which events happened in which universe.

    I think part of the problem was I read it too fast because I was procrastinating pretty hard. I did like it a lot overall.

  It's a Christmas Miracle!

  yes yes yes THIS IS EXCITING. I read it under the impression that it was finished, and so was kind of bummed when there wasn't a proper end.

  ```
  This... looks really good. Dammit. I did **not** need a new thing to read just now! *shakes fist*
  ```

    It is. One of my favorite Worm Fics, it really captures the spirit of the original story and characters, without feeling samey.

    Also, It has the best Leviathan Fight I've ever read.

      I actually thought the Leviathan fight was the worst part!

      I thought the rest of the fic was fantastic, then Leviathan just went on forever without really letting the interesting parts of the fic (Jack being manipulative, Weaver being terrifying and well-organized, various people being in the wrong place) make an appearance.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It was a genuinely enjoyable Endbringer fight, when I usually hold that pretty much every Endbringer fight in canon was just kind of boring.
      ```

  Awesome! I just caught up a few weeks ago. I liked it a lot. The Leviathan fight was great but it was a little too exhausting to read. There was an Extra Credits about this sort of thing for games / movies (I'd definitely recommend it but I'm too lazy at the moment to look up the link): if there are small drama breaks, like when Skitter does some medical duty in the canon Leviathan fight or when she meets with the lazer dude in the Behemoth fight then it works much better that way for the pacing. There was one but it could have done with another brief interlude about what was happening at the hospital, for example.

  I like Mouse Protector. She's cheesy (hehe).
