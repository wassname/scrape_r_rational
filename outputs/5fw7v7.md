    On the other hand, wouldn't it be even worse the week *after* finals? Y'know, for people who haven't got their marks back and are terrified they didn't pass? Or a month after finals, for people who failed?

  Is a paragraph missing or did I miss something? Blue doesn't say anywhere that he's planning on keeping an Abra yet that's what the other two react to.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Woops! Sorry, don't know how that happened.  Here's the missing part:

    >His hands move out among his collected pokeballs, straightening each one into a uniform pattern, enjoying the sight of all of them. It's a bit hard to believe how many he got.  Hearing the other two talk about their struggles to catch the awake abra showed how being Dark has its advantages, but now that the catching is over and he listens to the other two discuss how they'll train their abra, all the great uses they'll have for them, Blue feels the warm glow of contentment fading away. He always wanted an abra when he was younger. The idea of being able to teleport, or share the thoughts of one of his pokemon, always seemed so cool. The deepest bond you could share with one of your own pokemon.

    >But he'll never have that, no matter how many abra he catches. 

    >Blue's jaw sets as he picks one of his abra's balls up. "I'm going to keep one too," he says, interrupting their discussion.
    ```

    That also confused me and made me reread that passage just to see if I missed anything.

  - u/KnickersInAKnit:

    Same, very confused about this. Blue says to Leaf: 'Your pokemon, your rules' and they somehow interpret this as him deciding to keep psychic Pokemon.

  I didn't think things would go nearly that well when I saw the title.  Also, Red should probably see a psychic as soon as he can about the whole partition breaking thing.

  I do like how you portrayed Red's newfound heightened sensitivity to psychic minds. I especially look forward to when he progresses to the point where he can sense non-psychic minds as well, even if it will probably start with basic empathy instead of telepathy.

   It will be incredibly interesting to read a rational story where the main character can actually sense what is going wrong in peoples heads when they behave irrationally :)

  Also, a question; would it be a good idea for Red to bring the Abra he keeps to one of his sessions with the psychic lady whose name I forgot, so that she could actually see how his mind looks/feels when the partition is down? I feel like that could give her, or any kind of clinical psychic, relevant information when it comes to fixing the problem.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Technically what the abra does to his partition is just a stronger form of what any psychic does, and shows what they can do to his partition if they're not careful. But his experience here will definitely help with dealing with it :)

  Hey everyone, welcome back! No major news this month: I'm still working on adding stuff to the blog on my site, and those of you listening to my podcast should be aware that the next episode might not be up this weekend, thanks to a sudden change of plans for the remainder of the week. Sorry about that, but hopefully I'll be able to get it uploaded anyway.

  Hope you're all enjoying Sun and Moon, and as usual, all feedback welcome!

  Well, I guess accumulating way more money than they need *would* be pretty much in line with what happens in the games :D.

  Say, with all of these Pokemon being psychic, would it be possible in theory for all of them to link minds and be directable more or less as one unit? If so, forget keeping *one* Abra, keep half a dozen of them and train them into a squad. Couldn't use it in trainer battles, of course, but they could really go to town on anything you want to catch.

  In theory I suppose any group of Pokemon could be given a single verbal command, but I'd think psychics would have notable advantages in that kind of thing. You can more easily communicate an *intent* to all of them at once; they won't get in each other's way as physical attackers might; they might even be able to reinforce each other.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Oof, that might work for exeggcute for reasons that were never really explained in the games or anime, but if every psychic was capable of linking up mentally, I'm pretty sure humanity would be screwwwed XD
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      OK. So they can't function as a hive mind. The limitation, then, is How many minds can you transmit to at more or less the same time?

      Also I didn't think the Exeggcute actually joined together into any kind of hive mind, they just *attacked* each other mentally and all went crazy.

      EDIT: More importantly, how many subordinate psychics could *Mewtwo* simultaneously control? Force multiplier!
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        It generally works like a concentration of focus. You can commit most of your psychic attention to one mind, some of it to a couple, and a tiny amount to a few.

    D'aw shucks, thanks! In my view HPMOR does a better job with a lot of the concepts, but hopefully I've branched out enough to contribute my own share to the sanity-waterline-raising effort :)

    And I've been thinking "What Would Andrew Wiggin Do?" since I was in middle school,  if I could inspire anyone else to have a similar thought about one of my characters, that would be both humbling and awesome ^ _^

      I feel like your story does a better job working in the explained concepts more organically. I think it's a result of the multiple protagonists and how you allow others to also have a ton of wisdom to share.

  Just discovered your series last night and I'm completely blown away by the concept and quality. Realism, consistency, and the scientific method in the Pokemon world?

  Sign me the *fuck* up.

  How often do you usually upload chapters - around every 2 months or so? I couldn't see the submission dates on each individual chapter.
  ****
  A few general thoughts, questions and critiques:

  1. I'm a little surprised and intrigued by your decision to make all Pokemon only as intelligent as a typical animal. Making Alakazam, the creature that *"has a thorough memory of everything that has occurred in the world"* and whose brain *"can outperform a super-computer"* able to... "solve puzzles with the capability of a three-year-old" just seems insulting! There are already non-fantastical animals in real life, like apes, dolphins, some corvids, and arguably octopuses as well that can outperform ten-year-olds in complex tasks. Keeping pokemon a little more intelligent would, in my opinion, only make the moral implications of using these creatures as tools and storing them in stasis even more interesting in a fleshed-out world like yours.

  1. My biggest petty gripe is with the occasional non-subtle real-world references, especially to characters or people that are still living. Nothing takes me faster out of my suspension of disbelief in a fictional world than seeing "Professor Dawkins" or "Renekton". The entire Bill and the AI sideplot was unique, but not really my cup of tea when I'd like to learn more about this fictional world and its characters rather than contemporary issues that seem sort of wedged into the plot.

  3. Do you, the writer, dislike bug pokemon (or real-life insects), or is it only a characteristic of Red? I ask because there seem to be many hints here.
   - Wild Scyther killed Red's father and all his pokemon
   - Red is unnerved by his spinarak beyond the Night Shade incident
   - The "Insect Plate" in the Arceus cartoon is one of the evil forces, despite insects generally being depicted as courageous superheroes in Japanese culture
   - Red refuses to use a captured Beedrill
   - Red seems to have a general aversion to bug-like pokemon or creatures with chitinous bodies
   - Red blames the "stupid insects" Paras for killing his Rattata, but no similar insult was directed towards the Pikachu that fried his Noctowl

  4. Are Blue, Red, and Leaf in some way meant to evoke Peter, Ender, and Valentine?


  That's all I have off the top of my head but I'd love to discuss the series more if you're not busy with real life issues or writing.

    Hey there, thanks for commenting! Glad you've enjoyed it so much. I post once a month, at the start of each month.

    >I'm a little surprised and intrigued by your decision to make all Pokemon only as intelligent as a typical animal. Making Alakazam, the creature that "has a thorough memory of everything that has occurred in the world" and whose brain "can outperform a super-computer" able to...

Keeping pokemon a little more intelligent would, in my opinion, only make the moral implications of using these creatures as tools and storing them in stasis even more interesting in a fleshed-out world like yours.

    The pokedex is full of crazy and ridiculously impossible stuff, so I pretty much chuck a lot of it out the window.  If Alakazam were as smart as they're said to be, I think the pokemon world would look very different.

    But as for why the 3 years old comparison... that's actually as smart as chimps are, in terms of complex tasks and problem solving. I'm not sure what you mean by animals outperforming 10-year-olds... do you have any research papers you can point me to?

    >My biggest petty gripe is with the occasional non-subtle real-world references, especially to characters or people that are still living. Nothing takes me faster out of my suspension of disbelief in a fictional world than seeing "Professor Dawkins" or "Renekton". The entire Bill and the AI sideplot was unique, but not really my cup of tea when I'd like to learn more about this fictional world and its characters rather than contemporary issues that seem sort of wedged into the plot.

    References like Renekton mostly just come from me being *really* bad at coming up with names in my stories, so I do apologize for that, but as for the references to the real world, a lot of it has to do with the idea of teaching "real world science."  If I want to reference research done by someone, I don't want to make up some scientist who did the Skinner Box experiments: I'd rather just have Skinner exist in the pokemon world and do them.  I get that this can be immersion-breaking for people who live in our present time and react to seeing modern day, living people referenced in a fanfiction, but in the future, when people like Dawkins and others are dead, there's really no reason to distinguish between real-world scientists who are referenced.

    >Do you, the writer, dislike bug pokemon (or real-life insects), or is it only a characteristic of Red? I ask because there seem to be many hints here.

    It's a characteristic of Red :) I'm pretty neutral on insects, but I liked the idea of Red (being a psychic) to actually be afraid of Bugs even before he found out he was Psychic. I didn't really consider the idea that in Japanese culture insects are considered brave heroes though, so thanks for pointing that out: I may go back and swap that Plate. But in general a lot of Bug pokemon tend to be very sinister looking, so I figured it worked that way.

    >Are Blue, Red, and Leaf in some way meant to evoke Peter, Ender, and Valentine?

    I was heavily influenced by the Ender saga ever since I read it at the age of 14ish, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if there was some subtle or subconscious connection.

    I'm always happy to chat about the story, though responses might sometimes be slow if I've got other stuff going on. I normally don't plug my patreon, but since you're new to the story I thought I'd mention that the $5 reward is a monthly skype chat, so if you do decide to contribute that's one of the best ways to regularly discuss any thoughts on the story you might have.

    And finally if you don't mind my asking, how did you come across the story? Are you a regular on /r/rational, or did you find it through fanfiction?

    In any case, thanks for reading, and looking forward to more questions/feedback for future chapters!

      >The pokedex is full of crazy and ridiculously impossible stuff, so I pretty much chuck a lot of it out the window.

      That's fair enough, and it is your world, after all. Stuff like Slugma being 18,000 degrees F, multiple pokemon running faster than the speed of sound, Alakazam having an IQ of 5,000 - these are just ridiculous and prime sources for the "Pokedex entries are written by children" meme.

      If it were up to me, I'd probably have the baseline wild Pokemon intelligence be around the level of a border collie, less so for first or second evolutionary stages, but their intellect could increase greatly with training. Special attackers in general would be a little more intelligent across the board, and psychic pokemon would have the highest average intelligence of all.


      The way I look at it, in most Pokemon games the wild creatures cap out around level 55, yet the actual cap is level 100. Even a fully evolved creature caught on the Victory Road is just at 50% of its ultimate potential. Many pokemon undergo huge physical changes over their "evolutionary" development and even afterwards as they "level up", and I see no reason why increased mental prowess can't accompany these processes. An average fully-trained pokemon might be at the level of a typical ten-year-old child, similar to the anime - able to understand human speech, possess a typical range of complex emotions and perform a variety of different strategies - but basic algebra would probably be beyond all the non-psychic types.

      In my headcanon, many of the ethical issues surrounding Pokemon also stem from this quality. Sure, a wild Fearow may seem like a normal game animal to be hunted and eaten, but if almost every Pokemon has the *potential* to become far more intelligent, shouldn't eating Pokemon be outlawed entirely? 

      Do Pokemon have a right to be trained, and thus become smarter and stronger? Should deliberately keeping your companion "underleveled" by coddling it (I just want a pond full of beautiful Magikarp - I don't want to be responsible for multiple Gyarados! / A Liepard is big enough to harm me if it wanted! I'll keep my Purrloin just the way it is) be considered morally wrong, as it stunts the creature's capacity to develop?

      >I'm not sure what you mean by animals outperforming 10-year-olds comes from... do you have any research papers you can point me to?

      I think overall, a ten-year-old human is objectively more intelligent than any of the animals I mentioned. In addition, it's very difficult to get a true metric of comparison to humans by age. Still, there are several papers with points like "this animal mastered a concept that most 8-year-olds struggle with", though they may not be of sufficient scope or sample size to convince you. Here are the best examples I could find, if not all direct comparisons to humans, than of situations where the animals demonstrated capability beyond what was expected.

      Fair enough. It's definitely less obtrusive for me if I just imagine the Pokemon world as an alternative to our own, that still has many of the same scientists and discoveries, rather than something completely separate. I really like what you do with the more modern quotes, as you tend to attribute these to unnamed or entirely original characters even if the quotes are recognizable. So you could have something like:

      *"Arceus exists, if only in the form of a meme with high survival value, or infective power, in the environment provided by human culture."*

      >I liked the idea of Red (being a psychic) to actually be afraid of Bugs even before he found out he was Psychic.

      D'oh! I should have made this connection. I figured it mostly stemmed from the whole Scyther incident but overlooked this whole aspect.

      >how did you come across the story? Are you a regular on /r/rational, or did you find it through fanfiction?

      I was reading a comment thread on /r/pokemon where someone mentioned how there's so much of the Pokemon universe that Game Freak hasn't really shown in the games - politics, day-to-day life, dealing with non-legendary pokemon as threats, etc. Someone recommended your fanfiction, quoting your introductory paragraph to the series, and I was hooked.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        >If it were up to me, I'd probably have the baseline wild Pokemon intelligence be around the level of a border collie

        This is actually about what I imagine, yeah :) Most pokemon are about as smart as smart dogs, to be capable of being trained they way they are.

        The question of pokemon intelligence if it approaches sapience is definitely an interesting one, especially since in the anime it absolutely does show pokemon to be fully sapient and even capable of communicating with humans. The ethical ramifications of pokemon training is the least of it, honestly: with that level of intellect, the idea that humans were able to survive and flourish at all is honestly rather hard to believe. But I'd definitely be interested in reading a fanfic that goes into all those questions... I'm just not particularly interested in writing it, since it would massively derail the story toward addressing those questions, rather than the ones I'm more interested in.

        Overall the reason I decided to base it on the games rather than the anime is because that level of intelligence just seems more realistic given the pokemon world as we know it. It also allows for exploring issues of animal wellbeing more akin to our world, where animals aren't sapient.

        >I think overall, a ten-year-old human is objectively more intelligent than any of the animals I mentioned. In addition, it's very difficult to get a true metric of comparison to humans by age.

Here are the best examples I could find, if not all direct comparisons to humans, than of situations where the animals demonstrated capability beyond what was expected.

        Oh, yes, in very specialized circumstances and particular aspects of problem solving, many animals exceed children's capabilities. Similarly, pokemon are able to remember and interpret battle commands to a far better degree than human children can, and many possess unique intelligence properties that far exceed children's. But as an overall metric of "general intelligence," not just logical thinking but also learning capability and broad problem solving. What makes human intelligence so unique is the ability to learn a wide range of techniques and applications of intelligence, from visual-spacial to pattern recognition to mathematic to memorization. Some animals are much better than kids, or even adults, at one or two of those things, but in general I think the smartest pokemon wouldn't go much further than the smartest animal in general intelligence.

        I should probably edit the story to clarify that point a bit better and be more precise with it though, instead of just a single line about Alakazam and 3 year olds :) Thanks for the feedback!

    Same as above.

    Actually, on looking more carefully it seems to be intentional. A lot of Red's actions in that flashback section are unitalicised. Since they're also in past tense, it creates a confusing effect (flashback tense but present lack-of-italics).

    I'd suggest moving them all into the present tense and italicising the hallucinated/remembered dialogue and actions.
