  >And in time she told her own story, and she loved him still." The world shifted off its axis and I fell out of reality.

  Did she just usurp his role as the narrator?
  ```

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  So... Is it actually your wife writing the story from now on?
  ```

- u/LazarusRises:
  ```
  What did Flagg show to Haley in the vision? Flagg making his narrator (King?) write his own torture?

  I love me a metafictional twist. Taking bets on whether the text stays violet in the next chapter. 

  Also... did she just put Shawn in a narrative icebox until the world is safe for him again?
  ```

- u/Ozryela:
  ```
  Huh, that twist at the end is clever.

  I totally want them to munchkin the fuck out of this though. Switch narrator whenever it is convenient based on what the plot demands.
  ```
