## [D][HSF] Let's talk about Interstellar?

### Post:

I recently saw Interstellar and I'd recommend it as a good sci-fi epic. It has generated a lot of discussion on [it's own subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/interstellar), but I thought why not make a discussion thread here.

In particular, I found it visually stunning and the soundtrack is amazing. And to have the scientific spirit gift wrapped like this with mainstream-movie screentime is gratifying.

Anyone else see it?

  It was a gorgeous film, amazing to experience in IMAX 70mm. However, the plot made no sense and the characters were all idiots, so it's about as far from rationalist fiction as you can be.

  Good direction, acting and soundtrack.

  Stupid physics and stupid people using once more the trope that scientists have yet to grow past the emotional maturity of their high school years.

  I enjoyed the movie from a technical standpoint(as in, it hit all the right points and did everything 'theoretically right') but I found it meh in any other aspect.

  And I certainly do not see it fitting this subreddit. Using 'sciency' words and terms and even concepts does not make it science if its using them as props and not as tools.

    Well, [it wasn't that bad.](http://ikjyotsinghkohli24.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/on-the-science-of-interstellar/) [Even NDT liked it.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/neil-degrasse-tyson-interstellar_n_6133178.html) There might be a few inaccuracies, but it's *nothing* compared to other recent space movies like *Gravity*.

    Also, I'm a fan of the movie just because it gave scientists the chance to make Hollywood-budget simulations. Best simulation of a black hole yet, and [we actually made some new discoveries as a result.](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black-hole/) That's pretty awesome, whether the movie's plot is any good or not.

  Movie looked beautiful and I definitely loved certain parts. 

  However:

  * Some sort of food crisis caused by disease spread in dust storm. Grow everything in hermetically sealed buildings. Use algae as a base for most foods. Grow meat in vats.

  * Need to find a new planet for colonisation. Aliens help out with wormhole. Fine. Wormhole is in orbit around Saturn. What year is this 2001? Hell I loved that. 

  * Fate of humanity rests in relocation/colonisation. Infinite resources should have been  available to NASA. 

  * Oh we happened to send 12 people out to get data on these planets. Why? Send a bunch of satellites and probes. In fact there are allusions to artificial wombs so send a bunch of fertile eggs and those super smart robots to care for the children.

  * Set up a space station orbiting the Wormhole at both its ends. If radiation based communication fails you can just physically shuttle data back and forth through the Wormhole. 

  * Launch an intelligent mission from these stations to figure out if any of the planets were viable. No one has to go crazy. No one has to die.

  * Let's set aside the fact humanity had the technology to protect themselves from the radiation emitted by the accretion disc. None of the planets near a blackhole are safe.

  * Love is a biochemical reaction not magic.

  * Guy on mission: "We'll send one of the robots into the blackhole. PAST THE EVERY HORIZON. Maybe we can get data if it transmits it fast enough. 

  * Guy: Why isn't the data coming through? 

  * Every physicist ever: it's a blackhole. NOTHING GETS OUT PAST THE EVENT HORIZON. However Michael Cain figured out quantum gravity 40 years ago. Applications for space travel are decades away but we did manage to build a probe that might be able to come back. 

  * The girl has a mental breakdown and believes her ghost dad is talking to her through the random ticks of a broken watch. No way she came to that conclusion via any train of rational thought. Turns out blight makes you crazy. Even so she is still a brilliant engineer and designs a gravity based engine. Humanity finds cure for blight illness. Craziness is managed.

  * I prefer the mysterious 'them' to be aliens as 'them' being future humans would create a time paradox.

  * The crew should have been mainly female so they could have repopulated a planet using fertilised the eggs if disaster struck. 

  Pretty much covers how I would have fixed the major problems. There is room for tonnes of drama in the movie. The slow deterioration of morale as the crew finds each planet in turn not viable would have been great. Coop not being there for his children as they learn of his son's mental illness and his daughter following in her father's engineering footsteps. His daughter also succumbing to the illness even as she works to save humanity and succeeds. Drama of a plan A succeeding but also the multiple plan B's as well. Several world's seeded with human life. What would happen next?

    It could be a stable time loop in which there's no paradox. Still deterministic. 

    Maybe the above was more feasible overall. But I can see various suboptimal and not-smart actions being taken, though. People make mistakes and are wrong about things. That's also a part of observed reality. It's not so ridiculous for a movie to show people making mistakes. 

    I think your strongest point is about sending eggs on every mission and automating their incubation. Idk though, maybe they can't get to term automatically. But still, each of the Lazarus missions could've had them. I guess it's possible that they were resource constrained in some way. 

    They did send a bunch of probes though, but perhaps they don't have strong enough AI to rely on them? I'd argue it's ok to assume that as a premise. 

    Interesting points to think about!
    ```

    - u/Gauntlet:
      ```
      You make a good point about mistakes and people making suboptimal choices. In fact Brand(t?) going for the data on the water planet made sense. We see it all the time where people go above and beyond and get away with it. It was nice that she failed spectacularly and was deeply affected by that. A lot of the character stuff in the movie was done superbly well. Crazy Dr. Mann's actions made sense in a twisted way.

      I can see politics getting in the way of dealing with the food crisis. Immediately after an obvious world war a government would want its people to know they are safe and that there is hope for the future. Maybe they couldn't grow enough food in sealed complexes to feed the number of people left so the majority *had* to grow it in the open. 

      However I don't think that a group of people who designed the strategy behind the space missions did not see the obvious flaws and how to fix it. Even if they were resource confined there were far better ways of doing the mission. It's not like it was a heat of the moment scenario either, they had decades to plan it.

      My real problem with the time loop is that it does not add to the story or characters in any meaningful way. I felt it was included as Shyamalan type twist to make the movie seem smarter than it was. I think the idea of an alien race helping humanity out of the blue and making no other contact was far more interesting. It brings up the question of whether a price is attached. Maybe they accidentally caused the blight during a first contact situation and felt guilty.

      If it were just one or two things the movie wanted me to accept as a premise I think I would have been okay. It was the fact that my suspension of disbelief was shattered a short while after they went through the wormhole.

      I think the writers came up with a lot of interesting ideas and problems and a fascinating scenario. Instead of asking "How would humanity react to this?" they went with "How dramatic an adventure can we write?". That's what gets me riled up, they didn't think things through well enough.

      A few years back my friends and I went to see John Carter of Mars. It wasn't an absolutely awful movie it was just bland. John Carter was clearly fantasy and actually surprised me with its understated sci-fi elements. However one of my friends took personal offence at that movie. For 2 years he lamented the couple of hours that movie cost him. I think Interstellar is my John Carter.

  It wasn't rational. 

  Why did Astronaut #2 wait for 23 years instead of leaving to try and solve the mission alone? Not because it made any sense, but just so Cooper had a place to return to, but still loses 23 years of life, so that there can be drama?

  Why go down to planet #1 at all, given that you'll lose years of time? Especially when the sane alternative is shot down with only a few mutterings about a few **months** of travel and resources.

  Why spend decades on a fake plan that no-one but you, the astronauts, and one girl really care about? Lie to everyone else about how the project is going and redirect the resources *anywhere else*.

  The scene in the beginning, where Cooper hears about how the moon landing was covered up, is done because it is shocking to the audience and helps give sympathy to Cooper when he defends his daughter. (Never mind that they never deal with the fact that Murphy's response to disagreement is violence- Right or wrong, you can't raise a child to hit someone for disagreeing with you) 

  That scene isn't done because it makes sense- What, they got everyone over 40 besides Cooper and his dad to pretend the space race was faked? Why? Public opinion was already against the space program, they don't need to lie to convince people. 

  I do actually like Dr. Mann's characterization, though- His slip from sanity makes sense when he's been alone for decades with no hope for rescue.

    Actually, I think one of the main reasons this was included is as a not-so-subtle reference to Kubrick, who some conspiracy theorists state helped fake the moon landing.

    Actually I didn't necesarily see that as her being the aggressor, more like on of the other kids went all "Grr you stupid. I beat you now." so she defended herself... but since she was defending the 'politically incorrect' point of view, she was blamed.

    >What, they got everyone over 40 besides Cooper and his dad to pretend the space race was faked?

    I doubt they had to put so much work into it. Declassify some secret documents saying it was, get some supposed experts to back it up, the vast majority of people will swallow it. Give a reason like "It was to bankrupt the soviet union", and you leave anyone who doesn't toe the party line looking like a crazy conspiracy theorist. Especially when most people have more important things to do, like surviving.

  I saw it, and I didn't really like it.

  It was very pretty, yes, and there were a lot of individual moments and set-pieces that were way more scientifically accurate than 99% of the science fiction movies out there. Loved the design of Endurance. Loved the visuals of the black hole. The fact that suspended animation and time dilation and realistic travel-time to Saturn were used were great. The AIs were awesome characters, and none of them "turned on humanity" for no reason.

  But it was all woven together into a plot which made no sense.

  They have the technology to build those awesome spacecraft, human-like artificial intelligences, and yet all they gave the forerunner explorers were simple "yes/no" beacons? They didn't have space probes even as competent as the ones we've got orbiting Mars in real life *right now*. Mountain-sized waves would be obvious from orbit.

  For that matter, if a planet is orbiting a black hole close enough to have 1h:7y time dilation, it can already be dismissed as "safe for habitation" right then and there. They should never have bothered.

  Or, actually, they could have bothered. Why not send "plan B" artificial-womb colonies to *all 12* of those planets instead of those useless yes/no explorers. Follow up with plan A colonization if you get the chance.

  Apparently, Earth had the resources to build gigantic self-sufficient space habitats down on the planet's surface, they just didn't have the magical gravity drives needed to lift them into space. But why did they *need* to lift them into space? When Earth's environment degrades to the point where it's uninhabitable, just seal up the habitats and live inside them while they're still down on the ground. They'd be much easier to build if they didn't need to be designed to survive in space and you'd still have access to all of Earth's resources just outside the airlock. You could build a lot more of them and save a lot more people than the tiny fraction of Earth's population that they did with the space habitat in the movie.

  Earth has a couple of fully-reusable SSTO shuttlecraft that can come and go at will from a planet with greater than Earth's gravity, survive landing in an ocean and "surfing" a giant wave, and yet NASA's depicted as being a shoestring organization that has to rely on old leftovers from the glory days already in orbit. They could have had those shuttles going up and down routinely on Earth to build better space infrastructure (not sure why they needed a big Saturn V style launch the first time when all the other planets were SSTO).

  If you want your second-wave explorers to make an objective decision about which planets to go to, don't include someone among them who was in love with one of your stranded forerunner explorers. At least, not unless she's thoroughly psychologically screened to ensure she won't make decisions based on gut emotions.

  "Frozen clouds." Ugh.

  Anyway, in addition to just being bad, I don't think this movie fits the definitions of "rational fiction" in the sidebar. Very little problem-solving went on in this movie, the rules of the fictional world were not sane or consistent, and lots of stuff happened because "the plot requires it".

  [It led to some cool physics](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2lxebi/dhsf_lets_talk_about_interstellar/clzg0eq), and the plot was infinitely better than what I expected from the original script (which, for instance, featured millennia-old Chinese robots instead of posthumans). Probably one of my favorite mainstream scifi films since *2001*, and that's saying something.

  re: the food crisis.

  I believe that the blight was a mass extinction event on par with the creation of oxygen in our atmosphere by photosynthesis.  We used to have an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, but once the potent, toxic oxidant Oxygen byproduct started polluting our environment, the creatures of Earth suffered a mass extinction event.

  The Blight was like a virus or a microorganism that used Nitrogen (the 70% reference that older Brand/Michael Caine references) as an energy source and was polluting the environment. (I cannot recall what was happening to make everyone suffocate, but it was referenced a few times.)

  My biggest biological concern with the Blight was that they would bring the Blight accidentally aboard their Space Stations from Earth and they would continue to be unable to grow food (reliant on plants and photosynthesis rather than blight and nitrogen-consumption)
