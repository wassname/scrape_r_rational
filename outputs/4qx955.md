  "Dragons possess their own brand of structured magic, which has never been successfully copied by human mages. Quite simply, the issue is that dragons possess far bigger mana reserves than humans, and the sheer amount of energies involved in dragon spellcasting is virtually impossible for human spellcasters to match. Not every dragon is proficient in this form of magic, however – most don’t have the talent or patience for it, and instead simply rely on their innate magical abilities."

  Go Zach, go Zach ... you can be the first one to learn dragon magic with your enormous mana reserves.

    Yep, DragonZach to the rescue!

  Very interesting stuff. The fact that he's put so much thought on the Lizardmen makes me think we'll be seeing them on the quest for the keys.
  ```

- u/Themnos:
  ```
  That was interesting. Is there really just 5 sapient species in this world though? I was sure others had been mentioned.
  ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    At the beginning he mentions these are the ones that are thriving instead of just surviving, meaning there are others that aren't quite that well developed.
    ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  > The Sulrothum cannot speak a human tongue, their mouthparts incapable of producing proper sounds to manage it, ... by studying looted objects or questioning human captives.

  There's a bit of a contradiction here. They can't speak any human language but they can question human captives.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Not speaking =/= Not understanding.

    At least in this case where it's due to how their mouths are formed.
    ```

    - u/InsaneBranch:
      ```
      I don't think this is the problem MoralRelativity presented, but rather the questioning itself. How are they supposed to ask questions?

      But perhaps, as they learned to understand human languages, humans near borders also learned to understand sulrothum language.

        Maybe they write the questions.
        ```
