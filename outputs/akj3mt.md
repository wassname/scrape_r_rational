  Was that man firing a machine gun at a *planet*?

  - u/EthanCC:
    ```
    If you think about it, every gun ever has been fired at a planet.
    ```

      ```
      With steady hand and watchful eye, we may shoot the Cosmic Microwave Background.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Michael Bay *clearly* needs to step up his game.
    ```

- u/hyenagrins:
  ```
  Based on this short story: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13554058-the-wandering-earth by Liu Cixin (author of Three Body Problem).
  ```

- u/Frankenlich:
  ```
  Form the trailer, this looks way more like a Michael Bay movie than something that belongs on this sub.

  Can someone explain what is particularly rational about it? The trailer is mostly explosions and cliched platitudes.
