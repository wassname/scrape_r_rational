  Making a successful band of five consisting of both heroes and villains has massive implications. Catherine's whole idea for the Liesse Accords is that she can get both sides to unite for a common, greater cause, and here we see it proved to work even beyond the Truce and Terms. A little ray of hope after the whole Red Ax debacle.

  The Relentless Magistrate has skyrocketed through the hero rankings to maybe my third favorite hero. This guy literally arrested an undead abomination for a minor felony. Not for a crime against the gods, not for slaughtering innocent people, but impersonation. Hanno betting with the Woe has made his top two spot secure, though it's hard to choose between him and the Kingfisher for first place.

    Arrogation isn't exactly impersonation; it's claiming a title you don't have the right to, which is different from pretending to be someone you aren't.

    Regardless it was an absolutely excellent moment and I love Cordelia's reaction.

      Magistrate, is that you? ;)
      ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:
        ```
        We don't have magistrates where I'm from, so no! We only have the will of the shrieking white-hot sphere of pure wrath, as translated through the People.

          All Hail Bellophoron, First and Greatest of the Free Cities (Kaneas please don't kill me).

            Are you suggesting that the Kaneas would break the law and spare your life after you committed a capital offense??
            ```

              ```
              Fair enough. I submit to my punishment, as I have broken the laws of our most mighty Republic.
              ```

  Didn't look like anybody had posted the latest chapter, so, here.
  ```

- u/sparr:
  ```
  I am confused. Didn't this chapter get posted a couple of days ago, and then go 16+ hours with no comments here?
  ```

  - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
    ```
    PGTE updates on Tuesdays and Fridays, and this is the latest (hence from Tuesday). You might be thinking of 34, whose r/r thread still has no comments?
    ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      I do not think I am. This sub is where I find out when new chapters are posted, and I had already read this chapter when I saw this post.
      ```

        Then you should join us at r/practicalguidetoevil. The discussions are a nice bonus to the chapters. Oftentimes I find out something that I missed from someoneâ€™s comment.
