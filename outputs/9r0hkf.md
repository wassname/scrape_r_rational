## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  A little weird problem that I face when considering writing sci-fi stories set in the future of our world... I am always on the fence about how to come up with names for the characters.

  I find the idea of inventing names outright often leads to rather silly results, especially when considering time intervals that aren't too long (there's easily been Johns and James for the best part of one millennium now, so it's hard to imagine names as changing too radically unless on very very long time scales). However with just using realistic present day names I find that an annoying consequence is that the story will feel rooted in one specific country and culture, depending on which language I use, and that's not always necessarily something I want to draw a focus on if it's not key to my topic. In fact I like the idea of generality that comes with abstract or unknown names, I just don't feel they are very realistic or even credible in a lot of cases (if I were a linguist I might try to speculate about that, but alas, I am not).

  Is there an approach you would use? Maybe mixing up different names from different cultures? Just try to avoid using names altogether? Or you just don't care/think much about it?

    I usually think about their parents, and the sort of selection process they would have gone through, which as a byproduct helps define the character and their background.

    /r/namenerds is a great resource. 

    I think do research into the history/provenance of the names you want to include, and perhaps include some really, really old names. The name Tiffany is actually a very ancient medieval name that got brought out of obscurity with a book in I think the 1940s or something, but now people don't think of Tiffany as an ancient name, they think of it as modern and trendy like Ryan or Jayden.

    Think of your society: if it comes from America, then biblical/classic names like James/John/Mary will still be around. If it comes from Japan, the names will again be very different - Kumikos or something, I don't know Japanese names.

    This is another great way to create names that look namey while also being "new": https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/49yi1c/thoughts_on_dithematic_names_and_creating_names/
