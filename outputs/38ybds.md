  Either 

  a) Hold onto it until astronomy is advanced enough to figure out if an exo-planet could support life, then aim very, very carefully. 

  b) as /u/_ShadowElemental said, a stable celestial body in *very stable* solar orbit that's unlikely to deorbit if a lot of extra mass is added to it without being massive enough that the gravity well is a problem. Engines to compensate, maybe.

  c) Put both ends on moveable plates. Give to NASA or other aerospace organization. You now have a spaceship that needs only enough fuel to get into orbit, can support as many humans as you want without supply problems, and can even manipulate its own mass by passing matter through the portal. The only limit to its acceleration would be c and the amount of earthside fuel we could pump through. They wouldn't need rocket fuel, either. We could literally pass them garbage to throw out the back end.

  In fact, said spaceship could be expanded more or less to taste. Although there might be some... weird physics on the boundary once the far side accelerated to relativistic speeds.

    Portals collapse if you move them. Except for a couple of exceptions, one of which is putting one end on the moon.

      Move them relative to what?

    ```
    Assuming c) with plates that are space-efficient regarding the size of the portal itself, what happens if you pass one portal plate through the other?
    ```

  ```
  Besides the obvious point about making sure that there's a potential energy gradient to generate infinite energy, can I get a time travel loop by towing one end of the portal back and forth at relativistic speeds until one end of the portal has traversed significantly less proper time than the other?

  I concede that I don't want the responsibility, so I'd sell the usage to the US government for millions of dollars. Although getting them to believe me may be a challenge...

  Really Thing #1 to think about is less "where do we want portals to be" and more "do we want to use the opportunity to *fire*  the portal gun in any special way?"

  All solutions pertaining to portal location (except for things that are light-speed distances away) are contained within "put two portals on two portable, reusable disks."

  Sealed room with an airlock, and the moon. Mars would probably be more useful but what happens if you miss?

    Anchoring your space-side portal in a staging post location (some sort of large satellite, possibly a human-habitable space-station or similar) in high Earth Orbit would probably be better:

    (from [here](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/surfaceorbit.php))

    Whereas if your portal is to the surface of Moon or Mars, you're still stuck in a gravity well and aren't travelling at orbital velocity (now if you had an arbitrarily large quantity of portals, things would be different). Because

    It's hard to get to orbit because you have to go so *fast*.](https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/).

    So for that matter it might be better to put the space-side portal in *Solar* orbit -- not sure which would require more delta-v to get to an arbitrary location in space from the staging post.

      Sure, but there's nothing in space that's as easy to hit from the surface of the earth than the surface of the moon.

      It may be that there's nothing in space other than the moon or *maybe* the sun that you could credibly hit with a portal gun. And even the moon would be tricky. The sun would be really tough, with 8 minutes windage, and where would you anchor the other end?

      Maybe if you could talk NASA into sending a kilometer-scale balloon to geosynchronous, but how would you talk them into it without a demo? You only have one shot.

      Once you've got the portal to the moon you can start assembling a linear accelerator. It's much easier to do that, on the moon. Once you can demonstrate it there won't be much difficulty getting people building one that you can ship through a two meter hole in pieces.

        One option would be to put the portals on movable plates...ideally graphene, titanium, or some other very strong / very light material. Now you can demo the portal. Have NASA put one of the plates in orbit and you're good to go. 

        One option for propulsion -- have anchor points around the edge of the plate. Have one plate in a vacuum chamber on Earth, one in orbit.  Working from the Earth side, put a solar sail through the portal into orbit, with the anchorlines attached to the rim of the space-side plate. Shoot a laser through and voila, propulsion.

          Except that portals collapse when you move them.

  I was going to go for the very obvious 'one portal above the other' for "free energy", but thinking about it you can't really extract all that much.

  My other thought was to just shoot it in the direction of space that is most likely to not hit anything for a while in order to get it as far as possible, but then you risk hitting a star and messing up earth. Not sure if anything beats the high Earth orbit proposal.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Hmm. If you put it in a vacuum cylinder, dropped a magnet, built a railgun around it to accelerate it, then dismantled the railgun and built an electric generator...
    ```

    > but thinking about it you can't really extract all that much.

    Why not? Just put a turbine between the portals. It's infinite energy. It isn't infinite wattage, but the farther apart the portals are, the more power they would produce.
    ```

    ```
    If output is the issue you could just put the portal on the sun, or some other star maybe.
    Plasma for nothing and energy for free.

  Buy a property in NYC and a property in Shanghai. Make a portal between the two, thus making the quickest transportation in the entire world, and charging whatever price I deem worthy.
