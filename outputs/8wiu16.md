## More blogs like SlateStarCodex?

### Post:

I've recently discovered SSC, and I really love it. So educational, insightful, and engaging (easy to understand, fun to read). I'm looking for more stuff like this. I know about LessWrong, Wait But Why, and Paul Graham's essays. Can you recommend more good similar rationality/science/tech related blogs?

  http://siderea.livejournal.com/ is pretty good and a little less "everything is fine" while the world is burning, but she updates somewhat less often.
