## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  To my understanding, J.R.R. Tolkien set the events of his legendarium in a ‘mythological past’, an imaginary period in our Earth’s prehistory.  I’ve been thinking about the historical constraints of this idea:  Epic stories set in the prehistoric past of Our World, with the prehistoric setting being the reason why the events, no matter how stupendous, do not conflict with Our Historical Record.

  Obviously, these stories need to take place before the invention or arrival of writing in the given region. However:

  * A)	There’s the matter of how long the events would be preserved after the fact in the oral tradition before fading or becoming unrecognizable.  If they are preserved too long, then the stupendous events could potentially become codified and thus conflict with Our Historical Record.

  * B)	The invention / arrival of writing in different regions at different times means that some of these stories could take place more recently than others, so long as they’re set in illiterate areas.  But how much separation would be needed so that knowledge of stupendous events was not carried by word-of-mouth from illiterate to literate areas?

  * C)	How much consideration should be given to the various forms of proto-writing (pictograms, petroglyphs, cave art) as constraints?

  I realize this would depend on just how stupendous the events are.  Personally, I’m thinking of some moderate shonen / superhero shenanigans – cool fights with cool powers, but no catastrophic changes in landscape – but it’d be cool to speculate on how it works for stories at different power scales too.

    [Australian Aboriginal oral histories](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/16/indigenous-australian-storytelling-records-sea-level-rises-over-millenia) have preserved memory of sea level rises that happened 7-18,000 years ago, so you're looking at *at least* 10,000 years as a lower bound since dragons and other mythological beasties will probably be even more robust in the oral tradition.

      Fascinating!  Although, the article also conveys that the Australian Aboriginal system described appears to be exceptional amongst oral traditions.  For oral traditions elsewhere, 10 kyr seems a bit extreme to me, currently.  Dragons and mythological beasties would certainly be more robust, but the idea of them is already recorded in our world's mythology, alongside various gods and heroes.  Thus, so long as enough time passes for an account of dragons to become believably diluted/distorted, and the event parallels a known myth in a broad stroke, I would not consider that as much of a conflict.

      I think a better word choice for my original post might have been "diluted" or "distorted", instead of "unrecognizable"...

      Also, the supposed cap of 800 years for oral tradition was also new information to me.  Thank you!

        The other thing is, I guess you could say, cultural egotism: when europeans first came to Australia they dismissed the stories of people living out in the barrier reef as mythological stuff rather than a "true" account. 

        And I mean, the Aboriginal mythology also includes the Dreamtime where the Wagul slithered on the earth and everything his belly touched turned into a river. (I wonder if they are "marked" differently? Like, are the stories of people hunting in what is now the ocean "my father's father all the way back did this" and the Dreamtime stories "this happened long before anyone we know was born"?)

    If you're doing a supernatural story, then couldn't you have a pretty advanced society in the prehistoric past, complete with writing, but simply design your magic system in such a way that it could remove all traces of the society?  Like if, say, the society runs entirely on magic instead of technology, and anything magical must be owned by a specific mage, and when a mage dies all magic they own dies with them?  So we can presume that the society left no records behind because something drove them to extinction, and all of their records died with them.

      Erasure of all evidence is definitely an option, and would definitely simplify things.  And if there's any higher intelligence behind the stupendous events, that would probably be the safest method of concealment in the long run.  That probably is the easiest way to do things.  Thank you!

    Depending exactly *how* epic your fights are, you can make catastrophic changes in the landscape if you want... as long as the *resultant* landscape fits the modern one. (Put a mountain in prehistory where there isn't a mountain now, and it will end up getting blown up... perhaps a few large meteor impact craters can have different origins...)

    Also, if you're making mythological-past fiction, then Atlantis might be an interesting place in which to set it...
