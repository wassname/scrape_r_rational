## Superpower is melting the ice caps. I feel like there might be some non-obvious utility here.

  Could it work on Mars?

    The way the question is specifically phrased probably not.

      Mars has polar ice caps. Hell, it just says "the polar ice caps". As phrased you can affect every polar ice cap everywhere at the same time to melt at 10x.
      ```

  The only way this is useful is that in the far future this can be leveraged to generate free energy and defeat the heat death of the universe.

    Leave that to the super strong guy with the crank.

      Or anybody with even minor matter creation powers [since once you're farming Hawking radiation for mass to energy conversion nothing else really compares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ).

        I've always said this. Creates-piss-out-of-his-finger-man could be the only superpowered person ever, and he could still save us all.

  The problem with this idea - the critical flaw that limits the utility hugely - is you can't control the consequences if the power is as described.  If your power melts all caps equally and raises sea level everywhere evenly the power is by definition more destructive than constructive.  Like radiation for medical treatment would be if you have no control of where it goes.  The lack of specificity is the flaw.

    So what you’re saying is… This superpower is kinda shitty?

    Jokes aside, thank you for giving this much thought to the pros and cons of this power. I’m the OP of the post in r/shittysuperpowers and, though this is my first trip to r/rational, I personally would love to see more crossover episodes between these two subs.

    Thanks to you all for giving serious consideration to some of the bullshit we come up with over there.

  hello terraforming other planets! melting ice caps on earth is shitty, melting them on more frozen planets is awesome!
  ```

  - u/t3tsubo:
    ```
    Only if the other planets are already melting. 10 x 0% is still 0%.
    ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      Mars has pronounced seasonal melting of its caps.
      ```

  It depends on how the superpower works. If it works by generating heat to melt the ice caps it could easily be used to generate heat elsewhere which could be exceedingly useful.
  If it worked by turning any amount of ice-> water directly things would be tougher, but still doable. I'm not sure what exactly, but I'm sure that there would be some industrial uses out there that would benefit from being able to instantly flash melt water for no cost.

  If it only works by directly turning iceburg size quantities of ice->water it would be impossible to use for good. It could be used for profit by sticking hydroelectric generators at the base of an iceburg then just melting it all over a day, but while that would generate energy and money it would be amazingly horrible for the planet.

  The one *real* use would be terraforming other planets. Go over on the next flight to mars and you could melt the ice caps over and over to significantly increase the global temperature and help form an atmosphere.

  If it speeds up *any and all* melting of the ice caps equally, then you can use it to build power stations based on heating polar ice. The rate of heat production is increased by a factor of 10, so you have a self-sustaining energy source that works incredibly efficiently.

  (Once this energy source replaces all other non-renewable energy sources, the polar ice caps will no longer naturally melt on their own*, so the factor-10 increase is not a problem.

  \*ignoring runaway process effects**

  **also not a particularly convincing claim since natural melting is only balanced by freezing, so multiplying one and keeping the other unchanged offsets the zero-point

  Well, whatever, free energy matters more than a little silly flooding. :P)

  Easy.

  1. Read *Better Never to Have Been* by David Benatar.
  2. Find and exterminate every species that would likely survive this power being on full blast.
  3. Turn this power on full blast.
  4. You win!

    That's a lot harder than it sounds. And it sounds pretty hard.
    ```

- u/Sparkwitch:
  ```
  Is it 10x before or after other climate forcings? Right now the ice caps melt in the summer and then re-freeze in the winter and the latter is slightly less impressive than the former statistically so the trend is a slow year-over-year loss of ice on a graph with a long enough time horizon.

  If the melting is simply ten times higher, and the freezing remains precisely as strong as it is now, then the Arctic is ice free *this* summer and potentially year-round in perpetuity. At a similar rate the Antarctic will be ice-free in a few years at most. Greenland and Antarctica will be reduced to a few stubborn glaciers within a matter of decades.

  So the non-obvious utility is that the world will finally take global warming seriously, just as civilization collapses under coastal flooding and complete polar weather chaos.
