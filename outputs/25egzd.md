  I have finished the first three episodes.
  It is like a crime drama where the romance tropes are clues.

  EDIT: And the people are murders.

    ```
    Indeed, I hasitated posting it at first because the main character is anything but rational, but he understands the tropes that his world runs on and plays them like a lyre to optimize the happiness of those around him.
