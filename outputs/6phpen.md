  This is it. This is the end. The war is on.

    More importantly, WORM 2 HO, EVERYBODY ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN

      Well, maybe not "More importantly"; Wildbow probably doesn't like seeing that people just want Twig to be over with so they can read Worm 2 (and that's not even necessarily true, because a lot of people, myself included, prefer Twig to Worm).
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:

        Ah I didn't mean to be rude. I haven't read Twig and I love Worm very dearly, so this is like a big flashing arrow for me.
        ```

          No better time to catch up on Twig than the two months or so we have left. Who knows, maybe you'll end up as saddened as I am that it's ending.

          I probably wouldn't be so annoyed if I didn't see a lot of the same sentiment on r/Parahumans, at least as of a couple months ago. It's quieted down since then, and most people seem to understand Wildbow doesn't like people talking about it, but I imagine that's gonna change now that we've entered the last arc.

            I love worm dearly too, but I kind of want it to stay as it is. I started Worm when it was in it's final arc and damn, it was a crazy ride. I never got into Twig or pact the same way, but I couldn't handle the waits for Twig
            ```

              Luckily, being able to discuss the book with people who have *definitely* only read as much as I have is great, even if it means I have to wait for each new chapter. Maybe I won't feel that way in time, though---I've only been caught up with Twig for a few weeks.

        I can see how people would like Twig, but to me it just reads too much like Adventures in Bonesaw Land to appreciate.

        A little bit of that in a story is fine. When the entire world is composed of it, I just get too stressed by the horrific ethics violations everyone is just ignoring to continue.

          It gets way better, both about that and in general, in the second half. Reading through it again it feels almost as if the first half is mostly intended to set up the second half, and the very different dynamic it has, which it does well. Still, it is unfortunate that all I can tell people who aren't enthused by the book is "once you get through the first ~500,000 words you *might* like it."

            Personally, I think the critical part to liking Twig is understanding and caring about the characters, more than the worldbuilding. The worldbuilding is as good as it is in Worm, but it's far less vivid. The powers in Worm made a sort of intuitive sense which made it easier and more exciting to read in the beginning. It takes a long time for the experiments of Twig to get to that same level of understanding. But the characters, especially the Lambs, make up for it in my mind. I found myself genuinely loving each of them in their own way, far more than I felt for anyone in Worm. 

            The pacing is also really on point; Twig leaves room to breathe and relax to make the conflict all the more tense. The one flaw I will readily admit: it sucks to have to wait for new chapters. Generally I will get caught up and then wait a few weeks before reading again, but part of me almost wishes it was released all at once (or maybe an arc at a time).

            I absolutely recommend those who started Twig but couldn't get into it to give it another shot. Just don't expect 'Worm-but-everyone-is-Bonesaw' because it isn't that. It's its own thing.

      I can have a link where he talks about the next project?

        ```
        You can. [This interview](https://balloondaycreative.wordpress.com/2017/02/18/today-i-asked-wildbow/), as example.
        ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        I don't have a specific link, but that's the buzz over at /r/parahumans.
        ```

  ```
  Nope, nope, nope.  Not starting this till it's done, so I can just consume it in one weekend like I did with PACT.

  ```
  I stopped reading at arc 18. Does interesting stuff happened in the last 2 arcs?

  Should I go directly for the Arc20?
