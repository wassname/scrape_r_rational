  Ana sums up my thoughts on this entire story:

  “That is both really clever and the stupidest thing I ever heard,”

  Why? Who comes up with this? How long do these things take to connect? Was Ana's name planned out like that from the beginning? Will we ever know?

  Thank you, Scott Alexander, for this continuing masterpiece. [I] ain't guessin' where this one's going.

  Poor Lin, such a silly way to stop existing.

  I wonder if the ship minds having its name changed...

  A dog, a plan, a canal, pagoda.

  I expected that as soon as the dog showed up, but alas, it was not to be seen.

  > imagine the map of the mystical body of God overlaid upon **a map** of the Western Hemisphere 

  *That's* what I was doing wrong.  I was trying to overlay the Sephirot onto a globe, and all of the parts were ending up in the wrong places or the measurements were wrong.  Does anyone know what projection the map is?

  I was doing Panama -> North Pole = 9000 km = two steps in the Sephirot, making one step 4500 km.  I was confused because Juneau was only ~3500 km from the North Pole and from the midpoint of the north pole and Panama, and Baja California was about the same (~3500 km from Panama and from the midpoint).

  I'm kind of curious why the name for the ship stayed reversed, but no one else's did.

    The autopilot doesn't just have a name like the people and the ship.  It's powered by a Name.

    Maybe once everything stopped working the Comet King just lightninged his way out of there (bringing the ship with him somehow) and, by not finishing the crossing, the ship stayed broken...
