  Hey everyone, and welcome to, once again, the new Longest Chapter Yet! I was worried that this would finally be my first chapter to miss its deadline, but thankfully I was able to finish it in time. I'll be catching a flight tomorrow, so I won't be home until the afternoon. Once I am (and possibly after a nap), I'll update my site. Feel free to send all feedback and typos as usual, and I'll give it another pass for editing when I can. Hope you enjoy it, and thanks for reading!

    Ah, a low-stress chapter :). Nice to have one of those after interrogation by Giovanni + badge battle + offending Bill.

    Metapod can walk? That's news to me.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Glad you enjoyed it!

      >Metapod can walk? That's news to me.

      It's really just the anime adaptation that makes them famous for their immobility: in the games they can learn Tackle if they had it as a caterpie, so I figured they should be capable of at least some limited movement.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I was kind of figuring that it was more the limitations of the game; the designers didn't think it would work to have a mechanic where evolving stripped away learned moves. Especially in such an early stage of the game, where inexperienced trainers might not have any idea how to continue training their nerfed pokemon. And then everyone would be delaying the evolution of their bugs to minimise the time they spend in-cocoon...all in all, it would be a mess in-game.

        But it would make more sense in-world.
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          That's true, it can definitely be interpreted as a game conceit. I don't think a pokemon can *ever* lose a move naturally through evolution, which seems odd considering how much some of them change. But yeah, the idea that metapod can move a bit seems more reasonable to me than the idea that they can't. They're not quite cocoons from our world: just modeled off them. 

          Others like kakuna are probably not as mobile, but they can still shoot out poison stingers and string and whatnot.
          ```

          - u/ATRDCI:
            ```
            Just spit balling and this would only work for the Caterpie line, but since Butterfree have​ some psychic ability, perhaps Metapod have a very mild version of this? Just enough for a small self levitation to putter around? And particularly mobile Metapod tend to have strong psychic abilities as Butterfree, though perhaps they tend to be weaker physically since energy spent moving around is energy not spent strengthening their bodies? Maybe it's stupid, but it's another way to square the circle if nothing else
            ```

            - u/DaystarEld:
              ```
              It's a good thought, but without any psychic moves learned by metapod I think I would feel like I lacked enough canon justification to extrapolate that far :)
              ```

      - u/DCarrier:
        ```
        Can they fight effectively? If not, how will it evolve?
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          Ehh, not so much. But like in the games, they don't have to be the one to finish off the opponent to get experience from the fight.
          ```

  - u/Ibbot:
    ```
    Great as always.  Looking forward to the reaction to their new method of Abra catching!

  I'm really liking the theme of all 3 of them starting to mature beyond their mentors as they leave the city. Red's impostor syndrome moment against Blue's realization that he was demoralizing others - both were realistic and the comparison was well set up. This chapter has catapulted this fic to the top of my fav rational fics list.

  Two Abras for fast travel. GENIUS. Hope they get nicknames soon.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thank you, glad you enjoyed it so much! 

    >Hope they get nicknames soon.

    Yeah, they'll pretty much force Red into finally doing so :)
    ```

- u/SkeevePlowse:
  ```
  It always bugged me that you could teleport out of anywhere you want but you could only go to one specific place with them in the games.  I rather liked your solution to that; obviously Abras can go wherever the hell they want, it's getting them to go wherever *you* want that's the hard part.

  I also really liked the battle between Red and Blue; there was a lot of good character interactions in what should have just been a fixed battle, and I liked the nods to their fights in the game; Blue's got a fixed list of pokemon, and it's up to Red to work around that.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thanks, glad you liked it!
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  As always I am incredibly excited by the continued development of the psychic part of this story. Red not only developing his own powers (which, awesomely, seem to be unique without being overpowered) but also making a commitment to studying psychic phenomenon in general is literally a dream comes true for me when it comes to this fic.

  You've even managed to explain why all top trainers aren't psychic: I'm guessing the advantage they gain from telepathy and mental cohabitation is tempered by the fact that they also have to experience the pain of their pokemon as well? Even if I'm wrong, now I really can't wait to meet Sabrina!

  Also a quick question; in your story, how does the strength of psychic powers work? Is Sabrina very powerful (for a human) because her powers are just like that, or is it like how some people are born with bodies especially good at building muscle mass, but she still had to put in a lot of work to become the strongest in the world?

  Or, more clearly, do psychic powers work like strength in real life, where some people have more potential but everybody can get pretty damn strong and the difference between the best and a very dedicated but limited person isn't too big; or is it like height, where if you're born a dwarf, that's that and there's nothing you can do to even come close to someone born to be normal or above average?

  Thanks for the awesome chapter!

    Yep: I like powers that are double edged swords, and knew that I would have to make psychic trainers have a drawback to show why they can't dominate others as easily as they otherwise should.

    >Also a quick question; in your story, how does the strength of psychic powers work?

    To put it basically, raw power comes from genetics, finesse and control comes from practice/individual talents/personal techniques. But the "raw power" difference between human psychics is a very narrow range compared to that of psychic pokemon (or even the strongest psychic humans and the weakest psychic pokemon).

    Thanks for reading!

      I'm reminded of the discussion of the "magic" gene from HPMOR. Does this then have interesting implications for both psychic-ness (everyone is at least somewhat tall, but only some people are very tall...?), and darkness (are there degrees of darkness?)
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Good questions! :D
        ```

- u/Aretii:
  ```
  The conversation Blue had reminded me of a running theme in the boxing shounen Hajime no Ippo: the concept of "heavy fists." In the context of HnI, it means that boxers who rise to the top carry with them the dreams of all the people they've broken along the way, people who retired for whatever reason after losing to them, whether that be from injury, demoralization, or because their record just wasn't good enough anymore. It is part of the *telos* of the boxer (though obviously they don't use that word) to seek more and more greatness, because as they become great, the people who have fallen to them are vicariously fulfilled in their accomplishments.

  "In order to move higher and shine brighter, you use other men's dreams as stepping stones. For the sake of those stepped on, we must not be a mere pebble, but the greatest mountain they've ever seen..."

  This isn't quite the same thing, because Blue is merely demoralizing the people around him with his speed of achievement, as opposed to blocking people entirely from their dreams by crushing them himself, but it seems to be gesturing at the same sort of conceptual space.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    That's great. I think I'll be stealing and adapting that somewhat :)
    ```

    - u/Aretii:
      ```
      HnI has a lot of problems (for example, it's like 1200 issues long after running for nearly 30 years and shows no signs of wrapping up soon), but it has a lot of really good reflections on competition.

  Does teleport work with dark people? 

  If it doesn't then that means Blue would never be able to be saved in case of life danger

    I guess Red will have to invent Miracle Eye, then.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I cannot confirm or deny this.
      ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    It does not, much to Dark people's eternal frustration.
    ```

    - u/Ibbot:
      ```
      Any chance of Miracle Eye helping with that?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:

        It just might!

- u/DerSaidin:
  ```
  Red: "So, can you teach me in the time we have?"

  Ayane: "Not fully, but I can give you the basics, so that you can work on developing it along your journey."

  Red: *** teleports ***
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    They're talking about "free" teleportation, not the kind that any non-Dark person with an abra can use :)
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Thus Red had to actually register Bill's house as a teleport destination.

      Free teleportation sounds a lot like the game's Fly move.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Pretty much, yeah. I thought about having the flying pokemon have to follow the Fly restrictions (basically you have to train your flying pokemon to take you to a specific spot rather than being able to free-roam) but that's silly and the Soaring mechanic from ORAS demonstrated what flying on pokemon should be like anyway.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > the soaring mechanic from ORAS

          :D Gen 1 trainer here, with a smattering of Gen 2. I do know what the acronym stands for, but I don't know the game.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            In ORAS they let you basically fly around on Lati@s above a map of the region, fight flying pokemon midair, and land in any route rather than just in cities.
            ```

                ```
                The pokemon game series is a long running tragedy of two-steps-forward, one-step-back. They keep introducing new features every game, only to have them removed soon after. Thankfully, on the whole, the pile of features is increasing, but we can never be sure which ones will stick and which ones won't. For example, I'm pretty sure now that Alola included character customization that it's going to stay for all the New games, but the Remakes probably won't have it.  But will pokemon riding from SuMo persist, even in new games, or will they bring HMs back? Magic 8 ball says, "Ask again later."
                ```

                - u/The_Magus_199:
                  ```
                  Yeah... Honestly, I'm on team HMs - at least unless Ride Pokémon get seriously reworked. I liked actually using my own Pokémon outside of battle, and while the idea of specific ride Pokémon using more unique powers to their species is cool, the system as it is now is basically just "HMs but mixed with the bike so you can't do important stuff out of battle *without that frigging banjo the*-sorry, sorry, I'm getting off topic.
                  ```

                  - u/DaystarEld:
                    ```
                    That goddamn banjo... I don't understand game development enough to know why whoever is in charge of music design doesn't play the alpha and say "Hey, maybe let's not spend half the game listening to the same song after we spent so long creating a bunch of different tracks for it?" Maybe they did and the project leader just loooves banjos.

                    But yeah I hear you. I'd be more okay with HMs being reintroduced if they just made the attacks all useful. Surf is the gold standard, and Strength is okay, but most of the rest just suck so bad it's insult to injury requiring them in your party.
                    ```

                    - u/The_Magus_199:
                      ```
                      Yeah, like, the bike themes were at least good and fitting, and you didn't have to hear them if you didn't want to anyways. The banjo would be okay music for a minigame, but for something as unavoidable and omnipresent as this...

                      Yeah, I definitely understand the issues with HMs. My pet idea for how to fix them without totally changing them is to just make it so that you can use them a long as you have the HM, the required badge, and a Pokémon that *can* learn it, without needing to actually take up a move slot. But yeah, making the HM moves more usable would also be nice!
                      ```

                      - u/DaystarEld:
                        ```
                        Yeah, that solution is a nice middle ground: the main issue is that they don't want you to ever get stuck in a place you used an HM to get to (like if you surf to an island, catch a pokemon there, and replace only one in your party that can use Surf) but if they added some fancy coding or just were careful with level design it wouldn't be an issue.

      Mostly unrelated question; if humans can be Normal type or Dark type or Psychic type... does that mean that it's possible for humans to also be Fire type, or Electric type, or Poison type?  If so, what would that look like?

      Or is this just a case of this society co-opting pokemon typing terminology to describe a variable range of human psychic sensitivity?

          Hm, maybe. Were that the case, I'd expect to hear about some kind of 'type affinity' for pokemon trainers being discussed at some point, though.  Although there are an awful lot of trainers, not just the gym leaders, who have 'themed' teams.

          ~~I don't think we have enough data to say one way or another, but that's an interesting possibility I hadn't considered.~~  Apparently I missed some passages that suggest this very possibility, that of a type affinity.

        Well, based on Mister Daystar's definitions of humans with Typings, I'm guessing that there is a firm division for this.

        One set would be the typings based on physical aptitude and or physiology, such as Fire, Electric, Water, and all the typings based upon the physiology of the Pokemon alone. These are typings can be deemed to be impossible typings for humanity limited genetics.

        Second would be the typings reliant on the mental capacities and qualities of the of the subject, such as a Psychic's increased brainpower or a Dark's innate shielding. These are traits achievable by the genetic makeup of humanity itself. I'm quite excited to see how Sir Daystar can handle Fighting, Ghost and Fairy type Trainers in the future!

        Those are my two-cents! Thanks!
        ```

    - u/DerSaidin:
      ```
      Ah, ok.  I guess I expected even basic/restricted teleportation would require some more training.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yeah, there's nothing inherently complicated about the act of teleportation from the abra's perspective: taking someone else along is all you really have to teach them, as a normal trainer, and a psychic trainer can couple their mind with them to do it without much training with the abra.
        ```

  - u/SkeevePlowse:
    ```
    The way I understood it to work is that you can train an Abra two different commands:

    "Register Teleport":  An Abra who knows this command, when given the this command, will remember this specific location as a teleport destination.  They can only have one such location remembered at any given time.

    "Teleport":  An Abra who has registered a location will teleport themselves (and if they're in physical contact, their trainer) to the registered location.

    What Red was asking to be taught by Ayane was how to psychically connect with his Abra, so that when he gives it the Teleport command, Red can pick its destination, out of any location *Red* can visualize well enough.

  What's the range of a ( human ) pyschic? Can they sense people from three feet around them or three blocks?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    You know, I haven't quite figured out what the maximum would be in meters or feet or anything. 3 blocks for a powerful psychic seems too far, but not by much.  But the main problem is that when you go that far the reception/quality of the reading takes a heavy hit.

    So even if one psychic can sense minds from 100 feet away while another psychic can sense minds at 300 feet, the effective distance for both would still be something like 80 and 150 in terms of getting a clear enough sense to be more than mostly-meaningless mental/emotional noise.

      You mentioned Maturin being poisoned and Charmander hoping for a burn. Does that mean you're not follow traditional status effects? I like that, and hope it leads to interesting combinations like poison/sleep from butterfree.

    The only things he can really mimic are mental states: insofar as a power relies on a mental state more than anything else, he has a leg up in learning it :)
