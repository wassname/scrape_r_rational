  ```
  I wonder about the choice of title. What happened in the chapter to justify that title?
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Apprentice X Archer.
  I ship it.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Cat seems to be acting more heroically than not, even if she complains that villians couldn't get away with showboating as much as heroes like Archer.  

  I hope we get some payoff from Ranger being around in the form of the Queen of Summer showing up, or a face to face meeting with Cat. I could also see a cryptic message from afar delivered to Cat for payoff at a later date.
  ```

  - u/Tenoke:
    ```
    This is the battle of four armies and one after all, so I'd very much expect for Ranger to actually fight.
    ```

    - u/TwoxMachina:
      ```
      Lolz to Ranger fighting all 4 armies.
      ```
