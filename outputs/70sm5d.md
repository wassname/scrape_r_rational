  RIP the Queen of Summer. It's weird; I actually kinda liked her from her brief appearance onscreen. Ranger's obviously got her ways of countering having the Entire Sun dropped directly on her, so I don't thing Summer's getting out of this one.

   I guess Cat's out of Winter's bag now!

  There were actually a lot of cool things this chapter: Masego being a fucking eyeless weirdo, Masego breaking the rules of magic (and getting magically trumped twice in the space of two chapters, which is honestly kinda neat), our little band of 5 (4 and 1?) getting their official name/prophecy.

  EDIT: Oh, and going by the dialogue of both fae monarchs it sounds like they're getting a little tired of following their stories. I don't remember if it was said explicitly, but it sounds like the Queen was kind of hoping that they'd be able to break free of the stories.
  ```

    I don't think Cat is going to get out that easily. I think Ranger will be able to wound the Queen but she will flee and Cat will have to defeat her and their army.
    ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      That sounds like the ideal scenario, honestly. Part of their plan seemed to involve luring the queen into conflict with Diabolist. If there is no queen following, you've lost a lot of strength right before the big fight.

      On the plus side, they still have a captive fae princess. Maesego might be able to make something of that once he recovers.

    ```
    Yeah, I liked the Queen a lot. And Ranger seems deranged (*oh snap*). I'll be rooting for the fae here once Cat gets away.

    (Of course the Queen chose her appearance and behaviour to make this kind of impact, and Ranger's behaviour is likely a good way to counter this kind of deception, but still. Cute!)

  The Woe huh? I like it. Still wondering if Thief has any part of it. Still cheering for Robber getting his piece.
  ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    It's Squire, Adjutant, Hierophant, Thief, and Archer, right? The 5.
    ```

    - u/JdubCT:
      ```
      Yeah, although there are more than 5 Calamities even if there are only 5 "official" ones. Scribe is described as Black's eyes/ears/hands.
      ```

      - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
        ```
        Ah, I see what you're saying. Robber will probably fill this role then.

        Ranger did also mention how the mantle was too 'broad'. Perhaps we'll see Thief/Robber fill into the same role depending on the dictates of the story.
        ```

        - u/Oaden:
          ```
          It doesn't have to be robber, there are other potentials. 

          If we look at how they match:   
          Black = Squire  
          Ranger = Archer   
          Warlock = Hierophant  
          Captain = Adjudant  
          Assasin = Thief?  
          Scribe = Thief?   

          Thief was hired as informant, but takes part in combat at times, if she counts as Scribe, then robber can join as assasin. If thief is assasin, then its more likely that Juniper/Ratface/ someone else takes up the mantle.

          Also, we still have Killian's impending ascesion coming up, though i'm not sure how being fae interacts with names
          ```

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            Thief *so* doesn't fit as assassin. She doesn't murder people much that we have seen, their personalities don't allign in any way (she even said so herself) and most importantly she isn't a villain. Robber fits Assassin role *much* better. Thief seems like a pretty clear Scribe to me - a neutral-ish name responsible for a large spy network serving the leader directly and not affiliated with the other teammates, that leader found on an adventure in a city they visited. Wherever Scribe ever took the field with Black isn't currently known, so it's not clear if combat is even a factor.

            As for Killian...in The Girl Who Climbed The Tower there is a line about "Love ends with the kiss of the knife". Take that as you will.
            ```

            - u/Menolith:
              ```
              The Thief isn't the Assassin, hence the different title, but in broad strokes it works out.

              Cat is the juggernaut who breaks what won't bend, Ranger is basically Archer on steroids, Hierophant is Warlock with a different slant, Adjutant makes the logistics work and Thief is the one who skulks around in situations where throwing Cat at the problem doesn't solve it.
              ```

              - u/melmonella:
                ```
                Robber fits the role much better though, *and* he is personally loyal to Catherine, like a Calamity should be.
                ```

                - u/Oaden:
                  ```
                  Archer isn't loyal to Cat either though.
                  ```

                  - u/melmonella:
                    ```
                    Au contraire.

                    >That was how he’d been talked into going south, anyhow, but he’d wondered why Archer had acquiesced and asked her as much. She’d been sent as a fae expert on loan from Refuge, not a soldier to be used in the Squire’s wars.

                    >“Eh, just staying with the army would have been boring,” she’d replied. “Hakram’s not even around to spar with anymore.”...

                    >...“That seems like a thin motivation,” he’d said.

                    >“The idea of screwing over Sahelian does give me the good kind of shivers,” the woman had admitted. “And, well…”

                    >*Ah*, he’d thought. He could understand the unspoken reason as well. As a boy he’d sometimes wondered why his father did not lead the Calamities. He was the most powerful among them, after all, capable of wiping a city off the face of Creation in a single night. He’d always liked Uncle Amadeus, but like did not usually enter the equation when it came to villains. The strongest held command, that was the natural order. Now, though? He’d learned better. Masego could probably kill Catherine, if he truly put his mind to it. Two days of preparation required at least, but it was doable even with the power she’d gained in Arcadia. He didn’t want to, though, and not just because taking up her burdens would be atrociously inconvenient to his research.

                    >She had a way about her, that… It was hard to explain. Sometimes he thought of it as akin to the way smaller celestial orbs circled around larger ones, but that ignored some fundamental aspects of it. It was warm and nice and almost addictive, being part of the family around Catherine Foundling. That heady sense of belonging, the way that when she talked you believed there was nothing you couldn’t do. Apprentice did not enjoy ‘adventures’, as a rule, but he believed his life would be lesser if he’d not followed Squire on them. And so he did not ask any further questions of Archer, because neither of them would be comfortable with where that conversation would take them. Some things were best left unsaid, and in the end he was not inclined to bare much of himself to this stranger. For all that it was nigh impossible to get the woman to shut up, Masego still knew next to nothing about her or what she was capable of. This was not, he thought, a coincidence.
                    ```

  - u/um_m:
    ```
    As much as I would like Robber to have more screen time, I think members have to be Named??
    ```

    - u/JdubCT:
      ```
      I'm still of the opinion that Robber is already named. The Goblins to all outside appearances don't *have* names but their entire society is built upon secrecy and opacity. If he were named he wouldn't likely tell anyone or be noticed by anyone by the very nature of the name.

      Also, all people who're named are unprecedented or unique in some way. Robber is a *male* leader of his people who spat in the faces of the matriarchs and commands respect from all his mixed-gender underlings(minions).
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        There are other factors too. 

        He was the only [possibly] non-named in the room when Catherine got turned into a zombie, and he had no real good reason to be so close to a pretty clear Pivoting moment besides being Named. 

        He constantly gets into *noticeable* shenanigans that people keep *retelling* afterwards - e.g. that time he rode an explosive mule to Liese gates, whole thing with being a Special Tribune, he composes memorable songs that whole legion keeps singing afterwards, etc. To me it seems like that is one of the things primarily Named do. It's also interesting that I don't think we had a single chapter from his perspective since he became Special Tribune, which would seem like a pretty decent bet on when he might have gotten a proto-Name in order to have it by Liese.

        It's not 100%, but I would be willing to put money on it.
        ```

          Didn't we get one where he was robbing/murdering/looting the corpses of all the Praesi nobles heading to Akua?
          ```

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            I don't seem to remember any chapter like that, no.
            ```

                ```
                ...how the bloody hell did I miss that one? Regardless, it doesn't prove anything one way or another, I don't think. Might make Robber a Name slightly more probable even, if you consider his increased screen time.
                ```

                - u/Ardvarkeating101:
                  ```
                  What if his name *is* Robber, BUM BUM BUM
                  ```

        - u/hoja_nasredin:
          ```
          Could he be the Assassin?
          Nobody have ever seen him, why can't he be a goblin? And he is one of the two goblins Cat spoke to that we haven't seen aging.
          ```

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            He has no real connection with Black, I don't think.
            ```

      - u/um_m:

        Here's to hoping that is true. Robber is my favourite character.

  Missed a brilliant opportunity of Cat snarking "The Woe? More like 'The WHOA!', am I right!?"

  But, uh, I suppose narrowly escaping what is effectively a god and losing several hundred troops in a second kinda takes the wind out of anyone's sails. 

  Speaking of which, was it only a few hundred who died? Or was that only the legion casualties? I'm thinking there were many more deaths from the other factions allied with Cat.

  >It was past noon when the last few hundred began to file through

  This seems to only refer to the legionaries. But at the end we read:

  >The Deoraithe, the legionaries. Nothing left but ashes. She had not protected them.

  Previously in the chapter, it's mentioned that the Deoraithe were given the other portal for evacuation, but specifically it says:

  >I gave Duchess Kegan leave to use that one to **get her people out at her own leisure**, getting the Legions through the one at behind the palisades.

  To me this implies that the Deoraithe probably had many others left behind and covered in fire too, including, perhaps, Kegan herself. If Kegan dies, her friend/aide Adair (in the "Commanders" interlude) would likely take command - and he clearly doesn't think well or much of Cat. I doubt the death of his friend and ruler would improve his perception - the tenuous alliance could fall apart. Or if it's the other way around, Kegan may think this was a plot of Cat's and be enraged at the death of her old friend (and what she likely feels was a narrow escape for herself).  

  Also Winter might also have faced the brunt of Summer's sun:

  >I looked west, to the hill, and saw the silhouette had yet to move. The Prince of Nightfall followed my gaze, single eye narrowing.
  >
  >**“If she is not gone by dawn tomorrow,** I will have my due,” he said.

  Sounds like the Prince of Nightfall was planning on hanging around until the next day, and while the remaining Winter troops might have left with the other Winter royal commanding the force, some could have also stayed and fried with him. Do we know the names of the other two Winter royals, the one who died and the one who lived, by the way?

  Lots of good conversation on who make up "The Woe." I wonder what Ranger meant by the title being "too broad." Perhaps Thief, being a hero, and Archer, being... neutral?... don't fit well enough for an Evil team?
  ```

  - u/IBSC2:
    ```
    No, I think it means that Prince of Nightfall wants another go at Ranger considering he lost his eye to her
    https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/05/03/chapter-8-lies/
    > “Her mistress took the Prince of Nightfall’s eye and set it on a ring,” the soldier barked.
    > “It makes for very tasteful jewellery, if that’s any consolation,” Archer said.
    > “So this is what dying stupidly feels like,” Hakram mused.
    > “I’m sure Lady Ranger will give it back if he asks nicely,” I lied. “Regardless, Archer is part of my retinue. She is not to be touched.”
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      >No,

      No to what? He obviously wants another shot at Ranger, but I don't understand to what your disagreement refers.
      ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    They can do anything, now.  They are Woe to friend and foe.  No story can stop them, their fate is not yet sealed!

    If I say this enough maybe it'll work
    ```
