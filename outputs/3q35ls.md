## [HF][Q] Stories which go in-depth into magic, and the character's reasoning?

### Post:

I just caught the fantasy bug again, after years of not reading anything good. I just caught up reading Mother of learning, and I find the main character's deliberations to be a wonderful change of pace from the standard "I must power up to defeat the evil guy". I was up all night reading the web novel. I'd buy the e-book if the Author ever made one.

Are there any Hard Fantasy stories which you've been reading (online or otherwise) where you feel like the logic of the story and at least one of the main character's decision-making processes as they overcame their obstacles were really effective?

  [Ra.](https://qntm.org/ra) Although I haven't actually read it yet. qntm has a fabulous track record, though.

  * The Lord Darcy stories by Randall Garret.
  * The Incomplete Enchanter series by L Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt.
  * The Wiz Biz series by Rick Cook.

  Not sure if it's considered "hard" fantasy but *Name of the Wind* (Patrick Rothfuss) comes to mind - there are several distinct systems of magic varying from "obeys conservation of energy" to "poorly understood even in-universe", and the main character is narrating his life story so you get the inside view on his thoughts.

  Also the writing is just excellent. I would recommend it on the strength of that alone.

  I'd second suggestions of Ra, or anything by Brandon Sanderson.

    Oh, so you're writing your own! Best of luck. I'm interested in these story types.
