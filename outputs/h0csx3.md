## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  There's a thing that's been bugging me every time I try to write something:

  How do people write so fast!?

  Like, I look at PGtE with its bi-weekly updates, and I look at WtC with its tens of thousands of words per month, and I look at the numerous other serials that update thousands of words regularly, and I'm just utterly baffled by how people can just spew out high-quality content so quickly. 

  Personally, I can only write at a few hundred words per hour, so it'd take me a dozen or more hours just to match that rate, let alone coming up with the ideas and editing it to snuff. Is it a lack of experience? Motivation? Spare time? How do you do it?

    A lot of that comes down to practice and experience. Drive and motivation can take you far but the best way to optimize a route is by walking the walk repeatedly.

    When I started to draw half a decade ago not only was I bad at it but also slow, it took me two hours to make a drawing that right now I would get done in under 15 minutes and probably scoff at. Same thing with writing, I'm well past the 250k words mark, yes most of it is pretty bad, and just thinking about my first few stories makes me cringe, but I'm getting better and I'm getting faster. I used to struggle to reach 1k words in one sitting, now I can do that easily but struggle to reach 3k.

    In writing, and with time, you learn what to do and what to avoid, what suits you and what doesn't, you discover your niche, you find a voice, you either learn to organize yourself better with stuff like outlines or you embrace the unknown and dive into discovery writing. You learn the plots, the characters, how to weave personalities and strengths and weaknesses, you ease yourself into it, you spend less time hesitating, etc. It all adds up.

    Also remember that a lot of what you're seeing is what the writers are willing to publish, what they think is good enough for their readers. They write a lot and they accumulate a lot of experience, for the most part we only get to see the end result.

    The result of crafting or creating something is art, but the act in itself is not, both speed and quality come from excellence, and excellence comes from habit. So keep at it, if you find yourself lacking or not up to stuff [watch a lecture](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSH_xM-KC3Zv-79sVZTTj-YA6IAqh8qeQ), read what other writers have to say [about writing](https://fictionphile.com/best-essays-on-writing/), join a writing group or community, the most important thing however is that you write.

  Random "rationality" question:

  One of the biggest complaints about the medical accuracy of *House* was that all the doctors there seemed to be specialists in everything, running all the tests themselves, when they aren't actually established to be experts on that. 

  A rational story would have to honour that sort of thing, right? Like having doctors go to specialists for tests, having a real estate lawyer not doing murder defenses and a patent lawyer not doing copyright law, and whatever other professions that we chunk all the tiny little specialisations into one big general "X"

  I ask because having one lawyer who does all the law in the story is a really, really handy cop-out, but I know it's actually terrible, and, IDK, I guess I am kind of fishing for "of course you can create an unrealistic world where one lawyer without even a paralegal can handle every kind of law problem there is", which I've already talked myself out of.

  So, more general question: to avoid falling foul of this trope: what professions, like "doctor" or "lawyer", do people assume are polyvalent when really they have narrow specialties and would be relatively lost if they went outside it?

    Scientists. Scientists are well-known for being omnidisciplary in fiction.
    ```

  - u/ironistkraken:
    ```
    Deffinently engineers.  Like a civil engineer probably knows a bit of chemistry because they need to be able to study materials, but it is not the same as being a chemical engineer.  So often you can see these engineers who are not only interested in all areas of engineering but also able to do more complicated work in different fields.
    ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    You could subdivide it a lot. If someone is truly a specialist in their field, and notable for being a specialist, they may be really good at their one thing and the things surrounding that, but not have actually used any related fields since they learned them in college. Someone with a specialty in mechanical engineering may have only half remembered knowledge of how to build an engine because they actually specialize in the mechanical engineering part of materials science, or something like that. A chemist might remember almost nothing about inorganic chemistry because they exclusively work with polymers, and have for the past 20 years.

    Though aside from that, the association between computer scientists and hackers is somewhat extreme. "Oh yeah I'm a world renowned expert in artificial intelligence, but I am also an expert in computer security, despite those two things having little to do with each other, and my job doesn't relate to security in any way".

    If you wanted to have the narrative convenience of a lawyer who knows everything about law without making them unrealistic, you could say that their job in the hospital is to specialize in one thing, but they should have a cursory knowledge of other fields of law, and one of their primary roles is to act as an intermediary between the doctors and whatever legal specialist they actually need. It would require some change, but I think it would be minor overall. A lot of "I had the same question last night when I was talking to X specialist, here's what they said:"
    ```

      ```
      I love the idea of having people lean on other specialists like you're saying: it makes sense especially since you have a professional network, especially if you're already a really top level person (and there's no trouble with writing about the top level people. I remember my husband was watching Stargate with me and he's like "why is Carter both a world-level astrophysicist and an amazing marksman/soldier, that's so unrealistic" and I'm like "dude I'm sure there's probably one person like that in the world today and you can bet an astrophysicist/soldier would be headhunted by the Stargate program in a hot minute").
