  Hmm, what i dont like about the chapter or more the way the story shapes right now is, it goes this "we are a small group of students/friends, and we have to solve all those problems /save the world on our own, and everyone else is not to be trusted/doesnt understand us" Way, which in itself is a fallacy. On another note I really think the focus on learning by doing is super important in RL and by getting someone absolut top level to train you in a way by helping them/working for them... is the absolut bet way to progress. But to some extend we already had this in the beginning with Tenner (expert on demons nice!) but now it kinda feels cheap and slightly out of place , like an easy tool for character and plot progression. I try to hold the story to a really high standard and probably end up a bit to critical, but the beginning felt SO GOOD and now its more like a Well that works kinda thing.
