## [EDU] The Enchiridion, Condensed

### Post:

Since we've had a bit of a lull here, I thought I'd share /u/A_Lobster's condensed version of *The Enchiridion* by Epictetus, an ancient Greek Stoic. The raw .txt is [on Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/CvcneJ9b), though /u/TheWayofTheFuture can supply a formatted .pdf on demand. It was originally posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/2pxbku/ive_spent_the_past_few_days_editing_the/).

**Why does it belong on /r/rational?**

I hold that a rationalist Stoic behaves no differently than a rationalist; the only difference is in how they think. Stoicism is just map-territory distinction cranked up to 11 – mindfulness plus psychological debugging – and provides a pretty solid solution to Camus' absurdity along the way. [It's also repeatedly been demonstrated as a fast and effective treatment for depression](http://www.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Inform_Yourself/About_Mental_Illness/About_Treatments_and_Supports/Cognitive_Behavioral_Therapy1.htm), which is always nice.

While this über-condensed version might read a little bit like the Ten Commandments, I recommend reading the full text. It's longer – each bullet point is expanded into one or two paragraphs – but it explains the reasoning much more thoroughly, even if you read just the first page or so. It's available all over the internet, notably [here](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html).

  Some of these are incompatible with my values like this:

  >XII. It is better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence
  with perturbation.

  And some are just downright silly:

  >XXXII. Let not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant. 

  But there are a couple of good ones and the overall theme seems interesting. Is there any good modern analysis of that philosophy you can recommend to me?

  EDIT: My interest at this point is mostly academic. I don't think a model of behaviour built on ignoring things outside of one's causal reach is a good one for human beings.

    Twelve is fine from the perspective of someone thousands of years ago, who probably didn't expect to live very long anyway. 

    Valuing happiness over some mildly increased lifespan while unhappy is a totally reasonable position. The equivalent is euthanasia today, whee it is completely rational to check out rather than face suffering for a short period of time. There is only negative utility, hell, letting a disease take you out rather than dying while relatively healthy probably even makes resurrection harder if you go the cryonics part.

    This is pretty poor on its own, I agree, and is probably best understood as corrective hyperbole: if someone is distressing themselves about their upkeep, the point is they can drop the distress.  They are very probably not actually going to die if they stop stressing, and an extreme statement like this could open their mind to the possibility that one can still be happy in suboptimal conditions.

    I believe this is a cultural difference.  I seem to remember that laughing in that era was mostly understood as "laughing *at*".

    I think it's more about realistic expectations.  If you don't have absolute control over a thing, then it is wrong to expect that it will always go the way you want it to.  (If it did, then it would be something you had absolute control over.)  If you know that things are not always going to go the way you want them to, then you can be emotionally prepared for that eventuality.  You don't have to discard emotions — you can harness them for whatever productive ends they move you to — but you don't have to let them *debilitate* you.

    Not "ignoring", not at all. "Tying emotional state to." When Epictetus says "Concern yourself not with the weather, for it is outside your influence," he means "You can't control the weather, so don't get all upset when there's rain and clouds on your birthday. Just be happy regardless of the weather."

    Does that make a little more sense?

    >But there are a couple of good ones and the overall theme seems interesting. Is there any good modern analysis of that philosophy you can recommend to me?

    *A Guide to the Good Life*, by William B Irving, has been very helpful to me. It's a pretty straightforward interpretation of Stoic philosophy and an application to the modern day. He's written a few articles [here](http://boingboing.net/author/william_b_irvine), which I also recommend.

    Unfortunately, [quite](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/) a [few](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/) purely scholarly analyses seems to focus less on the philosophy and more on the archaic metaphysics taught by the ancient practitioners. As the SEP says, "Stoicism has never been ‘purely academic’." I'll do some googling and see if I can find anything.

  Epictetus is wonderful, though I hesitate to bring him up around here because he can be read as very deathist.  

  (Of course the actual lesson is not to stress oneself about *anything* one doesn't have absolute power over.  This doesn't mean you can't work to gain more power, just that it doesn't need to perturb you: "I must do X. Must I do X lamenting?")
