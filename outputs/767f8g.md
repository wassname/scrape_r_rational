## [D] Good vs Evil in stories

### Post:

A common theme of a lot of stories is, in a lot of ways, the conflict between good and evil. The villain of the piece is often extremely obviously evil, a [Card-carrying villain](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain); or just obviously misguided in some way. Recently the trend has been towards sympathetic villains, or anti-heroes and the observation that in morality there are many [shades of grey.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayingMorality)

The almost *universal* trend is that [good wins out in the end.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodGuysAlwaysWin). Why is this? I think that fundamentally, on some level, we *wish* that were the case. I mean, one of the main genres often displaying this trope is literally called "wish-fulfilment fantasy."

Is it true in real life that good always wins? It's pretty clear that the answer to that is no, and there's no fundamental reason why good should end up winning. Utility functions can be completely arbitrary, and "effectiveness at achieving your goals" is *rationality*, which is unrelated to which particular values you have, except in the sense that a utility function is the standard by which you judge which actions satisfy your values. I mean, we all know about paper-clip optimisers and so on.

But I'm still confused. Even in *explicitly rationalist* works, for example HPMoR which sort of *started* the trend, Harry wins out in the end, even though Voldemort is extremely competent *and* more experienced. Of course, Yudkowsky did have that "final exam" chapter, where if the readers failed the test, then Harry would also. But we're not in a world where he failed; indeed the solution turned out to be really obvious, disappointing and a bit boring. Some of the answers people came up with were way more fun than what ended up happening.

Was the point of HPMoR that "the power he knows not" is somehow "a desire to do good"? Is it possible at *all* that "trying to do good" somehow *also* makes you better at achieving your goals? I can't figure out what I think about this. It might just be a [halo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) bias showing up; we think that "good" is good, and then our bias predisposes us to generalise that feeling in an invalid way. But this is ultimately a heuristic. So I guess the question I'm thinking about is, to what extent is there a relationship between "the desire to do good" and "being effective at achieving your goals?" What would would we expect to see in the world, if there somehow *was* a positive relationship?

It's clearly obvious that trying to do good does not *cause* you to actually achieve good results in the world. But I suppose the flip-side to that question is, does wanting to do good actually make you *worse* at achieving your goals? That intuitively feels wrong to me, although I don't know how to make a good argument from that. To the extent that our intuitions are accurate, we might feel like the relationship between "wanting good things" and "being effective at achieving your goals" should be at least non-negative.

But what the hell am I saying? Am I actually suggesting that the real world is like a fantasy story? I must be going insane. I think I've just been reading Worth the Candle too much. I'm starting to see the world in terms of "quest hooks" and assign meaning to coincidental events (like how Joon received that book and Fenn keeps insisting that "not everything is a clue," which I agree with.) So if I am starting to feel like every little coincidence is a clue, that must be wrong, and I need to work to change that feeling, if I can. The real world is fundamentally *random* and you should not assign any meaning to random coincidences.

I really like the story but after writing this out I think I have to stop. It's become an unhealthy addiction.

So um...am I completely crazy? Should I seek help?

  I beg to differ on a fundamental point of your argument.

  Harry does *not* win in HPMOR. Rather, Dumbledore does, making great sacrifice and using superior information to end the threat of Voldemort and ensure that the human race continues. (The fact that Dumbledore ends up trapped in the mirror does detract slightly from his victory, but it does not prevent it from being a victory).

  --------------

  As to whether the good guy wins in the end. I think that there is a point to be considered here - the winner is the one who gets to write the history books. And that will make a big difference. Consider the example of South Africa.

  Before 1994, the Apartheid government was in power, and history books spoke mainly of the European settlers and their descendants. The Great Trek featured heavily, and the formation of groups like the ANC was not at all dwelt on.

  Post-1994, the Apartheid government was abruptly (but peacefully) replaced. Suddenly, the Great Trek vanished from the history books, and a whole raft of freedom fighters were suddenly important figures in the school syllabus - where they had simply not been mentioned before.

  There was a distinct and sudden shift in the most accessible narrative. Researchers inclined to look in depth would still find much the same information - but to the ordinary school student, the definition of the historical 'good guys' had just shifted to someone else.

  --------------

  So, then you also bring up the question of whether or not being good helps you achieve your goals.

  To a degree, I think it does, and the reason is this; that a lot of the time, being 'good' involves cooperation, while being 'evil' involves doing things that other people would rather prefer that you didn't do. There are costs to running directly contrary to your neighbour's utility function; for one thing, your neighbour might turn out to be a persistent fellow with a thirst for revenge. On the other hand, an evil neighbour might take advantage if you're feeling cooperative... but if you both cooperate, you can get a lot more done together.

    Problem is that the farther removed you are from the people you're cooperating with, the less you'll *feel* cooperative. And the less you understand what  the other players are doing, the more they'll be able to get away with without you being any the wiser. Good probably wins more often when there are fewer players involved and the group is trying to achieve a simpler task. Make things too complicated with too many agendas and someone might be able to get away with cheating more easily. And then the good guys have to become less cooperative just to keep up and stay in the game. That being said, it's probably all a matter of incentives. Make things less complicated by agreeing to organize your system better, make the rules norms and expectations more clear to all the players, and then it becomes much easier to tell when someone defects. Then you can punish the defector. The punishment for the defection must of course be made clear to everyone as part of the rules. Its a lot easier to stop someone stealing food from their fellow tribe members in the ancestral environment then it is to stop Putin from interfering with the US presidential election in 2016.

      Well, yes. There's limits to the power of cooperation over competition. One of the big ones being that it's a lot harder to stop someone who's got his own group that he's cooperating with than it is to stop a lone rogue.

      And whatever else you may think of Putin, you *really* can't call him a lone rogue. He has the whole of the Russian government to work with.

  > The almost universal trend is that good wins out in the end.. Why is this?

  Because stories are, first and foremost, normative. The myths and campfire tales that have existed since forever are pretty much universally just hyped-up versions of [Goofus and Gallant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goofus_and_Gallant).

  > You, a small forager-child, sit with your grandfather by the fire. He is in a reflective mood. "There are things you should do, and things you shouldn't," he says.

  > "How do I know which is which?" you say.

  > "Well, that's easy. Every night, I tell you stories. Stories my grandfather told me. And there's a reason he passed down these stories to me, and a reason I pass them down to you."

  > "See, there are two kinds of stories. There are stories about winners, and stories about losers. Someone in the future might call these 'comedies' and 'tragedies.'"

  > "A *comedy* is a story about someone who succeeds. The point of a story like that, is to teach you about what qualities winners have. You learn that winners do this, and winners do that, and then you know that if you want to win, you'll do those things too."

  > "I never needed to *tell* you any of that, though, right?" he says, a wise smile on his face.

  > You nod slowly, pondering the stories you've heard. You knew what point a story was trying to make, because a good story makes you like a hero, and so you just want to be like them because you feel like they're your friend. It was never really about winning... was it?

  > "But grandpa, why does the hero of the story have to suffer, then? Why don't they just win from the start?"

  > "Oh, it's to build empathy, certainly, if that's what you're thinking. But it's also to demonstrate that these principles—these things winners do—don't always work over the short-term. They're only good strategies over the *long* term. Things like generosity, they might get you in trouble if you come across a sociopath. But they also make you friends and allies that will help you beat up that sociopath. The qualities winners have, the things that make them triumph, are the same things that make them struggle."

  > "Ah." you say. It all seems a bit less magical, put like this.

  > "And a *tragedy*, well, that's the opposite. The qualities losers have, the things that make them lose in the end—they might work over the short term, but they won't work over the long term. So a tragedy is a story about a person with a flaw, and teaches you the pattern of how having that flaw will play out: it might help them in some ways, but it will end badly. You know all those stories 'bout revenge? You know how everyone in them ends up dead? The point is that wanting revenge doesn't work out in the end. It's a flaw."

  > "Stories are just candy that make the medicine go down. The medicine is a lesson about what kind of person it helps to be, or hurts to be. The candy is an entrancing series of events... and the *best* kind of candy makes you wonder which kind of story this story is going to be. Whether the traits the protagonist has are really good ones or bad ones in this world."

  > "You ever heard a bad story?" he says. You nod. Your little brother tells some sour stories. They never go anywhere, and then they're just... over.

  > "Well, a bad story is just a story that doesn't leave you wondering that. If every one of the protagonist's qualities is obviously going to be helpful or harmful, and they all add up the same way, and the world in the story seems to already have an interpretation in mind... then there's nothing to be found by listening. It's not exciting to hear about Mary the Good who everyone loves. It's not exciting to hear about Xander the Downtrodden who everyone spits on. But if you've got Xander the Good-at-heart, who gets spit on; or Mary the Egomaniac, who everyone loves *for now*... well, *there's* a story that's going somewhere. A story that has something to chew on, about what this kind of person will do."

  > "Huh..." you sigh. "I don't know if I want to hear your stories any more, grandpa. It's all a bit like... brainwashing, isn't it?"

  > "Surely is! Or it tries to be. But even little kids recognize a story that's just reinforcing a moral they've heard before—and they don't want to hear it. Boredom is the best tonic against propaganda. And stories that aren't—stories newly-told, speculative fiction about how people act in situations you've never imagined before—well, just as much as being about who's a winner, they're about inviting you to consider those situations at all. Critical thinking never hurts a good story none; it just gives it children!"

  > "So you know what you do, the next time I tell you a story you don't like?"

  > "...tell my own?"

  > "That's right. And give it a different conclusion. Tell it to me, and see how I like it. That's called *philosophy of ethics*."

  Rational fiction is still *fiction* - you should assume that the authors are going to fall genre convention over realism.

  Please don't assume that reading fiction necessarily makes you more intelligent or aware of real life's genre conventions.
  ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  Fiction *in general* follows a sort-of universal model, which Joseph Campbell identified as the monomyth, and Dan Harmon calls the "story circle", but it's also part of the larger (non-fictive*) "comfort zone" model of human states. Most stories are about a person leaving the zone of comfort, which elevates stress and anxiety (and in turn, concentration and focus), and then returning to that zone of comfort, having changed. That's the basic story structure.



  \* I don't actually know how solid the social science behind this is, but I have a toddler and this is one of the primary models of toddler/child behavior patterns, which I immediately recognized as sharing a lot of similarities with story structure.

  **Rational fiction** is still usually attempting to be **good fiction**, and so will lean toward many of the same conventions. This means that the good guys win, detail is conserved, guns introduced in the first act get fired in the third, etc. The *difference* is that a good writer of rational fiction is aware of how the audience marks all these principles and works to subvert or re-contextualize them, *and*, in making a work rational, will justify why these things are the case, if they happen in-universe. In other words, the good guys win because that usually makes for a more satisfying story, and in rational fiction the good guys don't just win because they're the good guys, they win on their merits, within the logic the story presents.

  I think "good guys always win" is only a false trope when taken in the aggregate; it's not unbelievable that the good guys win one story, but it's unbelievable that all the stories we have, with few exceptions, are ones in which the good guys win; it indicates a huge sampling bias. You don't need to worry about that sampling bias when writing one individual story, in my opinion, if the aim is realism.

  > Was the point of HPMoR that "the power he knows not" is somehow "a desire to do good"?

  I'd like to point out that HP:MoR doesn't really aim to be realistic in the first place. The whole "Good vs Evil" thing is an unrealistic dynamic to begin with; in real life, conflicts are between people with incompatible or competitive goals, not between a 10-yo and a bored sociopathic demigod. The conflicts we see in HP:MoR is engineered by higher forces (Dumbledore, Fate, Voldemort).

  Real life conflicts don't have to be zero-sum. They can be (for instance, there's not much common ground between Occidental interests and Daesh's interests), but most conflicts are borne out of coordination problems, not fundamental differences. Regulatory capture, realpolitik, immigration crises, poverty, corruption, etc. We solve them through social engineering, better law-making and technological advances, not finding evil people and punching them in the face.

  If we're talking about large scale "my army of knights vs your army of orcs" conflicts, then again most fiction isn't realistic. Stories are about individuals, superheroes, super-spies, charismatic rebels, secret agents, etc; but in real life 99% of conflict is massively controlled by governments, because governments are *based* on having a monopoly on military strength. A "government" can take the form of feudal lords, bureaucratic institutions, a ruling caste, etc, the general principle is "the ones in charge are the ones with the most guns". Good and evil and ideologies don't really factor.

  > So I guess the question I'm thinking about is, to what extent is there a relationship between "the desire to do good" and "being effective at achieving your goals?" What would would we expect to see in the world, if there somehow was a positive relationship?

  A good first step towards being effective in the struggle between good and evil is "Don't break the law because then you end up in jail". 

  We like to glorify being an underdog, being the lone hero who has to defeat the cunning villain, but in real life? People like Voldemort are the underdog who must hide from the law. Real conflict isn't between the likes of Batman and Joker, it's between Random Cop #48 and Random Thug #21, and Random Cop usually wins.

  > To the extent that our intuitions are accurate, we might feel like the relationship between "wanting good things" and "being effective at achieving your goals" should be at least non-negative.

  That sounds like magical thinking to me. I mean, in most social situations, not being an asshole means people respect you meaning it's easier to get your way, but it doesn't *have* to apply, and it certainly doesn't always apply in high-stakes situations like business or politics.

  On the other hand, enlightened self-interest and the invisible hand of the market are a thing. Institutions with less corruption are more profitable, trade deals make war less likely, allowing women to drive is good for the economy even when you're Saudi Arabia, etc.

  That doesn't mean "being on the side of Good gives you a boost on your stats", because on an individual level there are effective selfish people and ineffective altruistic people, but on aggregate, over long periods of times, institutions made of selfish people are out-competed.

  tl;dr: Most conflict isn't about good or evil, it's about governments, coordination problems and people not being consequentialist enough. Good eventually triumphs over evil because it makes more money.

  **WARNING:** This post may make you depressed. Not as much as I am though.

  Good always prevails, Truth in real life because of the anthropic principle. 

  If evil ever truly wins, then humanity is extinct. 

  Otherwise, evil victories are only ever temporary. As long as humanity continues to exist, eventually, by sheer random chance, evil will lose and good will win again. At which point everyone can go "oh look Good wins in the end!"

  ==========================

  Which is of course, cognitive dissonance at work. We live in a world full of evil and suffering, and no one has found a way to do anything about it. So we have all convinced ourselves into believing that good wins in the end, or that good ever wins at all. I mean, sure, that's technically true, every force of evil will eventually be defeated by sheer random chance. But what has Good actually won here? All that's happened is we have learned to say that the truncheons hitting us on the head are awesome. 

  It's the same in fiction too. Saying "Oh look Voldemort is dead, GOOD WON!" is self-delusion at its finest. All of the evils wrought by Voldemort have not been righted. Harry's biological parents? Still dead. An entire society of wizards is still scarred and traumatized by the magical war. The truth is, the moment someone is murdered, Evil has already won, for all eternity. Unless you have some kind of resurrection power, that person is dead forever. And even if you somehow resurrect the victims, the damage has already been done. Their lives have been permanently and drastically altered against their will.

  If you came from somewhere where good truly wins, where no one is ever murdered/raped/assaulted/etc, you would not call anything that happens in reality or fiction a victory for good.

  I think the phenomenon happens a little differently. It's not that the author (necessarily) picks a "good" side and a "bad" side, then makes the good side win. It's that the author picks a side they intend to have win (in regular fiction, through the use of plot conceits. In rational fiction, by messing with the initial conditions), and once that side is picked, the author makes that side sympathetic.

  Now, theoretically speaking, any side could have been picked to win (for example, tolkien could have picked mordor, and then made mordor the sympathetic side), but that's when we get into narrative casuality: authors are more interested in writing about characters that fit into particular patterns, which means that most stories that get made feature characters that the authors enjoy making win, which in turn means that characters following the morals of the author win.

  Which leads to a rather interesting point: that in many stories, there will be no "good" side (as defined by your morality). But you don't choose to read stories written by, say, neo-nazis, or ISIS, so you're not  exposed to the "bad" guys winning.
  ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  It depends on your definitions, of course.  Trivial example:  if you define "Good" as "has the strongest army" then generally the Good country will win.

  A more common definition of Good would be something like "that which promotes human weal and averts human woe, both to the greatest degree feasible".  By this definition, Good will still tend to triumph, because:

  1) Humans are social creatures who are capable of working together well

  2) Working together makes it easier to accomplish more and bigger things

  3) In general, humans dislike social defectors (the greedy, the liars, the murderers) and will punish them -- send them to jail, kick them out of office, etc.  There's a certain amount of net 'Evil' (i.e., their 'Evil' actions less their 'Good' actions) that an individual can get away with,  but if they go beyond that point they will suffer consequences that reduce or eliminate their ability to do 'Evil.'

  4) Civilizations that are run by 'Evil' individuals tend to collapse, as too many of the resources are consumed by the leader(s) instead of being devoted to food, irrigation, etc.  Also, 'Evil' leaders make other nations nervous, which often hastens their demise.

  Given the above, most nations that survive for long periods will be 'Good' and most people within those nations will be 'Good'.  Obviously, there are major exceptions, such as nations run by xenophobic lying bigots guilty of sexual harassment, fraud, and collusion with the enemies of their country.  Still, those people typically end up ousted eventually.

  So, yes.  'Good' does tend to win.  You can tell by the fact that the world has been getting better for a long time.  I'm obviously generalizing a great deal and there have definitely been major bumps in the upward road, but  the road *is* upward-trending overall.
