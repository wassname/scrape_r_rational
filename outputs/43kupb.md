  I'm getting worried that I don't have the knowledge base to keep up with this story. Even when I went to church, we never talked about the kabbalah.

  Are you expecting that readers will need a specific theological background to get all the jokes in Unsong? And if so, is there an introductory text you can recommend?

  Or is the theology of Unsong more of a mish-mash of copyright law and information theory not based in any specific tradition, and we just need a lot of general knowledge to keep up?

    ```
    There will be injokes that are funnier if you know the background, but you should be able to enjoy the plot whether you know it or not. The book itself will explain the parts you need to know as you go on (as with Interlude Bet)

      HOW MANY JOB JOKES ARE YOU GOING TO WORK INTO WORKS ON THEODICY?

      ^^As ^^many ^^as ^^you ^^can ^^work ^^in, ^^I ^^hope? ^^Sorry ^^not ^^sorry.

        Hopefully as many as possible.

    I expect the author will take great delight in having the character explain the cleverness to us not too far after it happens. (Aside from the challenges for the comments section, like the book titles and the Ithaca reference.)
    ```

    - u/PM_ME_UR_OBSIDIAN:

      Scott is notorious for blink-and-you'll-miss-it jokes, a bit like GRRM handles foreshadowing except with more puns.
      ```

      > (Aside from the challenges for the comments section, like the book titles and the Ithaca reference.)

      The Ithaca reference did, in fact, have a character delight in explaining the cleverness.
      ```

- u/DarkVeracity:
  ```
  > They had the usual sci-fi/fantasy classics: Tolkien, Asimov, Salby.

  Apparently Leonard Salby's around and publishing in Unsong. Given the setting, it seems fair to assume that The Northern Caves is a work of utter and complete kabbalistic brilliance.

  >“HELP!” shouted Ana. “IMMIGRANTS ARE STEALING MY JOB!”

  I actually burst out laughing.
  ```

- u/SvalbardCaretaker:
  ```
  Minor nitpick:
  Sounds like Ana is aromantic in addition to being asexual- I'd expect someone of her eloquence to use both applicable terms.
  ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    Indeed, was a bit strange when she went on about that while refusing the date when the word aromantic would have summarised it.
    ```

    - u/sir_pirriplin:
      ```
      I for one appreciated it. I prefer it when writers write with lots of common words explaining exactly what is going on instead of summarising with the "proper" word.

      It's kind of like "show don't tell", isn't it? Have Ana explain how she feels instead of just saying the word "aromantic".
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    She might not actually be aromantic, though. If she had been romantically attracted to people in the past, for instance, but wasn't with Aaron. Or she was homoromantic. Or she wasn't totally sure, and was sticking with asexual until she figured it out. Or she didn't want to confuse him, and figured she could get her meaning across by saying "asexual". Or she didn't like dating people, but knew she could become attracted to people after knowing them for long enough.

  Corporations willingly named themselves amalek and gog-magog....why?
  ```

  - u/ScottAlexander:
    ```
    Sniffnoy has the right explanation [here](http://unsongbook.com/chapter-5-never-seek-to-tell-thy-love/#comment-702), but don't check if you want to figure it out yourself.
    ```

      [](#s "Doesn't that still leave the question of why those companies would willingly name themselves that? Or are the existing real-world companies the same in UNSONG but referred to exclusively as their morphed names by the characters?")
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        I think only the nickname-hypothesis makes sense, which means it's true because nothing is a coincidence.

        Now if only kabbalists had not made the theonomic corps malignant by so (re)naming them!
        ```

    - u/SometimesATroll:
      ```
      The devil did it?
      ```

    - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
      ```
      This is like the opposite of Hanlon's Razor, right here, and I feel kinda stupid now.
      ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    And fucking *Serpens*, in a world where some form of Judeo-Christianity has been proven true.
    ```

    - u/avret:
      ```
      I actually didn't catch serpens on first read-through...downsides of only being knowledgeable in Jewish theology, I suppose.
      ```

      - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
        ```
        I don't think a Christian angle is even required.  It was Genesis, part of the Torah, where the serpent did its thing, and even without original sin theology or the serpent being Satan, it was still the first in a long-series of fuckups, and a bad enough fuckup to get cursed by God to not-having-legs.

        I'm picturing a particularly boneheaded entrepreneur who has pretty much zero exposure to the Bible looking through the Bible for a Biblical name for their startup and literally stopping on the first page.  "Oh, yeah, we're just like the serpent!  We bring divine knowledge!  Fund me!"
        ```

          Hardly unbelievable. Wasn't there a story about a child named Moloch because his parents liked the sound of it?

            Did he go on to purposelessly ride the incentive train to high levels of administration?

    Kabbalistic reasons.

  - u/sir_pirriplin:
    ```
    Maybe they are called something else but Erica calls them unflattering names in the same way Slashdot commenters say "Micro$oft"

  >The big yud was a Stevensite symbol. These were Stevensites. It fit.

  This has obvious kabbalistic implications.
  ```

  - u/fubo:
    ```
    Some blogger or other calls Eliezer Yudkowsky "Big Yud".
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      The origin is likely [the Ballad of Big Yud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXARrMadTKk). Nostalgebraist over on tumblr, the ultimate source of the Salby referenced in this chapter, uses "\#Big Yud" as his general tag for rationalist stuff, but I'm pretty sure his use derives from that video. I have seen it show up a bunch of places.
      ```

      - u/fubo:
        ```
        Oh. Wow, that video is really very silly.
        ```

        - u/boomfarmer:
          ```
          It reminds me of a lot of [filk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filk_music) stuff (probably because it is). Stuff like [Minus Ten and Counting](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8394E70A4DB81B5D) and Steam Powered Giraffe's [Rex Marksley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHE9IIIbRm8).

  ```
  >She shut her book with great force. “Did you really say ‘just a word’? You call yourself a kabbalist! Words have power! Words are the only tools we have to connect the highest levels of our intellect to the mysteries of reality! Once we describe something with a word, things happen! It’s been given a life of its own! The angels are on notice, working their secret little works around it, starting reverberations that echo across the entire structure! Words are the vestment of divinity, the innermost garments of Juan!”

  &nbsp;
  >“I don’t even know where I am! I don’t even know your names! In my head I’ve been calling her ‘Weird Hair Girl’ and you -” I cut myself off before I said something like ‘the girl I am going to marry.’ 

  Whoops.
  ```

- u/SpeakKindly:
  ```
  > 86% of known Names are held by eight big theonomic corporations. Microprosopus. Gogmagog. Amalek. Countenance. Tetragrammaton. ELeshon. And Serpens, the biggest, with $174 billion in assets.

  This looks like seven big theonomic corporations to me.
  ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    You're forgetting The One With No Name, of course.
    ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      I was hoping for something like that! I was really disappointed when the typo got fixed.

- u/themousehunter:
  ```
  Whenever anyone brings up the word "whale" to me, I will now henceforth burst out laughing. AHH THIS CHAPTER IS SO GOOD.
  ```

  - u/themousehunter:
    ```
    Also...I just noticed that the whale references are mentioned in chapter one. And chapter two. 

    I think I need to reread all of this now, because somehow my mind has forgotten all of it.

    > Ana and I had a running contest to come up with the worst Biblical whale pun. She always won.

- u/Darth_Hobbes:
  ```
  From Scott in the site's comments:

  >I guarantee at least three high-quality political summits with the Devil before we’re done here.

  I wonder how far ahead he's written, given the confidence he has expressed that the book won't miss an update this year?
  ```

- u/gryfft:
  ```
  Just got that RES -> ESR. *The Temple and the Bazaar* indeed.
