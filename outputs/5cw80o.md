  The fanfiction.net version also includes an Author's note as usual, which I suppose I'll put here for those who want to read it: 


  **A/N**: I'm not sure everyone fully appreciates what just happened, so let me give a brief summary of humanity's history so far.

  There once was a species which inhabited a universe so hostile to life that throughout their entire existence, they never once detected a sign of any other race in the galaxy. Even on their own planet, the very sun which gave them life brought death also, and the plants and animals around them all competed to devour each other. In fact, the very basis of life from which they arose was uncontrolled cellular replication - also known as cancer - meaning that the very darkness they so despised lived within them and fought to break free. Creatures of paradox, they were Order given birth by Chaos, and the instant Order failed their bodies were consumed by the very same Chaos that gave them life.

  Faced with this stark reality, humanity divided into two groups: Those who gave up hope and embraced Chaos - quieting their minds and telling themselves pleasant lies to avoid having to face the darkness - and those who fought back. Those who embraced chaos enjoyed far greater numbers, for they reproduced and consumed with no heed for the consequences, but those who were of Order devised technology and culture, and they slowly grew in power. Time and time again great civilizations rose up as Order thrived, only for the insidious forces of Chaos to rise up and consume them the moment they let down their guard. After the Second Great Darkness, the forces of Order declared themselves to have learned their lesson, and said "Never again!" They resolved that from that point onwards, all the forces of Order would practice constant vigilance against Chaos, working together regardless of their own feuds and vowing never to let down their guard for the sake of Civilization itself.

  And then a few generations later they voted for a man who acted almost entirely at random, asking without any trace of irony: "What's the worst that could happen?"

  We now return to your regularly scheduled Naruto fanfiction.
