  Chapter 65 is [here](https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/2017/12/29/monitoring-renzo-posada-null/). 

  Year 1 is done, and Heroes Save the World is now on (planned!) hiatus. It will be returning, with the first Sequence of Year 2, in mid-April. I've been working out what I need to do in order to accomplish my goals this year, and I anticipate publishing three Sequences (39 chapters) this year.
