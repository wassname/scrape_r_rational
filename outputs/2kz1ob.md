  Good to see this on the first day of RaNoWriMo. Thanks for posting, /u/Yxoque!

  On that note, I'm a bit surprised I've never seen *The Fall of Doc Future* posted here before ...

  > And as long as I’m on the subject: ‘literary’ stories about broken people becoming even more broken are not fun to read on grounds of pure hedonics.  If you try to countersignal that your story must be very hip and contrarian because it offers so little merely pleasurable reward for reading it, don’t expect to sucker anyone self-aware enough to have moved on past meta-contrarianism.

  I'm not sure if I'm misinterpreting, but surely there's nothing wrong with sad stories.

    My view on this: This isn't a property of sad stories, it's more specific than that. The examples of the genre he mentions I think of are *Death of a Salesman* and the collected works of J.D. Salinger, particularly *Catcher in the Rye*. They're about unsympathetic, stupid people, who make poor decisions and end up less sympathetic and just as stupid as they started.

    It's OK to write stories where the challenges are insurmountable and the main characters lose, or where you make them suffer a lot. (Luminosity does the first, and nearly everything Alicorn writes does the second.) But if the characters aren't worthy of any respect and neither are the things they accomplished, and there isn't any pleasure from the resolution, there's nothing to draw in the reader.

      Basically, it's the difference between the first part of Up and, like, everything with Batman in it.

      *The Catcher in the Rye* isn't about accomplishment. And I don't think that stories need to be about resolution either. Sometimes a story is just an exploration of how a person thinks, or how the world works, and I think that there can be an immense value in that. I watched a movie recently - though I can't recall the title - that was all about broken people being broken. And at the end of the movie, no one had gotten any less broken, and stupid decisions had been made, but those decisions were realistic ones, and those broken people were fully realized characters. I like reading stories about people making bad choices, because if they're well-written there's an enormous amount of complexity there - even if the character isn't sympathetic.

      It sort of goes without saying that I heavily disagree with Yudkowsky on the topic of literary merit. Those essays are a great guide to writing stuff that Yudkowsky would like, but he seems to be betraying an enormous lack of empathy for people who aren't himself. The jab at "literary" works was probably the worst part of it.

      But I'm an English major, so maybe I'm just showing my biases.

        Data and Philosophy here: Yes. Yudkowsky is trashing a vast number of stories. I think that there are large classes of fiction that would be better if people followed his rules, including most mainstream SF&F, detective novels, and most other things that get called "genre". That's part of why I linked: I expect most of the things I see written this NaNoWriMo to be "genre" in this sense.

        I agree with you that there's a lot of other good sorts of stories, that portray people and help one understand something different. It took me years of being exposed to "great books" to finally get my hands on All The King's Men, which showed me this alternate path. I imagine most people have a book like that. But those are a fairly small minority of what tends to get written, so I felt comfortable including his advice.

      Many people are drawn in by the stories you mentioned as examples and consider them quite powerful, so....

      - u/VorpalAuroch:
        ```
        None of them I've met has ever been able to articulate why those stories are not considered trash, when it's come up, so I'm fairly sympathetic to the notion that they are, in fact, trash, and are admired only because it signals sophistication.

        Also, I have met certain teenagers who were as stunted and unsympathetic as Holden Caulfield or the Lomans (Linda excluded; she's the only remotely sane person in that story). Those people might find the story more interesting, since they could actually see themself in the characters to some extent.

          "Trash" is a strong word. If you haven't met anyone who can *articulate* why *Death of a Salesman* and J.D. Salinger's works aren't considered trash, you have not been meeting the right people.
          ```

          - u/VorpalAuroch:
            ```
            Well, if you did so, that would be an existence proof. If you can't, I'll continue to be skeptical those people actually exist.
            ```

    Wow.  Actually, this is one of those times when I'm just unequivocally agreeing with Eliezer.  There really are some stories that offer no deep meaning beyond the fact that the author is just kinda an emo kid who needs to grow the hell up.

    But then again, there's a large fraction of the human race that's constantly obsessed with its own brokenness, so much so that I've often wondered if *we're* the unusual ones for simply *not wanting to be broken at all*, or not wanting to dwell on such.
    ```

    ```
    Keep in mind that Yudkowsky writes with a specific goal: teaching people new things they can use in their own lives. Maybe this advice should be seen in that light?
