## Can we have threads dedicated to Brainstorming rationalist versions of existing stories?

### Post:

What the title says, really. Unfortunately, most stories never receive the treatment they deserve to create enjoyable longstanding reads/watches/plays, due to budget cuts, author conflicts or dozens of other potential problems. Transformative works are an excellent way to ~~"rationalize"~~ "fix" their issues and expand the best parts, exemplified by *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* (I think we can all agree that that fic is the gold standard for Rational!Fanfiction).

A while ago there was [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1qdi45/my_potential_rationalist_fic_which_i_probably/) in /r/HPMOR about a potential rewrite for *His Dark Materials* (warning: link contains spoilers) and it generated plenty of healthy discussion. 

These wouldn't be purely negative critique threads, but breakdowns and evaulations and "It would be super cool if *this* had happened!"

What I want is to break all the restrictions stories seem to presuppose on themselves. Love it or hate it, *Worm* executed this really, really well. It took its premise and went as far as it possibly could, never lacking for creativity or logical exlpanations. 

We need more of that. We need stories that go to the logical extremes and *don't stop*. The stories where the hero takes the logic of the world, whatever it is, and makes it work for them, and achieves as much as possible, never mind the challenge or even merely reaching their original goal.

But not everyone is Eliezer Yudkowsky, so it might take more than one mind to fully exploit the potential of every story. Thus: Brainstorm threads. Think it'll work?

    > The title couple should show off things like clear communication, frontal override without sacrificing enjoyment, outside view, trust, concern for eachother's happiness... basically all the elements of a really healthy relationship. The idea would be to teach readers how to love the same way HPMoR teaches them to think. Because it isn't obvious, and the selection of fictional role models is terrible.

    This is a *service to mankind*, and I will pay money to whoever writes it.

      A service to mankind? It sounds boring as shit. Sorry to be so blunt as that, but you need conflict on some level to drive a story.

      Edit: didn't mean to offend, upon re-reading I could have worded this better. What I meant is that your summary sounds a bit too "and they all lived happily ever after", except from start to finish instead of just the end.

    *Alternately*, the tale of Romeo and Juliet becomes a story about two houses who are locked into a feud over something less trivial. The Montagues are deontologists, while the Capulets are consequentialists (or something). This would be a lot better if you had two philosophies which are more or less incompatible, with Romeo and Juliet forging a third way together which synthesizes the two.

  You appear to be describing stories that engage in Serial Escalation or try to go Beyond The Impossible.  I SUPPORT THIS VERY MUCH AND SUGGEST VIEWING LOTS OF GAINAX OR TRIGGER ANIME AS PREPARATION.

  Now, as to desired rationalfics:

  * *Assassin's Creed* done with a whole lot more idealism, as a way of teaching meta-ethics.  Just to make it ambiguous who "deserves to win", the Templars are attempting a Phlebotinum Singularity using Bostrom's idea of a Singleton (ie: have only one decision-maker in control to prevent existentially-risky wars), while the Assassins show a better understanding of real human values but favor a more anarchist politics (needless to say, they refuse to use the Pieces of Eden on people and treat them as *highly dangerous*) even if this means violence is more common.  This gets back to the conflict from the first game about how one defines ideals like "peace" or "freedom" in a complex world of multiple, conflicting ideologies.

  * Tengen Toppa Gurren Rationality.  Absolutely nothing is changed from the original, since the characters' hotbloodedness really is the best way to use Spiral Power.  Tutorial in so-called Fun Theory.  In fact, just go watch all of the following to learn about Fun: FLCL, Evangelion, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Little Witch Academia, Kill la Kill.

  * Rational *Attack on Titan*.  Instead of being a tutorial in blindly aggressive fascism, the story focuses on Armin and Mikasa more, and steadily becomes a portrait of what it actually means to live in a world constantly on the brink of existential risk.  Hopefully someone manages to cover the "life worth living" point that x-risk guys sometimes miss.

  I [already tried my hand at Terminator](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time), though there are a lot of holes that need plugging to make the Terminator canon actually work. If you've got a time machine ... well, you wouldn't use it to go back in time and kill someone's mother unless you were a somewhat autistic AI.

  I'm [trying to write the rational version of Santa Claus](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Day-That-Santa-Stole-Christmas) in time for Christmas, since there's a lot of lore there that doesn't make all that much sense. Santa's got panopticon surveillance of all the world's children (at the very least), the industrial capacity to dwarf the smaller nations, and the ability to reach every house in a single day. *And he uses this to distribute presents.* I've got two more chapters written, but I'm sort of stuck wondering what the central conflict really is - right now, I'm thinking institutional inertia from the elves, but I'm not sure that can be concluded in a satisfactory manner.

  But yes, in general I support the idea of threads dedicated to "What would a more rational version of X look like?". If you start posting them, I'll start commenting on them.

  I have, on occasion, floated the idea of Rational!Animorphs. What I really like about the idea is that you don't necessarily need to upgrade your main characters *that much*, because you can spread the power across the five (or six) of them.

  * Jake becomes much better at actual tactics. He reads up on military history so that he has something to fall back on when things get really hard. He's very good at instrumental rationality: using what he can to win more and making sure the blade cuts the enemy. 

  * Marco is the designated skeptic and science-guy. He's also the one keeping the bigger picture in mind, something the others sometimes forget and tends to question the alien's motives more than the others. He's also the one who thinks things through the furthest, looking at all aspects of the battleplan (before initial combat, after that it's Jake's call) and munchkin's their power the hardest. He's also (together with Rachel) one of the main consequentialists of the group.

  * Cassie is great at psychology. She understands people and their biases, but also knows how to use the dark arts and manipulate them. She's also the one who has the easiest time seeing the aliens as persons and looking at their different values. Furthermore, her knowledge of animals gets a major upgrade, which aids the rest of the group in using their powers optimally.

  * Rachel is the one who goes furthest in order to win, who is willing to sacrifice the most. Her values differ somewhat from the others, in that she doesn't mind all the fighting and even enjoys it. After Jake, she's the best at snap decision making and getting the job done. (To be honest, I'm not quite sure what rationality upgrade to give her. She's mainly characterized by being freakishly good at fighting.)

  * Tobias, apart from being a bird, is a good all-rounder. He's able to lead, is smart and can be willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. His main upgrade would be a strong adherence to the truth. He can't stand falsehoods and helps others see what's really out there.

  * Ax's main role would be "token alien", but he's also the one with very different values from the rest of the team. I'd need to do some figuring out how this shows exactly, but Andalites should definitely think differently than humans.

  The story would be quite similar in the beginning, but escalate quickly. The animal forms allow for excellent stealth missions and they'd resort to sneaking in explosives into the Yeerk pools. Open confrontations would be avoided but probably still happen frequently (no plan survives enemy contact, after all). In response, the Yeerks (and especially Visser Three) would escalate as retaliation, which would lead to open war a lot quicker. The Yeerks would also be better at infesting key persons, giving them more power to cover up these escalations.

    A single chapter from the yeerk viewpoint as they simply *crush* the animorphs would probably be more realistic. In the series the yeerks were downright incompetent.

    Like... why are the yeerks focused on a single town? Six guerrilla fighters ruining your small-scale invasion? You have the resources to run more than one small-scale invasion concurrently.

    Or why are they so bad at security? No ability to seal the exits? No guards at entrances? No snipers? No video recording? No identification? No passwords? No strict scheduling? No two hour waiting periods in isolation?

    Plus they suck at actually invading. Why not infest *the rest* of familes ("I think we should eat at McDonalds...")? Why not take over a hotel and then waltz into rooms every night and infest the guests (to be fair, they did take over a hospital but *only one*)? What about the bathrooms at conventions? At the theme park? Airports?

    I really like the books, but I try not to think about how little the enemy is trying when I read them.

        Briefly, the main "hypertext fiction" community is closely tied to liberal arts academia, and inherits the toxic culture thereof. There's a heavy focus on formal experiments of the sort that one can write about in a thesis, rather than on making use of the medium to say something that needs saying.

  Oh, and *while I'm at it*, someone really needs to do a rationalist-focused deconstruction of *Dune*.

  Basically, it's an entire series starring almost nothing but transhumans who all behave as what are, by our moral standards, *incredibly, massively backwards psychopaths*.  The bizarre thing being that they are explicitly stated to have physical, mental, and even *spiritual* capacities well above us, and are even (again, *explicitly*, in-universe) noted to have avoided domination by UFAI (by banning computers and replacing them with advanced mental powers in humans).  At least in my eyes they should have "gone transhuman" and Lived Happily Ever After a long fucking time ago.  Instead, they spend their time backstabbing the fuck out of each other and instituting feudal regimes we moderns would consider cripplingly, idiotically reactionary and backwards.

  It's like a whole series spent portraying, in the *coolest* way possible, the near-terminal moral failure of a universe-wide human civilization.

  I've had a vague idea for a **Rationalist [Starship Troopers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers)** fic, not strictly contradicting canon but working on the premise that the narrator of the original has a very limited perspective, so explaining the background of the story universe in more hard sciencey detail.

  One element would be a more complex understanding of the arachnid enemies, who in the original book are a human level technological society. My idea being that they are hyper specialised but still human level intelligence, think a whole breed of savants in a particular field, but with virtually no ability to change skills. 

  I would then contrast with the human society, and try to give a more realistic account of how a society where citizenship is dependent on military service would work. There may also be opportunities for game theory style discussion of how the relationships between the different species work. 

  Only problem is I have a lot of background info dump material but not really a plot in mind... Vague idea is to have viewpoint character as a science officer on one of the military ships, who is the only one remotely qualified in the area so has to deal with everything from stellar formation to novel viruses on the ship.

  Rational Superman. Only, instead of Superman, the focus is either on Lois Lane or Lex Luthor. I've always found (certain interpretations/portrayals of) Lex Luthor to be rather compelling. He'd got an iron will, he's super-intelligent, and he provides some pretty compelling points against Superman even when Superman is the big blue boy scout who never does anything wrong. So his thing would be about first discovering that Superman has a secret identity, and then trying to find some way to either kill or control him. I don't know, might be the next thing that I work on.

  >(I think we can all agree that that fic is the gold standard for Rational!Fanfiction).

  I don't think we can.  It doesn't really fix/rationalize things about Harry Potter; it's more often just an Author Tract for Yudkowsky's views on rationality.

  It is one of the premier examples, but we shouldn't promote a *deliberate* Author Tract (as in, he has *come out and said* it's an Author Tract) to gold-standard status.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Author-tract seems to me in danger of becoming the new "Mary Sue," meaning a real negative trope that loses its meaning by overdiagnosis.

    I'm aware that Yudkowsky calls his own story an Author Tract, but that doesn't mean he's right to do so.  When I think of Author Tract, I think of books like The Elementary Particles, or authors like Ayn Rand and Terry Goodkind. Not HPMOR.

    There's a clear distinction between ideas that people fashion a story around and stories that people put their ideas into.  HPMOR is the latter, and thus while it at times clearly reflects the values of its author, it doesn't sacrifice the story for them.

    At the end of the day, anvilicious writing is to some degree relative. But along the spectrum, it strikes me as odd that someone would desribe HPMOR as so. I've never read a single chapter in HPMOR that took me out of the story: even the most monologuey sections still fit the characters and context. 

    The same cannot be said for true author tract "stories."  Anyone who has read The Sword of Truth can name the moments when the author clearly sacrificed his story and characters' integrity for the sake of soapboxing. Even when agreeing with that particular soapbox, it's annoying and obvious author-tracting.

    I'd honestly like to know at what points Yudkowsky has done the same.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Chapter 7 was the first time that I thought the story was suffering for its soapboxing. That's the chapter where Draco says he's going to rape Luna, and Harry gives a big speech about how backwards their society is. It's since been rewritten a few times, and I still feel that way on rereading.

      The other large part is the Patronus v2.0, which works much better than the original version *because the main character believes and is apparently correct about something that the author thinks is true*.

      I think the big reason that people don't want to classify HPMOR as an author tract is the negative connotations of that label. The label has negative connotations because so often it's done poorly, and this is basically the argument that Yudkowsky makes when he says that HPMOR is an author tract. It's not a negative thing to have a work of fiction that quite explicitly expresses the author's viewpoints in great detail, but it's poorly done most of the time.

        I 100% definitely agree with the Patronus v2.0

        It just a very very silly thing. And the idea that he can cancel all other patronuses just by saying a few words is perhaps even worse. Because it implies that people actually think seriously and comprehend all of the input really needed before their patronus breaks even though from their entire life they have been casting patronus in the exact same way that it would be ritual rote.

          An idea which Harry has never in fact tested to confirm, mind you. I suspect he's not quite as right about that weapon in his back pocket as he thinks he is.
          ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        I can't speak for what previous versions of the story or chapters said, but currently chapter 7 doesn't come off as soapboxy at all. This goes to the general misuse of what "soapboxing" even means... it's not "has an opinion on something and goes into detail as to why." It's also not just a matter of disagreement on some moral issue (meaning, if you think it's judgmental to call a society where an elite nobility feels entitled to get away with whatever they do to lower classes "backwards," calling someone making such a judgement out for "soapboxing" is equally incorrect).

        >The other large part is the Patronus v2.0, which works much better than the original version because the main character believes and is apparently correct about something that the author thinks is true.

        Right, and because the topic at hand is "magic," it seems really odd to me that people bring this up.  By definition, any rule of magic works in a story because the author ultimately decides that's how it will work.  It's not like the belief contradicts anything else in the HP world, and it's internally consistent.  So what's the issue?

        JK Rowling wrote in a spell that worked based on the Power of Love to shield someone from an "unblockable curse," and the implications of that were never even mentioned again.  Compared to that, Patronus 2.0 is probably the most rational form of magic in the series.

        >I think the big reason that people don't want to classify HPMOR as an author tract is the negative connotations of that label... It's not a negative thing to have a work of fiction that quite explicitly expresses the author's viewpoints in great detail, but it's poorly done most of the time.

        Which is why I distinguished making a story to push an idea vs using a story as a medium for communicating ideas.  HPMOR is the latter, and regardless of connotations, referring to HPMOR as an Author Tract fails to distinguish it from the former.  Which means now we need a new word for those type of stories, which seems silly and unnecessary to me, when we could instead just recognize their differences and stop calling it that.

        Edit:

        As a counterexample of "true soapboxing," there is a scene in one of the last Sword of Truth novels where a teenage girl, having just turned a magic trap around on her would-be-killer, then proceeds to lecture them for two pages about the nature of evil and good, the differences between them, and basically an all-around reiteration of the author's beliefs on the topic, while the villain is slowly crushed to death.  Keep in mind that none of this was new at this point: he'd been doing similar things for at least half a dozen books now.  But apparently he felt the need to put yet another monologue into yet another action packed scene and turn yet another of his characters into a mouthpiece for his ideals, thus extinguishing their individuality from the other protagonists, who by this point had virtually all already joined the hive-mind.

        The context is the most damning aspect: behind enemy lines, just barely having escaped from death, it takes an Author Tract of truly onerous proportions to have a character decide this was a good time to give such a lecture... to someone who's about to die anyway, no less.
        ```

          I'm not sure how I feel about the Patronus 2.0.  When I first read it, it was a Crowning Moment of Awesome.  When I found out Harry was going to obsess over defeating Death, I was kinda disappointed, because that's not how Death works in the real world anyway.  I also felt that Rowling's original idea of Dementors equaling clinical depression was being thrown aside.

          When I found out Yudkowsky is preachy about his transhumanism, the scene started to make me *deeply* uncomfortable.  In fact, transhumanism in general, taken as an ideology rather than an idea, scares me a good bit: Yudkowsky and his Extropians are some of the best of the bunch, but the general majority of transhumanists often come off like really creepy, greedy, domineering people.

            ```
            I understand the impulse to read into a story based on knowledge of the author, but I try to discourage people from doing that with novels whenever possible. ("Literature professors hate him!") 

            Barring revolutions in medicine or computers, ultimately the author will one day be dead and gone, and their work is what will remain.  The story should be taken on its own merits: authors are entitled to speak about what's important to them, but we should only judge them for doing so when they sacrifice the story to do so, and I don't believe Yudkowsky has so far.

            As for the Dementors, I feel like it's an acceptable shift, especially the way it was framed: creatures that suck out the hope of everyone around them and instill despair can do so for a variety of reasons, and when trying to rationalize them it seems to me you have two options:

            1) Make them the avatars of "Despair," which is rather silly if you understand what depression is from a biochemical standpoint (Do they just go around in a magic field that zaps serotonin/dopamine?)

            Or

            2) Make them the avatars of a concept that in itself naturally evokes depression.

            And "Death" serves pretty nicely as a universally hard-wired cause of despair and fear. Fits the animal theme of the Patronus fantastically too: animals certainly can get depressed, but fear of Death is a human thing.
