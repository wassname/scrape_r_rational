  I was very tempted to go on an utter tangent about the souls idea. I've stopped typing that up because I am too tired for it at the moment and also it is an utter tangent.

  Somewhat more on topic, I personally feel that there entirely a point to both writing, and in my experience reading magic system write ups. Obviously, no formal critical culture really exists for fictional technical descriptions (that I am aware of, though I get the inkling that there is a place for it in the context of, say, space ships), but I know that I can enjoy a very writer-ish enjoyment from describing a magic system, and that I've derived a very reader-ish enjoyment from perusing some of the write-ups I've found, even the ones mostly devoid of non-magic world-building tidbits or story fragments.

  Then again, I've also experienced aesthetic enjoyment of color palettes, without an associated form or arrangment, so maybe my senses on this matter are just skewed?

    I agree with you here. For me, it's mostly manifested in reading the (magic-related parts especially) rulesets of various tabletop RPGs.

      That's certainly a pastime I can get behind.

    Interesting. Do you paint or do any form of visual art?

      I've dabbled in it, but mostly because my mom is a painter (when she has time to be one).

  Good discussion. You may want to add a link to the Runelords, since that was discussed but I don't see a link to it.

  Another interesting example would be Mother of Learning. The magic system is very heavily D&D influenced, but with more granular progress than just gaining levels. Also, there are Naruto-style bloodline abilities and training exercises. 

  The reason I find this particular example so interesting is that the story is very focused on exploring the magic system, but the system has so much breadth that there's still a tremendous amount of room for surprises. 

  This could be good or bad; I think it would be very unsatisfying if one of the protagonists solved a major problem with a spell we didn't see them learn (or even hint at studying), but the magic system is expansive enough that we could easily see antagonists or side characters pull off impressive things that haven't even been hinted at previously. 

  I'll be very curious to see if Mother of Learning gets a satisfactory ending.

    Added Runelords link, thanks for pointing that out!

    Mother of Learning is a great example, yeah. I'm hoping the writer continues to show the care and attention that they have so far.

  As someone who is not a materialist, I can answer your question as "Eh, not really." There's still plenty of stories that include supernatural elements that don't make sense to me. It's only when they conform to belief systems I already follow that I automatically suspend disbelief, though discussing my beliefs here has made them more rational.

  I might also have some unique disbelief reactions for when a story touches on ideas that my belief system covers. For instance, I have a certain conception of the afterlife that I think makes sense given reality as I understand it, so for some stories that feature the afterlife I'll think, "Wait, that's what it's like? Seriously? How does that work?".
