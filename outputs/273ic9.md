  Being rational involves using the latest available science, distinguishing between various sources of evidence, all that.

  Trusting the advice of an unknown spirit with no medical training and performing a dangerous medical procedure based on it's supposed spiritual elements is not rational. If the procedure was done wrong for a start, he could easily get a brain infection and die.

  Onto the characteristics of rational fiction from the side.

  He trepanned himself because a spirit told him to, not because of any plausible reason.

  The other factions make no effort to communicate with him or discuss alternatives.

  The character solved a problem, possibly, by stabbing himself in the head.

  The rules of this fictional universe are uncertain.

  They didn't use the scientific method.

  Their rationalist techniques are 'obey magical spirits' which isn't good advice.

  The story isn't a puzzle, readers can't reach the same solution as the characters.

  I wouldn't call this rationalist fiction, but I thought you did a great job capturing the "voice" of a schizophrenic person. I also enjoyed your descriptions of his perception of reality after the brain damage. Maybe post it in one of the more general writing subs?
