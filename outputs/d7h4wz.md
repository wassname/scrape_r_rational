  Aladdin and his Wonderful Lantern: Jafar obtained the lamp from Aladdin according to plan, and became Sultan largely unopposed. However, while trapped in the Cave of Wonders, Aladdin finds an Orange Lantern Power Ring. Cue increasingly insane Lantern vs genie-empowered dictator.
  ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    In the [original story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin) Aladdin was given a ring with a genie to help him get the lamp from the cave. The Sorcerer (the original version of Jafar) managed to get the lamp from Aladdin, but not the ring.
    ```

      I'm familiar with it, that's part of what gave me the idea :). Orange power rings are rather different, though; they're powered by avarice, and tend to drive their users crazy. Also, the original sorcerer did not exactly act optimally.

        Have you read with this ring it's a Spacebattles, Sufficient Velocity and Questionable Content story about a mostly Rationalist SI with a range Power ring in the Young Justice universe.  I've lost track of it due to work since it moved to QQ but it's why orange power rings are popular here as the plebotinum a rationalist could use to improve the world.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          :D You were following it up until it moved to QQ? Check my username.
          ```

          - u/Empiricist_or_not:
            ```
            How is it going? I lost track first or second quarter and need to spend the time to catch up.
            ```

              Well, the [TVTropes recap page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/WithThisRing) is largely up to date.
              ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  A rational Orpheus is ascending from the underworld and trying to determine whether or not Hades has kept his bargain (allowing the shade of Eurydice to return to life by following him) without breaking the deal and looking back.  

  An equally-rational Hades has anticipated this and has put in his best effort to make this impossible to determine until the shade has emerged into the light, and has thus been returned to life.
  ```

  Ooh: maybe the universe _really_ runs on [Narrativium](https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Narrativium), and it is currently set to "these mathematical laws, plus pay attention to the Widget which is allowed to change the rules".

  The story either ends in "and then the Widget was disabled" or "and then everybody died".
  ```

- u/immortal_lurker:
  ```
  A mother has to deal with the fact that, no matter what she does, an additional perfect copy of her ten year old child appears in her living room every morning.
  ```

  - u/TrebarTilonai:
    ```
    Oh, that seems like it could go dark fast.
    ```

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  Isn't Big Yud derogatory? I don't really read tumblr much but I've only seen that nickname there, and usually read it as fat shaming.
  ```

      It's a way to signal intelligence by being  one level of contrariness higher than LWers. I guess we should make a sneer sneer club but I'm more concerned with getting lost in stories than signalling anything at this point in my life, at least with my internet time
      ```

      - u/DuplexFields:
        ```
        The best sneer is not sneering back.
        ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I think I've seen it both ways, not sure if it started derogatory and was counter-claimed or started affectionate and was snatched for mocking purposes.
    ```

    - u/phylogenik:
      ```
      I think [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nXARrMadTKk) might be the original source, maybe?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Oof.

        >This video is an example of Gross's Law: [ a | a' ], or, the ease with which an opponent of a position can make that position sound absurd is directly proportional to the odds that the position actually *is* absurd.

        When you gotta make up "laws" to try and legitimize your satire...

    I seem to recall he put a big Yud (×™) on the cover of one of his books.
    ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      Oh, if that's the reference then I apologise, and thanks :P Guess I was misreading this throughout.
      ```

  - u/erwgv3g34:
    ```
    It started out derogatory (the name originates from ["The Ballad of Big Yud"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXARrMadTKk), an anti-rationalist music video) but Eliezer seems to have reappropriated the term (see how he stylized his name on [the cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41-6B7M-TJL.jpg) of "Dark Lord's Answer").
    ```

  - u/IrvingMintumble:
    ```
    It sounds affectionate to me. Weren't there Big Yud t-shirts at some point?
    ```

      The one time I heard about them is EY saying he kinda hated them.

  Basically, your take on the Roy game from Rick and Morty (struggle after realizing your life was "entertaining" simulation)
  ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Aliens want earth to participate in their Kaiju-esque robot fighting sport (giant robot boxing, basically), so they send brain messages (that are arbitrarily convincing) to the smartest member of our species, as determined by some sort of handwavey brain criteria.  This person's situation is not great (maybe they are in jail, maybe just not a big deal), and now they have to scramble to get a giant robot put together before the aliens arrive.

  &#x200B;

  I was just struck by the thought that being Noah immediately post-Arc-revelation would have been extremely weird ("Honey, this is gonna sound crazy, but how many animals, by the by, would you say that there are?"), and one could probably get a short story out of putting that viewpoint in a familiar 2019 scenario.
  ```

  An AI as Santa Claus
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    I'm not sure EY can do better than Futurama's Robot Santa for that concept.
    ```
