  Well at least the Hunted Magician's trial went well, though I have no doubt the future ones of the Mirror Knight and Red Axe will prove to be way more of a headache considering, as Cat laments, it's the Heroes who are the troublemakers this time around.

  On another note, recently someone posted an excerpt from Amadeus's speech to Tariq in Book 5 on the PGTG sub, and the current events show that once more Amadeus is keener at seeing the lay of things than most everyone else:

  > “We will twist around the spirit of every rule while obeying the letter,” the green-eyed man said. “We will lie and cheat and hide our sins, while dragging into light those of our foes and rivals. We will seek to twist the laws as a tool for our ambitions and a sword to slay our enemies. We will hide behind every protection afforded and make red art of the details that save or slay. We will defend our advantages and seek to unmake yours, never once faltering in our callous greed.”

  >The grin went wider still, a madman’s grin. A challenge.

  >“And yet we will uphold the Liesse Accords, you broken old thing, and wage war on any that would unmake them,” the Carrion Lord said. “Merciless Gods, you think they tip the scale in your favour? Your entire breed are servants of stillness, shaped from the clay of recoil. You came out victors of the Age of Wonders, but this… Age of Order will be ours body and soul.”

  >“You are mad,” the Grey Pilgrim said, tone hushed.

  >“That may well be,” the Carrion Lord laughed, “but am I lying?”

  Just as Amadeus has said, while Villains *have* broken the Truce and Terms they see the terms for what they are, accept due punishment, are clever enough to realise the protections and opportunities it offers, and do not seek to challenge them. On the other hand the Mirror Knight and the Red Axe, both Heroes, are proving to be way more of an issue not only in terms of the scope of their infractions, but also their fundamental opposition to the Truce and Terms and attempts to destroy it outright, purely based on their old way of thinking that "Evil = the Enemy With Which No Peace Must Be Made". Really proving Amadeus's word of the Heroes finding this new Age harder to stomach true.

    I like the idea that the three trials are woven into a story and form a pattern of 3, with the first a Win, and the remainders inevitably a Draw and Loss.

    Amadeus aptly points out the Villains are agents of Change, upsetting the statu quo while Heroes uphold it. The Liesse Accords, in this understanding, are villainous in nature.

  Cat is doomed with the red axe's trial, three trials one after the other. its a rule of three with the first one being a win,next is Mirror Knight's one that will be a draw. Red Axe's is going to go BAD.

    ```
    I wonder if she'll see the pattern and break it. She usually catches on when this sort of thing begins to be apparent.
