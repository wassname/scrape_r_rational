  Giovanni's speech in the context of 'My attempt at a friendly unstoppable superpower just escaped' is... concerning.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Yeah. As it is, it sounds like he's being humble, "we have no idea when another one of these will happen." In context, it's more of a "yeah this disaster was caused by two groups of humans fucking with powerful forces and losing control. Guess who just also did that!"
    ```

    - u/I_Probably_Think:
      ```
      And who instigated it?
      ```

      - u/MaddoScientisto:

        society
        ```

  - u/eniteris:
    ```
    Yeah, am I the only one who feels the fascist undertones?
    ```

    - u/absolute-black:
      ```
      I definitely did - big 'democracy is a luxury we cannot afford' kinda vibes. But like... He was already Champion in this world's weird pseudo military dictatorship, so
      ```

    - u/daydev:
      ```
      Yeah, at first I thought he was going to try to get ahead of the backlash by apologizing about the failure of the Mewtwo project before it was even found out, but turns out he was just going to sell them Hard Decisions on the premise of existential threats.

      UPD. Another thought. I have only very fuzzy familiarity with Pokemon canon, mostly just osmosis, but it's my understanding that in the source material Red and Blue are rivals. I figure this may be the first step to how it comes to pass here, as Blue enthusiastically signs up for Giovanni-jugend.
      ```

      - u/Silver_Swift:
        ```
        I think they start out as rivals and then grow to respect each other as the series progresses and both grow up a bit.

        For OoS, they just got over their last fight. I hope we don't go into round two of that immediately after.
        ```

        - u/MilesSand:
          ```
          *sigh* I now have to go back and reread to find out if they have a fight at every rival battle location so far.

          Thanks. No, really.
          ```

      - u/shankarsivarajan:
        ```
        Heil Giovanni, then.
        ```

    - u/DavidGretzschel:
      ```
      Meh.... why would Giovanni want to establish a fascist dictatorship?

      I figured this would be aimed more towards establishing support for doing a Manhattan-style project again, except this time in the open and with international support. Get a Mewthree. Or a Mazda MX-3.

      Or maybe laying the groundwork for pushing towards the Oak/Bill/Raiko reforms of science publishing.  
      Or pushing for human storage, again. \[remember, that he executed a valuable researcher with a pokeball..... which I figured was definitely suspicious\]
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        > Meh.... why would Giovanni want to establish a fascist dictatorship?

        To gain more power/control for whatever goals he has (like transforming the world (presumably after he catches M2/grows another one)).
        ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        It's pretty clear from that whole speech that figuring out how to control legendaries is priority one, the only thing that gives humanity a chance against all the uncontrolled ones (including Mewtwo). I think Red had a moment in there where he *almost* let himself imagine catching a Stormbringer.
        ```

  - u/steelong:
    ```
    Not to mention his own role in the Hoenn disaster by playing both sides of the fight.  He has a whole lot to apologize for, so it was a fun twist when he apologized for none of it.
    ```

    - u/ArcFurnace:
      ```
      The whole "Giovanni-as-villain-with-good-publicity" thing has been amazingly well executed so far. I wonder how the protagonists will find out? They have to wind up fighting him eventually, after all, although we managed to skip the "fight Giovanni in the underground base beneath the casino" event from the game storyline.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        >although we managed to skip the "fight Giovanni in the underground base beneath the casino" event from the game storyline.

        Mostly because, come on, how absurd is it that he loses to the player there? In a gym match at least there's the excuse of limiting his team to be as strong as the badge number or something, but if he'd used even the same team he uses in his gym battle there he would have wiped the floor with the player.

        Not enough games do the "you can't win this fight" thing, imo, or worse they let you win the fight then have you lose in a cutscene. It acts as a very powerful experience when done right through gameplay, like in Megaman X.
        ```

        - u/MaddoScientisto:
          ```
          If I remember correctly in that red/blue OVA we got around X/Y release (the one with mega charizard) Giovanni indeed wiped the floor with Red hard on the first match
          ```

        - u/ArcFurnace:
          ```
          Have to agree. It's particularly odd because you *have* to win that fight to progress in the game. Mob boss with no real reason to hold back versus a 10-year-old? Come on.
          ```

          - u/Ceres_Golden_Cross:
            ```
            Pokémon is condescent like that. The general vibe of beating dudes that steal pokemon as a livelihood with your level 12 starter is so silly
            ```

        - u/Ceres_Golden_Cross:
          ```
          Come on, even in the origins anime red is destroyed by Giovanni in silph, and their encounter in the casino left ambiguos. They know it is the logical outcome
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Yeah, Origins was great in a lot of ways. I would pay money for a full-length anime of that quality.
            ```

    - u/AKAAkira:
      ```
      I actually get the sense he *was* apologizing for Mewtwo and everything else, considering he specifically addressed the people of a thousand years in the future for a personal apology. As opposed to if he had apologized *on behalf* of the people of the present who didn't do more, or try to provoke the people of now by what people of the future would think of them, a personal apology reads more like he fully expects to be found out eventually and wants to be seen by history as having been appropriately contrite.

      Of course, he deliberately obfuscated the specifics for which he was apologizing to people who don't already know because he doesn't want to face the punishment by law and in public opinion yet.
      ```

      - u/DavidGretzschel:
        ```
        Of course it's addressed at Mewto. No other reason he'd have said "To every thinking being I share this planet with." \[no other thinking beings apart from humans and Mewtos\]  
        Also implicitly signalling, that he's not about to try hunt him down.
        ```

        - u/AKAAkira:
          ```
          Huh. That's a good point, and I overlooked that.

          Lotta different messages packed into that one single video.
          ```

- u/Leemorry:
  ```
  > Embarrassingly, Blue's eyes fill, and thankfully Red doesn't say anything as he swallows back his tears and takes deep breaths. Just squeezes his hand tight.

  “This is the cutest shit I’ve ever seen”.jpg

  > Her gaze rises a moment, first to him, then the others, then back down. "No, it was just… luck. Like Lizzy's. His magmar attacked him."

  Ohhhh, did it now?  
  So MG, Leaf, and Red are all keeping dangerous secrets now. I should probably be more worried for them, but it’s mostly really exciting. 

  Thank you for the great chapter, as always, can’t wait to see what comes next ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

  ```

- u/I_Probably_Think:
  ```
  There’s so much to unpack in this chapter! I think people have covered most of the big story bits so how about some appreciation of the writing?

  I really love how the first scene break has an implicit “Red gets shooed out from the room because he 100% didn’t consider following the nurse’s instruction.” It’s like a Noodle Incident except without voicing over-the-top silliness that would disrupt the tone; we’re free to imagine as much silliness as we want, and what would otherwise be a pretty minor detail becomes a fun little pause for imagination :D

  I don’t know if it’s intentional but the way Laura interrupts Leaf’s thoughts was perfectly jarring. I think by having my own train of thought (reading) suddenly interrupted in the same way by the grammatical weirdness was a great meta way to help me identify my experience with Leaf’s, counterintuitively improving my immersion.

  The way that we’ve been lacking Red’s narrative perspective is great; I enjoy reading his perspective a lot but it’s associated with anguish that can get a bit too heavy. Plus, in this case we can already imagine some of the thoughts he must have had so, again, instead we get to see even more from what other people are experiencing relative to him (especially from MG’s and Lizzy’s perspectives in the preceding chapters).

  Oo ah, big foreshadowing here. 

  I'm concerned about how Red is handling what he had to do, it was very telling we only saw him from the other two perspectives. 

  Also, I knew the pin would drop with Natural at some point, I just wonder if it is now, or it has yet to come with this coming from another source.

  Great chapter! Thanks!

      She may have, but it wouldn't be surprising if she hadn't with everything going on, could be a suspicion in the back of her mind. But she has her own scandal and secret to hide, as well as the sheer mountain of events and information. It wouldn't surprise me if she came to the conclusion later on when things settle down instead.

  Top tier Giovanni speech.
  ```

- u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:
  ```
  I hope that psychic trick of turning a pokemon against their trainer only works on pokemon that lost their conditioning (or never had it). Fighting against mewtwo is going to be difficult otherwise. Although fighting against any legendary tier is going to be difficult directly. Probably not how the story (could) end anyway.

  Also with the worlds view on renegades Red probably should keep his ability to himself. Renegades turn their own pokemon against humans and people hate them for it. Turning other trainers pokemon against them? I guess that would be viewed as Super Renegade or something.

  Maybe this ability is known in some psychic circles? Some of them might even kill to prevent this ability from being known before it starts a witch hunt against psychics. Makes the apprenticeship with Sabrina potentially dangerous.

  /edit: As people have pointed out I forgot that the renegades pokemon turning against them was a lie. Red might be in big trouble.
  ```

  - u/Leemorry:
    ```
    I don’t think difficulty factors into it, the Sakki seems to override any and all conditioning.  
    Don’t forget that MG is lying, and it was her vulpix that killed that renegade. That vulpix was freshly caught, but it had all of the necessary conditioning (or it wouldn’t have been on her belt)
    ```

  - u/Electric999999:
    ```
    It wasn't really renegade's pokemon turning on them, it's just much easier to say that than admit that their own pokemon killed someone. 

    Also I'm pretty sure Mewtwo can mind control people and pokemon, so while he doesn't have sakki to remove conditioning he also doesn't need it.
    ```

    - u/gamerpenguin:
      ```
      I think they mean if Mewtwo makes trainers' Pokemon lose their conditioning. People will only be able to use conditioned dark types against him.
      ```

  - u/LordSwedish:
    ```
    One would presume it's easier for conditioned pokémon as you only have to make them think of their trainer as an enemy rather than a non-human enemy.
    ```

    - u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:
      ```
      Isn't the conditioning specifically about not attacking humans and additionally following their trainers orders?

      In a wild pokemon the power just adds rage towards an allowed target.

      In a renegade pokemon you need to overcome the difference between the trainer and other humans.

      And in a regularly captured pokemon you need to overcome the resistance against killing any human.

      I think that would be more difficult.
      ```

- u/SecretCrisis:
  ```
  We finally get a chapter with the trio back together after, what, a year at least! I liked that Red and Blue seem to have ironed out their fight and are on the way to becoming friends like they used to.

  Interesting that no one (except MG probably) have realized Red's involvement in killing the Renegades. 2 Pokemon suddenly turning on their trainers while you're being guided by a psychic who's known for *sakki* should raise some alarm bells.

  Excellent introduction to the Silph Scope. With it now in play the story can move on according to the games just fine. Blue's injuries seem to have put him off anything for a long time. Maybe a visit to Lavender Town for a bit of down time to recover?

  Blue's monologue about how these major, earthshaking events can just happen and the whole world can be put in turmoil is an accurate representation of the corona crisis too. Completely blindsiding the world and all its leaders, leaving behind a lasting impact, fear and panic being spread. Whether it's a virus or weather gods, you can never plan for everything so it's hard to know exactly what to do.

  Which makes Giovanni's speech much more interesting. Claiming that we have grown complacent might be a fair charge to a certain degree, but where's a successful alternative? His attempt to prevent the awakening by dealing separately with Teams Aqua and Magma failed, since we can't always trust human nature to do the right thing (Archie going off on his own). Even his psychic legendary-killer has now escaped, meaning that another option for humanity's protection has vanished into thin air. He says that he "will do better", but what *can* he do?

  A last point about Blue's "I'm not the main character" line. It's nicely meta, but also shows just how big the world is in the face of your ambitions. There'll always be a Brendan and May, people out there who started before you and are far ahead. There'll always be Ethans and Lyras who come after you with even greater potential. It's important to note how to deal with this, and it'll be interesting to see how Blue gets over his new "inferiority complex".
  ```

  - u/AKAAkira:
    ```
    > He [Giovanni] says that he "will do better", but what can he do?

    Thinking about it...he did order Petrel to steal Team Aqua's research (his moles in team Magma may also have gotten a similar order) and he knew the orbs were special enough to want them even before Steven used the Red Orb's leftover energy to Mega Evolve his pokemon.

    So his most obvious next goal is probably to research Mega Evolution.

              My first thought was "Is this why Koga doesn't stick around?" but I suppose that's still a ways off.

              E. forgot he went to the Elite 4, I suppose it would be Agatha who copped it.
              ```

          - u/TheTrickFantasic:
            ```
            For Whitney, seconded.  But Flannery should have already been a Gym Leader, having fought Brendan or May for their 4th badge, before the cataclysm.

            But it could explain why Flannery's grandfather, who's mentioned as a former member of the Elite Four, never appears (outside of the anime)!

  Thoughts:

  * Ugh, I totally missed that MG was actually lying about the magmar to cover for her vulpix (as opposed to the magmar actually being found to have done the deed on investigation) until I read the comments here. Learning that Red did cause the sandslash after Lizzy to turn on its trainer made MG's scenario more plausible in my mind...which was the whole point, wasn't it.
  * On another note, Red's properly turning into a character with good battlefield presence like Taylor and Zorian. But I wonder how many other psychics in-story have done similar... It doesn't seem like it should be hard in terms of skill needed, but I haven't seen any hint of a similar strategy being implemented as a matter of course (e.g. one of Surge's gym's lectures mentioning it as a possible formation if a psychic is present). Then again, even Red isn't advertising that loudly what he could do - or what he actually did. Seizing control of pokemon to attack trainers *is* kind of iffy.
  * I definitely get the sense Blue is trying to over-compensate for being bedridden by jumping onto Giovanni's bandwagon. Before, he usually tended to be the kind of character to lead the pack. I hope this change in character isn't a sign of anything too bad.
  * Kind of unrelated, but I wonder how Bill's doing. His house and lab is near enough to the ocean to have been affected, I think, nevermind the earthquakes and deluge of rain. I'm not sure if any of the tech he put into them had anything to do with defending his house against natural disasters. Man, just imagine if on top of all the bad news in this chapter Bill lost significant research progress on stuff like the tangela regeneration capabilities he wanted to give to humans.
  ```

  - u/DavidGretzschel:
    ```
    Yeah, I think Lizzy also lied about the Sandslash killing Maddie.   
    If Red could have done that, why wouldn't he have killed Roark with his Golem as well?  


    He probably used Lizzy's Mareep, as that would have been the last thing she'd use against the Sandslash and she probably really did run thru her whole belt slowing it down.  
    Though.... maybe that was the first pokemon, as she used Flash to blind it at first.  
    Come to think of it, I don't see how you could unleash the killing instinct of a.... sheep.

    And then Red coordinated psychically with them after the fact, without involving Leaf, whilst the three of them made their way out.  
    Lucky that MG and Lizzy are sensitive, though it hasn't been explicitly stated that Lizzy is.
    ```

    - u/AKAAkira:
      ```
      ~~I recognize those names as Ramin's co-workers that he tried to contact, but I'm not sure it's been confirmed which is which...?~~ EDIT: Huh, nevermind that, I missed that the two renegades after Leaf and Lizzy were of different genders the first time around.

      Anyway, if one of Lizzy's pokemon did kill the renegade hunting her, it would've had to have something similar to a sandslash's attacks, or else the Rangers would see through the lie right away.

      Definitely looking forward to a perspective from Red going over this event in his head.

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Yeah the semantics trip thing up a bit: "over thirty times weaker" meaning "less than 30 times as strong" :) It may seem strange to write it like that but I figured Red would just be guesstimating by the knowledge that 1.0 difference = ~32x stronger. I'll edit to make it more clear!

  a bit late to this chapter, but felt like I wanted to say stuff about it anyway, because I haven't really commented on the Titans arc here before, and despite not being titled as part of that arc it's hard to read this chapter as anything other than the encapsulation of its themes. Some stuff that jumped out:

  > "I had all these goddamn *plans,* Red… and now I'm stuck in here while the world spends who knows how long recovering from shit no one saw coming!" 

  the climate change allegories in this chapter in particular have already been commented on, but this line in particular snapped the whole thing together for me in light of current events. Makes me wonder how much of this stuff was planned in advance, and how much has been swayed by things that've happened in real life

  > "It's like finding out… I feel like, I look at those videos, those pictures of them riding those pokemon… and it's like realizing I'm not the main character." 

  this line really landed for me too - most of the criticism of the Titans arc has revolved around the fact that it focuses so heavily on characters we're not invested in dealing with events that have received zero foreshadowing, but I found that to be the arc's biggest selling point. I think I'm on the record as really praising the Stormbringer arc for managing to be on the same level as Worm's Leviathan arc (which is its main point of reference, right?), and obviously it's hard to top that, but these last few chapters have had a lot of standout moments (everything with Mewtwo in particular is the icing on the cake). In spite of the Worm comparisons, I still think this story is pretty much entirely unlike anything I've read before, and I can't wait to see where the heck it's going from here
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Glad you've enjoyed it so much :) A lot of this was vaguely planned years in advance, with more shape forming in the months leading in. The appearance of COVID is something of a "fortunate" coincidence in terms of being able to expound on these themes in the story, but I don't think I would be able to write them as well if it hadn't happened.

  You know you're a good investigative journalist, when you don't even need to publish a story to completely cripple the global underworld's recruitment ability. Detective Hirai can now check the timeline and see for himself, whether Leaf forced Giovanni's hand, making him even more of a suspect. It should also be a matter of public record, that he was the one that secured a renegade's right to a private last conversation. \[unless Giovanni lied about that to make himself more sympathetic to the Weedle-killer\]

  If Hirai then asks Leaf again, she's likely to bring up, that he illegally used a psychic on her to protect that secret. \[which leads to what psychic you could hire for that job, if not a Renegade\]

  &#x200B;

  Oh.... Giovanni is in trouble :)EDIT: Actually, that warning probably didn't impede the process much. Not sure, why I was thinking that.  
  Possibly it contributed to Giovanni's org having trouble hiring new people in chapter 59.

  This line just irks me:

  >Blue winces in sympathy, then turns back to Leaf with a wary respect.  She put a lot of trust in Red, using her pokemon on a stranger because  he told her it was a Renegade. That's even less clear cut a  justification than the last time she did it, but luckily they could  check this one's pokemon to verify…

  I don't remember if it's been on-screen. Maria was shown, though.

  It feels like:

  * Blue remembers something
  * Blue wasn't always unconscious
  * They did directly attack a renegade nearby

  Argument pro is this line in the previous chapter.

  >There's a sudden surge of *horror-fear-despair* and then the  presence retreats for a moment. Maria stops running, trying to sort  through what she felt, assuring herself that Lizzy can't be dead, that  she's not too late.

  But it can be that Nidoqueen. Or Blue losing consciousness.

  And things just continue to adds up.

  * Maria never mentioned someone guides her and reassures her it's not her fault that the renegade was killed
  * Lizzy never mentioned this guiding thing either

  It looks like Red just make them all forget this. All except for Blue. Notice how Red asked if he remembers anything.

  So, my thoughts on what happened: Red killed that renegade. They all meet at some point. At that point there is no multiple reds, as seen in this chapter, where he's always gaunt. He just killed a man using a pokemon as a weapon.

  Yet even unpartitioned Red don't want to die. But he's Red, and I'm not sure he will just make them forgot at one point unwillingly. And I'm even less sure everyone else want him to be branded.

  So they allowed to temporary/permanently block their memory. Mostly because police psychics.

  But! All of these from a single line based on an event I don't remember happened, and confirmation bias. Did I forgot something?

  EDIT:

  I also like how it's obvious for Laura that Leaf actually could've done something fishy.

  >"No, Leaf," Laura says, voice firm. "You can hand him the containers to  look through and all that would lead to is him asking about other  containers you own, then checking your PCs to see what you might have  transferred recently. You have rights for situations exactly like this."  She stands as she turns back to the detective. "Get a warrant if you  can, or take her word for it. Either way, we're expected at the hospital  to relieve my son from a bedside vigil." 

  More than sure it comes with experience, recent and in general.

    Don't think anyone else really needed memory wipe, Red killed a renegade with Maria's Vulpix (Maria thinks the Magmar did it because that makes more sense to her), and Leaf put the other one to sleep (legal). Red leading them around psychically is perfectly okay. Him asking questions because he's concerned that someone might realize he used killing intent seems more likely than him altering their memories.

    Kinda disappointing this "aftermath" chapter didn't show the most important thing, which is how Red will handle it.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      To be clear, Maria doesn't think the magmar did it; she lies in this chapter.
      ```

    - u/topin89:
      ```
      If Maria and Lizzy never tell anyone about voices in their heads, maybe he doesn't. But come on, they've met at some point and I bet they do talk about it. Red should talk with Leaf how he guides them. Even if he omitted he sakkied Magmar, Leaf is not dumb. Lizzy is aware about killer intent, and she's not dumb either.

      Yet not one of them mentions this. Leaf never mentions Red guides remote party to safety, Lizzy and MG don't mention about mystery psychic help. Especially MG don't mention about relief that it wasn't her fault.

      OK, maybe with all the stress they didn't have time to talk, and Leaf was distracted with her own lesser crime. Maria may not be aware about Red's ultimate move, she wasn't in Blue's group when it was revealed. Red is miserable enough to brings this and just waits while some of them figures it out. Also, it's not like he know how to block someone else's memories, even if he knows well enough how to block his own.

      So, stressed everyone, private-y Maria, distracted Leaf and exhausted Red. Still not in character for Lizzy not to share this or not connect the dots. It's plausible she understand it all and hide as well, because, again, it saved MG and Glenn. We didn't see their thoughts anyway. Red might hope they didn't guess they know and definitely won't bring this up first.

      So, yes, OK, it's plausible Red didn't wipe their memories. And late arrival thought, mind block may as well be quite visible for are psychics.

    It kind of is. Existential risk is pretty explicitly what it's about, and global warming is one of those.

  So I guess the Silph Scope is just.... basically a VR headset without any VR. Red saw ghost pokemon on TV before, so the Silph Scope would just have to be something like an Occulus Quest. A helmet, with built-in displays, a camera outside.

  A bit difficult to think of this as cutting-edge tech, but I guess our world is more advanced at least when it comes to Virtual Reality.  
  Kinda makes a lot of sense, that the first HMD wouldn't be for Virtual Reality, but for seeing Ghost pokemon, come to think of it.

  That was a nice speech from Giovanni.

  You know, it feels weird to be reading about this Tier 6 post-mortem when our real world is also dealing with one pandemic. For all the subterfuge Giovanni might be involved in, I surely would prefer a leader with his humility and forethought to our modern world leaders, who all too often succumb to vicious bickering with each other.

    I mean, the guy did manage to create, antagonize and then release an unbelievably powerful (and intelligent) creature on a world that is now _really_ not ready for it.

    ```
    Giovanni is a giant hypocrite. He may do a lot of good but he's bought into his own hype too much. Instead of setting up criminal organizations and murdering people with pokeballs, he could be using that time to do some unambiguous good. As it is he's a massive failure as a rationalist, justifying his horrible actions with a veneer of utilitarianism while making the world a worse place. If Mewtwo ends up helping it will be in spite of him not because of him. Don't mistake being good at optics for actually being a good leader. That's the same mistake made with modern world leaders all the time.
    ```

    - u/hks15361:
      ```
      True. What I said is more about his speech and less about the genuine merit of his actions. The entire incident with Mewtho is a big screw-up on his part no matter how you look at it, and he's also engaged in a lot of morally shady actions.  I guess one thing that makes him fascinating is how, from his speech, we can see that he's a genuine subscriber of his sense of utilitarianism, while we the readers would at the same time be aware of all the wrongs he's committed.
      ```

  - u/interested_commenter:
    ```
    Seems more like false humility to me, considering he's still hiding his ACTUAL faults (that he was involved with aqua/magma and that he just lost control of Mewtwo). That omission makes this feel more like a fascist making the "existential threats require hard decisions, and as the servant of the people I'm the one to make them" speech than a genuine apology.

    As for forethought, him forcing a peace between aqua and magma was quite possibly the reason they created a teir 6 disaster instead of just a gang war. He also just created a living superweapon and then lost control of it.

    Blue spent the time the time around the doctor's visit reassuring {"the time" is the trouble, you made it double}

    A story of humanity rising from frightened mammals cowering in hovels to being who can harness the powers around us for our own needs. {being*s*?}

    One of the major debates is whether it should be classified as a "Tier 6" event, a hypothetical world-affecting incident, or if it merely had the potential to be, but in either case many are reacting to a near-miss cataclysm as if one is still coming by stocking up on survival supplies and fleeing the islands, though some of that might just be foreigners who don't want to stick around as the local regions recover. {This isn't really a typo but it is all a single sentence and I wound up having trouble parsing it by "coming by"}.

    Thanks for the continued reason to look forward to the first day of the month!

    In Giovanni's speech:

    This doesn't sound quite right to me.

    Is it proper to use an attributive clause to negate a statement?  
    Maybe this is allowed in English, but I stumbled over it, when reading.

  My initial read through had me thinking the "you" Giovanni mentions at the beginning of his speech is Mewtwo, and that he's trying to subtly apologize to Mewtwo with his speech. Not sure if I still think that, but it was a neat idea I thought I might share.
