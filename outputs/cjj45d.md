## Name that story: sentient magical robot made of runes on movable pieces

### Post:

The author stopped writing it after a [few?] dozen chapters but I'd like to re-read it anyway.

  My guess is that you're thinking of *The Tinker's Daughter* by eaglejarl (first chapter posted to this subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4310vk/hfrst_eaglejarls_new_project_the_tinkers_daughter/)), but I didn't read it.

    Oh, darn. The author appears to have taken the story down :(

      It's not down.  You should be able to see it here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/general-public-1-4218932  It's public.

      EDIT:  Nope, I'm wrong.  The links appear to have broken at some point...dunno why, since I don't think I've moved anything.  Regardless, here you go: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qxi003os31p2os3/tinkers_daughter.zip?dl=0
