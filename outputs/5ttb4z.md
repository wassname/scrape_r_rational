## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I *finally* finished watching Gilbert Strang's [series of lectures on linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) (MIT 18.06) on YouTube. Took me a little over half a year lol. There were only 35 of them and each was only ~50min long, but each required around 1.5-2h for me to get through since I liked to pause every time he asked a question or did an example in order to work through the problem first myself (and occasionally consult notes from earlier chapters). And then I ended up restarting at one point after making it through half of them, since I took a long break (QE preparations and cross-country move) and felt a little foggy on some of the earlier material.

  But anyway, they were great! He didn't go into as much depth on some things as I'd wanted and sometimes glossed over seemingly important points (e.g. he spent a good bit of time on the [Fast Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) but didn't really say why, other than that it was really important, until returning to the topic a few lectures later). Occasionally he'd make simple mistakes but I think I caught most of them (and usually someone else did too, after consulting the YouTube comments).

  So yeah, if you're looking for a nice, gentle introduction to linear algebra (which forms the foundation of SO MUCH applied mathematics, e.g. computational statistics), I'd definitely recommend Strang. He's a great lecturer: quite clear and insightful and a pleasure to listen to (though I did speed up the video ~1.3x, since he talks a little slowly). I mean to take his Computational Science and Engineering and Differential Equations and Linear Algebra courses next, and then also maybe Klein's [Coding the Matrix](https://cs.brown.edu/video/channels/coding-matrix-fall-2014/), which has a bit more hands-on implementation (in Python).

    Way to go!

      Thanks! I'd had a *OK* working understanding of linear algebra before this course from encountering it in lotsa papers (and having to google certain terms) and from using it in my own research, but it's really nice to now understand things on a somewhat firmer, more cohesive theoretical basis!

    Ugh, self-learning math can be very grueling unless you have a buddy to work with on the problems. Then it becomes fun to learn (for me anyway).

    Congrats!!!

  I have been reading The Gamer type fics lately, and one thing that stuck out is how useful it is to be able to grind more than one skill at a time. Like hopping on one foot to build dexterity while setting your hand on fire to build vitality and reading a math book to boost intelligence. But it's not exactly easy to do that kind of thing in real life.

  So it occurred to me that you could maybe gain a skill called Multigrind, which relates to the ability to grind multiple skills simultaneously. If you could level that skill up, you could do crazy stuff like practice the violin while drawing artwork with your toes and doing math drills in your head. At first you'd suck and not get much out of it, but at high levels it would be super effective. It is different from Multitask because it has to do with focused practice and thus improving your skills rather than just getting stuff done.

  Aside from being useful to justify rapid growth in The Gamer style fics, can anyone attest to gaining a nonfictional version of this skill? Or just passively benefiting from multiple types of practice at the same time? I'm wondering if people who end up highly skilled might just be really good at multigrinding. (Apparently there are bonuses to math from studying music -- maybe e.g. Einstein studied both simultaneously? Maybe Barack Obama practices his oratory skills while playing basketball?)

    I'll read papers or books or write stuff occasionally between sets at the gym, or listen to audiobooks/podcasts while running/walking/hiking/cooking/drawing/etc, or do squats or calf raises or other simple exercises while brushing my teeth. More effective use of time than multigrinding, per se, but sorta similar (I'd be leveling skills grounded in INT and STR and maybe CHA in the first example, say). Otherwise there are plenty of things you can do that improve relatively disparate abilities (e.g. exercising and taking creatine both are linked to improved cognitive ability and physical performance).

  Imagine you have the following power: You can set someone's motivation towards a particular goal from 0 to 10. 

  What would your first applications of this power be, if any? Whom would you use it on? What goals?

  Clarifications:

  * You can use the power on yourself.
  * 0-10 scale is to the best of that person's max motivation. A 7 for Elon Musk might be higher than someone else's 9. That's just how that person's brain is wired, you can't change that.
  * Use of the power could have unintended consequences. "I motivate myself 10 on figuring out Rubix's cube" might lead to you being a homeless Rubix Cube genius.
  * Power has a range of 10 feet, need fairly clear direct line of sight to the target.
  ```

    I'd try to use it to grind my own skills and stats, including natural willpower. To avoid the homeless rubix cube genius syndrome, I would use carefully phrased goals with time and resource limits, safety clauses, and so on, particularly with the higher levels.

    Math is the specific skill I'd probably use it to work on right away, since it is an easy one to get bored with but vital to a lot of other skills.

    It seems like it would be easy to accidentally harm someone by making them over-focus on a goal. Could be extremely useful. If you were a teacher, you could use it on students to make them learn the material better. If you were a boss, you could make them do a better job at their work. You could probably make a great reputation for yourself as a motivational speaker.

    Does the power continue to function when the person you are using it on is more than ten feet away, or do they return to normal as soon as they move out of your radius?

    Also, is it purely additive, or does 0 represent a minimum of motivation? Would you accidentally demotivate people if you went around giving them a 1 on specific goals, or would it just make them slightly more motivated than they were before?

      It's a permanent change in their base level personality. If you make someone care about fitness a lot, they'll naturally think about it, read about it, want to do it. If they are in a hospital, they'll look forward to regaining mobility and becoming fit again.

      > Also, is it purely additive, or does 0 represent a minimum of motivation? Would you accidentally demotivate people if you went around giving them a 1 on specific goals, or would it just make them slightly more motivated than they were before?

      A zero would be minimum motivation. You could absolutely demotivate someone by giving them a 1 on a goal. That would be an interesting application of the power.

  PSA:
  There is now a Murphyjitsu [chatbot](https://m.me/murphyjitsu) that works on Facebook Messenger, as a follow-up to the [planning primer](https://medium.com/@owenshen/planning-101-techniques-and-research-9bfff1a01abd) I put up last week.

  It walks you through the steps of Murphyjitsu, a CFAR technique for planning better.

  I manage the page, so I can in theory view sent messages, but I am publicly committing not to. Still, I'm saying this in full disclosure. (Edited to add this when I realized I forgot to say this earlier on mobile).
