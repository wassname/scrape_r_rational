  Hey guys, welcome back! Not a whole lot new to announce, other than I set up an RSS link on my site for anyone that wants to get notified when new things go up there. Special thanks to my patrons, old and new, for all your support. Hope you all enjoy the chapter, and any feedback is welcome, as usual!

    I thought it was a great chapter! I'm definitely curious about how Red's psychic powers will develop, and what the endgame for that looks like, since that is something the games did not spend much time elaborating upon. I also find it very satisfying to see Blue grow as a trainer while also seeing the difficulty of his gym battles rise in roughly equal proportion. It's a great way of gradually building the world (at least as it pertains to combat and gym bureaucracy) while also emulating the difficulty curves of the games.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Thank you, glad you're enjoying it! And yeah, the games and even anime have criminally underdeveloped how psychic humans in the pokemon world operate and interact with others. Maybe the manga do a better job, but I haven't read much into any of them yet.
      ```

  - u/Malakbel:
    ```
    Thanks for the chapter! Really like that Red is planning to donate to the Rangers. I'm also very interested in all the currently running plots
    ```

    - u/Grasmel:
      ```
      Yeah, the Ranger thing is great. It might also put him in touch with someone related to his dad, which is probably part of the plan.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Not a part of Red's plan, but it might well be part of mine! :)
        ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Thanks for reading, glad you're enjoying it!  The idea of donating abra was actually suggested by a reader, and I liked it enough to work the idea into what Red's going through.
      ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    I've complained about the pacing before, but now I'm finally getting a sense of plot and direction from the fic. It's really taking on a life of its own. I just wish it didn't take 300,000 words to get there.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Glad you're enjoying it more :) Sorry for the wait!

  Great chapter; I want to say, I really really love how you're handling Red's grief. Bravo to Red being a big enough man to go back to his therapist- a _great_ therapist, too. 

  The last section with Red thinking about how he's handling the Abra as a way to 'answer' the grief genuinely touched me, I'm still tearing up thinking about it. Wonderfully done. As someone who's lost a parent (and is very far away from the other) that way of projecting them into the situation and gauging their response (as a means of dealing with the overall depression) is something I do a lot, and do find it to be a positive experience- I've never seen or heard it somewhere else.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thank you! I'm glad that connected. Stuff like this is always hard to hit perfectly, so I worry sometimes about whether I handle it well enough. It's good to know that it's resonating with others too, and can maybe even help them in some way.
    ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  So we finally see an evolution happening. The growth to a new size was gradual, but the change in appearance was sudden and came with a flash of light, interesting compromise. At least this way it doesn't violate conservation off energy, but there is still something odd going on.

  I wonder if in this verse, pokémon that seem like a combination of two others like Mantine and Slowbro actually use two pokémon to come into being now? If so, are they still considered one pokémon afterwards?
  ```

  - u/HeroOfOldIron:
    ```
    My guess is that it's a similar process to how anglerfish mate. The male bites the female and is eventually absorbed into her body so she can fertilize her eggs whenever she wants.
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Mantine has actually been somewhat retconned to no longer always be accompanied by a remoraid. It still needs it in the party to evolve, in the games, but all the newest sprites of mantine don't have it attached.
    ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    No Remoraid hanging around that Mantine that we saw... maybe it was in the water providing moral support?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Heh, I imagine the remoraid wouldn't particularly enjoy being carried through the air, unless attaching to the mantine somehow lets them breathe out of water too!
      ```

- u/blanktextbox:
  ```
  It means a lot to me that we're seeing Red manage his emotional well-being. The passage about going outside, how it feels both good and taxing, made me notice my appreciation for having this depiction. Like most everyday tasks, we generally skip past emotional maintenance in fiction, but as someone who has to do it all "manually" and with friends and a life partner who struggle with that stability, it means a lot to me to read a protagonist go through it in a realistic and relatable way. So thanks. 

  Oh, and it's also great that even though it's connected to his psychic abilities, it isn't the thing generating them or empowering them as happens so often with impaired heroes (see: Daredevil).
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I'm glad it resonated so well with you. It's a delicate subject to deal with, and I often worry about whether I'm doing it justice. I hope I can continue to do so, and feel free to let me know if you have any feedback, now or in the future!
    ```

- u/FireHawkDelta:
  ```
  I chuckled when Red did the test on his psychic shield, it reminded me of the parapsychology studies from [this.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/)
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Yeah, studies of psychic powers should be so easy to prove/disprove that it's really amazing how hard some people find it to parse through the methodology. Suffice to say, Ayane and Red's testing will not end here :)
    ```

- u/MaddoScientisto:
  ```
  I loved the chapter, great all the way through and I'm really intrigued by red mysterious psychic thing, also blue's battle was exciting too, it's good to see how he progressed and even an evolution. 

  By the way I was rereading the whole story and stumbled across red mentioning that there are no dark rattatas... Oh if he only knew about alola
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thanks or reminding me of that! I made an addendum to his thoughts on the matter later, after Sun and Moon came out, but I forgot that Dark rattata were mentioned earlier. Fixed it now.

    And I'm glad you're enjoying it enough for a reread!

      I keep finding spelling errors in the older chapters, maybe I should compile and mail you a list sometime

        If you do the reread on my website opposed to fanfiction, you can just ctrl-enter the highlighted typo and I'll automatically get an email about it!

  Great chapter as always. A rather broad question, how long do you expect the story to be? I mean, it's already at 41 chapters and 300 000+ words. It feels like it's somewhere around half-finished based on the developments of the plot threads and such, but fanfiction is much less restricted to the normal rules of storytelling than other books. So it can go on for years and years without stopping. I mean, Red, Blue and Leaf is only at cerulean, and I don't know if you want to continue until Blue actually does become the champion (if he does) or not. So, what general timeframe are we looking at here? This is just pure curiosity though. I'll continue reading this as long as you keep updating it. And I'll probably read everything else you publish as well, supposing I am even remotely interested in the subject.

  PS. Do you need a beta? I don't know how much help I would be, but I do write my own fanfic, and I think it's decently written.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    So, my common response to this is to simply say "I'm not sure" and estimate that it will certainly be more than 100 chapters, but probably less than 150. However, we all know how optimism bias operates, and I would not be terribly surprised if, five years from now, I'm looking back and sighing at my silly past self for thinking that I could get through most of the story I have in mind in just 100 chapters.

    *However.* I have been making an effort recently to step the pace up, and I think I'm getting at least a little better at it. What's also helping with that is that I've always known the early parts of the story would take longer than the later parts, because it's where details on the world and characters need the most fleshing out. Once they're established, far less time needs to be taken going over them again (if any needed to be taken at all, by some perspectives). As an example of this, there will never be another chapter on Red and the gang going shopping. That chapter is probably one of the easiest to cut, if I ever have to choose chapters to cut, but it's also one that I think did a lot in building the world and society, for those that enjoy that sort of thing.

    Hope that's a satisfactory answer, and I'm glad you enjoy the story enough to keep reading it :) Who knows, maybe I'll hit it big someday and be able to quit my day job and devote myself to writing full time. That would certainly make the ~150 chapter estimate less daunting, divorced from the pace of one chapter per month @_@

    PS. Thanks for the offer, but I'm okay for now! What's your fanfic about?
    ```

    - u/Caliburn0:
      ```
      I see. There's quite a lot of content to look forward to at least. You're doing great. Your writing is supreme, your story is excellent, and those Mewtwo sections are pure gold.

      I am one of those that really enjoy worldbuilding, both doing it myself and read about others who does it. Fanfiction can be really good at this, as we don't have to start from scratch. This can be both a boon and a curse, but it's what I really like about it. So, yes. I did enjoy the shopping scene. It was really interesting.

      And if automation works out, then I too can start writing fanfiction full time, praising the robots that do all my work for me. Hopefully that can happen to you as well.

      My own fanfic is a Naruto and Bleach crossover. I know. It's the most cliche combination imaginable (perhaps after Harry Potter and Naruto), but I really enjoy both of those series. They have their problems, but that's why I'm writing, isn't it? 

      The story is named Bleached Whirlpool. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11459500/1/Bleached-Whirlpool It's about... well, worldbuilding itself, I think. I made my own urban fantasy world and tossed the Naruto and Bleach verses into that one. I don't classify it as a rational fic, but I try my best to be as logical and consistent as I can. Because none of the main cast are particularly hardcore rationalists, quite the opposite really. People will be people, and they don't always act rationally, but the world is at least self-consistent. Or at least as self-consistent as my monkey brain can make it.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Wow, 110k words in 5 chapters! But good on you for working at it. I don't know enough about fanfic in general to know what's cliche and what's not (other than generic trope stuff) but I'm currently reading through Naruto and enjoying it, so maybe I'll check it out sometime after I finish (and finally get around to Time Braid and Marked for Death as well!)
        ```

        - u/waylandertheslayer:

          If you don't mind me jumping in with a few suggestions, I'd like to recommend [The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/) for when you've finished Naruto. It's my favourite Naruto fanfic, and also rational on top of that, *and finished as well*.

          (Also check out /r/NarutoFanfiction if you want some non-rational stories)

  Seeing this evolution reminded me, I wonder if evolution stones are a thing in this setting.  There were wild Raichu in the forest, are thunder stones just lying around out there?

  What about trade evolutions.  How does that work?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Stones exist, but they don't work quite the same way as in the games or anime. As for trade evolutions, I've pretty much completely scrapped that, since it seems really gimmicky and is totally unexplained in the games, not to mention not making any sense (what, did Gengar and Machamp just not exist before humans invented the technology to trade pokemon?)
    ```

    - u/KnickersInAKnit:
      ```
      Why not make the trade evolution requirement to be more like...'world traveller' experience or something. So a Haunter, Kadabra etc that lives a quiet life in a small town with an introverted trainer is not going to evolve. But the individuals who visit the many cities in Kanto, or even the regions beyond and meets many trainers and other pokemon will.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Interesting idea, but a) I can't see any reason why travel and variety would inspire eg Haunter -> Gengar evolution, and b) I agree with /u/daystareld, trading was largely a gimmick to make it necessary to buy both versions and/or get friends involved and engrossed.
        ```

        - u/KnickersInAKnit:
          ```
          So the list of pokemon who evolve through trading sans item is as follows:


          Kadabra, Haunter, Machoke, Graveler, Boldore, Gurdurr, Phantump, Pumpkaboo


          Alakazam is one of the smartest Pokemon, on par with...I think a 5 yo in this universe? Let's compare that with a parrot. Parrots get pretty miserable if you don't socialize them, spend time with them, give them lots of *novelty*...well, I think that travel and lots of new experiences would encourage a Kadabra's maturation into an Alakazam. Also, note that Kadabra's dex entries say nothing about its intelligence (just power) compared to Alakazam. How does it become smart? Learning new things!


          Haunter's Pokedex says that it tries to steal souls...don't think that's happening in this universe (what does Red think about souls?). Phantump and Trevenant live in lonely forests and trap visitors. Pumpkaboo "is said to carry wandering spirits to the place where they belong so they can move on" - travel requirement pretty much right here! For the others, I think they'd need a wide variety of tasty victims to be able to evolve.


          Machoke...more people to fight, nuff said. Sparring the same people over and over doesn't teach you anything. Gotta be the very best!


          Graveler eats rocks (preferably moss-covered). Going to new places would ensure a steady supply of a balanced diet of minerals, assuming the trainer doesn't already live on a mountain. 


          Boldore is a tough one. Leaks energy constantly according to the dex. Maybe poisons its own environment if it doesn't keep moving, like a fish living in a tank with poor filtration/inflow of clean water.


          In conclusion, this proposed 'travel requirement' wouldn't be a hard one, but it would speed up growth and evolution of the evolve-by-trade group.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            I thought of a number of ways to try and rationalize the trading (not just the travel requirement idea, which you expanded on wonderfully, but also things like loss of their parent-figure or forced changes in allegiance), but ultimately I just realized there were too many holes  in all of them. For this one in particular, what about trades between people in the same region or location? If two people in Kanto trade haunter and graveler, they'd have no reason to evolve. It also throws into question the whole "trading with an item attached" evolution question, which clearly focuses on the item and not the trading itself.

            So if I went with that, now I'd have to make up a new rule that the trade has to occur between different regions to speed up evolution, and come up with an explanation for why the process of trading matters for those that need an item. And if I'm putting in new limits or coming up with new rules to make the "Trading causes evolution" still work differently from canon anyway, then I might as well just scrap it altogether.

            Maybe I'll think of something that works as a good nod to the game's rules without adopting them fully and implement it later though :)
            ```

            - u/KnickersInAKnit:
              ```
              Trades between two people and regions I'd view like...well, the concept of voltage! The greater the total difference between person A and person B, the more likely it'll result in an evolution.


              Screw the trading with an item idea though, that's dumb. Just give the pokemon the item and wait until they figure it out imo. Maybe it wouldn't work immediately like the evo stones if you want to differentiate the two.


              I see your point though, ultimately probably not worth it to keep the trading requirement nod to the games.
              ```

              - u/DaystarEld:
                ```
                >Just give the pokemon the item and wait until they figure it out imo. 

                Haha. Just imagined handing a scyther a Metal Coat, or a slowpoke a King's Rock and being like "...Well? Go on." as the slowpoke stares vacantly at it, then tries to eat it.
                ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Creative :). Your last paragraph doesn't seem like a conclusion, though: it introduces a novel idea, of trading being "helpful but not required". That bit sounds reasonable.
            ```

            - u/DaystarEld:
              ```
              Yeah, "helpful but not required" is basically how I'm going to be treating a lot of the non-level-based evolutionary requirements.
              ```

- u/Mizu25:
  ```
  Poor Red experiencing all the emotions from his dad's loss, but it's also good he's finally working through them, instead of bottling 'em up. I can see you're blending the 'carries a Pikachu about' character aspect Red and Ash are known for into it too, due to Pichu (and, once it evolves, Pikachu) being a fluffy friend he can cuddle with for comfort who's not particularly dangerous to hug.

  It's really quite sweet, and a lovely idea, imo.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Glad you're enjoying it! And yes, of the many conventions to keep or abandon, Red and his pikachu seemed worth keeping :)

          It's a possessive, and I think pokéballs are usually considered to be possessed by the pokémon? At least, that's how it's been pronoun'd in the story.

            It's more like pure association. You don't own your parents, yet you'd refer to them as "my parents".

    "Sorry to impose it onto you..."


    >"What are you a rules lawyer now?"

    ("What are you, a rules lawyer now?") or ("What, are you a rules lawyer now?")

    >He brought his pidgey, sphinx, shroomish...

    He brought his pidgey, shinx, shroomish...

    >Applause are audible from the bleachers...

    (Applause is audible from the bleachers) or (Sounds of applause are audible from the bleachers). Alternatively, shift the sentence to be in active rather than passive voice. "Blue hears scattered sounds of applause from the audience" or something like that. Similarly...

    >There are applause from the spectators...

    >The applause return...

    Later on...

    >"Which I'm saying shouldn't be impact your view of his motives..."

    "Which I'm saying shouldn't impact your view of his motives..."

    Later on in that paragraph:

    >"...and what their options are."

    Not grammatically incorrect, but there's no "they" implicated previously in the sentence or paragraph. I think you mean "...and what (his/your) options are." or "...and what the options are."

    >"...just incase..."

    "...just in case..."
    ```

  - u/daydev:
    ```
    > After arriving at the restaurant and spotting **her and Blue** at a table, he actually smiles.

    Maybe not a mistake, but Leaf was established as "her" two whole paragraphs ago, and then it talked about Red's pichu, who is also "her". I think the pronoun "lost its reference" by the time it's used here.
    ```
