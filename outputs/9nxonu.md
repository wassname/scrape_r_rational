  Hey everyone! Today we're joined by professional game writer Kuiper to discuss writing as a skill, or rather a set of skills, and the ways people can improve them. He's probably less well known around here than previous guests, unless you've been following [Re:Dragonize](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/17234/re-dragonize/chapter/202344/chapter-1-welcome-to-the-afterlife), which is off to a promising start.

  Enjoy!

  I've been having a great time play-by-post role playing in Discord to keep my writing skills fresh while I haven't had much time for actual fiction writing (damn you, grad school \*shakes fist at heavens\*). I don't suppose you would be interested in starting a RW Discord for people to RP in? If you want, I can set it up and do the modding.

  This is the first one I've listened to in a while, and I really liked it! I was really into the discussion about the "Artist"-"Scholar" thing. 

  I think the most important part of learning and practicing something like this is to first just notice what is happening, and that you should be able to do the same with writing. Rather than letting the artist go for an hour or two and then sitting the scholar down later to analyze what happened, you could set aside some practice time to sit them down together at the same time. I'm imagining something like mindful writing, I guess, where you look at what you're writing as you write it out, starting by noticing really obvious and distracting things first and then with practice you start to really notice the rhythm of your words, and how your mind arrives at that rhythm. 

  Full disclosure: I've never done this, so I don't know how it would actually look like in practice.

    Glad to hear you enjoyed it!  I'm an avid listener of the podcast myself, and I'm endlessly fascinated by the topic of storytelling, so as you might imagine I had a lot of fun recording this episode.

    There are a ton of micro-skills that go into writing: having realistic characters, using description to effectively convey those characters, writing the description in a way that's engaging rather than boring the reader, writing in a way that conveys a specific mood, and having writing that's just aesthetically beautiful, among many others.  These are all things that you could aim to do within the span of a single sentence, and it's pretty tough to write a sentence while consciously thinking about all of these things simultaneously.

    I think the goal of practice is to take knowledge that you're consciously aware of and through repetition and practice turn it into a sort of subconscious "muscle memory" that you're able to do without thinking about it.  As an example, when you're an elementary school kid learning spelling for the first time, you might use mnemonics and think to yourself, "i before e, except after c" and then use that bit of conscious thinking to correctly write out the word "believe" on a spelling test.  But at this point, I've seen and written the word "believe" so many times that I just spell it correctly without even thinking about it.  It's become an ingrained habit.  It's good that I have the conscious knowledge that believe is spelled "b-e-l-i-e-v-e," but what's much more useful is the fact that when I need to write the word "believe," my fingers just form the word without me giving it much of a thought.

    There are a lot of things that I see novice writers do, like inconsistent tense, where they're constantly switching between first and present tense in a way that's jarring.  The short-term solution to this is to think consciously with each verb about what tense you're using, so that you're always using the correct tense.  But at a certain point, you should become experienced enough that you can just decide at the start of a project, "I'm going to use past tense for this story" and your brain will just automatically use the correct tense verbs without ever having to consciously think about it, any more than you'd have to think to yourself, "when writing the word 'believe,' make sure to put the i before the e."

    I think most of us understand that this is important for technical skills.  I'm not consciously thinking about the rules of grammar when I write, but somehow my writing tends to come out mostly grammatically correct.  But this principle of taking "micro-skills" and committing them to "muscle memory" also works for more subjective things, like writing good description.  I used to constantly repeat to myself, "make sure you're using description that applies to senses other than sight."  Now, I just tend to do it automatically -- I'll be writing a paragraph about a character walking through a forest, and I'll slip in a line about the sound of snapping twigs under their feet without having to consciously think to myself, "this description will be more engaging to readers if it engages senses like smell and sound rather than just describing how everything looks."  There was a point at which I was consciously thinking this while writing, but now it's become an ingrained skill.

    At the top of this post, I mentioned that a number of micro-skills can go into writing, including having realistic characters, using description to effectively convey those characters, writing the description in a way that's engaging rather than boring the reader, writing in a way that conveys a specific mood, and writing beautiful prose.  I think that's too many things for your mind to consciously focus on at once.  But with enough practice, you can shift a significant portion of the workload to the same part of your subconscious mind that effortlessly spells words correctly and uses sensible grammar.  This frees your conscious mind up to focus on the things that are going to push your boundaries as a writer.

    I think the idea of "mindful writing" as you describe it is something that could work for acquiring a specific skill, and might be a good way to hold yourself accountable while learning to ensure that you're actually practicing to acquire new skills rather than just writing what's comfortable and familiar.  This is also a place where writing exercises can be helpful, as you can put constraints on yourself to force yourself to practice a particular skill.  (For example, one way to force  write description that appeals to senses other than sight is by writing a story told from the perspective of a blind person.)  However, I think the goal should be to eventually become practiced at performing that particular skill such that you're eventually able to do it *without* consciously thinking about it.
