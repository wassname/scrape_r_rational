## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  In the last Monthly recommendation thread, there was a [recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7hq84n/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/dqti48i/) for a podcast named "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text". The theme of the podcast is a little weird. It is a re-reading of Harry Potter, but they read it as if it were a sacred text (like the bible), and find deeper meaning in it. 

  The [podcast](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/) is actually very well done (it is very good technically, and there is a great chemistry between the hosts). 

  I'm usually quite cynical when it comes to spirituality. Obviously, J.K Rolling didn't intend all these layers of meaning when writing Harry Potter. However, listening to people discuss several spiritual themes (like Curiosity, Fear and Commitment) through the lens of this famous story is somehow very interesting for me, even a bit moving.

  This leads me to a greater question: Is there such a thing as rational spirituality? 

  I sometimes feel like the secular life are missing some very important parts of human experience. Specifically, I feel that it is very hard to maintain a sense of optimism in a world void of meaning. (I remember reading somewhere that religious people are less likely to develop depression, and are generally more contend in their lives. Could anyone find a source on that?).

  In addition, I think that the communities and family structures in the western secular culture are crumbling. These social structures seem important for our happiness, and it doesn't seem that we have built anything to replace them. 

  I also think that some religious practices, like meditation (and maybe prayer?) are legitimately helping people live a happier life, and generally feel better about themselves. 

  On the other hand - I find it very hard to identify with traditional religions. I feel like they force people to suppress their common sense, and ignore inconsistencies and falsehoods.

  Is it possible to find meaning in a meaningless world, while still maintaining our rational thought processes?

    I'm starting to wonder if I'm a some sort of philosophy mutant because I see people making points like that and never understanding it.

    EDIT: Okay, since I've had like ten millions "me too"s in the last 3 days, I'm going to guess this is just an uncommon position and not a weird brain mutation.

    The basic idea of nihilism is "There's no deeper / higher meaning to be found". Every time I see someone mentioning nihilism (as in "this guy is a nihilist" or "I'm nihilist"), it's mentioned as a sad thing; like the idea that there's no higher order is an inherently bad thing.

    And I almost never see someone just... be okay with it? I mean, personally speaking, I'm a bit unhappy with the whole "death" thing, but as far as philosophical / existential meaning go... I don't see any, and I don't feel the need to see any? I dunno. This whole subject weirds me out a bit.

    > I also think that some religious practices, like meditation (and maybe prayer?) are legitimately helping people live a happier life, and generally feel better about themselves. 

    I'd be happy to change my mind, but so far I've seen no evidence that meditation is more than self-reporting errors plus regression towards the mean.

      You're not alone. I also feel this way. Even when I was a teenager, I was listening to a friend give his nihilism rant, and my end thought was "I agree with everything he says, but I don't know why this is supposed to depress me."

      I'm afraid of death, that's for sure, but the lack of a grand cosmic meaning to life doesn't bother me at all. 

      I don't really have anything to add, just wanted to say you're not the only one who thinks this.

      It's not unique to you. I am such a mutant as well.

      I never really saw the point of looking for a point to my existence. I just enjoy that I exist in the first place. The one thing that I never really understood from other people is that they think the idea that our complex lives emerge from very simple interactions at a much lower level somehow takes away meaning and beauty while I find order emerging like that to be a very beautiful thing.

      I'm with you.  Everything is objectively meaningless, including the fact that everything is objectively meaningless.  So if you grok nihilism, you should also grok that there's no point to getting upset about it.

      I feel exactly the same way.

      The best explanations for this I have found so far is:

      https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/

      (The blog talks a lot about Buddhism but that is not relevant to the article)

      According to this the human mind develops in stages. Not every one reaches all of them. And between stage 4 and 5 people develop nihilism when they get stuck there.

      Would love to hear what other people here think about this.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:

        I really, really like that article and the model it develops, but I think it's too simplistic to give accurate predictions of reality (the most visible argument is that it treats the different stages as strongly correlated, which doesn't have to be the case). I'll probably revisit it when I have time to do serious philosophy; I'll hit you up then.

        There's definitely a "n-1 => n => n+1" pattern of

        * "All is X"

        * "There doesn't have to be X"

        * "There is *some* X"

        to be found in a lot of philosophy.

        (that's actually a really neat way to put it, now that I think about it)

          ```
          You seem to describe Hegels thesis - antithesis - synthesis. Interesting theory to describe things after the fact, but can be misleading when trying to predict things. I am not the biggest fan of Hegel.

          But now that I think about it I often have imagined the stages as some sort of pendulum swinging back and forth with decreasing distance. Maybe I should rethink that.

          Oh and Kegan is a developmental psychologist not a philosopher but I don't really know very well how psychology research works. Maybe the difference is not that big.
          ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            Ugh, I'm having French class flashbacks. That's not a pleasant thing.

            Seriously though, I can't quite say "Yes, I was describing this" or "No I wasn't", because I get the feeling two people reading this wikipedia article could get wildly different understandings of what thesis-antithesis-synthesis is.

            What the vividness.live article you linked says, which blew my mind the first time I read it, is that for a lot of philosophical concepts, people go through the following stages:

            * Not knowing about / believing in the concept

            * Thinking the concept is everywhere

            * "Transcending" the concept, seeing where it is and where it isn't.

            Ex: Morality is absolute -> There's no reason believe in a higher morality, every position could be valid -> Okay, morality isn't absolute; but in most situations it may as well be; however, thinking of it as relative can be more productive in other situations.

            The interesting points here are:

            * Each stage is utterly incompatible with the previous stages. You can't be both a moral absolutist and a moral existentialist.

            * If your "current stage" is n, you can easily confuse n-1 and n+1.

            * Each stage is more complex than the previous one; in fact, each stage "contains" the previous one; a n can understand a n-1, but a n-1 can't understand a n.

            This is the most important part. In that framework, your beliefs aren't a pendulum that swings on a linear axis towards an ideal value (so the only possible directions are "more X" or "less X"); they're more like a blurry image that gets a better resolution over time. Stage n-1 is "everything is white", stage n is "there's some black!", stage n+1 is "it's mostly white".

            The article then naturally tries to apply this pattern everywhere, which is where it starts to lose me.

    This was reason numero uno that I started listening to it, incidentally. HP&TST makes a good case that the layers of apparent deep meaning in e.g. the Bible or the Book of Mormon say more about how much work we've put into looking for deep meaning and less about the secret depth of those works.

      This is a common theme I've heard from the authors in this community. The audience will sometimes fail to spot what they consider obvious hints (because the author has access to privileged information), but more importantly will also find 1,000 completely off-base links to justify any conceivable interpretation.

      The correct answer will often rise to the top (e.g. because it fits more evidence, resonates thematically, or provokes retcons when the author sees what people are confused about), but until that selection process is finished you're looking at a [Library of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel) situation.

      In the case of a holy text, this selection process never finishes. The people interpreting it, and the world they live in, are too diverse and dynamic to ever settle on a single, majority answer. And it's looking unlikely that we'll get authorial clarification at this point, since their human authors are generally dead and their spiritual authors are some combination of non-interventionist and non-existent.

      It sounds like this podcast is a good study in the ways that people ascribe meaning to random patterns. I'll have to give it a listen sometime.

  I just listened to [the latest episode of the Cracked podcast](https://overcast.fm/+BHdl_96bg) where Jason “David Wong” Pargin, a former conservative turned ardent leftist and writer who was hugely influential on my development, gave a sound logical explanation of how liberals enforcing ideological purity is pushing people into right-wing circles that become ever more radical.

  If I had heard that a month ago I would’ve thought he’d hit the nail on the head yet again, but now I believe that is naive. I think ideological purity is incredibly important because that ideology is about empathizing with and helping victims of abuse and discrimination, whereas the opposition are tribalists who want to allow oppression to continue.

  I feel so strongly about this that I’m worried I’ve become too radical and will end up worsening the divide in my society, but I can’t imagine a way to repair that divide without persuading or subjugating people who enable oppression. I now think that treating people as equals when they think I don’t deserve equal rights will just make me another enabler.

    >because that ideology is about empathizing with and helping victims of abuse and discrimination, whereas the opposition are tribalists who want to allow oppression to continue.

    This strikes me as wayyyyyy oversimplified and naive.  The vast majority of people on both sides are ordinary people trying to do the right thing, but disagree on either the best methods of solving certain issues, or on how reality is.  Let me put forth the following groups of people and their beliefs that I believe portray certain types of people:

    Type A) Radical leftist:

    A1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

    A2) White people are currently oppressing black people and causing them to remain poor

    A3) White people are inherently evil as a result of their race

    A4) White people should give money to black people, or should be segregated in society and given lesser rights to atone for their sin of being born white

    Type B) Semi-radical leftist 

    B1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

    B2) Some racist white people are discriminating against black people, combined with past injustices which is causing black people to remain poor

    B3) White people are responsible for their actions that have caused black people to be poor, and should make up for it by checking their privilege in debates, never ever do anything culturally insensitive like making racist jokes or saying the N word, and should give precedence to black people via welfare and affirmative action

    Type C) Moderate Leftist:

    C1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

    C2) The cycle of poverty has caused this to continue until the present time, where black people remain poor

    C3) Everyone should be treated the same regardless of their race

    C3) However, policies should target black people with welfare and affirmative action because this will help them break out of the poverty cycle

    Type D) Moderate Rightist

    D1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

    D2) The cycle of poverty, combined with gang culture and the destruction of the black family unit, has caused black people remain poor.

    D3) Everyone should be treated the same, regardless of their race

    D4) Therefore, people bear no guilt or association with the actions of other people, living or dead, who share nothing in common other than race.

    D5) Therefore, we should not give extra welfare or affirmative action to black people, but instead should make policies that target poor people regardless of race, as this will accomplish the same good in a more fair and equal manner.

    Type E) Semi-radical rightist


    E1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

    E2) This, combined with geneticly smaller intelligence and looser morals, has caused black people to be poor.

    E3) Everyone is responsible for their own choices, and the consequences of those choices.  Therefore black people should be left to their own devices and if they want to not be poor they can simply work harder to fix it

    Type F) Radical rightist:

    F1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was good.

    F2) Black people are inherently inferior to white people

    F3) Black people are poor as a result of their own inferiority

    F4) Black people should be sent back to Africa, or re-enslaved, or exterminated, so that they stop ruining our society.

    Obviously the above are somewhat oversimplified, many people will have more nuanced versions of these beliefs, or have some but not others from various different tiers.  But my first main point is that the distribution of people believing these in real life seems to be close to a bell curve.  Most people are close to the middle, and a huge part of the issue is that people on one side tend to view things in terms of "right of me" and "left of me".  People on the right have difficulty distinguishing between A/B/C, while people on the left have difficulty distinguishing between D/E/F.  However by looking at these it is obvious that we have a sort of horseshoe theory happening, where A and F are obvious and dangerous racists, B and E are moderately racist or misguided but have some hope, while C and D both believe in equality but differ slightly in what that means for policy.

    The second main point is that many of the beliefs are possible to hold without being a terrible person.  We have "moral" beliefs, about whether or not certain things are good or bad, and "territory" beliefs, which describe how someone thinks reality is.  Someone who believes "black people are genetically less intelligent than white people" has a territory belief.  There is a hypothetical world in which this is a true statement (which might be our own, I don't know enough about genetic influences on intelligence to know either way).  This does not necessarily imply that this person thinks they should be treated differently (a moral belief).  So even if you do think this belief is incorrect and makes them a racist, they're on an entirely different level than someone who hates black people, and you shouldn't group them together.

    I find it incredibly naive to call one group "tribalists" and "radical" but not the other which is performing idealogical purity tests that is scaring away its own members.

    Hopefully, at the very least, you can see the concern for radicalization of the left, as well as for the right.  Both are dangerous.  Even if the two sides are not perfectly symmetric, they're awfully close.  All labelling everyone D and right as "nazis" does is dillute the word and makes it harder to recognize the real nazis.

    The way Kazerad [put it](http://kazerad.tumblr.com/post/71725286960/im-trying-to-get-back-into-the-habit-of-actually):

    > I’ve said things to this effect to people before and gotten replies like “you can’t solve problems by being nice”. I should clarify that I'm not advocating the idea that people should be nice and passive and eventually problems will go away. I am advocating the idea of being a manipulative bastard. I am advocating luring people into a sense of security wherein they openly put their most vulnerable thoughts and feelings forward for your perusal and modification. This is traditionally called “being nice and understanding”, and it’s how you control people. Or help them, if you’re into that sort of thing.

    And while Kazerad is being pretty romantic about the whole idea, there's a lot of merit to it. At least anecdotally, I've noticed that I was more convincing to people whose views I strongly disagreed with if I approached them from a position of respect and understanding.

    From a consequentialist point of view, it doesn't matter for Jason Pargin's point whether your opposition is "tribalists". If ideological purity leads to more people going to the opposition, then it doesn't matter who the opposition is, it's in your interests to be more open.

    There are a lot of different evils in the world , more than anybody can understand or care about at the same time.People don't automatically agree that something is a problem especially if people in the outgroup are the ones talking about it all the time(or even if someone talks a lot about it), so you can't expect people in other group to be concerned about all the things your group is concerned, you can try to care.

    Of course I kind of understand  why you would feel angry and start considering more extreme ideas , but in that case the kind of solutions your brain will suggest more easily are the kind of solutions that would work in the ancestral environment , but not now.Most people in the opposition aren't neo-nazis , in fact , a really low amount of people are neo nazis  .You cant get the opposition to agree whith you by force , or by being angry at them , again  that is the kind of thing that could  work in the ancestral environment(by convincing who can be convinced and getting everyone else out of the tribe) , but in big countries it just leads to people  being increasingly more divided , radical and eventually  violent.

    Are you sure that being more radical and equating everyone in the other side of the political spectrum whith the neo-nazis will lead to less racism? .Or are you actually thinking that because you are angry whith  them so you  want to punish them and then rationalize reasons why doing it is going to help ? .Because I don't see how that will help convince the other side , in fact I see a lot of ways it can lead to things getting worse . 
    You cant subjugate half a country , you  can subjugate the evil people whith the help of everyone else , but if  you start  saying that everyone on the other side is evil , you aren't going to get their help, and they will believe you less when you tell that racism is important ,or  that someone is racist or a nazi  because they will be angry whith you ,,witch will make you angrier because you think in doing so they are tolerating evil , which will make them  more angry , creating  a feedback loop of people getting angry at other people and dismissing the other side's opinions.
    It's really unlikely that in the big mostly arbitrary  conglomerations of ideas that is the political spectrum happen to perfectly divide good and bad ideas, or true and false beliefs  (which doesn't necessarily mean that both happen to be equally right or wrong   but its bad anyway, and everyone things their group is  the best ) .

    Its not a question of which side is righter , its just that  being polite and trying to convince  people ,even being manipulative about it  is the only option, not only moraly , but practically , if its isn't working  for you can only   try harder or in a different way .
    And if you think  it's  naive to believe that   the situation can  can be solved that way , then at least things wont go worse  by respecting the rights of people ,and you can get more info about their actual views to figure out other ways of solving the issue. Really consider if whatever other  idea you have  was actually  generated by your problem solving ability trying to find how to get people to be less racist or something else.

    I say all this because I'm getting the impression that the main change between you a month ago , and you right now , is that you  fell  more strongly about the issue ,and you tried talking to some people on the other side , but it didn't work  and those  are reasons for why you are angrier  now and therefore more inclined towards being more radical , not reasons why now you are better at deciding which plans will lead to less racism .

    And remember , there are a lot of other people suffering in the world for thousands of  reasons, and right now you aren't deciding everyone else is evil for not trying to help.

    I underwent the same transformation earlier this year. I no longer think fascists deserve free speech and vastly prefer the way Germany handles them to the way we do in the US. The risks of allowing that ideology even an inch of breathing room are simply too great. In addition, I've come to the conclusion that the only word which adequately describes the Republican Party as an organization is Evil, and given the magnitude of what they have done to the world at large I'm not sure if even that is enough.

    That said, those are just facts about me. The best way forward right now is not righteous face-punching, but bringing enough people on board our causes to step us back from the point where violent revolution will become necessary. Fixing everything at once isn't in the cards, we just need to halt the progression.

    Despite the obvious corruption of our government at every level, I do still have some hope on that front. Mueller's investigation is advancing at a frankly shocking pace by comparison to the Watergate investigation, and given the number of people very close to the President he already has in his sights publically, I wouldn't be surprised if he presented damning evidence in time to affect the 2018 elections. That will do nothing to change the minds of the 35% of this country who are unabashedly evil, but it will affect everyone else. Remember, Trump did not get a majority of votes last time, and this time we have the entire country enraged.

    Even if you believe the Democratic party is also somewhat corrupt, they have every political reason to impeach the President if they manage to retake Congress. Even if they don't, making him a lame duck will stem the bleeding, and two more years of random flailing will do nothing to help the Republicans' chances.

    These monsters were elected in large part because they made promises they could not keep to the people of the American Midwest, and that is something they cannot cover with propaganda. Jobs simply are not returning to the coal towns which voted them in, they have utterly failed to do anything with healthcare, and their tax bill is easy to campaign against with the line "Your tax break ends in ten years. His doesn't." Hell, their laughable attempts at a "Muslim Ban" have even shown they can't get appeasing the KKK right. These are people we can get into the fold with the right kind of populism.

    We can still fix this.

      This is functionally an admission that their arguments are stronger than yours.  But more pertinently, repression of Nazi speech, alongside street violence against them, was actually an integral part of their rise to power.  It gave them an oppressed/victim narrative that grew the movement considerably.  As was mentioned elsewhere in this thread, this sort of thing is just going to push them further; it's the exact same logic progressives tout regarding the radicalization of Islam.  You're even doing the exact same thing progressives used to decry when Republicans would condemn all Islam.  If you're declaring that *all* Republicans are evil, then you're functionally normalizing their actual extremist element.

        I don't think it's an admission their arguments are strong at all. Their arguments are 100% based on lies! However, the ideas of fascists have proven to be pernicious and self-sustaining, and given the damage they do to society just by existing that is not acceptable. Censoring them just enough that their choices are go to prison or look utterly ridiculous (as has been done in Germany, where they are forced to wave Confederate flags because all of their other possible symbols are banned), limits the amount of damage they can do by making them look far less appealing to the kinds of people it is easiest for them to recruit.

I would be right but incitement to hatred laws are surprisingly bipartisan and haven't lead too far down the slippery slope as far as I can tell though they are inching towards further censorship.
