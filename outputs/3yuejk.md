## [Biweekly Challenge] Paperclipper

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3x58rz/biweekly_challenge_dungeons_dragons/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Dungeons & Dragons". /u/Rhamni is the winner with their story ["Flowcharts"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3x58rz/biweekly_challenge_dungeons_dragons/cy1od3m), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/Rhamni!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be "Paperclippers". A paperclipper (or paperclip optimizer) is a hypothetical unfriendly artificial intelligence (UFAI) which has a utility function set to "optimize for paperclips". The shortest path to doing this is to make paperclips out of everything on the planet, which includes all of humanity. This would be bad. More generally, the term refers to any superintelligent UFAI who acts in a way opposed to human values but not (usually) deliberately evil. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, January 13th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be "Immortality", one of the transhumanist goals and also one of those things that popular media tends to frown upon. It's a wide open field that ranges from *Dorian Grey* to the Fountain of Youth, emulated minds on fully redundant systems to angsty vampires.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 1/13.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

  This is a long one, probably needs to be pruned a fair bit. It's part of a rational Doctor Who setting I'm working on. The setting does away with a lot of canon (because honestly a lot of canon is idiotic) and this story shouldn't need any existing knowledge.

  Just in case, a brief summary of the needed information: the Doctor is an immortal Time Lord from Gallifrey who travels in the Tardis, a time machine that appears in the form of a blue police box on the outside and like a space ship (of changing appearance) on the inside. Time Lords possess the ability to regenerate into a new body after death and the Doctor is (as far as he knows) the last of his kind, having permanently sealed Gallifrey away to end a terrible war.

    That was great. Really looking forward to more from you: I've wanted to read rational-Who for about as long as I wanted to read a rational-anything, and I think you really captured a part of what it would look like :)

    That was damn good.

      Thanks! If my other drafts are any good, a revised version of this might end up as a chapter in a larger Rational!Who fanfic.

      There's still the niggling problem of the series arc. Analysing my initial plan more closely has revealed it isn't consistent with my explanation of time travel. Hopefully I get that sorted, because I'm feeling pretty optimistic about this.

    Nice, one fix, you've got a repeated phrase:

    Brought here by the contest win.  Well done, and even more kudos for not screwing it up.

    You came close enough to a win that I have to just trust that reddit's ranking algorithms got it right; you are therefore awarded some gold from my private stash. (Also, I really enjoyed your story.)
