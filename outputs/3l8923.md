  Now I'm trying to remember the story where someone provides counter-explanations for one of Holmes' "amazing" deductions.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think it was "Watson Learns the Trick," or something like that. Notable for being written by Doyle himself to make fun of his overzealous fans.
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      Did Doyle know his character was full of shit? That sounds like he knew.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Doyle was a pretty sharp tack, by all accounts.  I'd be willing to bet if we were able to ask him "You know Sherlock's deductions are mostly bullshit, yeah?", he'd respond something along the lines of "Where the hell am I?  What year is it?  Give me that glowing device you're carrying, I'd like to inspect it.  And yes, of course the stories are over the top.  They're stories."
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          He was also really into fairies. And mysticism.
          ```

      - u/notmy2ndopinion:
        ```
        Doyle was a physician who modeled Sherlock on one of his mentors. However, he wanted to stop writing stories about him and killed off his character in the Reichenbach fall. The general public were so upset about this that they bugged him for years afterward and he gave up and wrote more stories with the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          AFAIK he actually resurrected Holmes because he ran into money issues, not because people kept bugging him.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            I think it was a little bit of both.
            ```

          Now I want to see HPMOR ran through a gangsta language/culture filter...

            I really should be doing math homework but..... talk to me tomorrow.

            I'm white as HELL. But I'll do my best.

        ```
        Or any show involving investigation, especially House. 

        Doctor: this should fix your illness. 
        Patient: Then why can I hear in yellow? What does that mean?
        Doctor takes temperature and pulse.
        Doctor: <stares incredulously> It means I was wrong, it isn't lupus.

        - u/Sparkwitch:
          ```
          That one doesn't fall particularly far from the tree, though. Holmes/Watson become House/Wilson and the detective is a drugged-up sociopath sick of life but fascinated by mysteries. The formula branched after a few seasons, but House isn't CSI: Princeton-Plainsborough. It's the medical adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
          ```
