Marked for Death is an RPG-style story set in a rational reimagining of Naruto, where thread participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.


The first chapter is [here,](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/) and the story-only thread (if you’d like to get caught up quickly) is [here.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/4993131/) There’s also a [guide to voting](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6283682/) put together by Twofold, one of the thread participants.

  Yes, he's extremely singy.  Bursts out into song on a regular basis, actually.  Lovely contrabasso, don't you think?

  I really liked this chapter! I found Hazou's speech a bit long last chapter (I wish I could just go on soliloquise like that without anyone interrupting), but I love how the decisions made by people in the forum cause Hazou to be brilliant half of the time and oblivious in the other half. Right now he's my favourite character I think - Mori's my least favourite. She's way too self-centered for my tastes. 

  I want to see Hazou finally dodge Mari's hair ruffle. I'm guessing that that'll be a big moment for the two of them. You need to allow him an actual dodge roll for that to ever happen though!

  I'm looking forward to see how they'll interact with the other characters in Leaf. Was surprised that they sent the team with 3 noble heirs and the Third's son to escort them, that seems needlessly dangerous. I'm hoping they'll get to meet Naruto and Sasuke - very curious to see what you've done with those two characters especially. 

  Edit: Oh, and I vote tremorsense over skidmark if I can do that here, and WOW the thread on SV is already 4 pages along since I read the chapter. I can't keep up with that!

    We are, admittedly, a pretty active bunch. We're trying to help Keiko, incidentally, but we'll have to see how well that goes.

    If the sheer volume of it is unmanageable, you're always welcome to pop in near vote times and look over the options once they've largely settled :)
