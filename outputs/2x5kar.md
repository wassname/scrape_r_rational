  I don't know why I expected a series called "Failure" to have any sort of happy ending.

  Still reeling from the loss of Dumbledore honestly. That's a masterful chess move if I ever seen one. The definition of playing the game "one level higher than you do". 

  I really want to see what Voldemort's end game for Harry is. He's seemingly investing a lot (although I guess, on his scale, a unicorn, a murder, a troll and a 5 minute ritual isn't THAT much) in Harry's well being here. Even accounting for the prophecy here. In addition, I feel like prophecies play the game at level zero anyway. As in, I feel they're invulnerable to the sort of direct manipulation Riddle (both of them) favors.

    I'm pretty sure that 'one level higher than you' remark was specific to Harry. QV is literally one level higher than Harry at any point in time because he can run an internal self-simulation of Harry's rational processes.

      He misread Harry multiple times, and said so in Parseltounge iirc.

        Of course - I didn't mean to imply that he was infallible in so doing.

      Agreed, it was directed at Harry. But that doesn't mean he wasn't playing one level higher then DD as well. Although the story's not over, so for all I know, this could get very meta.

  The 28^th? Ack! EY, why must you torture me so?

  It seems Voldemort is rather hilariously misinterpreting a prophecy about Harry bringing about the Singularity. (Well, hilarious if you're not Harry.)

    Misinterpreting? It's obviously going to be a non-friendly AI which will kill and destroy everything. ;)

      You say that like Harry is non-Friendly.

  So uh, why *didn't* he kill Harry, then? Why is he able to parseltongue-promise to kill him if he tries anything (indicating that killing him couldn't be *that* bad) yet has not already killed him?

  Maybe killing Harry is no use, maybe he just gets transferred to another Horcrux since he shares a "soul" with Riddle? (Riddle fixed the whole continuity issue, right?)

  Hot damn. Just when I had read the first part, the next comes.

- u/None:
  ```
  It might just be me, but Voldemort seems too smart.  Always ready for any encounter.  It seems to be that he's like a intelligence lvl 5.
  ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    He had 9 years to plan this whole thing with no distractions.
