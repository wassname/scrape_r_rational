      Wow... is the author 13?

      And this is not the first (or even second) light novel I've read were mid-20s to early-30s is considered "old" and "once-beautiful". 

      *Release that Witch* describes a character named Scroll the same way. 

      Other than that, I am enjoying the story so far, so I'll tentatively second this rec.

    How about [Release that Witch](https://www.webnovel.com/book/7931338406001705/Release-That-Witch)? No Harems, No Fanservice, No OP powers, all played relatively straight.
    ```

    - u/Calsem:
      ```
      \> no harems

      \> Literally has an entire group of adoring women surrounding him

      It may not be a typical harem but it is definitely similar.

      The "No OP powers" is debatable.  The author does do a good job of leveling up enemies along with the protag, but the protag wins a bit more often that I would like.

      That being said, release that witch is better than most isekais.  Uplifting a medieval civilizatoin is straight up /r/rational's alley.

  I've recently read through the [Kaiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiji_(manga)) manga series and I'm craving more gambling style manga. Similar examples would be Gamble Fish, Liar Game, and Gambling Emperor Zero.

  I'm also requesting fanfiction of Temeraire. Dragons in the military are so much fun to read about.

  I suppose I should provide recommendations as well right? There is [Chili Pepper Mint](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14686974/chapters/33934212) which is fanfic of [*The Care and Feeding of Magical Creatues*](http://sadehall.tumblr.com/)*,* [Harry and Hermione Starring in the Digital Revolution](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922890/13/Harry-and-Hermione-Starring-in-The-Digital-Revolution) has recently updated, and [Advice and Trust](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/advice-and-trust-nge.8768/) which is a beautifully written romance between Asuka and Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion where they are actually rational about their Hollywood\-like romance.
  ```

  - u/Badewell:
    ```
    For gambling manga:

    You've already read Kaiji and Gambling Emperor Zero, and if you like those basically everything else written by Fukumoto will probably also be up your alley.

    If you aren't sick of Mahjong yet Tetsunaki no Kirinji is pretty good.

    If the fanservicey stuff like Gamble Fish doesn't put you off Kakegurui is probably worth a try.

    For less gambly more mind gamey stuff I liked Spiral: Suiri no Kizuna. For very edgy mind games Tomodachi Game was decent.

    Might edit more in later, I feel like I'm drawing a blank for more similar titles.

    Go through the rational faq for recommended works. Some of the shorter stories were great. Branches of the Tree of Time, the MLP one, A Bluer Shade of White. I also enjoyed Shadows of the Limelight and Time Braid. Active stories on here Worth the Candle and Practical Guide to Evil are highly recommended.

    One story I greatly enjoy but is not quite rational is Taint. [https://lsdell.com/table\-of\-contents/](https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/)

    If you liked Seventh Horcrux, check out [Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/) by the same author - it's not on fanfiction.net so you might not have come across it before. It's a similar sort of hilarity, but for the Naruto fandom instead, and has a few rational-adjacent running jokes (especially with regards to doublethink).

    Have you read [Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/)? I just finished it and really enjoyed it. It's slightly heavy on worldbuilding as opposed to character development, and I think at least part of your potential enjoyment of it will correlate with how much you enjoy puns, but it's definitely entertaining. If you enjoy feeling like an author is much, much smarter than you are, it will scratch that itch. If you also happen to enjoy references to obscure Jewish trivia, well, happy day.j

    I suggest it not because it is very like any of those things you say you enjoyed, but because I've enjoyed those same things and really liked Unsong. Except for Troll 2. YMMV.

    I'm really tempted to recommend Glimwarden here.

    In all seriousness, how about Spice and Wolf (anime/manga)?  It's not agenda-driven rational lit., but it doesn't rely on stupidity, misunderstandings, arbitrariness, or mystery boxes.

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I'll have to give Spice and Wolf a shot; it's one of those things that I've seen recommendations for a fair amount, and put on a list somewhere, but the list got lost.

      FWIW, I would consider Glimwarden pastoral in setting, as it takes place in a small(ish) town surrounded by farmland and is a bit cozy in that sense ... but not really pastoral in terms of the archetype. I really *should* reread it though, since it's been some time (too long).

      (There have been a couple of different studies that show writing things down makes us less likely to remember them, which I think is definitely the case for me; stories that mostly living in the brain stay there, while stories that go onto the page tend to vanish.)
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        >I really should reread it though

        By all means, do! If that doesnt scratch your itch and you need to take up writing it again, well --- too bad, nothing that can be done about it, it must've been fate etc etc.
        ```

      - u/CarsonCity314:
        ```
        If I can comment on a work in progress, I don't think you need to escalate the level of conflict in Glimwarden as much as you might think. 

        I really liked the early narrative based on concepts of maturation and finding/making a place for yourself within the context of this isolating, resource-limited world.  I also enjoyed the magic system munchkinry and mystery box elements of the increasing threat, but there's friction between those and the early narrative that relies on the status quo as context.  My completely unsubstantiated guess is that friction was behind the burnout/hiatus.

    Have you given [Yokohama Shopping Trip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kikō) a read? It’s a 14 volume manga.

    Up front, it doesn’t outright fit the boxes you selected, but is adjacent to them in a. lot of ways. It’s about a gynoid/robot managing a small café. There are occasional guests, but much of the story is about her traveling, experiencing the world around her, and keeping her friendship with her neighbours. the story is very much low on dialogue (whole chapters with but a few words uttered), with lots of scenic images. Much of the science fiction could very well be fantasy (there are streetlamp plants, for instance, and other creatures). On TVT the setting is described as a *cozy catastrophe* and *humankind in decline*, which appears to be true, but another way to look at it would be mankind passing the baton of exhilarating advancement to their children and leaning back in their rocking chair. There’re also quite a few peculiarities in the setting that aren’t ever explained to the reader,

    So… there are checkmarks in pastoral scenes and slice of life, and science fiction is more conceptually expressed than hard. The pacing is very measured (some might say slow), and consumption shouldn’t be rushed.

    There’s also an OVA adaptation, but I don’t remember how I felt about that one. The manga was published outside of Japan only in Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, so you’d have to look for translation elsewhere. Incidentally, it also won the Seiun award, a very noteworthy speculative fiction award in Japan (other winners, for comparison: *Japan sinks*, *Legend of Galactic Heroes*, *Empire of Corpses*)

    To be frank: YKK is one of my favourite manga, definitely in the top ten and a good contender for first place, so I am a fairly biased in my recommendation.

    **[The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/2016/07/27/1-00/)** is about half Slice of Life, about a fantasy litRPG world that several earthlings have recently been teleported to. Two protagonists that the story switches between, Erin and Ryoka, and I've always thought of it as two different stories with different genres and goals being told side-by-side. Erin's story is very Slice of Life and an absolute joy to read.

      I tried it, but couldn't get into it, despite really liking the basic premise. I think it's fairly common for web serials to have slow/awkward starts; is that the case with The Wandering Inn?

  Two of the very few DC fics I've read with a protagonist I not only tolerate but also enjoy. There's clearly beena  lot of research into the timeframe, to the point that the world just feels real; even the dc elements have a depth to them thats complete enough and with just the tinge of the bizarre that makes it feel like an actual history. Best of all, the infodumps are pretty seamless and well spread out throughout the story.

  For fans of Mother of Learning, or if you are intrigued by the Chinese Xianxia/Wuxia stories but don't enjoy the poor writing, try the Cradle series by Will Wight.  His 5th book just came out the beginning of this month, called Ghostwater, on Amazon.  First book is called Unsouled.  The genre is fantasy/adventure/action, and the magic system is pretty well developed and thought out.  Lots of great fighting scenes and humor thrown in, and great characters.

  I want to take a moment to recommend the website FimFiction.net, the website for My Little Pony fanfiction. My interest in the fandom has waned, but it's just such an incredibly well designed and easy to use website compared to just about every other content website out there. You can search by total views, total likes, like/dislike ratio, genre, characters, wordcount, it's just so easy compared to everything else. And the quality search function is just the beginning of what it offers. I don't know how much someone who isn't familiar with My Little Pony will get out of it, but I wanted to put this message out there.

  [The Zombie Knight](http://thezombieknight.blogspot.ca/): A fic about an alternate universe where there are spirit-things called Reapers that can revive people from the dead and give them superpowers. Very funny, lots of action, good world building. Unfortunately inconsistent, but it's not too bad and the author does a decent job of retconning.

  [The Gods are Bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/): A fantasy novel that originally presents itself as also a western, but besides for one arc is mostly about industrilization and the effects of increasing globalization, interconnectedness, and various social justice movements in addition to the standard fantasy fare. The main plot is around university students who are all learning to be adventures and have appropriate backgrounds, e.g are the chosen champions of gods or one is a pirate princess. There are multiple sub plots focusing on other characters however.

  I'd like some audio book recommendations so I can use up a backlog of audible credits.

  I'm in a mood for fantasy /scifi books with fast or adventure-y plots, especially if there's a good narrator.  (Dresden Files was amazing)

  The big limit is that I like smart characters, but, because of life circumstances, I'll be listening to the book in small chunks and might be splitting my attention between it and kids.

  Short witty scenes are great, since I can drop in and enjoy them.  I'm going to miss too much to enjoy a sprawling plot or vast cast of characters.

[Plunder\-funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund), Hero\-firms, and a racist (literally! \- blame the elves!) class\-system have formed oligopolies, capturing the world economy and driving heroes to quest to make ends meet, driving up prices everywhere, and mass\-producing relics.

  I'm going to quickly pop in and recommend Sense8, which is going to have its finale released on the 8th of June. I'm looking forward to it and dreading it at the same time. It's a great story by the Wachowskis and JMS and they intended a 5 season arc, but early reviews of the finale state that it's a very good finale. 

  Episode 4 is widely considered the place where it becomes clear what the series is about, so if you watch it and don't like it at first but want to give it a chance, episode 4 is where it begins to show its potential. 

  I think rational will like it because although it isn't primarily a rational story, munchkinry is a clear focus.
  ```

  - u/ngocnv371:
    ```
    The story has good potential, but instead of trying to utilize their powers, all the characters are too absorbed in their own personal struggle. Their reaction when having a bad guy looking for them is "run very fast" and "keep 1 member permanently under drugs" and "having group orgies".
    ```

      I think that's unfair, the end of season 2 shows that they have done some very clever things about the bad guy. As far as the personal struggle, another way I describe the show is "imagine if 8 really good dramas were interconnected and joined" - so I think that's a feature rather than a bug, getting to watch / enjoy each character's story.

      The group orgies is something that the show got a reputation for that is pretty unearned, I mean yes they happen but they occupy the same amount of "sex scene" time that something like GoT has in its run time, and I think they're very beautiful / artistic / poetic like a renaissance painting in motion rather than gratuitous.

      But anyway, YMMV, and if you are really averse to sexual content then it's not the show for you.

  Anyone know of any good treasure hunting adventure stories? Which is to say, the sort of thing you'd expect Indiana Jones to be doing.
  ```

    Funnily enough, such stories seem to be in short supply when it comes to manga. The only two I know of are [Toriko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toriko) and [Hunter x Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter). But they don't *quite* fit since Toriko's about hunting food not treasure, Hunter x Hunter doesn't spend too much time on hunting treasure (the characters are often doing something else despite it being their job), and both of them require the characters to be superhuman in a way that Indiana Jones can't. I would LOVE a manga about a treasure hunter who *isn't* superhuman in some way.

  I recently had the opportunity to buy [the entire 18-book Recluce series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41825) for $3 per book.\* I found the [first](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/185253) and [third](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/185200) books to be worth four-star ratings (they included some interesting intermittent digressions into woodworking and metalworking, respectively, in addition to having fun stories), but the [second](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/185251) and [fourth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/185197) books were three-star *at best*, and the [fifth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/618243) and [sixth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/185224) books have been two-star embarrassments, with (in my opinion) too much filler and too little action. I've taken a (possibly-permanent) break from the sixth book in favor of finally reading *[A Fire Upon the Deep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711)*\* (four stars? five? I can't remember) for the second time.

  Reminder: [*Time Braid*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644) is an awesome story. Yudkowsky-sama himself [has stated](https://www.fanfiction.net/r/5193644/31/1/) (`Ctrl`+`F` "Less Wrong"):

  > ...this is almost exactly to [*Ch\[u\]nin Exam Day*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411) what [*Methods of Rationality*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108) is to [*Partially Kissed Hero*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771).

  > Well done, well said, and well ended.

    I lived th recluse books as a kid! Especially how like the lives of heroes past turned from history to myth. Lerris is still my favorite of the bunch because I started with him, but I think my favorite book was probably the order war, about his uncle Justin learning gray mage craft and bringing down fairhaven?

    Which of the two Naruto fanfictions is he comparing to HPMOR?
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      The quote means that Time Braid's differences from Chunin Exam Day are similar to the differences between Methods and Partially Kissed Hero, so it's Time Braid being compared to HPMOR.

      Chunin Exam Day (Naruto) and Partially Kissed Hero (Harry Potter) are both really bad, enjoyable maybe if you've spent an entire childhood frustrated at the problems in the respective canon but still aren't old/well-read enough to have taste.  They address the problems of canon by incessantly bashing everything that irks the author while making the protagonist into an unstoppable Mary Sue with very questionable morals.

      Chunin Exam Day and Partially Kissed Hero are vents for author frustrations and power fantasies.  HPMOR and Time Braid are coherent stories with proper characterization and themes and the works, even though a first glance might indicate they're similar to their badfic counterpart.

      *Chunin Exam Day* ∶ *Time Braid* ∷ *Partially Kissed Hero* ∶ *HPMoR*

      *Partially Kissed Hero* = good *Harry Potter* story  
      *HPMoR* = great *Harry Potter* story  
      *Chunin Exam Day* = good *Naruto* story  
      *Time Braid* = great *Naruto* story
      ```

        Partially kissed hero and chunin exam day are awful stories, not good ones. HPMoR, and even time braid despite my dislike of it, are so far above them it isnt funny.

  Wouldn't call it rational by any stretch, but I've been enjoying the manga Hoshino Close Your Eyes. / Hoshino me wo tsubate

  https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=130286

  For a harem rom com, it's got surprisingly good writing. It's about a antisocial loner getting roped into doing makeup for a girl in his class who leads a double life - her pretty popular made up self and her unfettered athletic unmade up aelf. Essentially it's a super hero story from the POV of the secret keeper, but the super hero plot is merely a device to explore the coming of age story.

  Probably what I'm most enjoying is the theme of (personal) identity, the different roles we take with various people we interact with, and balancing that with vulnerability in relationships. Echoes a lot of themes in Ward, appropriately enough.

  It's probably the best harem rom com I've read snice Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa/My Monster Secret , which is decidedly not rational (all of the characters are loveable idiots - indeed thwir most threatening antagonist is explicitly acknowledged in story as so fearsome be cause they're not an idiot), but it's got one of the best endings in any media I've experienced in recent memory.

  I need an english text of my choosing and I was wondering if our subreddit could offer something nice. My topic is based on landscapes and people's relationships with them, but the landscapes can be any type (urban, natural, homely) of any form, (real, remembered or imagined). I'm looking for something that shows people's interaction with different landscapes and how they are affected by them. Any genre, any text type (except non\-fiction, since we are already using a non\-fiction text). Even oblique examples such as games and podcasts could work well if they explore landscapes (Elder Scrolls was an interesting suggestion)

    You could try [Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8680.Fierce_Invalids_Home_from_Hot_Climates) by Tom Robbins. It's one of my favourite books, mostly because of the exquisite prose. In the book he travels all over the world, from the US to the Amazon to the Middle East, and he tends to describe the various locales very distinctly. Here's an example:

    >Switters was actually quite fond of Seattle's weather, and not merely because of it's ambivalence. He liked it's subtle, muted qualities and the landscape that those qualities encouraged if not engendered: vistas that seemed to have been sketched with a sumi brush dipped in quicksilver and green tea. It was fresh, it was clean, it was gently primal, and mystically suggestive.

    It is not a typical recommendation for this sub. The MC is proudly irrational at times, and it gets very weird.
