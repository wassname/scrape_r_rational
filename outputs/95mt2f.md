## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I am currently developing a puzzle game that I hope will share the reasons why I enjoy physics and learning new concepts. My project is starting with optics, which in my opinion is the easiest to translate to the visual medium of gaming. However I do not just want to have everything be super realistic as this would be boring to anyone who already understands optics, or is just not interested in it. I am going to include a system of magic in my world that players will have to discover.

  My world is set sometime between 1950 and 1960, in an alternate reality which until this point is very similar to our own. The development of lasers have uncovered a system of physical laws unlike what we have in our own universe. The magic system will be based on creating polygons from the lasers intersecting. Currently the idea is for the player to discover this system while solving unrelated puzzles about making lasers go around obstacles. 

  Different polygons would have different magical effects and the strength of the magical effect would depend on the size of the polygon and how close it is to the ideal polygonal shape. My demo currently only has squares creating a force normal to the plane of the square. 

  Other ideas I have to form in the center of a polygon: 

  magnetic/electric fields,

  making the color of the lasers change some parameter,

  lights,

  sound,

  temperature,

  pretty much anything that currently already is in physics.

  I do not want to go to far afield from what is currently described in physics, like say a stable large wormhole, or effects which would represent a huge amount of energy such as fusion/fission.

  While conservation of energy is not necessary, I am going to try to keep it within sight. 

  Now that the system has been described, and given you are limited to the size of a classroom, what would be some things you would like to try and create? I would then try and implement them into the game.

    Some things that immediately come to mind is building a kind of laser based generator. Create alternating current by moving the laser that creates magnetic/electric fields, etc. Maybe strong enough for some lightening? 

    If you put an object in between two identical square lasers, it would form a sort of grip, right? This could be used as a sort of levitation device, or maybe a squashing device. Plus, you could make a hover board if you could attach the lasers to an object.  

    Temperature is probably the easiest in a sense that you could make refrigerators. I remember my thermodynamics professor had a big hard on for proving all the laws using refrigerators and heat pumps (the old fashioned way) so it would be cool to brake these examples with laser magic. I'm sure they're floating around somewhere. This would have some interesting implications in relation to entropy and all that jazz.

    On a somewhat related note, have you played any of the [Zachtronics](http://www.zachtronics.com/) games? I love them cause they're less "here's a puzzle; solve it" and more "here's a design doc and some tools; make this thing". It sounds like you're trying a similar approach so I would give them a look.

  I'm sick but I have a conundrum so here's a nice short summary of my issue:

  - I am writing a vampire romance story, and I want the human to be able to snuggle the vampire during daytime sleeping because it's adorable

  - Vampires sleep during the day and can't be woken

  - Vampires will try to kill each other - not like every 5 minutes, but every few dozen years, maybe

  - So you're at risk when you're asleep of a rival vampire's human servant coming and setting you on fire or just dragging you into the sun

  - By the same token, if you have a favoured human servant / bodyguard, they can be threatened and thus manipulated to kill you

  - So under no circumstances would you ever allow your sleeping body to be anywhere near a human, no matter how much you trusted them

  - But then I, as an author, don't get to write cute snuggly sleepy vampire/human scenes?!

  How do I fix this? How do we make it so a vampire is comfortable with an unhindered human being around it while it's sleeping? I had some options:

  - a) Relax the "human has to be around" requirement, and just have the vampire lock itself in bed each night (or lock the human in a cage or something)

     - Problem: it makes the most sense but fucks up the "cute snuggly bedtime vibe" I was going for.

  - b) Relax the "vampire can't be woken from sleep" requirement: a sleeping vampire, when moved, will wake up, but in a groggy, sleep-walk way and is likely to lash out at whatever woke it

    - Problem: a stake immobilises a vampire, so the problem is just moved from "why don't you drag the vampire outside" to "why don't you stake the vampire then drag it outside"

    - Another big problem: you can kill a vampire by cutting off its head, so the human could just straight up kill you while you're asleep?

  - c) Have the vampires tell humans that b) is true, in the "if you pee in the pool it will turn the water red!" sort of way

    - Problem: surely someone has tested this at some point, or would try to test it under controlled conditions: it is worth the risk? 

    - Problem: vampires tell other lies to humans, do they really want to add another to the pile?

  - d) Have the vampire chain itself to the bed so it can't be dragged off; or wear armour to bed

    - Problem: a bit too 50 shades of grey for me; surely vampires have heard of bolt cutters; short of swallowing it, where could a vampire hide a key?

    - Problem: if you're wearing armour to bed, the human can just take it off you

  Anyway, I think b) is the way to go, but then I still run into the problems outlined there.

  I'm happy to explain this by modifying the vampire lore somehow, or by coming up with a good strategy for vampires to use to keep themselves safe. 

  Because I'm writing a romance story I don't want e.g. the vampire to threaten "if you kill me, my dead man's switch goes off and my vampire friends kill you and your family", or anything else that similarly puts the human in an uncomfortable position. I'm also uneasy about the vampire implicitly trusting a human after only a few months.

    .. You are thinking about this wrong. A sleeping vampire is defenseless. There are two solves for this: The first is to hide your sleeping spot, the second is to always have someone there to defend you, and the first of these ends up being highly impractical, since you have to shake any theoretical trail every single morning.

    Particularly paranoid vampires might be very careful to pick paramours with few external levers, but honestly, I expect old vampires to have the social skills to notice if their lovers are being blackmailed into murder. 

    Not to mention that it seems like the sort of tactic which could easily get extremely taboo. - Everyone wants a companion to be there to answer the door and do daytime buisness, so everyone is far better off if targeting them is just not done, on pain of the collective displeasure of every vampire in town.

      >  I expect old vampires to have the social skills to notice if their lovers are being blackmailed into murder.

      That's something else I didn't consider. Vampires would have a lot of experience with humans in all stages of deception. Exit interviews with Survivor contestants also comes to mind (former winners coming back to play say they were at a disadvantage because they never got to see the odd behaviour others did just before voting them off). 

      Thanks!

        Feel free to rip these of for inspiration: Some models for how a vampire might interact with their live-in minion/paramour, mostly stolen from better functioning WoD games.

        "The serial romantic": This entity is 700 years old, and also stuck in a cycle of falling lin love, living happily until their paramour dies, then spending 7 years despodent with grief, only to do it all over again. They are very aware that this is how they work, but is of the very firm opinion that it is overall worth it, and that the eventual grief does not taint the present happyness. 
        Also, *terrifyingly good* at being a spouse. Practice.
        Also; has murdered at least 23 people who falsely promised a non-vampiric path to immortality. Gruesomely. 

        The bargainer: The world is vast, and full of tragedy. Did your entire family just die in a car crash? Murder suicide? Fire? Get sentenced to 900 years in maximum for running a epic ponsi scheme? This personage will hear, and may have a proposition for you. They never  cause any of these tragedies, - there is no need, and the risk of discovery would be a ticking bomb.  Hardly anyone ever says no.
        ... The rare ones that do, well, the sea is deep and full of secrets. One more wont matter. 

        "Teacher": For centuries, there have been places you can give up unwanted children for adoption with no paperwork and with no eyes on you. The mercy box at the convent, a heated drawer on the outside of a hospital.  Occasionally, someone placed there never arrives at their expected destination. They always end up named Robin, and there are few beings on this earth as omni-competent as a Robin eventually becomes.

    How is this fundamentally different from just being a deep sleeper?

    I've slept around people who have demonstrated the abability of approaching and touching me without waking me, and never felt the need to make any particular assurances that they won't set me on fire, even though I doubt they'd have much physical touble doing it without  waking me prior to me being on fire. 
    While your vampire would surely be cautious about enemies learning where they sleep I think "no human not even one I trust to arbitrary degrees, can ever know" is an irrational leap.

    I'd also think that having a trusted human who can deal with any assassins sent by rival vampires on hand would be useful. To ensure loyalty treat them well, deal with anyone harassing/intimidating them harshly and have a standing offer to beat any bribe to betray you they are offered. As an added precaution have 2 or more so they can watch each other and any rival will have to turn multiple highly loyal retainers.

    Three things can kill a sleeping vampire: Bad Luck, Hostile Forces, and Betrayal.  Partners can betray you.  But they're helpful when it comes to random fires or opposing vampires.

    I'd be tempted to go with a modified (b).  A vampire, sleeping alone, is dead to the world.  A vampire, sleeping next to a human, feels groggy and comfortable, like a person under a warm duvet.  The human feels similarly comfortable  This gives you more opportunities to write romance.  Comfortable vampires talk, but don't remember their conversations the next day.

    It also shifts the math a bit.  

    Humanity used to be really, really bad at fire safety.  So, in all likelihood, there were a bunch of vampires who burned to death in random urban fires.  Paranoid vampires would be especially vulnerable to this.  If I don't tell my thralls where I'm sleeping, then they can't pull me out when my enemies toss a couple torches onto my roof.

    If I have a human sleeping next to me, then there's someone there to wake up to the smell of smoke and drag me out of the burning building.

    I wouldn't worry too much about armor and chains.  Vampires could use them.  And humans could sleep under a kevlar duvets.  But, in practice, if the SWAT team has kicked in my door and burst into my bedroom, then I'm already doomed, regardless of the covering.  The escape route + human to drag me through it would be a good trade.

    I see a possible solution based off of vampire social dynamics. Given their tendencies towards compulsive behavior and complex internal politics, plus the fact that they could reproduce vastly faster than they ever seem to in practice, I'm assuming that they've got a very complex, ritualized, formal set of rules for interacting with each other, presumably enforced by ancient powerful vampires and/or social norms. 

    As such, what if the "rules" for killing another vampire forbid a good chunk of your threat model? I'm assuming that social status is a common reason to kill a rival vampire, so social pressure would probably be a viable defense against a good chunk of that.
