### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  So, it's been a bit since [my other things-I've-read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ugqabu/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/i745q4o/) and I thought I'd make another. Here are some more things that I've read in the last few months that I think are worth bringing up. Some of these have already been posted by other users in other threads.

  As before, I don't read smut, so all of these should be SFW.

  Rough Scale: Dropped < OK < Good < Great < Awesome

  &nbsp;

  [Life Ore Death](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/life-ore-death-young-justice-crossover.489535/) - 1.4m Words - Young Justice / Mistborn (Dropped):

  I love Brandon Sanderson, so a Mistborn crossover this well done should make me very happy. It even (eventually) handles the magic really well! Unfortunately, major pacing problems make it feel like it's following a modification of the YJ plot, episode by episode, instead of flowing as a natural narrative. Pick it up if you want something to read, but feel free to drop it once you get bored.

  &nbsp;

  [Doors to the Unknown](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/doors-to-the-unknown-worm-d-d-fusion-crossover.1001110/) - 300k Words - D&D / Worm (Great):

  This one was recommended by another user on the same thread I last posted. Crossover between D&D and Worm, but not in a way you'd expect. Instead of another Taylor Alt-Power, the story follows Valigan Talaire, a D&D immortal mage who is investigating the recently discovered Worm universe to take his mind off how he just lost his husband. Somehow, the author reconciles D&D plane mechanics with Worm's entities. I don't as much enjoy the other half of the story, where Taylor & Co are transported to Eberron, but it's definitely well written.

  &nbsp;

  [As N Approaches Infinity](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3553727) - 480k Words - Puella Magi Madoka Magika / Bleach (Awesome):

  Somone recommended this in one of the last few threads, and man is this one awesome. Homura finds support for her loops, characters actually talk to each other, and lots of feels. Never watched Bleach, but the characters pulled in from there are written well. Probably my favorite PMMM fic now. Not on pace to ever "finish" but what's here is enough to be enjoyed. 

  &nbsp;

  [Tainted Steel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tainted-steel-fate-stay-night-with-tsukihime-elements.861166/) - 180k Words - Fate / Tsukihime (Great):

  I really have a soft spot for any fic with Shirou Emiya in it. Tainted Steel is Fate/Stay Night, except before the grail war Shirou gets apprenticed by a powerful Dead Apostle and heavily embraces his reality marble very quickly. Still updating, and the story has gone a long way without the war even starting yet. 

  &nbsp;

  [Serenity Malfoy and the Hogwards Education](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/serenity-malfoy-and-the-hogwarts-education-harry-potter-sailor-moon.1012830/) - 74k Words - Sailor Moon / Harry Potter (Good):

  Written by the same author as Life Ore Death, this story follows Sailor Moon, except she's raised by the Malfoys in a hybrid HP / SM universe. So far, it's been some wholesome fun with investigations into ghost-affecting magic, and some minor family drama simmering under the surface. I'm hopeful this one will go places.

  &nbsp;

  [What was Created by God](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/what-was-created-by-god-percy-jackson-fate-grand-order.1001080/) - 100k Words - Percy Jackson / Fate Grand Order (Good):

  Percy (and Annabeth, eventually) each find themselves alone in the FGO Lostbelt. Cue confusion as to why their powers don't work right, their parents sound weird, giant robot monsters exist, and old heroes are showing up. A little slow paced, but enjoyable whenever a chapter drops.

  &nbsp;

  [Unsanctioned Mishap](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/unsanctioned-mishap-admis-supergirl-worm-sanctioned-worm.105144/) - 50k Words - Supergirl / Worm (Good):

  This is a meta-fanfiction of Administrative Mishap (Supergirl/Worm) and Unsanctioned (Worm). It's a little hard to describe without first going and reading all the Unsanctioned stories by Alivaril. Those are all feel-good Taylor-Ascends-To-Entityhood stories where Queen Admin is given a personality and just kind of fights the local setting's plot via out-of-context-problem powers, to humorous effect. Each one is dropped before it loses its luster, making these all great popcorn fics. 

  &nbsp;

  [SAPR](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sapr-rwby-mlp.674638/) - ~900k Words? - RWBY / MLP (Awesome):

  If you haven't already skipped to the next entry after reading that cursed crossover line, you're more adventurous than I was for a few years. I saw this fic floating around on spacebattles for several years before getting bored enough to actually give it a shot. I'm glad I eventually did. This story is a very well executed RWBY fic with random MLP imports as faunus. The main character and MLP import, Sunset, reminds me of Eustace Clarance Scrub from _Voyage of the Dawn Treader_. She's completely insufferable for the first several chapters of the book, before slowly getting a redemption arc that doesn't lose the core essense of who she is. It's quite a slow burn, but the author manages to juggle an extremely wide cast of characters by just having so many words to work with. Right now, the story is undergoing a rewrite, which means the latter half of the thread is currently unreadable - the first half has diverged enough from the original plotline that things no longer make sense. All told, I would give this a try if you're looking for something good set in RWBY.

  &nbsp;

  [Immersion](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/immersion-sword-art-online-au.103350/) - ~95k Words? - Sword Art Online [Quest] (OK):

  A quest by Birdsie, who often power ramps the protagonist and opposition alike. Decent popcorn, and a fun read whenever an update pops up. Not my favorite quest I'm currently following, but enjoyable enough to watchlist for sure.

  &nbsp;

  [The 3rd Law of Cultivation: Qi = MC^2](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-3rd-law-of-cultivation-qi-mc-2.1008298/) - 160k Words - Original / Cultivation (Dropped):

  A cultivation story that starts out with an interesting "I'm going to go my own way and make science qi pills" premise, but turns into more of a standard path cultivation story. Not awful by any means, just not interesting enough for me to finish catching up. The author definitely wrote this without a long-term plan for the story's path, and by the time you get 50 chapters in it shows.

      Here are a few beyond the few I linked in my other review post:

      [Fate/Alternative](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-alternative-pre-route-shirou-x-pathfinder-rpg.1021905/) - 46k Words - Pathfinder / Fate (Undecided. OK, maybe?):

      Shirou ends up in a pathfinder RPG setting. Not enough plot yet to really tell how good it's going to be. Shirou is considerably weaker than his companions in this one, and appears to have the harem protagonist aura on. Nothing serious yet, and given it's on spacebattles I don't expect anything explicit. I'm just not sure that, beyond Shirou's interactions with the pathfinder cast, the story being told is actually interesting enough to me for me to keep following. We'll see.

      &nbsp;

      [Hereafter](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hereafter-worm-x-fate-grand-order.90656/) - 320k Words - Fate Grand Order / Worm (Great):

      Post-GM, basically-unpowered Taylor ends up being a master in the FGO timeline, mentoring the twin male and female versions of the game's player character. Well written, but having not actually played FGO I don't find it as interesting as most other fate fics. I usually let chapters pile up a bit before catching up. No Shirou, but good enough that it doesn't really matter.

      &nbsp;

      [Forgotton Remnants](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/forgotten-remnants-fate-stay-night-rwby-crossover.836103/) - 110k Words, Dead - RWBY / Fate (Great):

      A drop-in, somewhat amnesiac, post-war Shirou ends up being discovered by Raven and her bandits. He's overpowered, and the rest of the story is basically everyone else dealing with it. The character interactions are interesting, and I don't think we see the inside of Shirou's head much, but it's been a bit since I read this one. Sadly, seems pretty dead.

      &nbsp;

      [Poisoned Chalice](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-poisoned-chalice-fate-zero-fate-grand-order.65495/) - 140k Words - Fate Stay/Night (Great):

      Sadly, I can't do a good review for this one. It updates slowly enough I don't remember the story by the time it updates again. I do remember really enjoying it, though. A bit slow, but well written.

  If you like Brockton Bay's Celestial Forge, but wish that: 

  * The MC had enough space to come to grips with his powers
  * The story focused on maybe one or two of the cooler / more exploitable perks instead of just throwing them in willy nilly
  * The tinkering was centered around abusing the ways magic and tech and perks can interact
  * Stuff actually happens and time actually passes

  Then boy have I got a story for you: Macronimicon's [Industrial Strength Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57011/industrial-strength-magic). It's fairly new on RR, but Patreon has chapters up to the 50's.
  ```

  - u/GlimmervoidG:
    ```
    Yep, I'm really enjoying Industrial Strength Magic. I like Macronimicon's work in general and this one is rather good. 

    That said, I think it would be better without the LitRPG system. I get why its there (the entire duology thing the story has going, with the two halves of Paradox as represented by his two parents) and it is woven meaningfully into the plot, but I think it's premise could stand on its own as a straight magic/superhero story. The duology could have been met without that element.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      While I also enjoy his work, it's kind of started to feel a bit like there's really only one story he just writes over and over again with a few changes.

      There's nothing wrong with that but reading them becomes a bit dull since you know it's going to retread the same tropes the last four have.
      ```

  - u/brocht:
    ```
    I like Macronimicon's writing in general, but I can't stand how he never really finishes anything. He seems to push it till he either writes himself into a corner or gets bored, then drops it. Does it seem like he has a more long-term plan with this work?

      Wake of the Ravager is getting finished apparently! He got a three book contract, so he's going to finish it next year for publishing. 

      I'm really stoked for this because Wake of the Ravager is my favourite series of his and one of my fav LitRPG systems period, right up there with Sins of Cinnamon. I just really love how it works.

      - u/brocht:

        Oh nice. Yeah, I enjoyed WotR, but was annoyed when he dropped it, like right in the middle of a big climactic arc. Glad to hear he'll be finishing it.

      ```

      - u/brocht:
        ```
        Sure? I'm not sure what your point is. They're packaged chucks of his webfiction. Just because they're sold as a novel doesn't mean they're a complete story. In point of fact, every thing he does is a long saga, and none of these stories conclude the overall plot arc.
        ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      The "Systems of the Apocalypse" Series with 4 published books is rather complete. Not only is each Book already a complete arc, but Book 4 also ends some of the series-spanning arcs in a way that I think is rather satisfactory. There is no cliffhanger and the story threads all get wrapped up.

      It doesn't preclude a next book (Macronomicon has said he'd like to eventually write a Book 5), but you could slap a "and they lived happily ever after" on there and it wouldn't be unsatisfying.
      ```

  The fourth season of *Overlord* is probably going to end up as my favorite, and I really love the way that the show really focuses more on how the world reacts to an essentially omnipotent protagonist with mysterious motives (and how Momonga's followers care for him so much).

  What are the best fics in a similar vein, that have wildly powerful characters not knowing what to do with virtual omnipotence, and/or side characters spectacularly devoted to the main character?
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:

    Well, have you read the Dune series lol? Doesn't fully fit your "powerful characters not knowing what to do with virtual omnipotence" but that is a big theme of books 2-4.

      He wasn't really omnipotent was he? At most, he could be called omniscient, but even that would be overselling his precognitive power.

      If he was actually near omnipotent, then pretty much none of the events in the book would have happened.

  Today I'm going to recommend not fiction (or nonfiction), but a habit. In fall of last year, I resolved to lose weight, as most people do. To track my progress and encourage myself, I gamified the task. Existing apps/programs didn't have the features I wanted, so I created a spreadsheet. The basic format is, every day I mark down my weight (at the start of the day) and then at the end of the day I mark down codes indicating several other metrics, like whether I spent at least 30 minutes excercizing. Based on which codes I put in, I would assign that day a point value, and then accrue points over the long term to buy things I wanted, but couldn't bring myself to pointlessly splurge on-- a magic the gathering booster box, a Pump It Up arcade pad, etc.

  This turned out to be totally useless for losing weight in the long run. I started out at 205 lbs, went down to 195, then went back up to 205. This tracks with observations about basically any sort of diet... Initial progress, followed by a return to baseline.

  But what this spreadsheet *did* do was dramatically improve my quality of life. The secret sauce turned out to be the 'HGD' code, for "had a good day." as the one code that required me to write down what I did to dcdeserve it, I've been essentailly tracking all the good days I've had for close to a year. That's made it easy to notice what factors contribute to a day being 'good', and also made it easy to notice when I spend a long period of time without any good days.

  I spend more time exercising, more time writing, and more time in social events since beginning this spreadsheet. I feel healthier and accomplish more. I would highly recommend figuring out what your priorities are, and doing something similar.

  For reference, the categories I tracked were

  *free daily "log in bonus" (for tracking my weight)
  * whether I lost weight day to day/week to week
  * whether I wrote fiction that day, with thresholds for 100,500, 1000 words
  * whether I excercized that day, with thresholds for 30/60 minutes
  *whether I had a good or really good day
  ```

  - u/scndnvnbrkfst:
    ```
    I very much enjoy tracking things in my life, I may try this out. 

    What worked extremely well for me when losing weight was going back to the basics. Changes in weight are directly related to calories in vs calories out. Estimate how many calories you typically consume per day then subtract 500 calories off of that number to get your initial daily calorie target. Weigh yourself every day. If you are losing weight too fast (>1% bodyweight per week) or are experiencing intense discomfort (hunger pangs, severe cravings) add 100 calories to your daily target. If you are losing body weight too slowly subtract 100 calories. Expect wild swings (>3 lbs) in weight at the beginning due to changes in body water content.

    Track calories using an app (I used MyFitnessPal, but there are plenty of other options). When you eat out estimate how many calories you consume, but err on the side of overestimation as restaurant food contains a ton of fat (which is part of why it tastes so good!), and fat is extremely calorie dense.

    After you reach your goal weight and go back to caloric maintenance (calories in == calories out) keep tracking calories for at least a couple of months to prevent a rebound. After that maybe just weight yourself once a week so that your weight doesn't get away from you without you noticing.

    What I like about this method is that results are guaranteed. If you are consistent and track calories correctly then you will lose weight. No exceptions.
    ```

    - u/cjet79:
      ```
      The hard part of these diets is not the calories in part, it's the calories out. Exercise is a guaranteed way to lose calories. But lots of things your body does that expend calories might be more "optional". And optional in the sense that your body is forcing the decision onto you, rather than something you want.

      The responses vary by individual, but when I've tried this kind of strict calories diet I sleep more (but still felt tired all the time), am moody constantly, can't think as well, and generally just enjoy life less.

      What worked more for me long term was cutting out almost all sugar, and most carbs. Not all the way to ketogenic diet though.
      ```

      - u/scndnvnbrkfst:
        ```
        The key is is tracking weight loss to set sustainable goals. You are correct that we don't have much control over how much calories our bodies use, but the multi-day average is relatively static. Changes in weight are linearly related to calories in minus calories out, so if we track weight and calories in we can adjust calories in until we're losing weight, regardless of what calories out happens to be.

        You didn't lose weight because you cut sugar and carbs, you lost weight because cutting sugar and carbs decreased your daily caloric intake. Cutting sugar and carbs (sugar especially) is an excellent weight loss strategy. Sugar is not very satiating, so you will feel better (more full, better sleep, less lethargy, etc) cutting 100 calories of sugar per day than say, 100 calories of protein. This is the way most weight loss diets (keto, paleo, whatever) work. They replace less satiating calories that come from substances like sugar and saturated fat with more satiating calories from proteins, carbohydrates, and unsaturated fat. This results in the dieter requiring less calories to feel full, thus consuming less calories and therefore losing weight. 

        The symptoms you described experiencing when attempting the diet strategy I described above came from either setting a caloric target that was too aggressive (too low), or from cutting the wrong calories (cutting protein intake instead of sugar, for instance).
        ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    This is sort of a tangential aside, but I take every excuse I can get to bemoan the death of the Basis Peak activity tracker watch.

    It was, as far as I can tell, the only activity tracker to date that actually did a good job gamifying excercise. Badges for completing activities. Badges for doing multiple different activities in a day. Badges for doing activities for a certain amount of time (better badges for longer). Badges for doing activities for multiple days in a row. Automatic activity detection that worked quite well (at least for biking/walking/running).

    It did all of this back in 2014-2016 before intel killed it.

    I think I would probably buy in a heartbeat an activity tracker that matched it's capabilities, but nothing seems to do so, even half a decade later.

    I'm a decently healthy individual, but the 2 years I had that watch were by far the healthiest I have been since I stopped regularly playing sports in college. 

    Gamification probably wouldn't work for everyone, but it worked very well for me, and for all that's been written in various think pieces about "gamifying our lives", it's shocking to me that no one else has ever really done it for exercises in such a seamless, automated way.

    -edit- yes there are lots of apps that claim to "gamify" fitness/excercise, but the addition of the watch with automatic activity detection and heartbeat monitor was a huge part of making it easy and seamless. If I have to manually enter/start the excercise, that's a high enough barrier (for me, if it's not for you, then great) to discourage use. Excercise is hard enough to do, any barrier that can be torn down is a plus in my mind. 

    Plus, the granular level of data and automatic graphing/plotting were a big part of it for me (I'm a sucker for a good dataset/graph)
    ```

  - u/SecondTriggerEvent:
    ```
    Good on building good habits! Focusing on being healthy rather than weight is best in the long haul.

    The weight regulation thing is normal. People have been observed to maintain a set point weight (or rather within a range of a set point) that is largely down to genetics and regulated by hormones.

    The clearest example of this is from the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. Participants were starved, and as expected, gained starvation symptoms. Returning to an "average" weight did not remove the symptoms of starvation. It was only returning to their original weight (plus an average of 10%, which generally ceded over the following years) that the symptoms went away.
