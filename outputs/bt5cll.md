  ```
  1. Only controller enter the space where The Guardian stationed. Given that leaving the Time Loop require the controller to enter that space, RedRobe must have the mark of the controller. He most possibly has the same imperfect marker as Zorian has, which is enough to fool the Guardian so he can access the place as often as he likes.
     1. You might wonder, why Zorian never able to locate him with his Marker Detection ritual. Well, that can easily explained by RedRobe had already left the Time Loop by the time Zorian know of the ritual. 
     2. You might also wonder, why the ritual also failed to detect RedRobe the first time it enacted outside the time loop. It can also easily explained by Panaxeth ability to strip and add marker/contract to a person's soul.
  2. RedRobe does not have to completely gather the keys. The Gate was not barred before he leaves. The way outside is open. That's why Panaxeth offered him a deal. Panaxeth won't offer anyone any deal if the way is not open, because that would be pointless.
     1. You might wonder why RedRobe need to take the deal Panaxeth offered when the way outside is already open. Well, The Guardian of the Threshold chief function is to prevent anyone, excepting the controller, to leave. Even assuming The Guardian is fooled, RedRobe must not leave the Time Loop ordinary way. Because, by the time The Guardian tried to put RedRobe soul back in the real world, he would find there was already a soul, instantly realizing RedRobe is not the true controller. On top of not allowing he leave, The Guardian would most definitely destroy his mark.
