## PtOoS - Vermillion - Blue's Perspective after all was said and done.

### Post:

Chapter [65](http://daystareld.com/pokemon-65/)-[67](http://daystareld.com/pokemon-67/) of /u/daystareld 's excellent work was impactful and jarring. I was shivering when Red confirmed Aiko died, I almost teared up when he hugged with Sabra and told Leaf.

But I'm here to talk about Blue's emotions. He narrates a chapter at the beginning of the attack, and says that it would be hard for him to pass by a person who needs help right in front of him, even if he knows many more people need help in the near future.

This fundamentally illogical departure from the reality of the situation is a central heroic tenet in Blue's mind. He says Red would evaluate the situation and trade one life for another. Blue believes it's amoral to think that way, even if it leads to more lives saved. 

After he says this, it isn't until [72](http://daystareld.com/pokemon-72/), a month or so after the attack, that he narrates another chapter. After his emotions have had time to settle. Blue hasn't adjusted his moral compass, even though he knows Surge would advise him to if they had a conversation about it.

Blue has changed a lot since the beginning, and after meeting Aiko, even though it seems like he has the same perspective. The biggest defense of Red's perspective that I could come up with, is if his Dad, as a Ranger, warned Red about trying to do misguided heroics and 'adding another body to the pile' for the Rangers to save and/or clean up. In fact, his Dad probably did exactly that, seeing as he advised they wait in the Beedrill Incident.

It wasn't explicitly stated in the story, but I think that when they pulled the dead trainer out of the field the Beedrill were swarming around, Blue had already decided that Red's approach was wrong. No matter what Red could say about probabilities, Red's approach had ensured a trainer's death.

I think that this frustration was held inside him, because arguing with Red on these types of things is pointless (along with similar times where he disapproved of Red's attitude, such as the Pineco Catching scene), and he let it all out when he learned of Aiko's death. In his mind, Red has decided to let people die for *bullshit math reasons*, multiple times, and still doesn't see a problem with it.

Does this make sense? Am I seeing animosity where there was none? I know Red isn't the best at picking up social cues, but he has grown up with Blue. I feel like Red should have noticed if Blue was feeling cold towards him, but maybe Blue is good at hiding it. He is a Dark trainer after all, and Red relies on psychic stuff too often.

  Since Aikos death that story is much less enjoyable for me, because I find it hard to relate to each protagonist.
  Red is moping and copes by convoluted social overthinking. That is consistent but strenuous to read.
  Blue copes by being an self-righteous hypocritical asshole. He tells his grandpa, he can't work if sayed grandpa isn't safely stashed in a panic room. But he wishes his childhood bbf with unresolved childhood trauma to have died by being stupidly heroic. F that.

    Blue has a fantasy of getting himself hurt to protect others. Not a fantasy he daydreams about, but he has decided long ago that he is a hero; his ego couldn't handle it if he didn't see himself as a hero. And if he has to put his life on the line to protect someone else, well, that's what heroes do.

    But he can't handle it when others (especially people he loves) put their life on the line to protect him. Even though he sees his grandpa as a hero!

      And what about Red?
      ```

      - u/covert_operator100:
        ```
        Red plans for what goals he'd like to reach, but he doesn't really take his own happiness into account when making those plans (other than that achieving the goals makes him happy). He knows on a surface level that he desires companionship, but he never includes that in his plans until he's about to make the decision to cut a possible companionship.

        I think he wants Blue back, but he also wants to change Blue to be slightly less morally-opposed to his decision making process. He wants Blue to see the value in logic, so that Blue can succeed.

          ```
          Sorry for not being clear. I meant: Why is Blue that angry at Red. Well pressure, stress, emotions at first. Butt why isn't he seeing the double standard he was applying later.
          ```

          - u/covert_operator100:
            ```
            Oh, I thought I addressed that in the OP.

            Blue doesn't see a double standard in his behaviour. Blue doesn't see it as necessary for Professor Oak to protect Blue, because Blue wasn't ever in active threat of death. Professor Oak going into the storm actively puts Professor Oak into danger (dying of Pressure), even though Blue doesn't need saving.

            Blue sees Red's behaviour in the storm as wrong, because Blue would have gotten himself killed alongside Aiko. Blue tried politely to convince Red, over the months they were together, but has decided now that it's impossible.

            Professor Oak sees both of these problems as one: Blue will get himself killed if Professor Oak isn't there to distract/protect him. Blue doesn't see it that way. Ironically, he sees Professor Oak's sacrifice much the same way Red analyzes whether people are worth saving.
            ```

  ```
  I was about to say that Blue has seen people die because of a lack of heroes charging in to save them at the risk of their own lives, but he has yet to see the heroes die because they shouldn't have charged in. Maybe that would help restore his balance.

  And then I realised, I'm wrong. He's seen his grandpa knocked down (though not entirely out) by charging to the rescue when perhaps it wasn't essential. And although that did indeed impact his thinking, it didn't make him more sympathetic to the general idea that heroics can sometimes be reckless and stupid; instead, it's created a dissonance in his thinking, where he objects to his grandfather charging to the rescue, but he still expects Red to do it. Sooner or later, that inconsistency has to be resolved. He can't keep saying that Professor Oak and Red were *both* wrong.
  ```

  - u/covert_operator100:
    ```
    Good interpretation. Working out the inconsistency would be satisfying to read.

    Maybe he thinks that he doesn't need saving because he's made the decision to risk his life - it's a waste of effort. If a hero has already decided to get themselves killed, then trying to save them is not only undermining them. It is also ensuring that the hero's sacrifice (whether they die or not) does not accomplish the 'protect everyone' goal (because the saver is putting themselves in danger too).

    It's a skewed perspective, but I can see it based on Blue's actions.
    ```

      > Maybe he thinks that he doesn't need saving because he's made the decision to risk his life - it's a waste of effort.

      By that logic, he should not blame Red for failing to save Aiko. From what I could see, Blue wasn't really upset about Red failing to rescue the people who originally got stuck in the building; he was upset because Aiko went and Red, as her friend, did not. But Aiko freely chose to put herself in harm's way like that, so if that means that she doesn't need saving, then Red did the right thing.

    pretty sure it's supposed to be something along the lines of 'pokemon the origin of species', can you confirm /u/covert_operator100 ?
