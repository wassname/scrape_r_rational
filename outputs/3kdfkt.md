## Eco- multilayer survival game with exposed data for players to create laws

### Post:

I am not sure if games quite fit in this subreddit but this game just finished its [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1037798999/eco-global-survival-game/description). 

It is basically minecfraft but the world has a eco system. There is a impending natural disaster unless the players get to a point in technology to stop it.   This requires using world resources which can kill off the  eco system or be used up

This is part where it fits in /r/rational the players can view data of the world to propose laws to prevent this.  

I think this would be fun way to teach/encourage data driven discussions. 


What to people think ?

  Reminds me of wakfu, which tried something like that (shared, global economy that was influenced by player actions), but had to decrease its importance because griefers would just kill all sheep / cut all trees without replanting etc, preventing any other players from gathering the resources.

  The law setting is going to be crucial, and whether this is actually playable depends on how sophisticated the law system is. Can you express a concept of ownership? Can you have laws selectively apply to some players but not others?

  (edit: oh, actually both land ownership and criminal justice are stretch goals)

  I think as a social experiment this looks quite cool. As a game... well, I'd be up for trying it, but I'm not too hopeful ;P

    Indeed the law system needs to work if there are ways to work around it then it will just fall to trolls.  

    I am thinking the player size will be small for each world I cant see it being that great with loads of people coming and going.

  The video makes it look like things go bad too fast and too obviously to be interesting. Cutting down one tree instantly kills the Earth for five meters in every direction and improper mining sends a wave of death across the land. Then you can look at a graph and see exactly how many deer were killed by hunting versus starvation versus predation. 

  The "laws" thing seems like it's supposed to explore an interesting friction regarding how conservative we should be, when exactly we should switch from seeking short-term gains to avoiding long-term losses, which of a dozen factors in a problem should be limited, and generally how to interact with a complex interconnected global ecosystem. But it looks like it's *actually* exploring friction between sensible players and Captain Planet villains.

    Yeah I feeling the Developers are not aware the extent trolls will go or how just many people will want to do it.   

    I wouldn't take the speeds of effects shown to be the actual speed I would think they have been speeded up to show the effect

      I'm not even talking about trolls. The blurb says that tragedy of the commons is the main conflict between players, but that's not really a problem when players can get so much information. Are fish disappearing due to overfishing or pollution or habitat disruption by ocean shipping? Well, here's a graph that shows disease as the primary cause of recent die-offs. Also, the water is black. Everyone agrees that fish disappearing is bad, and everyone agrees that pollution is responsible, and even selfish parties will vote in favor of obvious long-term benefits, or else get easily outvoted by the sane majority. Without trolls, I'm not sure if there can be any meaningful conflict in the system as it is described.

        I think you're greatly underestimating how irrational people can be.
