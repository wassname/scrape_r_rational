  Every time I read this it makes me think of freemium gaming.

    Bullshit is probably going to be the basis for the moderate near future economies of the world and it is strange to me.

    Rival economists selling bad weasels and bad bad vegetables (but mostly bad weasels). 

    Economics is about to transform into the study of creating scarce resources and trading them to other economists. 

    "Economist" will then have two meanings: One, carrying the meaning with which we are all familiar, and which now has purely historical use; and the other, which is not unlike, say, "wargamer" in that it refers to a person who is a member of a crafty hobby.

  If I may recite a proverb: "Money is a sign of poverty."  And apparently economists are in the business of making poverty.

    Quoting Iain Banks, or was he quoting someone?

    - u/None:
      ```
      Well *I'm* definitely quoting Ian Banks, but I've got no idea where he got it.

        Well you made me look up where I first saw it in his novels:

        > It wasn't convincing. I wasn't convinced. I was a little shaken, too. Was this farce, this gloomy sideshow trying to mimic the West - and not even doing that very well - the best job the locals could make of socialism? Maybe there was something so basically wrong with them even the ship hadn't spotted it yet; some genetic flaw that meant they were never going to be able to live and work together without an external threat; never stop fighting, never stop making their awful, awesome, bloody messes. Perhaps despite all our resources there was nothing we could do for them.
        > 
        > The feeling passed. There was nothing to prove this wasn't just a momentary, and - coming so early - understandable aberration. Their history wasn't so far off the mean track, they were going through what a thousand other civilizations had gone through, and no doubt in the childhood of each of those there had been countless occasions when all any decent, well-balanced, reasonable and humanely concerned observer would have wanted to do was scream in despair.
        > 
        > It was ironic that in this so-called Communist capital they were so interested in money; at least a dozen people came up to me in the East and asked me if I wanted to change some. Would this represent a qualitative or quantitative change? I asked (blank looks, mostly). 'Money implies poverty,' I quoted them. Hell, they should engrave that in stone over the hangar door of every GCU.
