  Damn. I was right about Zach being the champion of angels but man, I did not even think of a possibility of a *death pact*.

  And still, in retrospect, it was foreshadowed. Zorian contemplated that gods were major dicks, and humanity was better off since their disappearance. Well, makes sense that angels are major dicks as well.

    > Zach being the champion of angels

    It certainly explains his divine blessing.
    ```

    - u/AKAAkira:
      ```
      ...And since Quatach-Ichl has the same blessing, does that mean he also made a death pact with angels or gods, once?

      Does that mean he knows how to get out of it?
      ```

      - u/AllSeare:
        ```
        if he did make a death pact with divine beings he probably just followed through with it.
        ```

          Loophole abuse via the "undead" part of it, eh?
          ```

          - u/PM_ME_YUR_JEEP:
            ```
            I think more that he just succeeded in his pact
            ```

          - u/Tommy2255:
            ```
            Why would there need to be a loophole? The gods are at worst Lawful Neutral. There's no reason they wouldn't follow through on a reward.
            ```

      - u/gamedori3:
        ```
        Maybe the solution is for zach to bevome a lich.
        ```

        - u/AnimaLepton:
          ```
          It's imprinted on his soul, though, so I don't think that'd be the workaround.
          ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        If we are going to trust him about his blessing I'd say no, no death pact for him.

        I would need to re-read all the relevant bits, but isn't the relevant trait a direct line to the Ikosian Emperor who we know used the gate last? That was always what I assumed; Zach got picked because he was basically the heir to the gate from the perspective of the angels, esp. given that his family owned it until his guardian sold it back to the current royals.

        Of course, if that's not the reason why, I find it hard to believe it's something so coincidental and trivial. If Zach wasn't just the default gate user by dint of being the sole survivor of House Noveda, why would an unremarkable boy get picked to be the savior of the universe? We still can't conclude they're not sneaky machiavellian puppet masters until we actually know what's up with that, because it might be possible that Zach was designed to fetch Zorian or some other convoluted nonsense that led to the present circumstances.
        ```

        - u/morgf:
          ```
          A relevant fact is that Zach apparently began each loop asleep in his bed. Not awake, not at the gate.

          That leads me to believe that the angels somehow started the loop while Zach was asleep in his bed. Maybe they made a deal the previous day? Or maybe the angels contacted Zach in his dreams?
          ```

          - u/Retsam19:
            ```
            Maybe the loop doesn't start from the moment you enter it, but can be started from some point in the recent past.
            ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Zorian speculated on why Zach was chosen a while back. He starts in vicinity of the summoning, he's (presumably) rich AF, has a ridiculously high amount of mana (even before the blessing), and most importantly, he doesn't have anyone watching over him to be concerned about his massive increase in skill in the long run.
          ```

        - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
          ```
          >the relevant trait a direct line to the Ikosian Emperor who we know used the gate last

          That's just speculation from the readers, I believe. I don't think the possibility was ever mentioned in the text.
          ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    Is it just me, or does this definitively rule out RR being Zach, or a simulacrum?

    If "you will die at the end of the month if the primordial gets out" is divinely stamped onto your soul, I would think that would propogate to any copies made of you.
    ```

    - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
      ```
      It could be that the simulacrum doesn't mind dying to accomplish whatever he's trying to do. If that's who Red Robe is, that is.
      ```

- u/eroticas:
  ```
  It says much about Zorian's change that he knew Zach would decide to die rather than be suspicious of Zach like Veyers and Silverlake
  ```

  - u/chaogomu:
    ```
    Well, Zack can make simulacrums. This means he's willing to accept death to achieve his goals.

    Unlike Silverlake who has the drive to live at all costs. Silverlake cannot make simulacrums. She would fear their betrayal and they honestly would attempt it in order to live longer.
    ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      This is an interesting logic knife. Quatach Ichl, despite his aspiration to live forever, is willing to die if his priority required him to do so.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        He was willing to die under the pretense that he wasn’t himself, he was a copy, and dying theoretically helped the real him live longer. So maybe just more detached from his sense of self.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  I guess we know why Zach spent so much time studying the divine energies on his soul, even after giving up on modifying the temporary markers. He was looking for the death pact mechanism, so he could circumvent it.

  >His fellow time traveler was sitting cross-legged on the floor with his eyes closed, trying to sense the divine energies of his divine blessing and Controller marker. Zorian wasn't sure why he was doing that, to be honest. Both he and Zach had already succeeded at percieving those divine energies, and it was unlikely he would develop the skill much in what time they had before the end of the restart. On top of that, they had basically given up on trying to modify the temporary markers. There was little point to that now.
  ```

- u/GeeJo:
  ```
  A temporary memory packet might work as a loophole. The terms of the contract are specific about nobody knowing *at the end of the month*, and memory erasure is specifically called out as an alternative to murder. 

  If Zorian forgets everything and picks it up back after, it might work. Nothing to lose by trying it, at least.
  ```

  - u/MaleficentStatement:
    ```
    >He made a death pact with the angels to stop the release of the primordial… while making sure no one could find out about the existence of the time loop


    Note that it says "could find out". This implies that even indirect means of regaining the memories (which the angels can detect) are unworkable.
    ```

    - u/archaeonaga:
      ```
      It sounds like an even more perfect form of a geas; you can’t make yourself forget it, and you can’t easily trick it. Since Zorian is definitely going to survive, and Zach just nobly sacrificing himself like he plans is too sad, they’ll figure out some way around it. Maybe there’s a hint earlier in the novel, now that we know what significance divine powers have to the story.
      ```

      - u/chaogomu:
        ```
        Well, almost all of the story so far has been divine free thanks to them not existing inside the time loop.

        They do have resources to call on, those we've already been introduced to.
        ```

        - u/archaeonaga:
          ```
          I get that, I'm saying that now that we have a much more clear understanding of what the angels did and what Z&Z need to overcome in order for both to make it to next month alive (something I'd still say I'm 90% confident will happen). Knowing that, maybe something that previously seemed innocuous will make a lot more sense; they were understandably focused on manipulating the divine energies of their markers, but it's likely that the answer to this problem was foreshadowed with that kind of discussion.
          ```

    - u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN:
      ```
      Wouldn't that require Zach to erase his own memories? As long as Zach remembers, he can potentially re-inform Dorian after the month's end.
      ```

      - u/archaeonaga:
        ```
        I will laugh and laugh if Zach lost his memories originally because RR and Zach were trying to get around the death pact, and RR decided to turn evil when that didn’t work.
        ```

        - u/leadlinedcloud:
          ```
          That actually sounds pretty realistic, I wouldn't be surprised if this turned out to be true.
          ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      That's impossible and would be an automatic death sentence for Zach. As long as he's alive there will always be the possibility of someone finding out.
      ```

  - u/marwin42:
    ```
    Honestly, zorian can totally live by with his memory of the time loop erased. Maybe with a convincing explanation for some knowledge/skills and getting rid of the rest, much better than any of them dying.
    ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    And they should store it in the orb that has a massive memory storage! They can't deposit it in a mind of a person (or aranea), lest it counts as 'knowing'.
    ```

    - u/Green0Photon:
      ```
      I'm pretty sure that's a loop only function. It doesn't exist in the normal world.

      Zorian would have to craft an auto dissolving packet in his mind. He might also be able to just redact the knowledge that the loop exists, not the rest of his skills. 110% annoying, though.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Zorian already knows about the Aranea's form of memory storage. Remember those rocks he talked about once, how he tunneled through them thinking that they were hiding something in them, but it was just Aranean telepathic paper?
        ```

        - u/Green0Photon:
          ```
          That might work too. Better, even, because it's not storing in a soul. 🤔
          ```

          - u/YukiOtonashi:
            ```
            What chapter was the Aranean telepathic paper in?
            ```

            - u/sicutumbo:
              ```
              I believe it was mentioned when they broke into the Cyorian web's vault.
              ```

      ```

      - u/ODIN_ALL_FATHER:
        ```
        Maybe it does still function as memory bank. The guardian stated that all memories in the orb go away after the time loop is finished but that might only be because the guardian cannot effect the orb in the real world.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Pretty sure the orb only works during the time loop.
      ```

  Veyers Boranova is a ball of anger who pull a cringe-worthy stunt: Damn, I did not expect a likeable character out of Veyers.

  Pretty great chapter, solely because we got the stake raised yet again. I honestly did not think it could go further. On the other hand, there is a chance for a power ranger team. 4 Mini archamagi go against dickhead angels and primordial.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    A twist: 4 mini archmagi and a lich.
    ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      I would imagine Quatach Ichl will noped out of Cyoria once he realized what at stake. Why risked himself when the angels and primordial already planned to make a ruckus? He would be on standby, of course, in case angel team won without much fanfare. But he would be staying at Iasku Mansion when the event unfold. Not in the middle of it.
      ```

      - u/archaeonaga:
        ```
        Why? Angels and primordials are obviously powerful, but Panaxeth and the guardian alike seemed happy to just murder people in totally normal ways that wouldn't really bother QI so much. 

        I don't expect we've seen the last of QI, in any case. Story logic dictates that he's either going to turn good or get killed in the climax, so we'll see what happens.
        ```

- u/burnerpower:
  ```
  This explains a lot. Looks like the Veyers thing was part of Red Robe's plan, just not in the way we were thinking. He just wanted to get an idea what kind of people his opponent's are. Also as a lot of people guessed Silverlake is young again and the familiar destabilizing her magic nicely explains why she hasn't been around, pretty obvious in retrospect. The death pact Zach is under explains so much. It wasn't just a clever compulsion from Red Robe that pushed him to act so strangely, it was also the pact in his soul he no longer understood all the details of. Maybe he met with Red Robe to specifically figure out a way around the geas then got screwed over, assuming Red Robe isn't actually Veyers.
  ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    I find it strange how passive Tesen has been. Never showed up during the fight at the mansion, never showed up afterwards or looked for Zach, didn't grab the envelope from the porch (unless RR or Silverlake, whichever one placed it, somehow *knew* that Tesen would not use that door before Z&Z walked by). That, plus the fact that he could be someone young Zach would go to for help, and the fact that he's one of the few people that could be granted permission to borrow the dagger, just makes him seem suspect in my mind. I have no idea what the connection with Veyers could be, though, if so.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      I think it's just part of him being a crappy corrupt caretaker. From the sounds of it he's gotten pretty much everything he wanted out of the Noveda estate so he doesn't really care what happens to it outside of keeping up appearances. I'd be surprised if he was Red Robe, there's no way Zach wouldn't notice him acting different considering he probably thrashed him dozens of times in the loop. Also he'd never trust Tesen enough to tell him the things he told Red Robe.
      ```

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        He used to completely trust him, though. He always knew Tesen was pretty hands-off, but Zach honestly believed that his caretaker had his best interests in mind and was doing a good job at safekeeping his estate, before the time loop. But yes, the fact that Zach would regularly thrash Tesen *is* a very strong argument against him being RR.
        ```

  - u/Watchful1:
    ```
    Yeah, I think people often forget how early Red Robe left the loop. He didn't experience all the adventures that Zorian and Zach went on, likely didn't even know who Zorian was. Zorian is coming into this with all these experiences of what Red Robe did in the time loop and years of thinking about it, but Red Robe likely left shortly after learning that other loopers (outside of Zach) existed, and didn't even know who they were.
    ```

    - u/AnimaLepton:
      ```
      For sure- until this chapter, we didn't know that RR knew Zorian's identity (presuming that the note left at the mansion was actually from RR)
      ```

- u/tjhance:
  ```
  Well, this was an informative chapter.

  The letter says "Thank you for showing mercy." I wonder what that means? It sounds like RR expected ZZ to harm Veyers. Why would that be? Perhaps Veyers learned about the time loop and so RR knows that Zach needs to kill him?

  "You know how to contact me." ... Do they? They don't seem confused about this line, but I have no idea how they're supposed to know how to contact RR.
  ```

  - u/rtsynk:
    ```
    I thought it was referring to not killing the OG Silverlake
    ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      No way. The letter must came from RedRobe about Veyers. Because, what's the point of sending letter if Silverlake herself would spare time to have face-to-face. And if you mean RedRobe thanking the duo about sparing original Silverlake, well, that sounds fantastical to me. RedRobe should not know Silverlake, because even the looper witch wouldn't say a thing about the original. She does not even care about her.
      ```

    - u/WarriorMonkT:
      ```
      Naw, I think the letter's from RR. Silverlake visiting Zorian is a separate incidence, I believe.
      ```

    - u/CaptainMcSmash:
      ```
      Yeah, I feel like it was clearly referring to Silverlake, though I am stumped how they would know how to contact her.
      ```

      - u/AnimaLepton:
        ```
        I mean, how specifically would they contact RR either? Does he just mean going through QI?
        ```

        - u/woschtl:
          ```
          Does he even know they can contact QI? They only found out about that after he left the loop. Maybe Silverlake told him?
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    RR made it plain that, while he's cutting ties from Veyers, he's reluctant to see him harmed, so he's glad they didn't kill him. 

    RR's also been pretty blunt about his involvement with QI and they know how to contact him pretty well. Silverlake wouldn't have any particular reason not to mention that, as it really gains their side nothing.
    ```

  - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
    ```
    Well, their simulacra are always fighting, so they could just coordinate a meeting through them.
    ```

  - u/CraftyTrouble:
    ```
    That whole "I was testing you, now let's meet up on good terms" would be a cute trap. But in-story I doubt that's what'll happen.

    I also don't know how they'll contact him, but they did run into ZZ's simulacra all the time, didn't they? Maybe they can just head over to one.
    ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    This, to me, increases the chances that Red Robe is Alanic.
    ```

    - u/TheBobulus:
      ```
      You know, I hadn't considered that before now, and while I think it's unlikely, it does make one piece of the puzzle fit: We've established that Alanic and Silverlake already know each other and don't trust each other. And we know that Silverlake and Red Robe aren't working together too well. Silverlake stated this chapter that she's withheld info from Red Robe, and it was implied this was for purely selfish reasons.

      If Red Robe *is* Alanic, this makes a lot more sense, because Red Robe is going to be immediately distrustful of Silverlake from the moment she shows up, even if they're 'supposed' to be on the same side. And Silverlake might assume he's going to backstab her the first chance he gets, so she's keeping him at arms length just as much as the she is the protagonists.
      ```

      - u/TheBobulus:
        ```
        Actually. Hmm. I was trying to think of any connection between Veyers and Alanic that would explain why Red Robe would remove Veyers from the loop and later snatch him up outside the loop. And then I remembered that Alanic has a high proficiency in fire magic, *including an item that selectively protects people from his fire magic*.

        ...what if Alanic is an exiled / disgraced member of the Veyers noble family? He could end up being very sympathetic to Veyers, as someone who has also been mistreated by the Veyers family. Hell, the artifact could be something that he stole away from the family and would have been incredibly useful to Veyers.
        ```

      - u/AnimaLepton:
        ```
        And he definitely fits in terms of "returning to normal" once RR exited, as he's someone we don't see before part 2.

        Some other stuff doesn't fit, though, like his stature- if nothing else, we know that Zorian and Zach at least considered their classmates feasible candidates for RR, and Alanic is an adult.
        ```

        - u/The_Magus_199:
          ```
          I have to wonder though, assuming this theory is true, how did he arrange to have himself killed in the loop, when he can’t influence any loops past leaving short of using the knife? Or would he have originally just been targeted by the cultists normally, and co-opted them somehow?

          Also, how would he have become friends with Zach when Zach was hyper focused on the invasion?

          Finally, i can’t help but think that Alanic being red robe would feel a little bit weak without the loop!Alanic we’ve come to know being there for context and confrontation.
          ```

      - u/Argenteus_CG:
        ```
        This is another reason for it, yeah. Plus, Red Robe and Alanic are both known to be competent soul mages. And Alanic isn't made illogical by having interacted with Zorian in a predictable manner in each loop or by having already known Zorian like Fortov.
        ```

    - u/LimeDog:
      ```
      I thought the prevailing opinion was Sudomir. 

      He's got the QI connection, top marks for soul stuff, can plausibly linked to Zach's exploits with the cult.
      ```

      - u/Argenteus_CG:
        ```
        He's also a boring choice. We already KNOW sudomir is an asshole, (a version of) him being evil has no narrative punch.
        ```

        - u/LimeDog:
          ```
          I would agree with that lack of narrative punch, but this is still a rational story. We should be able to decode who RR is for reasons other than the narrative demands a twist.
          ```

          - u/Argenteus_CG:
            ```
            Sure, but that doesn't mean the narrative doesn't play a role. A rational story it may be, but it's still a story, and Red Robe being Sudomir would simply be unsatisfying.

            Even Alanic is suboptimal due to how relatively late in the story he was mentioned, but it'd be surprising enough in other ways that it makes up for it. And every choice mentioned sufficiently early is ruled out by logic.
            ```

            - u/LimeDog:
              ```
              Anyone being RR is going to be satisfying. For once we will have an enjoyable chance to compare and contrast time loop personalities. Sudomir could be completely different after experiencing the loop.

              Alanic has already experienced his redemption and it would be weird for him to backslide like that. Sudomir has a gripping goal with his wife where we can end up seeing his labor towards that end.

              Alanic has no further gripping reasons to be a malicious actor. He is a reformed necromancer. It would be an interesting case of when nobobdy is watching how one's ethic roll. 6 months doesn't seem viable for Alanic to decode the marker when he couldn't make much of the marker when he examined Zorian.

              I still like the cut of your jib. Who was your suspects list before the Alanic conclusion?
              ```

              - u/Argenteus_CG:
                ```
                There might be better choices than Alanic, but I still hold that there's no way it makes any narrative sense for it to be anyone who was clearly evil to begin with, especially someone as evil as sudomir.
                ```

                - u/archaeonaga:
                  ```
                  This is a very good point. The themes of the story really depend on the original RR being redeemable, if not outright good.
                  ```

                  - u/AnimaLepton:
                    ```
                    Could you elaborate on this?
                    ```

                    - u/archaeonaga:
                      ```
                      I actually went a really long time without googling the title, so I didn't actually know the idiom it was based on: repetition is the mother of learning. It's a very clever title, and it's a theme reinforced by the stuff SlantedSlash brought up. I think the fact that RR is someone who would probably only become evil in the context of the loop will be important, or at least it will be someone who the main characters have interacted with and consider an ally (or one of themselves!). 

                      And frankly, it's just sloppy storytelling if you set up a big, novel-defining mystery and then it just ends up being one of the bad guys all along. nobody103, who has never shied away from fun cliffhangers and excellent plot twists, doesn't strike me as that kind of writer.
                      ```

                    - u/None:

                      Zorian was kinda an asshat before the loop. Throughout the story, he’s become a better person. Zach was incompetent, now he’s very competent. Therefore, it would make sense if RR is someone who appears to be good/neutral.

              How? For one thing, Zorian is my leading RR candidate, and he's there from the very beginning. But if you don't like that theory, there are lots of characters introduced in the first loop who Zach would've considered as somebody to bring to the gate and who might be persuaded by Panaxeth. 

              Alanic and Xvim are awfully distant from Zach, however, even though they both often come up in these discussions. Zach claims that Xvim never believed him about the loop until Zorian showed up, and Alanic is someone Zorian only knows because Kael tipped him off. For Zach, Alanic is just a guy who gets killed by Sudomir early on. Given that pre-mind-wipe Zach presumably already knew that most aspects of soul magic were out of reach for him in the loop (and the angels made the ring something he could just go ask for), he's not going to go rescue him just to find a teacher for a subject he can't learn. 

              And frankly, six months isn't long enough for Alanic to give up his moral code. He actually had a religious debate with the primordial monstrosity he was living inside of at the time, mere months before the scheduled end of his existence. And given his apparent power with both church and state, the idea that he would betray Cyoria would be very, very out of character.
              ```

      - u/archaeonaga:
        ```
        Why would Zach either a) use the crown to give him a temporary marker to a necromancer despite knowing that soul magic is one of the most dangerous things he faces (esp. given that the angels presumably explained why the ring was important if they also arranged for him to get it) or b) take Sudomir down to the gate where Panaxeth might talk to him? 

        What motivation would Zach have to do either of those things? Sudomir isn't just a boring solution, there's no plausible way for him to get into the loop.

        It just seems in-character for Alanic. And aside from not having been mentioned early enough, he's the most dramatic pick that still makes logical sense. He knows soul magic, he didn't speak to Zorian during the time Red Robe was operating in the loop, and him being Red Robe would be surprising given his religiosity. He's honestly my bet currently.

  Maybe we already have the solution to this. Remember Sudomir's wife? She died during the plague thing, and Sudomir kept her soul. Part of the deal he had with QI was a modified version of the ritual that turns people into a lich, made so that it works on a disembodied soul. If Zach dies, and his soul isn't immediately swept away to the afterlife through the death pact, Zorian could potentially deal with QI to get that spell and reincarnate Zach as a lich. A lot of people have speculated that Zorian would become a lich because of all the nefarious magics he learned in the loop, but this would be a really fitting way for him to use that knowledge.

  To get QI's help, they could probably offer him the Orb or one of the other pieces of the Key. He's always portrayed as someone who honors his deals, so the idea isn't completely unworkable.
  ```

  - u/MaleficentStatement:
    ```
    At the very least, right before Zach dies open a dimensional portal to the mansion. His soul gets sucked in, Zorian can go learn some more soul magic then pluck his soul out and attach it to a golem or something. This is kind of satisfying because it uses several plot elements + Zorian skills we know about - the Sudomir subplot, Zorian's spell formula experience, etc.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      I don't think there's any distinction between a golem powered and controlled by a soul, and a lich. There are golems that soul mages can make that are powered by souls and use the soul in place of an animation core (I think) but the original soul isn't the one in control.

        - u/sicutumbo:

  There is no way this is finishing within 5 chapters without a Deus Ex Machina. Well, not literal one, a literary one.

  I'm pretty certain he'll be able to do with hard work though, or at least has a decent chance. Clearly, divine magic is just another type of magic, and Zorian, Silverlake, and QI all have some experience with it. There are options.

  I definitely didn't expect this though, but a divine geas does make a lot of sense. I'm curious what Silverlake has been doing, though, and I'm worried about her sanity. I doubt that whatever she thinks is 100% true, though. That said, the angels do have a really high focus on limiting loop repercussions, including extra loopers, so it makes sense they'd make a pact. There has to be some sort of loophole, though.

  ---

  At the instant the fire drake attacked, my instant thought was this: it's a canary. In the original loop, no one helped Ilsa, but then Zach started to. Then, at whatever point, RR erased Veyers from the loop and Zach's mind, so that anyone who helps Zach could be an extra looper. Thus, Red Robe could quite possibly know that the third looper is Zorian.

  It's still a big question how RR joined the loop. I still like the idea of someone being constantly befriended by Zach in the beginning, until they temporarily allied with QI to give RR a temporary marker. RR learned from QI to give himself a permanent marker, quite possibly with divine magic. Then, RR betrayed Zach, erasing his memories and Veyers from the loop. Perhaps Zach met RR through Veyers (I still like the Fortov theory, even if no theory fits perfectly), and deleted Veyers to make sure Zach would never have a plot thread to meet RR.

  What would be even cooler would be if it was a double betrayal. RR agreed with Zach to get around the angel's pact, but still wanted to stop Panaxeth. They would totally want to work together if they were great friends; Zach really would want RR to not forget. So maybe RR learned the mind magic in order to remove himself and the original pact from memory, to work more in the shadows in preventing Panaxeth from coming out. The biggest problem is why would he constantly improve the invasion. My answer is to make sure Zach thinks they're super great, but easily beat them by the time he comes out unknowing.

  I dunno, this is wild speculation. It would be amazing to see a double betrayal of the Antels and the Primordial. It would be even crazier if QI was once a looper with RR and left (though unlikely, because then he'd need the tools to leave, which would delete Zorian from the loop, but Panaxeth could have interfered; who knows).

  Also, Angels are not good. They just want to enforce a lack of gods/divine intervention. Thus no Primordials, and super limited use of the gate (for worse case scenario). Especially since the gate's breaking.

  I was also in the middle of making a theory about something weird going on with the fire drake, but that plot thread seems done. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

    Probably excessive. Zorian is making no secret that he is hanging out with Zach. What Benisek knows, everyone knows.

    > It's still a big question how RR joined the loop.

    Is it? Maybe the primordial did it? If he was able to smuggle people out of the loop, why not sensible to suppose he could grant them markers. Temp marker -> corruption by primordial -> permanent marker -> exit. Silverlake just skipped the 3rd step.
    ```

    - u/Green0Photon:

      Definitely true with the first part.

  So far, everything has been pointing to some sort of "conflict" between Zorian and Zach. But how could that be? We knew their goals (stopping the invasion and the primordial) were aligned. And it didn't seem right either to just have Zach be a super-amazing actor hiding all his evilness (that would have completely undercut the themes of the story regarding trust).

  And now we have it. This reveal both explains the conflict and sets up a new obstacle, while also not retconning Zach's entire personality. It's something I'd never have thought of - and yet it makes complete sense.
  ```

- u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
  ```
  Wait wait wait, Silverlake just said that the Death Pacts are inscribed on souls right? And that they are frustratingly impossible to circumvent? But we know that in soul terms, Zach and Zorian are really Zarian and Zoriach, because they got pieces of each other's souls from when QI tried to soul meld them together. Zorian clearly isn't instinctively feeling the death pact even though he has a piece of Zach's soul, and Zorian has examined his own soul countless times without noticing anything like that, so something is off.

  Hypothesis A: Something about the soul meld ritual QI used can be used to void death pacts.

  Hypothesis B: Zach actually doesn't have a death pact, but Silverlake mind magic'ed him at some point to make him believe he does. The fact that Zach instinctively feels that he can't let anyone mind magic him is extra suspicious, since that is a clause that only makes sense to have if the control over him is mind magic related instead of a soul-scribed death pact.

  Hypothesis C: Somehow, the time loop marker, which is supposed to be absolutely guarded against spreading to other souls, got spread over anyway thanks to the soul meld. Yet the death pact marker, which is supposed to be absolutely guarded against being removed, didn't get spread over. This makes little sense.

    Theory A has interesting implications. We know in Zorian's case, the foreign soul matter would be assimilated over time. Not be kept separate. If the duo found a way for Zach soul to momentarily lost identity to avoid angels detection, and keep it separate from the host until it spliced again into new body, that would be swell. I wonder if anyone would teach them that, if the spell's viable at all.

Also, in my memory he was still telling some people even after he had gained significant power... Or at the very least not trying to hide it (like when Zorian first started looping) I will have to look back.
        ```

        - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
          ```
          They would've forgotten when he failed. The thing is, he never told anyone about the invasion, never tried to get help with the invasion, just tried to figure out what started the loop. He was trying to succeed without anyone knowing about the loop.
          ```

          - u/Ozimandius:
            ```
            But I think Zach's first words to Zorian after Zorian enters the loop are about being a looper.  Yeah, in chapter 7 after Zach recovers from the soul meld and firsts interacts with awakened Zorian: "The whole world resets itself on the night of the summer festival and I am the only one that remembers what happened." " I've lived through this month.. God... 200 times now" "I don't remember how I started this time loop"

            Etc.  There were other instances where he told people too so clearly his instincts did not really make him feel like he couldn't tell people about the time loop which in this chapter was apparently one of the things that he wasn't supposed to talk about.  If he believed that those restrictions by the angels were stopping him from telling people about the invasion, why did he not feel they stopped him from talking about the loop?

      Every 3-4 weeks. You can find the next chapter target date on the author's bio. It always starts as three weeks after the last chapter, then about two weeks later either gets pushed back a week or stays the same. Once the target date is less than a week away, it never changes and the chapter is always released on that day, though time of day isn't consistent. For about 20 chapters I was trying to ignore the story long enough for two chapters to come out so I could read more than one at a time, but by now I've given up on that.
      ```

- u/InfernoVulpix:
  ```
  I wonder if the story is going to end with Zorian taking a hacksaw to his own brain.

  Last chapter, last scene, just wipe away all memories of the time loop so that both Zorian and Zach can live.

  Not sure where that'd leave Zorian (probably not all the way back to pre-loop self, maybe something like false memories of how he got his powers) if he does try it, but it'd be a nice dramatic end for the story.
  ```

  - u/Green0Photon:
    ```
    I can't remember, did he tell Spear of Resolve about the loop? Because if so, that's an added complication. They'd be helpful in mentally redacting that knowledge, but you still have to deal with the fact that they all know.

        ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Even if he wiped every memory he had of the time loop, his skill in magic would largely remain the same. Well, he would forget the spells he knew and how to cast them, but his soul would know how to shape the Mana for it. He would also still have the Mana reserves and any blood magic abilities he gave himself. Zach could probably reteach him lots of spells if it came to that.
    ```

- u/silian:
  ```
  I get the feeling there will be no weaseling their way out of this one, either Zach will snuff it or Zorian will be completely mind-wiped when it's all said and done. There's a more narrative appeal to Zorian either biting the dust or getting wiped at the end in my opinion, going back to the cyclical nature the plot is based on and building on how much Zorian has matured as a person over the course of the story. Zach doing a heroic sacrifice feels like it doesn't tie in as well with zorian's arc and wouldn't be as satisfying.
  ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    Alanic knows. Xvim possibly knows, or will know as soon as Zorian hands him his research notes. None of those notes can remain, if Zach is to fulfill his part of the pact. Zorian would have no valid explanation to give to Daimen to explain his skills other than a time loop, and even if Alanic, Xvim and Daimen were willing to be mind wiped for Zach, there would still be the matter of all the rest of the Taramatula being aware of Zorian's visit.

    There are already too many variables, and there will only be more, as time goes on. A simple memory wipe won't solve this, or change how Zorian has soul sight.  His soul itself is a creation of the time loop, just like Silverlake's and RR's bodies. Zach has to die.

    Time to look into lichdom, I guess.
    ```

- u/CraftyTrouble:
  ```
  I wonder what Zach got out of that death pact with the angels. Any ideas?
  ```

  - u/MaleficentStatement:
    ```
    A divine blessing and access to the time loop and all the skills and knowledge that provides. The chance to be *somebody.*  


    Then again, isn't it implied that he had his divine blessing long before the time loop started?
    ```

    - u/CraftyTrouble:
      ```
      I got the impression that he agreed to the pact while he was already inside the loop. I guess I was wrong.

      *If* he had the blessing ahead of time, maybe that could explain why he was the one picked to enter the loop.
      ```

      - u/Banarok:
        ```
        i think you missed something.

        The angels gave him the Increased mana & the death pact so it was probably a deal, they needed him to be powerful enough to stop all this hence the mana, they did not want the news of the gate to spread hence the death pact. he made a deal with the angels pure and simple.

        Zach was always a good candidate, his status as last heir to the Noveda opens a lot of doors, he have more liquid assets then most. he is young and healthy with lots of stamina, so basically he got almost everything going for him to stop this. (now RR is a problem but that was caused inside the loop so it was a problem the angels could not have forseen, without RR Zach could probably have stopped everything himself)
        ```

        - u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN:
          ```
          > he have more liquid assets then most. 

          Not a problem for a halfway competent looper. What's more useful is that he's *supposed* to have a bunch of money (the theft being an open secret), so nobody can question his sudden wealth.
          ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        He couldn't have agreed to the pact within the loop: there was no access to the spiritual planes (and thus the angels).
        ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    A chance to live, decades of experience, an advantage in any field he desired and an opportunity to do good. He had some legit reasons to agree, first of all, the fact that if the primordial gets released, then he dies if he's just an untrained kid in Cyoria. And everyone in Cyoria dies if the primordial is out. Everyone.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    This is easy. There's going to be an attack that involves pretty much everyone he knows. A decent portion of them are going to die and life as they know it will change. He was given a chance to prevent that. Even if the deal was that he'd die at the end of the real month I could see him taking it. Hell maybe the angels could show him that he'd die in the attack if they didn't intervene.
    ```

- u/Ristridin1:
  ```
  > "The primordial cannot directly discuss this," Silverlake said. "He hinted at it, and Red Robe explained the details of it to me later. I don't know how he knows so much about it, but presumably **Zach told him that personally while he still remembered.**"

  The above is inconsistent with the below.

  > "I didn't know the details," Zach said defensively. "I didn't know I'd made a deal with angels, or even that it *was* a deal. All I knew was that I have these… instincts… that tell me things. I can't really talk about them…"

  > "Can't or won't?" Zorian asked.

  > "Can't," Zach said. "I get tongue-tied whenever I try."

  So, Zach couldn't tell, and RR still knows. Are we adding that to the pile of mysteries? 

  Was it something RR found out by mind-reading, then mind-wiping Zach to prevent Zach from having to kill him? I could even speculate that RR and Zach were allies up to this point, with Zach willingly allowing access to his mind somehow.

  I'm quite happy that this finally gives a compelling reason why Zach vehemently opposed having his mind read, despite the evidence of his mind being tampered with. He either was compelled to do so by his 'instincts', or simply didn't want to take the risk of being forced to kill Zorian.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    There is no inconsistency because we already know Silverlake is wrong. She even uses the word 'presumably'. 

    The answer is mind magic. We know RR has used mind magic on Zach. That's how he got that knowledge, and more.
    ```

- u/AstraFlame:
  ```
  Oh shit, Zach is screwed as he is right now, because even if they defeat Red Robe and Silverlake, and Zorian wipes his mind, Alanic knows about the time loop, and Red Robe and Silverlake can just start telling people about the loop. Zorian could mind wipe them, but if they just explain it to someone random so Zorian didn't know, or use magic to amplify their voice and tell people during the invasion, then that's it.
  ```

- u/kaukamieli:
  ```
  >Even if he prevents Panaxeth's relesase, so long as there is even a single person who knows about the time loop at the end of the month, he is going to die.

  So they just need to modify some memories a bit. Maybe even for a while. If Zach still has the compulsion after the month, they just don't modify the memories back. Non-issue really.
  ```

  - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
    ```
    Those are pretty extensive modifications for Zorian; he spent about a decade in the time loop. Even if that's viable, it wouldn't be a very satisfying ending, I don't think.
    ```

    - u/archaeonaga:
      ```
      Yeah, if Zach and Zorian are going to be saved (and I’ll be super disappointed if they aren’t), it’s definitely not going to come down to “Zorian used memory modification, it’s super effective!” There’s a solution out there, it’s just going to be way weirder if it’s going to be satisfying.
      ```

- u/distrofijus:
  ```
  It was a bit underwhelming for me, I guess here are my highlights of the chapter:

  Pan did make a custom body for Silverlake. It is still remains to be seen how special it is. 


  The angels are ... Well, after this chapter I'd say that they remind me of a incompetent people in power (bureaucracy) misinterpreting the orders or trying to follow something to the letter. 

  Gods, before leaving, casually told the lackeys they left:Try to make sure that no one is using SG when we are absent. If you have to use it, make sure the knowledge is not spread about it. It would be good if none of the primordials would escape their cages. And try to make sure the locals don't blow the planet up or at least try to prevent some wars/mindless slaughter.


  So the idiots in charge had a large part in:

  Cataclysm (tried to meddle in something and things went beyond bad). 

  Weeping (the splinter states were fighting for a long time for supremacy with a lot of bloodshed. Mages were usually heading those attacks/generals/whatever. So Angels decided to cut this ruling layer down a bit. Unsurprisingly the situation went from bad to worse and they especially hurt their own followers (church/priests tried to cure the sickness and were nearly wiped out). 


  They learned of the conspiracy to release Pan and the action they come up with is promising power/anything for a capable recruit (the time to hone his skills is long) with a minor deadly geas as collateral. 


  I guess the sentiment about capable people in government (especially in Easternish Europe) may have reflected inadvertently from author.


  Zach had some suicidal tendencies for a long while and Red Robe is a friend? 

  Zach spent a lot of time in loop and learned and matured a lot. After he learned a lot he had seen the preventing primordial release would keep the status quo which causes a lot of regular folk suffering. And he met his RR and his passionate plan to make the world a better place. Zachs plan before encountering Zorian was die inside the loop (he asked his friend RR to remove some memories about loop so he could die in ignorance. And by dying he causes least amount of damage). Some sort of euthanasia. Then Zorian appearing in his life and it his life plan was derailed.
  ```

    Because RR was able to defend himself against Zach. It's not like Zach would call down some divine wrath - He would just be compelled to use all his might to attack the mind mage.

  ```
  OK, now's a good time. **RedRobe is Veyers Boranova.** I won't explain how, because I don't know. But here's the deduction.

  1. RedRobe cares about Jornak Dokochin the lawyer. When interrogated, Jornak was not that fond for Veyers. Him saving the kid would be unthinkable. The counter argument: He could grew attached to the kid, like Zorian grew attached to Taiven despite their fairly distanced relationship at the beginning. It's a sound argument, but I wouldn't want to put much weight on that. I grew fond of Occam Razor.
  2. The memory that's erased from Zach is on Veyers. RedRobe, because he presumably understood he would be killed if Zach knew about him, went on to erase the memory of himself. The counter argument: Veyers being erased could be a tactic employed by RedRobe for the sake of completion, as in, why just erase myself, why not everyone that could be connected to me; just like Aranea. It's also a sound argument and I'd put more weight to it that the Taiven-Zorian analogy, but I would like to think RedRobe was not as paranoid when he did memory erasure.
  3. RedRobe left Veyers to his own device after some measure of security because he's fond his naive cringey old self. Unlike Zorian who got no option but to kill his old self, RedRobe could see him from afar. Beside, killing him or bound him in some kind of dungeon will be detriment to his plan. So, why not just spare him? The counter argument: Sending Veyers to his own device will provoke Zach and Zorian into hostile action, which ultimately will be a detriment to their plan. I won't put much stock on this counter-argument, because RedRobe was cautious; he won't underestimate the skill level of Zach and other ex-looper to get rid of Veyers without anyone noticing. Instead of thrown wrench, Veyers just became a momentary distraction if he follow this logic.

  I think I have some other rationale behind these three, but I can't remember at the moment. So there you have it.
  ```

  - u/LimeDog:
    ```
    Veyers is merely the cult connection used to reach the real RR. You gotta mind wipe that.

    I'm betting on Sudomir. He's got soul magic, a reasonable expectation of meeting Zach, wraith bombs, motive to perfect the attack on Cyoria, and all his wife stuff as motivation.
    ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      That's the counter argument of my second point. I guess my comment is pretty hard to read, I tried to cut words to keep it brief, but I ended up cutting too much.
      ```

- u/hallo_friendos:
  ```
  So, Silverlake and Red Robe are going to die when they fail to release the primordial, and Zorian and Alanic are going to get their own minds erased of any knowledge of the time loop? Also, wow, Zach is a better person than I thought. He's really been a good influence on Zorian.
  ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  So has Zach been feeling the urge to murder Zorian this whole time and just been keeping it in check through sheer willpower?

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:

- u/lostatnet:
  ```
  We need to know the complete terms of the contract in order to plan saving Zach.
  All we know that Zach probably got a divine blessing with the contract.

  If Zorian can remove it from Zach, then perhaps Zach can deny the divine pact.
  If Zach could technically claim that the angels didn't fulfill their part, then they might not be able to collect.
  After all, Zach & Zorian collected the 5 keys by themselves to unlock the gate.

  Or maybe Zorian can make the claim that he is exempt (& can be spared by Zach) as he made his own way as a looper & out of the Sovereign Gate without any angel's help.
  ```

- u/archaeonaga:
  ```
  Very interesting chapter. Silverlake is being as crafty as ever, and I honestly didn’t see the divine death pact coming, though it’s another great escalation. 

  But as far as my Zorian-Is-RR theory goes, a mixed bag, like the rest of the chapter. On the one hand, another Zorian gives Zach an interesting route to defeat the death pact—maybe the angels’ pact will be satisfied somehow by just killing one of the Zorians, or maybe Zorian can figure out some complicated way to take his soul and stuff it into RR!Zorian’s corpse after the month is over. 

  But on the other hand, this theoretical RR!Zorian doesn’t seem like the type to do the whole “thank you for showing mercy” thing. Unless RR!Zorian is actually an insane gambit where he’s really good, and this is just a super complicated way of getting around Zach’s death pact. But that’s starting to get crazy. 

  Either way, it’s interesting that Zorian starts the chapter thinking about how _obviously_ RR got his start as a temporary looper. Given what we later learn about Zach’s pact with the angels, it makes it far less likely that he would’ve gotten involved with an effort to bring someone out of the loop with him. 

  But if it isn’t Zorian (still my leading candidate, though it feels shakier after that chapter), we now have some extra info about who it is. Somebody who could either convince Zach to change his mind, or get into a position where they could talk to Panaxeth. And whoever it is, presumably they knew about Zach’s angelic death pact, or Panaxeth told them; that might help convince lots of people to think helping a primordial was a good idea. 

  Lots to digest in this chapter. Maybe I’ll have a better idea of what’s up after I sleep on it. 

  edit: Maybe the whole “showing mercy” bit is just RR pretending to be Veyers a little longer? But why? And is it significant that the bad guys are continuing to try and tempt Zorian?
  ```

  - u/PhilosopherGanon:
    ```
    I may be misremembering, but didn't Zorian find out that RR wasn't "open"? In which case, RR couldn't be Zorian unless he was faking it somehow. Also if Zorian is RR, how did they exist in the same place when they were in the time loop?
    ```

    - u/archaeonaga:
      ```
      When he first meets Damien, Zorian talks about how by then, he was good enough to tell if someone was psychic quickly; when he encountered RR, he wasn’t nearly as far along, and I don’t recall him ever explicitly saying RR was a non-psychic, just that he wasn’t very good. Which, as this chapter helps confirm, is a huge mistake—RR had to be damn good to manipulate Zach’s memories without triggering the death pact’s terms or the marker’s safeguards. Just not as good as you can get by actually working with the spiders instead of against them. 

      And if Panaxeth can make Silverlake a new body outside the loop, what’s stopping it from making a new one inside of it? And if it can get your soul through the gate, can’t it hold onto the soul between resets, or manipulate it with the same kind of divine energies that the death pacts use?
      ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  Watch them make another deal with Quatach-Ichl, this time to find a way to remove death pacts made of divine energies. Which will probably require the orb to be made into a Black Room again to be done in time.
  ```

- u/TheIssac:
  ```
  So all they have to do at the end of the month is erase Zorians Memorys concerning the time loop and reinstate something that tells him not to go after those memories ( he can already do that himself)... he will have all his skills, shaping skills, pure technical knowledge etc... maybe he goes back to be an ass but then its Zach job to befriend him again, not that much of a problem. More of a problem is to kill Silverlake and  Red Robe.
  ```

  - u/mishanek:
    ```
    Sounds impossible. You would have to erase 30 years of time loop experience, but keep the skills and knowledge gained during those 30 years. It would not be possible to separate the two. A lot of what you learn takes into account the situation that you learned it.
    ```

- u/jasmeet0817:
  ```
  The agreement between RR and ZZ is simple to imagine. They both (RR and Zach) have a common goal, fullfil or evade their death packs.
  ```

- u/somerandomguy2008:
  ```
  As I expect the true identity of Red Robe to be revealed within the next couple of chapters, I'd like to go on record with my Red Robe theory. I don't love it. I'm clearly making most of it up as I go, but it's the best I've got.

  Zorian is Red Robe. Or, well, a copy of Zorian is Red Robe.

  Some time before Zach got mind-wiped of Veyers, he placed a temporary marker on Zorian. Before the end of this temporary marker, Zorian is approached by Panaxeth and offered a deal. In exchange for doing his best to make the invasion a success and helping Panaxeth to be released, Zorian will be made a permanent looper and allowed to leave the loop whenever he wants. Zorian initially refuses, hoping he can find another way to escape the time loop or become a more longterm looper, but then he learns that Zach has a pact with the angels and is soul-bound to kill him if Zorian ever makes it out.

  So Zorian changes his mind. But instead of merely becoming a permanent looper with a get-out-of-the-time-loop-free-card, Zorian also asks Panaxeth for an extra, unmarked copy of his soul (and body for that matter) to live the life he would have lived in the loop if he didn't make this deal with Panaxeth. Why? Because he is also planning on wiping Zach's memory of himself and when he starts helping the invasion in the loop, Zach would be able to figure out that the mysterious Red Robe must be Zorian if Zorian was totally absent. (We know that this is within Panaxeth's power to do, for the record, even if he never explicitly offered this deal to anyone. The whole time loop functions by leveraging Panaxeth's power to copy the souls of everyone in the world. What's one more soul?)

  Panaxeth agrees to the deal, this Zorian becomes Red Robe and wipes Zach's memory of these events. But what about Veyers? Why did he wipe Veyers from Zach's mind? Because they had "soul-killed" Veyers together at some point on their adventures together. In order to wipe Zach's memory of himself, he had to wipe Zach's memory of them soul-killing Veyers, and if Zach doesn't remember soul-killing Veyers, he'll be confused when Veyer's doesn't show up to school like he usually does. Easiest to just wipe Zach's memory of Veyers entirely so as not to arouse suspicion.

  Why did they soul-kill Veyers in the first place? Probably because he always got in a fight with a drake near the beginning of the loop and the flames tended to kill an innocent bystander (which may well have happened in the most recent chapter if Zorian and Zach hadn't been there to tend to the flames). Or because Veyers was just annoying them or they were just testing out the power and Veyers just happened to get hit. Whatever it was, wiping Zach's memory of Veyers wasn't for Veyer's sake. It was so that Zach wouldn't be able to figure out that he'd been mind-wiped.

  One last question - why did RR!Zorian go get Veyers as soon as he escaped the loop? Likely because Silverlake had talked to him and, as such, he knew that Veyers was Zach and protagonist!Zorian's lead suspect and he wanted them to persist in that false belief. After observing Zach and Zorian's post-loop behavior for a while (and maybe by talking to Silverlake some more), he determined that they might not really be enemies after all. He decided to release Veyers to see what they'd do to him. They showed mercy, so now he wants to see if they can work together to get him out of his deal with Panaxeth. End theory.
  ```

  - u/archaeonaga:
    ```
    >why did RR!Zorian go get Veyers as soon as he escaped the loop?

    Clearly, getting to Veyers before Z&Z could ensured that he could use him to figure out who the other looper was. 

    I like the idea that RR!Zorian thinks he can get Our Zorian to cooperate after he's already killed a bunch of people and cooperated with Silverlake. But honestly, I think it's a trap. RR being secretly good would be kind of disappointing at this stage, and I think it makes for a better story if the two Zorians came out of the loop wildly different. 

    (Also, I had my own giant Zorian-Is-RR post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/aazrb6/a_final_rr_theory_spoilers_through_93/) if you want to compare notes/walls of text)
