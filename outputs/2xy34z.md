  Still enjoying this very much. 

  It's nice to see Allen take what I assume are some of his first steps to more rational thinking.

    Thanks!  Yes, I'm trying to push Allen towards at least some basic rational thought outside of his comfort zones.

  I'm willing to buy into the whole idealized dominance-hierarchy-based upbringing thing, but teenagers not having sex, for conscientiousness reasons? Please.

  And even if they're so conscientious, are you telling me that contraception has been suppressed? How the heck do you suppress knowledge of the rhythm method among livestock breeders?
