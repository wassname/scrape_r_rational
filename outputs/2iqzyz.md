  I'm really enjoying this fanfic, it's the best attempt I've read to continue hpmor in a different direction.

  That... 

  Actually makes a lot of sense. In the original HPMOR, Harry mentions [Spoiler] (#s "That it would be impossible for Hermione to stop herself from burning out to destroy dementors.") So her [Spoiler] (#s "Getting a phoenix.") in the process makes perfect sense to me.

  ```
  I want to know how everyone knows with total confidence that they will die from killing dementors, they've never done it full power before, they have no information to possibly base it on but they are all 100% confident it'll be their death.
  ```

  - u/rtkwe:
    ```
    In HPMOR the times Harry's true patronus has gone out of control " Part of Harry's life flowed back into him. 
    Part had been lost as radiation." It's also described as being cast with your life force instead of with your magic. All the descriptions indicate that it takes something distinctly not replaceable to kill a dementor. Of course this isn't written in some and Harry could be mistaken about the drain he feels but it's taken as unlikely.
    ```
