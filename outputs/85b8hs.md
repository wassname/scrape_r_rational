## [Spoilers] [BST] Yet another Full Metal Alchemist speculation thread

### Post:

I've seen [a few](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/31hjma/rational_fullmetal_alchemist/) Rational!FMA discussions [pos up](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ftyt8/bst_what_would_a_rationalfullmetal_alchemist_look/) evey now and then.

Stuff that has been discussed:
- The "equivalent exchange" principle is never really explained in the series. Could we make a consistent set of rules for alchemy?
- The series is kind of anti-transhumanist: you can't cheat Death because if you try "God" screws you over. Maybe r!Edward Elric would be a transhumanist who'd go "screw God, I'm still bringing back my brother *and* my mother".

There's an aspect that jumped to me when watching a few FMA videos, that I don't think has been explored yet, and would probably be the part of an hypothetical r!FMA that would interest me the most: *enlightened self-interest*.

**Spoilers ahead.**

---

The basic principle behind FMA is: a scheming devil-like creature is trying to attain immortality / godhood by creating a philosopher stone. Problem: unlike most stuff which is made of matter, a philosopher stone is made of souls (though it's not clear whether that means there's an afterlife at all; maybe souls are just a special life-component that dies with you unless it's harvested).

So the creature calls itself Father, and goes on to build a country / empire with the sole purpose of ritually sacrificing all its citizens at once down the line, with the help of a few gullible politicians and generals who are promised a share in the immortality business.

More importantly, Father carves out several parts of himself matching the Seven Deadly Sins, both as a "purify myself of all redundant thoughts" thing, and to act as quasi-immortal enforcers. Each of the Sins has its own personality, powers, and enforces Father's agenda in different ways.

But, and this is where things get interesting, Greed goes rogue, for obvious reasons. Long story short, he escapes from Father's influence, goes do his own thing, and builds up a criminal gang; he meets Edward Elric 100 years later, gets captured, killed, then re-injected in a different host, Ling, who is the prince of what I *think* is FMA!Japan?

The new Greed is basically a factory reset of the old one; he has the same personality, but has lost all of old Greed's memories, and is loyal to Father again. Also, he can't communicate with Ling's personality, though he mostly ignores him at first. Ling asks him for help taking over his Empire, but Greed goes "meh, I want even more than that".

A few chapters later, Greed is tasked to hunt down rebels, which happen to include some of his old gang, and this is where canon!FMA breaks down for me. One of Greed's henchmen recognizes his power, and goes "Greed, don't you remember me? I'm your friend!" Greed kills him, but is struck by grief over what he's done; Ling tells him that Father couldn't completely erase his memories, because *of course* they were in his soul all along. From then on, Greed is redeemed by the power of friendship, and eventually sacrifices himself to save Ling (and/or the greater good and/or to spite Father).

---

This is the part of Full Metal Alchemist that annoys me the most, and the part I'd like to see re-interpreted in rational fic, more than the magic system or the transhumanism.

Logically, Greed should be made of... well, pure Greed. The idea that the power of friendship is somehow universal enough to move even him, that "all he really wanted/needed was friends" strikes me as really dumb.

It's annoying, because there was a lot of potential to Greed II. Ling, who was previously shown as an ambiguously heroic figure, more or less volunteers to become Greed's host because he thinks it will help him claim the throne of his home country. This is never really explored: Greed dismisses the idea before his redemption, and dies afterwards. After his redemption, he basically acts as a cookie-cutter anti-hero: always smirking and mocking the heroes, but not really showing any selfishness or avarice.

I'm complaining specifically about Greed, but I think you can probably find a lot of characters in FMA with similar problems. The philosophy in that series is all over the place. It's been a while since I've read it, so I'd have trouble naming specific examples, but to quote the sidebar it's doesn't feel like "any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values", more like all the good guys are somehow working together against the bad guys.

I dunno, what do you think? Is there some other moment / character in FMA you think would make for an interesting rational rewrite?

  What I believe is that emotions aren't inherently the same, rather they differ from person to person. Father wasn't very lustful, so lust wasn't as well.

  Greed was father's true intentions and desires, father only really wanted friends and too be loved.

  Equivalent exchange, to my understanding is that an equal amount of matter must be present, and if the alchemist did not provide the "information" necessary, then there would be a rebound. Think about it, to transmute a spear, Edward needs to:

  1. Have the material.

  2. Have the knowledge of the components.

  3. Know what to do with the material/put in the information that is present in the spear.

  I believe that the sheet complexity and amount of information in a human body is what caused it to backfire. There's no way ed and al have a complete and perfect understanding of how a human body works, they didn't have the knowledge necessary to create a human.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Equivalent exchange seems like a bundle of conservation principles. Mass, sure, but not only - there are some alchemical properties (Al mentions not being able to transmute iron from something that has the qualities of water). They don't seem to have a fixed school of thought regarding this but they adhere to some sort of "element" school as well, so it's probably something along the lines of "earthy" things becoming other "earthy" things (e.g. stone => iron), "watery" and so on. Though they also explicitly mention atomic elements (oxygen, carbon), molecules (ammonia, dissociated from explosives) and even crystalline structures (diamond/graphite) so it doesn't really look like their chemistry is too different from ours.

    Energy is conserved too: they just draw it from tectonic movements.

    I always thought the true nature of alchemy was to ignore the 2nd principle of thermodynamics. Everything is conserved, but for example you can gather high-entropy energy to make things happen (like, using thermal energy to propel a pillar with high kinetic energy) and rearrange disordered matter into ordered structures. You can make iron out of rock and not water because rock is more likely to contain high quantities of iron atoms in its minerals.
    ```

    - u/OnePunchFan8:
      ```
      Spoilers, but I thought alchemy drew its energy from father, not tectonic plates, which is why father was able to cancel out their alchemy by stopping the supply of energy.

          No, sorry, this is not how it actually works, check it out. Even more spoilers: Father's Philospher Stone acts as a *dampener*: it does not fuel alchemy, rather, it restricts the flow of energy they can access. He can increase the output to stop it altogether. But when the final battle happens, there are two reverse giant alchemic circles that get activated. One, designed by Hohenheim, cancels the  process of Philosopher Stone creation and revives all the Amestrians sacrificed during Father's ritual. And the other, designed by Scar's brother, disrupts Father's energy and allows alchemists to access freely the true source, which means that their alchemy actually becomes far more powerful.

    I bet they don't know how a radio works that well either, but that doesn't stop them repairing them.

    Funny thing that he doesn't just repair the automail himself. He does turn it into blades and back...
    ```

    - u/OnePunchFan8:
      ```
      Oh yeah...I think he just messes with the outside components, like the plain iron.

      A radio isn't that complicated, ed and al are established to be geniuses, so it's not impossible.

  > who is the prince of what I think is FMA!Japan?

  I think it's pretty transparent it's FMA!China really. Most of their naming patterns and culture are Chinese, and heck, Xing was an actual vassal state of China: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xing_(state). The Xing emperor also appears to be modeled after Shi Huangdi, first emperor of China, the terracotta army dude, who is alleged to have died by drinking mercury, as he thought it would make him immortal (this story is even mentioned in FMA, I don't remember who is it attributed to though).

  > The idea that the power of friendship is somehow universal enough to move even him, that "all he really wanted/needed was friends" strikes me as really dumb.

  It's still a shounen series, but I didn't see it as completely out of left field. Basically, to Greed, his companions too are "possessions". He's greedy for power, money, but also followers. So when he kills his own former henchman, and then realises it, it triggers his rebellion *again*, because he realises he's been manipulated into doing the thing he hates the most, destroying his own possessions.

  Anyway remember that, his name aside, he's not literally an incarnation of a Biblical sin, but a part of the Homunculus' former personality. And what was that Homunculus' most human trait that eventually caused his downfall? The desire for human connection that had led him to befriend Hohenheim, and eventually give him half the souls from Xerxes, something that he had absolutely no reason to do if not some twisted sort of genuine gratitude.

  Personally I would not dare a rewrite of FMA, nor suggest it needs one. I think it's "rational" enough as it stands. Its characters all have their own flaws and desires, but ultimately their behaviour generally always makes sense. Just because they don't pursue transhumanist goals (Ed and Al *did*, but the beating they got out of it is a believable reason for them to have thought it wiser to give up) does not mean they are not rational. Alchemy is a limited form of science in their world, and they are approximately at the level of technology of the early XX century, save a few oddities like automail. At that point, they might reasonably conclude that even if transhumanism was possible, it would be beyond their reach for their lifetime. Every experiment in that direction seems to hit a wall where you either don't proceed, or need more human lives to fuel the extension of just one.

  One thing I've always wondered, when does Lust ever actually behave in ways that would embody her name? I get that she was kind of supposed to be this seductive femme fatale assassin/spy, but I don't recall any specific points in the story when she actually used that kind of approach.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    She seduced one of Roy's men, but that's about it. I think maybe she's supposed to represent bloodlust too? But yeah, she's a sexy lady more than... like, the incarnation of *wanting* sex.

      Headcannon would probably be a very illegal and weird weapon.

    I think that's more a problem with drawing for a PG-13 rated audience than anything else. I mean having her being a femme fatale is safer than having her actively pursue sex 'on-screen'.

      The thought of an *actually* sex-crazed Lust reminds me of something I made a long time ago XD:

  Father was really just a pathetic creature who just wanted to chase his desires and understand the world outside the Gate. 

  In Envy we see that his underlying motivation was envy of humanity and what makes people special. Envy wasn't just the emotion, he was Fathers envy and Father was most envious of humans. In the same way, Greed wasn't just someone who wanted power over everything, what he wanted most of all was what Father wanted. Fathers dealings with Hohenheim, his adoption of the name "Father" and his envy of humans show that Greeds main desire makes total sense.

  Remember, Father isn't incapable of wanting. He still wants power and to become a god even after excising Greed, he only excised his most human emotions that could hinder his goal.

  I didn't write it intending to be *rational*, per se; but I have written a [oneshot fanfic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13663779) about transhumanism and life extension in FMA (the Brotherhood/manga continuity). I'm curious as to what you might think about it.

  Here's a thought about a "rational" bent on a FMA fanfic -

  It has been a thousand years since the entity known as "Father" was defeated at the hands of the Fullmetal Alchemist, and since then State Alchemy has grown by leaps and bounds. The State Academies and a formalization of alchemical education have increased the number of qualified alchemists per generation by factors of ten. However, what nobody was able to foresee is the effects of so many people drawing on the Earth's tectonic energy. Thus, a thousand years later, Emmeline Elric, direct descendent of Fullmetal, notices something *off* about the global temperature...

  (okay maybe not temperature, but there's surely *something* interesting you could do with a far future/energy draining situation?)
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Could actually be going the other way around: maybe they're *cooling* down the core of the planet way too fast. We could run a quick calculation of how much energy expenditure that would take. And I think tectonic and geothermal activity do play a role in keeping the planet the way it is. Not sure what would happen if the Earth finally solidified all the way through.
    ```

    - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
      ```
      Two things:

      1: Carbon dioxide dissolves in the oceans and is utilised by phytoplankton in photosynthesis for growth and reproduction, entering the food web. Eventually the dead organisms sink to the seabed and become part of the the sedimentary rock. Without the subduction of the oceanic crust and the return of its carbon to the atmosphere by volcanoes, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would be gradually leeched out and the temperatures would drop, encasing the planet in ice.

      2: The magnetic field would weaken and dissipate, leaving the unprotected atmosphere to be stripped away by the solar wind.
      ```

- u/Trips-Over-Tail:
  ```
  The 2003 series, when the writers had to depart from the manga, reveals that the understanding of equal exchange is incomplete, because though you are providing the mass, you are not providing the time, energy, and expertise to create new things, ie you are violating Thermodynamics. Hoenheim reveals that [that power](#s " comes though the gate, in the form of slain human souls from the world on the other side. That world turns out to be our own, presently embroiled in the first world war, but the power transfer is one-way so alchemy doesn't work on the other side.")
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    In the manga energy is provided by tectonic movements. Which is indeed a nearly inexhaustible source; the problem is, you can't gather that energy and use it so efficiently because it's very degraded, high-entropy stuff. That's the miracle of alchemy, it basically subverts only the 2nd principle of thermodynamics. Everything else more or less makes sense in terms of conservation laws.
    ```

- u/RynnisOne:
  ```
  Wait... what?

  *Alphonse* is an unintentional transhumanist already, from the very beginning of the series.

  There are shown to be not one but at *least* three ways to cheat death.

  Also, I think it was GameTheory or FilmTheory (same people) who did a piece and figured out one reason the Elrics (and everyone else's) human transmutation didn't work--the elements and measures they listed for a human were flat out **wrong**, and its entirely possible that whatever they create would either not be alive or die in horrible pain as its body was unable to sustain itself.

  Also, the Panda was a subtle clue that the nation they borrowed from was China, but others seem to have made this point.

  I find it surprising that you're totally OK with the series up until that point involving Greed.  If it were actually *rational*, things would have diverged quite a bit before that point.  For that matter, their world would look quite a bit... different.  For all the cool bits about Alchemy we see during the series, it seems to be monopolized solely for military purposes.  The main question there is... *why*?

  If I were doing some rational re-write, there would have to be a lot of baseline rules covered first, things that would need to be explained.  For instance... can anyone do Alchemy with just a bit of study, or is there some necessary "spark" to be able to do so?  (Somewhat spoilery, the end of Brotherhood shows that it is indeed possible for a human to have zero potential for Alchemy.)  Why is it that the Elrics start with this rare collection of books and never think about it when they get older, including the fact that both can do Alchemy?  Do common people know of the concept of Equivalent Exchange, or just low tier Alchemists?  Is it a thing they use to explain it whilst it is being wrong, or is it simply the outmost 'layer' of knowledge that is safe to share?  Why do some Alchemical constructs have those weird 'strips' in them while others don't?  (I have a theory here)  Who came up with the "arrays" and how do they work, what is the significance of the 'points', etc?  What *is* the gate, really, and why is it inscribed with the Sefirot?

  FMA is a great series, but due to the 'fuzzy' softness of its system, a lot of the plot can be confusing at times, and there are a *lot* of unanswered questions.
  ```

    ```
    [Spoilers](#s " Alchemy is monopolised for military uses because of the social engineering of Father. They are the most potent weapons of the time and so are essential for carving the blood crests in the Amestris transmutation circle, and for aggressively expanding into neighbouring nations to expand its territory to the required size, and for defending said territory from those nations as they become themselves aggressive and militarised is response. It also means that powerful alchemists are under the military's command, so that those who have committed the taboo and thus made useful sacrifices of themselves can be located and summoned to Central City for the Promised Day.")

    It seems that everyone has the Gate for alchemy within them, but opening it requires learned skills and understanding. In a wartorn turn of the century era, most people do not have the time or resources to pursue such studies, to say little of the intellectual requirements. It is apparent that the Elrics are prodigies, but they were also lucky enough to live in a house full of alchemical texts and were financially comfortable [spoilers](#s " not to mention being the sons of and growing up with the Western Sage of Xinghese legend himself.")
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      I'd be totally OK with the **huge spoiler block info you posted** were it not for the fact that it's shown there are *non-military* Alchemists in the world, too.  

      The State Alchemists aren't all military.  Shou Tucker was an example--while he became a State Alchemists, he never was military, but worked to create Chimeras.  Other non-affiliated Alchemists exist, such as Father Cornello from the initial episodes, who are not under State control.  Plus, some like Alphonse, are tolerated to exist due to being related to others who are a part of the military or government.

        But a single person who focused on making things out of a single substance wouldn't have to study nearly as much, and could be very focused as a result.  Blacksmiths who use Alchemy to form tools and horseshoes and the like.  Road workers who make tessellated cobblestones as far as they need.  Architects who create buildings or entire cities out of stone or clay bricks, etc.  

        This is somehow absent from the military as well.  Oh, you want trenches?  We can do trenches with little berms on the side in *minutes* as opposed to hours.  The Amestrian army would be like a supercharged version of the Romans... wherever they march, small outposts and castles are left in their wake where they garrison their troops.  Conquering other people is a lot easier if they are willing to submit, and being able to build new homes, instantly dig wells, provide irrigation to fields, etc, makes them a lot more accepting of your rule, especially if all you want from them is food and the willingness to shelter your troops when they are passing through (in the barracks your army creates itself).

        If you're worried that people couldn't be raised under good enough situations to develop even this basic level, remember that real-world militaries have technical specialists too.

        Clearly the Elrics had a great head start.  That's something they don't seem to really recognize in the series.
      ```

      - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
        ```
        Alchemy is much harder than that, though. Notice that Edward cannot repair or replace his automail (and not just because he needs the arm to do it). Understanding automail likely requires as much work as understanding alchemy, by the time you have the comprehension to start making them alchemically you already know how to do so manually.

        Most alchemists need circles, and different transmutations usually need different circles, which increase in complexity with the complexity of the transmutation. Notice that military alchemists bring their circles into battle with them, and that limits their versatility. Those few who don't need circles are the most effective and versatile of them all, but the price of that versatility is as terrible as it is secret.

        Note also that there appears to be little tradition of alchemy education and publishing. The books either only cover the basics (and remain almost impenetrable for all that) or are encrypted and secret. After that, the most useful books on alchemy are controlled by the state and only available to alchemists in their employ, which tends to filter up-and-coming alchemists into the state and thus military. The Elrics had to beg and grovel to get a teacher, and Izumi had the same problem when she was learning.

        While we do see non-military alchemists, they are extremely rare. There seem to be whole towns who don't see an alchemist until one from elsewhere shows up, and they're usually military when they do. Liore, for instance. When you count Father Cornello, there's still only one. The 2003 series had more about than Brotherhood, and even then the Elric's had to seek them out. [Spoilers](#s " And in that narrative all the wars engineered by the homunculi was intended to create the kind of despair necessary to drive people to alchemy to make the philosopher's stone. The necessary drive and passion to achieve anything in such a difficult field seems to be rare without it.") There appears to be a significant barrier to entry when it comes to learning the science, both in ability and accessibility.

        It appears to be that labour is cheap but powerful human weapons are not. It should also be noted that Amestran leadership is not interested in conquering people by offering a tasty carrot [spoilers](#s " when the bloodiness of the stick is the very point of the conquest.")
        ```
