  It seems somehow unfair when we readers: (a) know who Superman is, (b) get multiple perspectives, and (c) aren't under whatever mental influence Krypton provides.

  I love it.

  It is a really fun story. I am actually really curious about how the problems will be solved, which isn't normal for a story like this where a human is fighting a god.

  Two days on and I'm actually finding myself impatient for the next chapter. Any time I see Superman referenced anywhere I get a tiny jolt of excitement as my brain subconsciously makes the connection before I realise what it's excited about and that it'll be days before the next one and will continue to be a week between each one...

  Congratulations I guess!
