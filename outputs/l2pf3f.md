  Fiction so rarely captures the inanity of bureaucracy properly. I just had to send an email asking one of our vendors to pretty please not cut us off because we're going to be late paying them because the money allocated to paying them was written down as being associated with the wrong purchasing group, which has spawned a multi-week "oh no what do we do how do we fix this" festival.

  Like, this isn't people actively blocking anything. Everyone involved in the conversation wants things to be worked out and is willing to do their part in getting it there! It just takes this long anyway!

    The laundry files plays this to good comedic value, when not busy with spy plots and a slow decent into eldritch horror with a British stiff upper lip.

      better yet: Laundry is actually an example of how soul-less bureaucracy can actually defeat, and even recruit Eldritch Horrors, precisely because it already defies human logic and is mindlessly resistant to chaos.

    I don't think people can comprehend how inane and indifferent large real world organizations are due to the bureaucracy. Experiencing it, trying to wrap your head around it, and how much it probably drives the world, is very Lovecraftian.

    The book Catch-22 and "The Pentagon Wars" movie spring to mind. I think most military culture is open about it as opposed to businesses being encouraged to lie and hide it.

  Effective altrusim - donating blood/platelets/plasma. Especially COVID-convalescent plasma.

  I did my first plasma donation today, I've donated blood only twice before. I got $65, not for the plasma, but for my time according to them. It took about 4 hrs though it was supposed to be only 2.5 hrs for a first timer. They pay $100 for donations of tested COVID convalescent plasma. I suspect I had COVID back in Feb 2020, but that's way past the CDCs 4 month estimate of the antibody presence in blood, and during that time the virus was just starting to ramp up anyways.

  I was inspired to donate by the Lex Fridman podcast with Michael Mina about rapid testing. I recommend trying both the podcast and donating. Plasma goes especially far in this day and age. The pricing makes it easy to see how badly the stuff is needed. My plasma bottle was marked "for manufacturing use only", so that was neat.

      No, it isn't selfish not to do this specific altruism. There's plenty of other things that need doing. Plain cash donations to the Against Malaria Foundation is pretty effective (even better if it's cash from donating plasma). 

      I hope venting helped a little. Do you think everyone should be scared off from donating plasma? I think the answer to that is obvious, and while not donating because of a personal bad experience is fine, a long public anecdote is a bit self-centered and not much of a public service announcement. "A hugely non-insignificant percent of the people sticking you at those places are very inexperienced" is just unqualified.

          It's pretty obvious it was just bad a personal experience you had and you just dug up something on demand. That article mentions nothing about the training of the nurses, and the patient complications they referenced were from people who deliberately bypassed the safeties. Lets be rational about it.

          If it's specifically the for-profit companies that bother you, plasma donations are taken by non-profit blood donation centers as well.

          Again, covid-convalescent plasma is especially important now, no article from 2014 is going to change that.

              COVID-convalescent plasma is important for research and production, not for direct therapies, though they use that too to save lives.

              They're offering double monetary reward, I think that's a pretty good indication of value. It's just in demand worldwide and plasma donation is being requested of everyone who tests positive for the anti-bodies, they send mail, call you, and ask you in person.

              I thought YOU skimmed the article, because even after all that quoting line by line it just doesn't back up your assertion that the staff are commonly under-trained. Bringing up the NY law didn't really help there either.

              No, 60 or so donations from years ago aren't enough to cover the plasma demand today that readers of this subreddit could help with. I'm confident in asserting that without qualifications.

              I spent 2 hours watching presentations and reading documents on the risks, including the citrate reaction and several others that the article doesn't mention, and so will anyone who chooses to donate. I made my suggestion without all that extra info because we (me, you, the journalist) aren't medical professionals. I do CNC machining, my hands are important too, but so is donating plasma.

  I want to see a world with stats but without bs magic materials.

  &#x200B;

  For instance very powerful people resisting attacks because they are too dense to penetrate. i.e Enemy (who's superhuman already) throws rock at MC, the rock moves at bullet speeds but because of the MCs defense stat, his density is too high and the rock shatters to dust after giving him a small bruise. Maybe if the enemy had use a lead pellet he'd have damaged the MC but his lack of proper equipment to deal with a superhuman means he loses by default.

  &#x200B;

  Or bows being uncommon because making a bow strong enough or with enough draw weight to damage a powerful person it'd have to be too big to handle or to be made of very rare materials.

  &#x200B;

  People having to use interesting materials for weaponry like lead or gold because of the high density etc.

  &#x200B;

  Ranged weapons being lead pellets people throw. Melee weapons having gold tips, crazy stuff like that.

  &#x200B;

  I'm reading this LitRPG and some goblins are attacking this MC who could carry a car on his back with bone weapons and they're supposed to be a challenge? Come on, bone wouldn't even scratch his skin at this point it's too dumb to enjoy..
