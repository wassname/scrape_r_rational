## A Hero's War TVTropes page

### Post:

Just thought some might be interested to know that I've started a TVTropes page for A Hero's War, at https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AHerosWar

All contributions and feedback welcome!

(Anyone know how to put the apostrophe in the page title?)
