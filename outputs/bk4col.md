  I'm expecting the Saint to betray the group, since she wants Procer destroyed. Killing the Dead King would prevent that from occuring. It could be easily justified, since in her eyes Pilgrim and Sorcerer are both being deceived by a villain. It doesn't have to be an offer taken, maybe just a seed of doubt planted. Like the Dead King saying that of all the group, she'd be impossible to sway, and not making an offer at all.

    She can't do anything to the Dead King, though? At least here. She's more likely to count on being able to kill Kairos and Cat later, IMO.

  I like the shape of things to come, we get to see the laws of narrative in the converse situations as previous books: a band of five heroes (of circumstances) charging into a great evil.

  ... Did anyone else see Epilogue at the top of EE's posts? I averted my eyes and navigated to the appropriate chapter, but I'd like to know if I am in fact hallucinating or is this actually happened as there is no 'Epilogue' at the top of EE's recent posts now. Would have been an hour or so ago.
