## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Looking at English original web serials, Mine Lord is high quality:

  https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/76164/the-mine-lord-a-dwarven-survival-base-builder

  It’s not a LitRPG or anything, but a very well-executed frontier survival story. It’s not your typical RR fare. It’s very good.

  But if anyone has dabbled in Asian webnovels, Longevity Simulations is provoking comparisons to Lord of the Mysteries and Reverend Insanity. It follows a pragmatic protagonist exploiting a time loop in a xianxia setting. I know, I know, time loops “have been done,” but this one is relatively unique for the setting and the length of the loop - that of a full life. The author knows how to keep progression going and interesting, and similarly to RI and LotM it really nails the world-shaking, climactic denouements. It used to be machine-translated only, but there’s a nicely edited translation here: 
  https://www.scribblehub.com/series/851465/my-longevity-simulation/

  That updates on average faster than a chapter a day. 185 chapters so far isn’t enough to judge it whole but I’ve been told it only gets better from this point in the story, and I’m already enjoying it a lot. The time-travel really lets the protagonist be an outside-context problem and watching him learn how to lean into that and manipulate the butterfly effect is a really cool idea. Of course, like all translated Asian webnovels, there’s a certain lightness to the prose. It’s stilted, theatrical. But if the translated trappings don’t bother you then I would definitely recommend checking it out.

    The cheat in this novel is too extreme for me. Not only can the MC time travel, he can choose to keep his cultivation, keep an item in an inventory, add someone else to the time loop, set different save points, and even spend "charge" to block fatal blows. Compare that to Spring Autumn Cicada in Reverend Insanity, which pressures to MC to advance at a certain rate or explode, has a failure chance, reduces the users luck, and is imprecise about how far back it can take the user.

      It sounds like you’ve read further than me! You’re correct, though, the time travel is strong enough that the story has to keep your interest with mysteries, plotting, and progression rather than fights for survival. I personally enjoyed this because it’s different from the usual fare and well-executed imo, but I should have mentioned it as a caveat.

        Not really, all that information is basically presented immediately. For example, this from chapter 2.

          \>one of

          It sounds like he's limited to one at a time. I haven't read very far myself, so his system might get more OP over time. With the restriction of one, once he starts cultivating, he's likely to pick #2 unless he finds some god-tier treasure that is helpful in the first stages of cultivation to pick #1. #3 would be a hard reset for his progress, so unless he can truly trust the person he's bringing back (unlikely in a xianxia), it's giving them a big advantage over him.

  Hi there! 

  I want to know if there is a Harry Potter fanfiction out there about a muggle figuring out the existence of the magical world?

  I've started "Out of the west" by Larry Huss on fanfiction.net and found it interesting, but the fact that the characters have psionic powers kinda turned me off. I would have preferred if the characters were not wizards in their own way and deduce the existence of the magical world with nothing but their wits, knowledge and available technology.

  I think it's an interesting question. If the muggles were to find and understand the magical world, how would they manage to do it?

    If I remember correctly, book 2 in [HPN20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/34/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20) had a plot thread that fits this bill. Beware though, it's abandoned right after book 2, just when this plot thread was blossoming to pure awesomeness. The whole fic is chock full of awesomeness in general so worth a read (I wouldn't be surprised if it's in top 3 HP fanfic for most people here), but it's also why the unfinished status hits the hardest.

        I just reread it and it's as hillarious as I remember it to be. Any ideas for similar fics?

    I'm similarly looking for this type of story. I can recall twoish off the top of my head. 

    Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach.

    https://archiveofourown.org/works/4626147/chapters/10547214

    Harry is caught on video flying his broom as he escapes Death Eaters, and the video is edited into a super bowl ad in America. The wizards are run ragged attempting to contain it, and it takes a bit given its the 90's but it goes viral. 

    Fair warning it's long, and I never finished it. The story itself is, poorly constructed as it reaches to cover the global scope of the veil being pulled back. Every few chapters have a dozen new characters, and OC characters are rarely brought up for long. It explores the premise at least from a lot of the angels. 

    Hermione Learns a Thing. 

    https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hermione-learns-a-thing.991079/

    This is unfinished, and suffers some from the Harry Potter Fanfic tendency to make 11 year olds act like adults. Hermione is a genius who discovers magic on her own, learning to artificialy reproduce her accidental magic with technology. 

    She validates this by volunteering her tech and herself to a college physics lab and ESP department to validate and investigate magic.

      Thanks! I'll have a look at them.

    What does Light Novel mean exactly? Translated web serials from east Asia?

    Reverend Insanity (aka Gu Daoist Master) is the usual villain MC recommendation.

  Heya, I'm looking for currently running webfiction recommendations.

  I'm currently reading Thresholder, Pokemon: Origin of Species and Pale Lights.

  As I am very much able to finish a new chapter the same day it comes out, that leaves me with a lot of days without anything to scratch that rational-fic itch. (I do read books, but I like to take regular breaks from a long story to read something else)

  I see that there are some fics with regular updates popping up in this subreddit, but I'm wary of just jumping blindly into a work from an author I'm not familiar with.

  So, any recommendations for what I should add to my weekly reading roster? :)
