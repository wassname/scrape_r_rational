## What would be the most effective way for another civilization to broadcast a signal with the meaning "Danger/ous"?

### Post:

Some time ago I was thinking about one of the solutions that is usually brought up whenever the Fermi Paradox is mentioned: Everyone is silent because they're afraid of getting noticed by Something Bad. Which means that Active SETI could be acting very stupidly. 

From there I started wondering: Let's suppose not only that the universe is quiet because everyone is hiding, but also that there is *evidence* of something worth hiding from. Even if nobody is broadcasting, however, you can still monitor, and at least a few altruistic civilizations are willing to take a risk when they notice some young up-and-comers who haven't learned what's going on. 

If one of these civilizations noticed our signals and wanted to warn us, what would be the most concise way of communicating "SHUT UP. IT'S DANGEROUS TO TALK."? On the one hand, you would want to make sure that there was enough information as possible, to increase the probability that the newbies will receive and successfully decode it (and *believe*, too). On the other hand, you want to send as little as you can get away with, in order to reduce the likelihood that the Bad Thing will find you. 

I've been told elsewhere that the idea of division by zero would be a reasonably clear signal that Something Bad is going down, so maybe one would send numerous repetitions of "STOP. 1/0", paired with the broadcaster's version of Lincos so that we could decode it. 

I'm not sure if that's the best solution, though, and this seems like an appropriate topic for /r/rationality.

  The most concise way of communicating "SHUT UP, IT'S DANGEROUS TO TALK" is *silence.* Which is what we're experiencing right now.

  I know it's a chestnut, but here's the obligatory quote from The Killing Star:

  1) Their survival will be more important than our survival. If an alien species has to choose between them and us, they won't choose us. It's difficult to imagine a contrary case; species don't survive by being self-sacrificing.

  2) Wimps don't become top dogs. No species makes it to the top by being passive. The species in charge of any given planet will be highly intelligent, alert, aggressive and ruthless when necessary.

  3) They will assume that the first two laws apply to us.



  Imagine yourself taking a stroll through Manhattan, somewhere north of 68th street, deep inside Central Park, late at night. It would be nice to meet someone friendly, but you know that the park is dangerous at night. That's when the monsters come out. There's always a strong undercurrent of drug dealings, muggings and occasional homicides. It is not easy to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. They dress alike, and their weapons are concealed. The only difference is intent, and you can't read minds. Stay in the dark long enough and you may hear the occasional distant shriek or blunder across a body. How do you survive the night? The last thing you want to do is shout, "I'm here!" The next to last thing you want to do is reply to someone who shouts, "I'm a friend!" What you would like to do is find a policeman, or get out of the park. But you don't want to make noise or move towards a light where you might be spotted, and it is difficult to find either a policeman or your way out without making yourself known. Your safest option is to hunker down and wait for daylight, then safely walk out.

  There are, of course a few obvious differences between Central Park and the universe:

  There is no policeman

  There is no way out

  And the night never ends

    I am getting definite horror story vibes from this.

      If you're H. P. Lovecraft, the cosmos is a horror story, and the only solution is "cower." If you're Gene Roddenberry, the same cosmos is a space opera, and the only solution is "be the policeman."

      Edit: also, for the record, Central Park uptown of 68th street, in this day and age, is really not all that scary :)

  The best way to do this is probably just with highly directed signals. If you're picking up humanity's TV broadcasts, and are an advanced species, you can just say "Stop broadcasting, there's something bad out there, here's a manual that might help you not be completely screwed," and transmit it all in highly directional particle bursts that we'd see as cosmic rays.

  One might want to alter the scenario so that there are selfish reasons for another civilization to request radio silence from an ignorant one.

  For example, perhaps the evil will have a negative impact on a galactic scale. Therefore, if other civilizations in our galaxy notice us behaving noisily and attracting attention, they will have an incentive to quiet us to that the entire galaxy is not destroyed or harmed.

    If that were true, then the other civilization might be best served by destroying us though. Especially if FTL isn't allowed.

  The most concise way would be to present whatever that evidence is.

  If there's even evidence of the Bad Thing, it's not as apocalyptically bad as it could be. Since your premise suggests every one of the advanced civilizations just want to hide (and hence implying that's a valid survival response - Big Bad can't find them by chance or effort, but can trace broadcasts?), they'd just stay silent.

  If they have a reason to risk detection at all (eg coalition for a solution), there'd be no Fermi paradox and any altruists would probably be sharing everything in a last ditch effort.

  To be honest, if I received a message of '1/0' from an extraterrestial civilization, I would think that they're trying to check if humans know the basic principles of mathematics than that they're trying to broadcast a warning message. There's nothing about 1/0 that signifies danger, at least to me.

  Yea, I can't really see a scenario where the Nice Aliens are able to send an untraceable message to us in a form we'd understand. At least, enough to actually understand it as a society. We've all heard of people that wear tin foil hats and spout nonsense. So the message would have to be fairly convincing. It would probably take an annoyingly large amount of back and forth, to really sell any government worth its salt. And I can't see the Nice Aliens being able to transmit such a message to us, in a world where Something Bad exists. It would be too risky. Unless Something Bad wasn't in the form of an intelligent society of some sort (which I believe is the implication based on this post)

  Probably no message at all.

  O, that's easy. As soon as you have noticed that some new civilisation is sending directed signals into space with the intent to find other civilisations, incinerate a large enough chunk(something the size of France, for example) of their planet. Make sure that the attack appears to come from the direction they have recently sent a signal to. Now they know that there is something out there that wants them dead and they should keep silent lest that something kill them off for good. Signaling 1/0 or something similar carries a danger of being misunderstood and/or ignored, while a giant laser from space is very clear in what it means and is very hard to miss. Coincidentally, it can be as short of an impulse as you prefer, as long as the total energy is appropriate.
