  Mod of CMV here. If you do go there read the rules first. /r/changemyview is pretty tightly moderated.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    I'm missing the context. Did I break any rules? Please let me know so I don't become a repeat offender.
    ```

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      In general from our experience, outsiders who are linked to it often leave quite low quality comments- they ignore rule 1 and agree with OP, leave short jokey comments and violate rule 5, get angry and pick a fight with someone and violate rule 2. I wasn't criticizing you, I was just appealing for any who read your post to read the rules first.

        Ah. I got it.

        /r/rational is a relatively mannered community, so I hope not much of the kind will happen.
        ```

        - u/Nepene:
          ```
          I'd hope so, but it's always possible some angry rationalist will stomp in there to stop the evil faith filled heretics.
          ```

            ```
            This ain't /r/atheism ...
            ```
