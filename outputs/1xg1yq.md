  A problem I've realized I'm having with my own writing is that I keep writing scenes that I think "ought" to be in the story rather than just getting to the stuff that interests me. The result is that the writing is difficult and slow and bad, and the audience probably doesn't find those scenes any more interesting than I do. As a result, I'm going back over my stories and throwing out everything that I wrote because I thought it was supposed to happen. Instead, I'm going to do whatever interests me, and I'm going to listen to the part of my brain that gets bored, that complains the scene isn't working, that feels like it's being forced to work instead of the writing flowing naturally.

  I think this story could use the same. Skimming farther down, it looks like it gets sort of interesting. There's magic and monsters and stuff. Sounds neat. But do I really want to slog through pages of...I don't know what, exactly, to get to that?. Girls at school getting to know each other and learning about drinking? Sort of like *The Bell Jar* but bad? I wonder how much of what's been written really interested in the author, how much flowed naturally out of what interested her about the story she conceived and how much she had to force out because she thought it was supposed to be there.

  Also, is it just me, or does it go from Chapter One to Chapter Three with no Chapter Two in between?

  The awesome starts at ~chapter 3.

  First impression wise; you could do with an editor to help smooth out the word flow. Right now it feels just a bit stilted and not much has been done to frame the world we are in a little more.

  I do not know where we are, and I was not engaged enough to invest the time to get to the explanation of the world we are reading about. After reading the first few paragraphs I sorta can guess that we are in a boarding school, maybe? This is set in the modern day, but the characters prefer to use much older styles. I don't know why this is or what this means for the setting, it just feels out of place and takes me out of the story even further.

  It is not very clear on what exactly is going on to the detriment of the story. I honestly don't feel like sticking to the third chapter with how the first five paragraphs are written.

  I really don't mean for this to be too harsh on you, it is great that you want to write and to get your work out there. Just find someone to pre-read for you and to work on making the writing flow a little better. Keep working at it!

    It's not mine. I am running the website for the author though.

    How many books have you picked up that were engrossing from the very first paragraph? Like actual novels, not web-fiction or fan-fiction?

    /r/rational seems to trend towards fiction that you can just pick up and start reading. Fiction that doesn't require any kind of investment, and a lot of short stories. I think the industry in general is probably going that route, but I don't think it's a very good trend.

    It's had a lot of pre-reading. Given other peoples reactions, I'm inclined to think it's more about your reading style then the content of the book. You try to target everyone and you end up pleasing no one.

      Having had a very small hand in going through the slush pile at a small publishing company, and a degree in English - the first sentence/paragraph/chapter is the most important one in the entire novel. If you look at readership statistics of pretty much *anything* people are far, far more likely to drop off at the very first part than at any other part. [Here's a traffic breakdown by chapter](http://i.imgur.com/8nYEkJR.png) for the last nine days of a novella-length fanfic that I wrote. That very first chapter is where people decide whether they want to read it or not. You can see similar stats if you look at any of the traffic stats that Wildbow has posted for Worm. The first sentence/paragraph/chapter of a book is *absolutely* the most important, because that's where people will decide whether they're going to keep going.

      Now with that said, I don't actually think that it's as big of a problem here. For me, the part where I actually got interested was halfway down the page - the idea of a medieval person going to university in modern clothing is intriguing and makes me want to know more. If I were editing, I might move that part up to the beginning, then describe the room in contrast with home, *then* have a conversation with mother and father ... but that's based solely on what I find interesting and what grabs me and says "this is worth continued reading".

      The very first sentence made me want to stop reading, and the second and third sentences reinforced that feeling. Not every story needs to start with something going bang--look at Star Wars: A New Hope, which has a painfully slow opening. But based on a skim, this story has absolutely nothing happening for several pages. That's not an opening; that's just stuff that needs to be cut.

      I have picked up lots of books that draw me in with just the first few paragraphs. I want to feel invested when I read something, and all I am saying is that his story does not have that draw to it for me.
