  **Conurbations**

  Last week there was a question about what exactly a 'conurbation' is - the word refers to extended urban areas that cover several towns and cities, but in 'Ascent' the numbered conurbations are a specific kind of highly self-sufficient city. Not quite like an arcology or a regular town, Conurbations are built around incredibly high density subsistence farming ('protein farms') - most residents grow heavily modified seaweeds or staple crops in high density square meter plots, a little like the ancient Inca method of farming. Conurbations are built to minimise public spaces and opportunities for meeting and congregation. They are designed to be nearly self sufficient in food, water and basic goods, with heavy recycling and printing facilties. Energy is provided by extensive solar power farms, the only method of energy generation that does not add to total planetary waste heat. The only things that need be imported are high-tech goods like medicines and some electronics. There is little need for travel. All in all, the Earth's total population at the time the story is set exceeds 20 billion, with demographics resembling a present day middle income country. 'Wastelanders' are an insignificant minority.

  I remember this setting! You've written two other short pieces set in this, one about how Vash rose to power, I believe, and the other about how Earth came to be like this and who is on the other end of that phone line. Keep up the good work

    Good catch. *Every* story I've ever written or will ever write is from the same setting.
