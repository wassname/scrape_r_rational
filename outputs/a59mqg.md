## Does Arrival take place in a universe in which all actions are predetermined? (Arrival movie spoilers.)

### Post:

While Amy Adams' interactions with the Chinese general makes it appear she is pulling information from future timelines and using it to make changes for the better to her present, very little of the rest of the movie makes sense if that is the case. In particular, why would Amy Adams have a child doomed to die prematurely, when by the smallest of timing variations she could have a different sperm fertilize her egg, or by waiting a month have a different egg to be fertilized, thereby producing a healthy baby? The movie seems to be going for some sort of Aesop about her valuing and finding beautiful even a defective child, but both the child in the movie and all other possible children she might have instead are just that -- possibilities. So why would Amy Adams choose a possible child which would fulfill her utility function so poorly? (Unless she valued the premature and and painful death of her child and the resulting breakup of her marriage.)

Another thing that made little sense to me was, why doesn't Amy Adams' future child change each time Amy Adams views the future? Each time Amy Adams views the future it makes her disoriented, makes her at the least pause, or more often take different actions.  This should result in timing variations when she conceives the child, resulting in different sperm arriving at the egg, resulting in a succession of different possible children.

These factors made the movie pretty nonsensical for me the first two times I watched it, however on the third rewatch it occurred to me that some of these problems resolve if Arrival takes place in a universe in which all actions are predetermined, including actions that are apparently time travel. 

Thoughts?

  Orginal short story was set in predetermined universe, but movie wanted to have more actiony ending and that caused some plot holes.

  Yes, that is kind of the point. Adams learns to value the here and now despite knowing where it will end.

  The heptapods even get confused about how humans view the world with the "there is no time" comment. Humans think that time exists sequentially, while the heptapods see it as a "one long moment," so to speak. Speaking in past and future tenses on what could happen or what had happened simply doesn't make sense to them since the future "already happened" to them, and as Adams' knowledge of their language increases, she can glimpse that instantaneous perception of time too.

  Arrival definitely seems to occur in a predetermined universe. But note that this is not necessary to explain the main character's behavior w.r.t. her sick daughter.

  Even if the sick daughter who dies early is only one of many possibilities, Amy Adams' character never sees any of those other possibilities. Her heptapod-like perception (or flashes of perception) of time means that she experiences the possible future with her sick daughter as the present actuality. That is, as far as she's concerned, she has a daughter whom she loves very much, and would like to spend time with, and children aren't exactly interchangeable. It's natural that she would choose the exact sequence of events she remembers from the future that would lead to the sick daughter being born, even she and the universe had other possibilities.

  Small variations in timing, though potentially important, aren't in this case, since the future she saw was the one in which she'd already seen the future. That is, it's not like there's an original timeline with no foreknowledge that she was trying to match to make her daughter come to be. Rather, the timeline that she saw, in which her daughter came to be, was one in which she'd already seen the timeline and all her future actions. There's no room for Primer-style small variations to have big consequences because there are no small variations.

    How? If she missteps by a Planck length the error will grow exponentially until the wrong sperm meets the egg.

    - u/bassicallyboss:
      ```
      I think the universe she's in is predetermined, so she doesn't actually have the freedom to misstep like that.

      But the bit you quoted was an attempt to answer OP's implicit question about why, in a counter-factual world that wasn't predetermined and she could have her choice of futures, she would choose the tragic future she saw instead of trying to get to another, happier, one. (Because she loved the child she had, not the ones she might have had)

      Not necessarily.

      Chaotic systems can contain attractors, which are regions where small variations still produce convergent outcomes over infinite iterations. 

      &#x200B;

      If we presume that Adams could have made choices otehr than the ones she remembers making it's likely that the timeline she remembers is something similar where she has to do more than misstep by a plank-length to diverge from it in a way she would recognize as being different. This would not preclude there being otehr such timelines, or otehr less stable timelines.

        An attractor is when it ends up in some set of outcomes. There's still a lot of differences in what it can be.

        And in any case, it's pretty clear that messing around with a bunch of molecules bouncing off of each other isn't going to end up with them bouncing in the same manner and pushing the same sperm to a given egg.

  Its a single timeline just like harry potter. She has the kid because that what has already happened. She doesn't pause and do something different, she does the thing she has already done. Everything she does with knowledge of the future makes that future happen.

  Does it make perfect sense? Of course not time travel is a fantasy. Of course it doesn't make sense with QM, and all time travel has information from nothing paradoxes, thats time travel.
  ```

  - u/crivtox:
    ```
    There's no information from nothing paradoxes and there's an obvious way to make it work whith Qm I think.

    You just have all the posible casually consistent  timelines existing. 

    In some of them it just happens to look like knowdelenge is created.
    But most loops will close in simpler wayand its not actually paradoxical.
    Realisticaly time travel would not be posible at all though, since branches where nothing time travels are way more likely. 
    So we might even live in a universe with time travel and some caracter√≠stics of it that we take for granted actually a consecuence  us being much more likely to live on universes whithout time  travel.

  What do you mean by "predetermined"? If you mean deterministic, most likely not. Even if it's otherwise deterministic, stable time loops can resolve multiple ways, and it's presumably random which actually happens. Though it's possible that there is some rule that can be used to predict it.

  If you're asking about whether it follows [presentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_presentism) or [eternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternalism_\(philosophy_of_time\)), then presentism makes even less sense than normal in this case, but it's confused to begin with.

  There's two types of time travel: single timeline and multiple timeline. With single timeline time travel, all travel is earlier in the same timeline. With multiple timeline, you create a new timeline when you time travel. Arrival uses single timeline. It's impossible for Amy's future child to change since it's the same child. It's not that the same events happen each time. They only happen once. You just see them multiple times if you're not looking at things from a linear perspective.
  ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  Short version: You're attempting to view the timeline of the movie in a linear fashion. Notionally, Adam's character was "able" to view the "future" information because time stopped being linear to her. Under that view, there is no future, and so there is no changing the future. 

  When you have information moving through time, AFAIK/short version, you either have meta-time (the dimension along which the timeline changes) or you have a "constant" universe where the timeline is static. In "Arrival" it's the later, in most other fiction (terminator, et all) it's the former.

  There might be some wiggle room in there with quantumn funniness and the gap between determinism and knowable (see Scott Aaronson's lecture on free will), but I figure you'd _still_ not get a "changing" timeline.

  The neat philosophical idea at the core of Arrival is the combination of the physics "principle of least action" with the linguistics/cognitive science "Sapir Whorf hypothesis" - yes, the author was serious about his thought experiments.

  I'll briefly describe these ideas and how they combine in Arrival, and this should answer your question. But you should really read the original short story "Story of Your Life" - it explores this very cohesively (as opposed to the movie which became heavily Hollywoodized).

  The Sapir Whorf hypothesis was trendy in the 1960s, a cool idea but mostly not taken seriously these days. It simply says that the language one speaks significantly shapes the way one's brain works, and the way one perceives the world.

  The "principle of least action" is a very general and enormously powerful interpretation of physics which, does \*not\* phrase things in terms of cause+effect, but instead looks at complete trajectories of a system across time and specifies the rules that characterize entire trajectories. While a typical way of describing physics would say "given the current conditions (position and velocity), this is what will happen next", the principle of least action instead says things like "a complete trajectory of light will consist of straight lines, and interactions with shiny surfaces where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection". This way of looking at physics only talks about "complete stories", and the "arrow of time" doesn't show up at all.

  The thought experiment behind Arrival basically asks, since there are two languages for talking about physics (the cause+effect language, and the "characterizing complete stories" language), what if there were aliens that thought entirely in this second language? It's not that they have superpowers or can see the future, just they conceptualize only characteristics of completed stories, and don't perceive cause+effect, nor the flow of time.

  On our world, every kid intuitively knows about cause+effect, while the logically equivalent "principle of least action" is only seriously taught at the advanced undergraduate level as an exotic alternative; consider an alien world where these facts are flipped: every kid-alien intuits the principle of least action, but "cause+effect" is an opaque abstraction taught only to ambitious aliens who are really good at math.

  The main character of Arrival is, naturally, a linguist (with a physicist best buddy), and the main point of the story is that, as she learns the alien's language, she starts thinking in this alien way, losing her perception of time, and gaining a perception of the complete trajectories of stories.

  Naturally, such a perception of time would be an emergent property of her brain across her entire life, and she would not be able to fully realize the thoughts outlined in the story until the end of her life. Each moment of her life contributes to a single timeless perception of the trajectory of her life, once she thinks in the alien language. But the fact that her consciousness is an emergent illusion wouldn't bother her, just as the (different) emergent illusions that characterize our consciousness don't bother us. And while this stretches the believability of the Sapir Whorf hypothesis to a wild extreme, there is well documented neuroscience demonstrating that our perception of time is full of illusions and inconsistencies, forced on us by quirks of processing in our brain (see, e.g., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866156/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866156/)).

  In short, Arrival isn't "just another time travel story", but rather the consequence of taking an extremely foundational, standard, influential, yet counterintuitive view of physics, and writing a story simply asking "what would it take to truly embrace this as a way of thought?"

  The story is thus \*completely\* within mainstream physics, and isn't trying to say anything controversial about predetermination; but it is outside mainstream cognitive science/linguistics, and that is what makes it interesting.

  Reality *is* predetermined. We only perceive randomization because we are unable to calculate all effective factors. 

  A perfect measurement of reality would *be* reality, because all effects are real, measurable, and caused by previous effects, all the way back to the beginning of the universe.
  ```

  - u/lolbifrons:
    ```
    Are we talking IRL?  Because the part of real life that throws a wrench in that is that we only perceive part of the quantum superposition we‚Äôre always in, and which part we experience perceiving is subjectively random.  

    It can‚Äôt depend on past configurations in principle because those past configurations also produced another ‚Äúus‚Äù that are experiencing each other everett branch, and they could in principle be asking themselves the same questions and remember the exact same past.

    The universe isn‚Äôt random; every branch happens exactly as previous conditions dictated.  It‚Äôs a trick of our limited perception - our ability to only subjectively experience one branch exclusively - that creates subjective randomness, but even still, the particular world we see, experience and have access to is determined subjectively by a roll of the dice and the born rule.

    - u/bloodfist:

      Right. The term is "hidden variables" or more broadly the question of whether the universe is deterministic. At the macro scale, it appears to be deterministic, but at the quantum scale, everything is non-deterministic and governed by probability. Of course this is one of the biggest questions in physics and philosophy, so there is room for that to be wrong, but all the data points to a non-deterministic universe.

        I mean if you subscribe to manyworlds (*cough* as you should) you can go up a level and get back to a deterministic structure.  The problem is, we don‚Äôt experience the world on that level.

        It‚Äôs like a choose your own adventure book, except at every crossroads you assign a probability to take each path proportional to the square of how many pages will be down that path, and then you roll some dice to pick.

        The story you experience seems pretty random, but nothing about the book ever changes.  It‚Äôs prewritten and fixed.  Immutable.  Except what page _you_ are on.

        As far as we‚Äôre concerned, any decoherence event is a source of true randomness.  But really it‚Äôs an illusion.

        The universe isn't random, but we are.  \*holds up spork\*

          It sounds less like a book and more like a search space. An infinite search space given structure by an equation or collection of equations (universal laws). Are you saying every possibility in that infinite search space *actually* exists somewhere?

          >I mean if you subscribe to manyworlds (cough as you should)

          Why? Isn't that merely one of many different possible quantum models?

          Can you recommenced some good books or resources on quantum stuff? I gave up on that subject years ago when I kept on running into that question, "Isn't that merely one of many different possible quantum models?", but maybe I should get back into it.

            Occam's razor.  It explains at least as many observed phenomena as any other hypothesized model with at most as many axioms.

            >Can you recommenced some good books or resources on quantum stuff?

            Honestly you might laugh, but unless you're working on your phd in math I'd start with [the QP Sequence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hc9Eg6erp6hk9bWhn/the-quantum-physics-sequence).

            The absolute best book I have ever read for explaining what superposition really means and how quantum mechanics is really about information instead of physics is [Q for Quantum](https://www.amazon.com/Q-Quantum-Terry-Rudolph-ebook/dp/B074DYJTKN/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544560541&sr=8-1&keywords=q+is+for+quantum).

            It's the most well-explained introduction to quantum mechanics that I have ever heard of and it's simple enough that middle-schoolers could be reasonably expected to understand it. It doesn't even use any mathematical concepts beyond arithmetic and logic, but it makes for a great foundation for understanding the math in related quantum concepts if you chose to read beyond this book.

            It won't explain everything, but it really helps to make a lot of aspects of quantum mechanics intuitive.

        According to Stephen Wolfram, the "laws" we observe are emergent  phenomena from underlying, possibly deterministic or possibly probabilistic, processes that are akin to cellular automata. Matter and energy changes in the "grid" according to what matter and energy constitute its "neighbors", and in the aggregate this is observable as F=ma, b=1/d^2, etc etc.

        Unfortunately it appears to be unfalsifiable, however it is interesting.
