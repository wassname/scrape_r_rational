## Pyrebound Sixteen (A Champion in Battle) Parts 1-3

### Post:

I've got three updates in a row here, Wales style, but the first was posted more than a month ago; I simply took a break from social media use for (Orthodox) Lent.

PB has been updating quite irregularly for some time, as I had to focus more of my energy on school.  I hope to get back to a more frequent update schedule (if not quite the weekly I managed at first) for the final seven updates.  The story has grown immensely in the telling, but I now feel, oh, 90% certain that 17.5 will be the final post.

If you have no idea what PB is (which would be understandable) it's about 230K words right now, and it's about a young man's struggle to survive after he gets mixed up in the political intrigues of a magical theocracy based loosely on ancient Mesopotamia.  [Give it a shot](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/) if you like deep worldbuilding and jacked-up structural incentives and suchlike.

As ever, thanks to everybody who stuck around for the last two years, and for reading, commenting, what-have-you.

  I can recommend this; it has interesting systems and characters that feel distinct from most webfic I've read (and I've read a lot). I did kinda fall off it, but that was in no way due to the quality of the story; as I said, a lot of webfic. Sometimes I lose track of one and then when I try to pick it up I forget where everything is.

  Kind of excited to see it posted again, actually; I'll probably give it a full reread to catch up at some point in the future.

    Thanks for the testimonial, and I hope you enjoy where the story went in your absence.
