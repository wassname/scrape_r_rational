## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Animation exclusive rec post. 

  I'm loving the rise of western animation aimed at adults over the past few years. The possibilities are endless with animation in a way that just isn't possible with live action, and the only thing holding it back is the stigma that animation==for children.


  All are the recs here are considered good to great by me, the plusses are just expressing the strength of my recommendation, not how good I think it is, necessarily.

  --------

  #[Captain Laserhawk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cqWBOVszYo)     
  **Genre**: Animation, Scifi, Cyberpunk, parody, action    
  **Rec**: +++     
  **Plot**: In an alternate history dystopian 1992 US, a fugitive supersoldier and other inmates get Suicide Squad'd.         
  **Thoughts**: A pastiche spinoff tv show of a pastiche spinoff expansion of a videogame(far cry 3). It's fast, it's fun, it doesn't take itself seriously.    

  ---------

  #[Pantheon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTgYeETwgKQ)     
  **Genre**: Animation, Scifi, near future, AI, thriller    
  **Rec**: +++     
  **Plot**: A bullied girl discovers her father had his consciousness digitally uploaded before his death, and has become an UI, Uploaded intelligence, the new frontier of human existence.          
  **Thoughts**: This show feels a bit outdated at first, given the current AI zeitgeist. The characters go on about how AIs are pie in the sky wishful thinking and actually the real promising technology is actually UI! Specifically, taking a human genius and giving it the computational capability of a supercomputer! There are also some inconsistent portrayals of the capabilities of such an UI, which shifted according to the needs of the plot. Despite those issues I found the writing to be overall smart and engaging. I especially liked the Steve Jobs(yes, really) >!reincarnation!< subplot.    

  #[Scavenger's Reign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWQH8cMpWTU)
  **Genre**: Animation, Scifi, survival, surreal, ecology      
  **Rec**: ++         
  **Plot**: The crew of a ship who crashlanded on an alien planet must learn to survive and coexist with the strange flora and fauna.      
  **Thoughts**: Style over substance? The visuals are gorgeous and extremely creative, worth the price of admission by themselves. The story... I tend to get caught up in small foundational details of setting and character. In this case my annoyance was that so much of the cool visual storytelling was the survivors of the crash using extremely niche and involved methods to explore the awesome native flora and fauna of the planet. The problem is that they only been there for a handful of months, so how the hell they could have found that out in that time? E.g. the opening scene is a guy nonchalantly crawling around inside the bowels of a huge grazing creature in order to extract 2 orbs. He then pulls expertly on an organ in order to get puked out, neither worse for the wear. The orbs are bio-luminescent light sources that they use as lanterns. A few minutes later he and his companion scrounge around in a creek looking for a creature that they affix to their nose and mouth as a breathing filter mask to survive noxious mushroom spores. As cool as those scenes are visually, the question remains: how the hell did figure that shit out? Maybe its silly to fixate on that kind of thing, and I agree, but it's not a small part of the show. The show is still coming out, so it's possible this is explained in the later episodes. Perhaps something to with the psychic kodama-ghiblis helping humans how to survive?

  --------       

  #[PLUTO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ez8lm9I26Y)
  **Genre**: Anime, Scifi, AI, murder mystery, drama    
  **Rec**: +        
  **Plot**: In a future rampant with AI/androids/robots(it uses the terms kind of interchangeably, to my distaste), an android detective investigates the death of a famous robot.    
  **Thoughts**: Reminds me a bit of Ghost in the Shell in terms of themes, though tone is substantially different and pace is way slower. My problem, as is often the case, is that the setting doesn't make much sense, e.g.: Worker robots(not androids) such as maids being married and paid wages and having their own apartments. What's the point of a creating a menial worker robot capable of complex emotions to the point of mimicking the needs and wants of a human? How much more pointless and wasteful than a commuting menial laborer robot can you get?! That kind of thing distracted me enough I wasn't able to enjoy the show to its full potential. It's still pretty good.

    I'm in awe that Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon exists and has come so far. I mean, it was literally made as a meme/joke DLC because some people thought it would be kickass, and now there's an actual animated series? Absolutely incredible.  

    This is the type of shit that make me proud to be a human: that we've reached a level where we can just make stuff like this.

  Recs:

  # [Prince of Cats](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13532173-prince-of-cats)

  **5/5. Comic book.**

  "Romeo & Juliet but set in the modern world" except featuring samurai-style action and an inner city gang war. Also, set in Tybalt's perspective, which is unusual. Gorgeous art, and even better dialogue. This book neither renounces shakespeare nor allows itself to be bound by his original.

  # [John Scalzi](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4763.John_Scalzi)

  **3.5-4.5 stars. Sci-fi Author**

  This author has a penchant for incredibly addictive little sci-fi novels with clever premises and consistently tight execution. He tends to use the same plot and the same characters every single time even though he changes the names and the setting... but it's a good plot, and they're good characters, so I can't complain too much. Airplane fiction in the style of *Ready Player One*. Pick up one of his books at the duty-free shop before your flight, and you'll be finished with it by the time the plane touches down. In particular, I ended up reading four of his novels in the span of about a week:

  * [Starter Villain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61885029-starter-villain) (A broke divorcee inherits his uncle's supervillain enterprise.)
  * [The Kaiju Preservation Society](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693406-the-kaiju-preservation-society). (Exactly what it says on the tin.)
  * [Fuzzy Nation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9647532-fuzzy-nation) (Rehash of a famous 1960's sci fi novel about saving a debatably-intellegent alien race from rapacious capitalists.)
  * [Redshirts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13055592-redshirts) (You could be forgiven for thinking this is a satire of star trek, but it surprises you by becoming contemplative metafiction. Of Scalzi's novels, this one was my favorite.)

  # [Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34324534-against-the-grain)

  **4 stars. Nonfiction.**

  Lays out some very convincing (though not totally unassailable) arguments about why early peoples would have avoided or been compelled to adopt agricultural practices. Fair warning: may convert you to anarchoprimitivism.

  # [Cryptonomicon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816.Cryptonomicon)

  **4 stars. Sci-fi, historical fiction.**

  This one's actually sort of an anti-rec. If you're also the kind of person to enjoy a cryptography textbook interleaved with historical fiction about ww2 interleaved with Neal Stephenson inventing cryptocurrency, you'll enjoy Cryptonomicon. But if you're not similarly brain damaged, this book is 300,000 words of mostly exposition you'd be better off not reading.

  Don't read this book just because you liked Anathem. It's not the same thing.
  ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    I'll rerec Cryptonomicon. It's pretty digressive but a great book. If you read it with a 2023 mindset you'll get less out of it, it comes out of the cryptoanarchist philosophy of the early 2000s. (Yes, I know the book is 1999) I, personally, feel like we could use some more of the utopianism of those early days, even if it's difficult to access in our current tech dystopia. Try to read it with an eye to the history of ideas and you'll get more out of it. There's definitely some dated stuff. (Not sure if the weird part when the MC goes through a divorce with an academic who critically deconstructs his beard is prescient or dated.)

    I like the part where the MC has dental issues. It has nothing to do with anything but was weirdly engaging. If you're willing to wander all over the place I do think it's a solid novel.

    I'll very softly derec Scalzi. He just feels smarmy and obvious, and his object-level ability to write is pretty low. (Admittedly that doesn't stop me if I like the ideas.)

    Here's a first sentence from one of his most famous books, *Redshirts*, which kind of speaks for itself.

    > From the top of the large boulder he sat on, Ensign Tom Davis looked across the expanse of the cave, toward Captain Lucius Abernathy, Science Officer Q’eeng and Chief Engineer Paul West perched on a second, larger boulder, and thought, Well, this sucks.

    I did read *Redshirts* and it's fine, just think Scalzi is probably somewhat overrated.
    ```

    - u/JudyKateR:
      ```
      I'll echo the anti-recommendation for Scalzi, and rather than piling onto the people providing prose-level examples to support their anti-rec, I think there's a certain context that may be essential to understand when talking about his work specifically.  There is a bit of a "halo effect" that surrounds certain authors, a certain amount celebrity that confers upon them a certain amount of "unearned trust" from tastemakers. (Or more charitably, "trust earned from things other than the content of their writing.")

      For example, one of the most popular fantasy book reviewers on YouTube recently started self-publishing fantasy novels.  And because he is a huge part of the community of people on YouTube who talk about fantasy novels, there are a lot of other YouTubers who decided to read and review his book -- even if you're not his friend, it might make sense to do this for cynical reasons, so that when people go to YouTube and type "[name of popular booktuber] book review" into the search bar, your review of his book has a chance of coming up.

      The general consensus is that this new book is "pretty good for a debut author," and there is a sense in which I do an internal mental calculation as look at all of the reviews, and say, "Alright, if the people who occasionally collaborate with this guy say his book is a 3.5/5, the true rating is probably closer to a 3, or maybe a 2.5."  Just as a review from a family member has to be taken with a grain of salt, so too for everyone else in the same clique of fantasy Booktubers.

      Now, to be clear, I don't think that these people are *lying* about their enjoyment of the book -- I don't think that their own mental calculation where the say "Okay, this book is only a 3/5, but I have to add 0.5 or 1 points because it was written by my friend."  Rather, there is a sense in which, when they read, they do so offering a greater level of charity.  There are certain points at which you might read a book, encounter an apparent contradiction, and be left to think either "That seems dumb, why would the author do that?" or "That seems interesting, I wonder if that will pay off later."  This will color your impression of the entire book as you read it, *regardless of whether that thing actually pays off.*  

      When you are reviewing a book, all you have to go on is your own subjective experience, and part of that subjective experience includes the warm fuzzy feelings you get from thinking "omg, I'm reading a book from my favorite YouTuber! I love how the voice of the main character is just like how he talks on the channel!"  (I don't think that it's the reviewer's job to try and calculate the delta and then subtract that; I think it's more appropriate for the reviewer to make the disclosures that would allow the reader to do that for themselves, which is exactly what I'm doing when I see "Ah, this book from a popular Booktuber seems to be rated at around a 3.5/5 by other Booktubers, so I should adjust that downward."

      So, with that preamble out of the way, John Scalzi.

      Redshirts won the Hugo Award for best novel in 2013.  To anyone who has only read Redshirts, I can imagine this being quite surprising, but it makes slightly more sense when you realize that from 2010-2013, John Scalzi was the president of SFWA (Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America).  Now, to be clear, Worldcon (which gives out the Hugo Award) is institutionally independent from SFWA (which gives out the Nebula award), but I'm not making a claim that John Scalzi won the award due to institutional corruption; rather, it is the halo effect. If you're one of the people casting a vote for who should win the Hugo, you likely know who John Scalzi is.

      The fact that John Scalzi is appreciated for his non-book contributions is illustrated particularly well by SFWA themselves: here is [an exit interview with John Scalzi](https://www.sfwa.org/2013/07/16/an-exit-interview-with-john-scalzi/), published by SFWA after he stepped down as SFWA president in summer of 2013.  This is how the piece begins:

      >This June, John Scalzi stepped down as SFWA President. He took office in 2010—twelve years after beginning his wildly successful blog, *Whatever*, and five years after he published his first novel.

      It's not lost on me that the introduction describes 2010 Scalzi as *first* as a blogger of 12 years, and *then* as an author of 5 years.   In the same way that we now have book YouTubers cum author, John Scalzi is the 00's version of this, a book blogger cum author.  And just as a lot of the enthusiasm for a novel by a popular YouTuber is based on things other than the content of the fantasy novels that he writes...

      None of this is to say that John Scalzi is a bad or substandard author.  It's difficult to win awards without clearing a certain competence threshold. But I think knowing who John Scalzi is might help some people to reconcile how it is that Scalzi, such as he is, keeps getting nominated for awards.

    Nice recommendations. 

    Scalzi's skill is definitely in the tight execution of an addictive premise. Have you read his *Old Man's War* series? 

    In the reviews of *Against the Grain* it gets some outstanding critical reviews for... something? Is it politics or just "opposition-scientist-flak"? What's your take?
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      > Have you read his Old Man's War series?

      Nope. I got the "serious sci fi" vibe from it, and right now I'm on a kick of reading more lightweight novels. (not "light" novels, just "lightweight.")

      > In the reviews of Against the Grain it gets some outstanding critical reviews for... something? Is it politics or just "opposition-scientist-flak"? What's your take?

      I read it after reading [seeing like a state](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20186.Seeing_Like_a_State?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=A93pAQ17cw&rank=1) and it's fundamentally the same type of economic history-- an attempt to explain how the lifestyles of people[s] arise from individuals taking narrow steps to benefit themselves against environmental conditions. It leads you to deeply anarchist conclusions without ever actually having to make an ideological argument.

      In brief, it says:

      1. people respond to incentives
      1. they aren't stupid
      1. we spent a lot of historical time with all the prerequisites for settled agricultural civilization
      1. we spend only a small portion of historical time doing settled agricultural civilization
      1. ... so maybe settled agriculture isn't as great as the elite-biased histories of settled agricultural states claim
      1. ... so maybe what looked like 'state collapse' was really *beneficial* to the people who weren't literate history-writing urbanites.

      point (5) I thought was argued for pretty convincingly. But I don't think the author adequately addressed counterarguments against point (6)
      ```

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        Ahh, it's the "return to monke" school of thought. 

        I've always found that while point 5 is rather easy to sell because how much abject suffering peasant farmers had to deal with historically, my "shooting from the hip" counterargument against 6 would be that social hierarchies and "rule of law" developed explicitly as a countermeasure against the consequences of 'state collapse'. Without these systems someone inevitably gets the smart idea that they don't need to laboriously farm if they can just pillage instead, and while this is bad for the "history-writing urbanites", the farmers who get put to the sword and have their fields raised probably took the brunt of the blow before the proverbial or literal castle walls with the history-writers inside got assailed. 

        Still, sounds interesting. I'll give it a read.
        ```

        - u/DRMacIver:
          ```
          >Ahh, it's the "return to monke" school of thought.

          FWIW I don't think Scott is actually in favour of return to monke. If you look at e.g. Two Cheers for Anarchism where he's more explicit about his politics it's very comfortably middle class Anarchism-lite rather than any real "smash the system!" type positions.

          I think what his academic books offer is a good (though not perfect) description of some of the downsides of technology and states that are useful even if you think technology and states are good, and should be taken as more descriptive than normative.

          Also "Against the Grain" is by far the most readable of his research books IMO. All the others are good too (well, almost all of them. I've read most of them and have a few that I've stalled on or not got around to) but they tend to be very detail heavy. The details are interesting, but if you're not interested in the details the books will often be a slog.

  For any Worm fans, I came across these two series that I quite like. They're dead/on hiatus unfortunately, but still a fun read:

  ***Goblin Queen* by biigoh**

  Worm x Exalted

  Taylor gets double powers; one set from QA (bug control) and another from from some exiled god thing that gives her, among other powers, "narrative control."

  Well-written, but there are minor typos/grammatical mistakes. I like the author’s prose, especially when Taylor is narrating her own life. It’s definitely distinct.

  https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/goblin-queen-worm-exalted-crosspost.448/

  ***Go Gently* by Shana the Short**

  Welcome to Night Vale x Worm

  AU where Danny triggers after a suicide attempt. Danny being a hero causes canon to go off the rails; Danny has to move to an apartment in the Asian part of town after accidentally destroying their home, Taylor and Emma are still friends, Sophia joins them, Emma triggers and becomes a ward with Sophia, Lung is Taylor’s neighbour, and so on.

  Really well-written. I like the radio show Taylor does. I really wish there was more of it, and people’s reaction to it.

  CW: >!Suicide Attempt!<  
  
  Light on Shattered Water by G. Howell is kinda sci-fi (I guess) with a romance subplot. It's long, and due to its size I can attest to the fact that it takes a while to build up steam (heh). So basically a guy gets isekaied to a world with bobcat people called Rris. And he is stuck there in a place just beginning its own Industrial Revolution. And it asks the question: how would you feel if everyone considered you to be some freakish animal? How isolated and alone you would be.  
  
  And he's basically being used as a repository since his world (our world) is so advanced comparatively (he brought his laptop with all kinds of useful info on it with him). So eventually he has a female companion/minder who helps him maintain his grip on sanity since he's basically a bird in a gilded cage, and it leads to something so strange and I can't decide whether it's hilarious or not. He>! literally introduces her species to the orgasm!< And that was just so amazing. It's ridiculous and yet also makes sense given their biology and being descended from bobcats or lynxes or whatever. And I've been left wondering just how genuine her feelings are. But I doubt they would've banged so much if she didn't like him on some level. Humans are very ugly to their bobcat eyes.  
  
  And that's something else that's interesting. You can tell that the author really took time to consider rationally how their evolutionary history would affect their physiology and psychology. They're terrible swimmers because of their fur and muscle density, and since their eyes are different (they can't perceive some colors we can) their paintings look subtly wrong to the human eye. Same thing goes for their music. They don't have a word for marriage. When they mate (they have a mating season) they have their cubs, maybe stay together for a few years, and move on.  
  
  Also it goes into a lot of detail on creating new technologies like more efficient steam engines and looms and stuff (I'm not an engineer so this went over my head), so if you're into that kind of technological uplift (and knowing this sub that's likely) then boy is this a story for you! The sex scenes are steamy and atmospheric. Also, while Kindle Unlimited gets shat on for being an Amazon monopoly on self-publishing, without it there's no way in hell that we would get stories like this. No publishing house would touch this in a million years. So yeah that's my semi-review/endorsement (I'm about 75% of the way through. No clue if there's a happy ending).

        I've got some adjacent stuff. 

        [Snekguy](https://snekguy.com/) does a lot of scifi furry/scaly stuff, and it tends to be written pretty well. Usually a 2.5 to 3.5 on the furry scale, and usually not isekai. His Pinwheel series has some volumes that are kinda uplift-y. Though don't expect uplift to be the main theme. 

        [The Mook Maker](https://www.scribblehub.com/series/530450/the-mook-maker/) is an isekai where the protagonist gets the power to summon an infinitely regenerating (though limited in number) horde of bloodthirsty furries that venerate him. He's stranded in a place where he doesn't understand the culture or language, and the only tool he has at his disposal is a hammer. It's an interesting mix of erotica with fridge and on-screen horror.

    Eh. I enjoyed the premise as well, but the MC is a massive Idiot with skin like wet tissue paper, both literally and metaphorically. Or maybe he's just whiny. Every time he gets scratched, the narration makes it sound like he's been ripped up by a chainsaw. And he refuses to acknowledge that the indigenous people have a non-human psychology, so he keeps wallowing in  self pity every time his crush/love interest acts in a way he doesn't like.
    The orgasm thing seemed massively cringe, not to mention stupid, to me. As does the fact that he gets suicidally depressed if he doesn't get his dick wet often enough.

      Well yeah everybody is walking around with retractable knives on their hands.

      >And he refuses to acknowledge that the indigenous people have a non-human psychology, so he keeps wallowing in self pity every time his crush/love interest acts in a way he doesn't like

      He acknowledges this later on. He's in the habit of anthropomorphizing them when his guard is down because he's only ever been exposed to humans before, and I think the inability of your love interest to ever reciprocate your love would be quite devastating tbh. 

      >The orgasm thing seemed massively cringe, not to mention stupid, to me. As does the fact that he gets suicidally depressed if he doesn't get his dick wet often enough.

      Different strokes (heh). I learned to embrace the weird, and the taking into account of different biology turned it from cringe to kinda amusing to me (as well as WILD lmao). Also you characterizing it as "suicidally depressed" doesn't really make sense to me? It isn't dependent on whether he gets laid or not - they do things other than boning, and it's obvious that he wants something more than sex. If he wanted to "get his dick wet" he could hit up interested nobility at a party. 

      Honestly at the beginning I thought the way the emotions were portrayed was a bit much, but does it make sense given that he's in another world with people who can never fully understand him? Yeah I think so. And a massive idiot? I think he's more kinda gullible and vulnerable - he's in a new place and there are people looking to take advantage of him for being a fish out of water.

    I remember reading this years ago. I honestly found it fascinating, especially the depiction of the MC having to learn a brand new language to communicate. The struggle of learning a new language can be tricky to portray well in written media, but I thought the author pulled it off.

    Another thing that stuck with me was how the Rris didn't really do pair bonding, so they didn't really feel love like a human would. It's subtle at first, since they're depicted as being similar to us in may ways. They still had literature, music, and culture, just none of it was about romance. 

    It made me pay attention to what our own media is like in real life, and how so many of our songs seem to be about falling in love, being in love, falling out of love... But then there's this plausible civilization being depicted that *just doesn't have that*, and the Rris are just fine being that way. There are plenty of people in real life who are aromantic, and I found the depiction of an entire civilization like that to be really interesting.

    The story changed the way I look at the world, even if only a little, which is more than I can say about a lot of stuff out there.

  Are there any fanfics or stories-in-general out there with a socialist or left wing bent? I've been reading the story "The Summoned Hero Is A Historical Materialist??" and enjoying it a lot. I've already read "It Starts With One", the Worm-AU billionaire death simulator, and the unfinished and quite crack-y "Abolish Private Property" Naruto fic (which led me onto "Sanitize", which is also very good). If anyone has anything like that that would be much appreciated.  



  Otherwise, in general I like stories which take the premise of their setting and run it to its logical conclusion, or do something interesting with the concept. Recently I read this one from Inception, where the wife was right: the movie was Decaprio's dream the whole time, and his wife and daughter are waiting for him to wake up ("A Dream You Dream Together is Reality" by lady\_ragnell on ao3).   


  I'm finding it hard to say exactly what I'm looking for. Stories with a rich exploration of worldbuilding implications? Not just logical ones, but moral ones too. There are a few Narnia fics I like which involve Jadis and Tash or the Problem of Susan for example. Or LotR fics where Sauron and/or Orcs aren't evil on an essential level (E.g. Saruman of Many Devices).   


  I've read everything by Nostalgebraist, Benedict\_SC, Alexander Wales (except worth a candle, as I didn't enjoy the romance). I've read HP & the Natural 20, HG & the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation, Applied Cultural Anthropology, Luminosity, and Peter Watt's "The Things" (as well as everything else he's written). Honestly I wish I could just list everything I have read and then request a list of everything I haven't that's still worth reading.  


  Anyway, if you have any weird & interesting stories/fanfics that fit into the vague categories I've described, please recommend them to me. Even and especially if it's an original work or from a fandom which is obscure (by fanfiction standards).   


  Please **don't** recommend anything from the following fandoms:  


  * MLP
  * Youjo Senki
  * Marvel/Avengers/DC
  * that one where all of the anime girls are warships
  * RWBY

      lol yes I have seen that. IMO from what I remember that's only slightly better than "Harry Potter Becomes a Communist" though. Not really socialist, more making fun of (and having fun with) the trappings of socialism. "Abolish Private Property" is similar, but only half-crack, so it doesn't fall to that level.

    Not sure if you like quests, but [Attempting to Fulfill the Plan MNKh Edition](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/attempting-to-fulfill-the-plan-mnkh-edition.73217/) is pretty good.

    Main character is the new head of the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy, trying to not get purged by Stalin and also trying to meet the 5 year economic plan goals. As the story is player-led, AU Soviet Union in the story might actually have the chance of achieving Communism.

      There is another very similar ongoing quest titled "That Time I Became A Dictator Of A Small Asian Communist Nation" that you might also enjoy if you liked the first quest. It is a very amusing story that also has a serious plot and excellent worldbuilding.  I particularly enjoyed the occasional snippets showing the history of Guangchou prior to the start of the quest.

      The quest has now come to present an entire alternate timeline centered on the development of Guangchou (The Most Glorious Democratic People's Republic of Guangchou, Light of All Nations, Defender of Humanity, and Paradise on Earth) disrupting the normal course of events.

    Can these be published books?

    There's a rich tradition of socialist and communist utopian fiction. Two I would recommend would be [News From Nowhere](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261) by  William Morris and [The Iron Heel](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1164) by Jack London. The first one is a talky one where the protagonist cutout falls asleep and wakes up in a land where people have a very different approach to labor and the second is a more action-oritented story of socialist Resistance to fascism and stuff. If you've read *Call of the Wild* you know London does kind of write a page-turner, and he was a card-carrying socialist. For something slightly weirder you could try [Looking Backward](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624) by Bellamy, which led to a lot of social movement after it was published in the late 19th / early 20th century.

    The game Disco Elesium was written by socialists, though in the tradition of Orwell they're pretty self-critical and even-handed. Just a superlative game as well.

    Not quite what you're asking for, but Leonard Richardson's "Constellation Games" contains a pretty compelling depiction of post-scarcity anarchy IMO.

    You might like to check out "Pedagogical Poem" by Anton Makarenko, if you can get hold of it, though I can't vouch for the readability of the English translation; it's super upbeat on socialism while still being grounded in reality (as opposed to the best of late Soviet era writing which tends to the incredibly depressing for obvious reasons)

    The [Fall Revolution](https://www.goodreads.com/series/56651-the-fall-revolution) series by Ken Macleod is pretty great Sci-Fi with an explicitly leftist bent. I wrote a [pretty confused summary](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/myyble/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gw19pwx/) of it like two years ago here on this subreddit

    [Commonweal series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/242525-commonweal) by Graydon Saunders has a very socialist bent. However, it's a bit of a hard read. The author has a very particular and sparse style with absolutely no repetition. 

    I'm guessing you've already read the Culture series and Ursula Le Guin? If not, those two are really popular and up there in the greatest of all time lists.

      Ah thank you, this looks interesting. Unfortunately yes, I've read the Culture series and Ursula Le Guin's books. My dad's grandmother once told him the best part of growing old is that you get to read all your favourite books again for the first time.

        Another person to look into would be China Mieville, who is also a real life socialist. If you haven't already that is.
        ```

        - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
          ```
          China Mieville, Eric Flint, Judith Merril and Steven Brust are/were Trotskyists. Ken MacLeod is a [Trotskyist-turned-Communist-turned libertarian-turned Labourite](http://www.bigecho.org/ken-macleod). The Futurians were, for the most part, socialists-Communists-Trotskyists, but moved to the center in later years -- see Knight's, Merril's and Pohl's accounts. Heinlein was a socialist in the 1930s. Pournelle was briefly a Communist in the 1950s.

          How much of it affects/affected their SF depends on the author. On the one hand, MacLeod's ideological wanderings certainly affected at least some of his books directly. On the other hand, Brust has said that his ideology had an abiding impact on his writing (I don't have a link ready, but it was in a video recording on YouTube some years ago), but I wouldn't say it's immediately obvious when you read most of his books.

            Tony Blair was a Trotskyist. From my experience of British politics, you should never trust them. Though I do enjoy China Melville. Also, as an aside, I really appreciate your lists. Very helpful resource.
            ```

            - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:

              Glad to hear you find my lists useful! :-)

              Re: Tony Blair, it's my understanding that he briefly considered himself a Trotskyist when he was in college. It reminds me of how Isaac Asimov briefly called himself a "communist" while hanging out with the Futurians at the ripe old age of 19 :-)

              Re: China Mieville, I skimmed his attempt at a non-fiction history of the Russian revolution a while back. It's well written, as you would expect of Mieville, but it has more than its fair share of mistakes. Unfortunately, it's an all too common phenomenon: great revolutions -- English, American, French, Russian, etc -- attract authors and readers alike, but doing them justice is a lot harder than it seems.
