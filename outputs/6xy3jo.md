  Bravo üëè

  A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.

  I was wondering who's Pov we would get but Malicia's was pretty low on my list, and the fact that I absolutely love this one even more that cat's is a pleasant feeling.

  Easily one of the best chapters, if a bonus. I'd love to see more chapters from Malicia's perspective in the future, as well as the rest of the Calamities. It's fun watching Catherine grow into her Name, but there's always something satisfying about watching people with decades of experience in the field use their abilities to the fullest.

  Does this mean the work is finished and I can start reading it?

    Far from it lol

    No, this is closure to a sub plot
    ```

- u/Nihilvin:
  ```
  I think Akua has something similar to what the Dead King used to turn his people undead, except on a far smaller scale, confined to one city. A necromantic circle of sorts. It would explain why Akua's soldiers turn undead after being struck down. It also makes me wonder if that was the rune Apprentice saw, not a rune for the flying fortress like it seemed at the start. If so, it could raise some speculation about the Name he would have transited into.

  ```
  Fascinating bit of news in there:
  Malice has 'hooks' into all Legion officers Legate or above.

  I'm sure that's going to be an important factor in Book 5 or 6...

    Just the Wasteland I think.
