  Solace is incredible. You lost me on Joon, though. Mr pot-head?
  ```

  - u/ChefBoyarE:
    ```
    The pot is full of juniper (the plant).
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Yeah, I saw that. It's smaller than the pot, which is a crime on its own :P

      I think if there was something about 'smith' that could work for me, otherwise meh, too many interpretations.

        Joon is a fresh baby cutting with plenty of space to grow. He was a last minute addition haha
        ```

  - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
    ```
    I think it's a juniper plant.
    ```

  Worm the Candle.

  Oorang is the best one, although of course the DM is pitch-perfect. Nice!

    ```
    You wouldn't believe how much time it took for us to glue all those darn leaves on, thanks!

    As to the DM, I'm glad you liked it! I was feeling unsure since I took some artistic liberties (grey hoodie instead of a dark grey hoodie, a die instead of just text, and my natural eye color instead of blue).

      ```
      You didn't even bother to replace your eyes!? Nevermind, this is low-effort garbage.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Hierophant agrees. Eyes or GTFO.
        ```

        - u/MuonManLaserJab:
          ```
          GTFO: Gouge Those Fuckers Out!
          ```

      - u/sparr:
        ```
        I once saw someone cosplaying rose mcgowan's character from grindhouse, but she was missing the wrong leg. I said nothing.
        ```

- u/GlueBoy:
  ```
  I recognize Solace and Canary. Who's the lazy guy supposed to be?

  Edit: also, cosplaying a character in a relatively obscure webserial must give the ultimate geek cred at one of these things.

    ```
    The DM. (The album is labelled.)
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      Not on mobile, I guess.
      ```

- u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
  ```
  Gat dang, that Solace looks like it took a lot of work. Nice job!
  ```

- u/KiwiWillRockYou:
  ```
  Itâ€™s not easy being green...
  ```

- u/Akiryx:
  ```
  DM looks like Miles Luna from RT
  ```

- u/Kuratius:
  ```
  One was effort, one was ingenuity, and I'm not going to comment on the the other two.
  ```
