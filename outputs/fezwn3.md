  I considered titling this chapter 'Grief', but we aren't there yet.  This is the initial shock.  Grief comes later, and it's not a momentary thing that could fit into one chapter, so no single chapter deserves the name.

    ```
    So call the first arc of the story Grief instead of Arrival?
    ```

      Could do, but it's more about his arrival in the new world and how he adapts.  His grief is a result of that but not the core premise.

  I see what you're doing here and I approve. Magically-assisted learning can still be satisfying when it's addressed as requiring attention and effort. Bonus points for canine psychology.

  More chapters? So soon? I cant...believe it!

  Pretty good so far, I am bit miffed at how fast he went from dog think to advanced reasoning, but I suppose its necessary for the story to get going, same for random translation, maybe could have been done by pantomime between dog and Spear guy, just point and woof at things.
  Wonder if they will save some of the meat, maybe not waste it or leave it to feed wolves and other foresty animals.

    There's no translation going on, Athos simply learned a couple of words and now notices them when they're spoken.  Don't worry, there will be plenty of pantomime going on.  

    As to the horse meat...the caravan is in quite a hurry, as evidenced by the fact that they're traveling after sunset.  (Recall that Athos arrived to find himself under a very bright full moon.)  They're going to deal with their dead but they're not going to spend time doing anything with the horses.  OTOH, Athos is hungry and is going to eat a bunch of the dead horseflesh before they move on.

  Anyone want to do guesses on where the doggos power came from? My best guess is that the individual who best represents their species gets upgraded to an ideal of their species, and one of those gets upgraded again. Now, there are probably dogs in the world since there are wolves, but I posit that earth breeds are distinct enough to count for the system. 

  So our MC is the most rotty-mix pup to ever rotty-mix in the new world, and the system recognizes that. Thoughts?
