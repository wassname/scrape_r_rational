  I guess this means Gohan will probably be the winner of the fight, since Goku will probably land first.

  As for Red, well there really wasn't much chance of his story ending any other way.  If he wasn't murdered by a pissed off underling now, it would have happened eventually.

    ```
    He was too much of a moron to live in canon already. I just sped up things a bit.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      But in your story, how did such a moron get to that position in the first place? And why did it take a complicated conspiracy plus an assassination at a coincidentally opportune moment to depose him?
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        I didn't write this yet, might include it later, but my personal canon is that he inherited the position. The Red Ribbon is a private organisation, and Red's father was actually competent, but then he died and the thing changed hands and simply kept running smoothly thanks to competent aides like Black. 

        In the original, Red gets killed by Black once Goku causes a big enough crisis. I don't think normally someone would risk doing something like that without a very big reason. Remember, the Red Ribbon isn't outright *illegal* in my version, though they may occasionally do illegal things under the table. But it must be noticed that here the Instruments have been brewing discontent for quite a while, and the Ribbon's decline only made it worse for them, and pushed people to their cause. I'll probably address this in a few chapters from now, as the Red Ribbon will be a very important part of the next arc.

        Also, about morons getting in positions of power... *gestures in the vague direction of the current real life Commander in Chief of the world's most powerful army*
        ```

          But that guy was elected. And he is apparently pretty good both at appeasing rich people and oligarchs and at fanning passion in a certain type of people.

          But if Red Ribbon is a legal corporation with a single majority shareholder who voted himself in as CEO and "Commander Red" then I guess that works. Though now I am curious how his father managed to build all that without investors.
          ```

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            I mean, even with a board, the key issue is how much does the position *matter* in practice, especially when the rest of the staff manages to cover for Red's incompetence. Anyway, I'll try to see if I can put some more backstory for the RR in there at some point. It's something interesting to think about.
            ```

            - u/Bowbreaker:
              ```
              If the staff actually obeys orders and Commander Red isn't aware of his own superfluity then his idiocy is likely to wreak havoc each time he becomes aware of a major decision.

              Seeing how this is a PMC, that means that in any major battle against an actual challenge he may feel like doing his title justice, costing the PMC men and equipment it wouldn't have lost otherwise.

              If the command staff is able to completely obfuscate him then I guess we are back at Red Ribbon having a shadow council doing the actual leading, making Red a figurehead that only needs to be appeased because he owns everything and him dying or going to the courts would completely remove the fig leaf of legality, transforming the PMC into a terrorist organization if it doesn't dissolve.

              Which, given how he is dead now, I hope one of the following is true:

              * Someone forged a credible will.
              * Someone managed to cajole Red into making an actual will.
              * Someone controls Red's legal heir in an equivalent fashion as Red was controlled.

              When I say hope I mean after putting myself in the shoes of a Red Ribbon member of course. As a reader I am cool with anything that both makes sense and makes for a good story.

  So, how is this story? I've seen it posted a number of times now. Does anyone have a review?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It’s amazing if you like dragonball, pretty good if you don’t. I would reccomend it; there’s a nice blend of cleverness and rational planning, realism, and staying true to the spirit of canon that I appreciate.
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I've enjoyed it quite a lot so far. I never watched or read Dragonball, but know a lot of details from growing up as a DBZ fan, so it's a nice blend of familiar and new for me, and the rationalizing is pretty well done.
    ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    I've enjoyed it so far, despite knowing next to nothing about dragonball. Would recommend for sure.
    ```

- u/JulianWyvern:
  ```
  Hmm, I wonder if a RatFic is actually gonna have to deal with a world that suddenly has no moon.
  ```

  - u/SkyTroupe:
    ```
    That would be amazing but I think the story is leaning more towards Goku learning to use his sayain instincts without losing control. Especially with the way Gohan was teaching him.

    How did I even do that? Ugh.

    > point!, - Comma is redundant

    Mmmh, arguable, IMHO. There are different conventions as to what to do with dialogue in this situation, and some I've read about use commas this way. I'll leave it for now, but if someone else wants to chime in, feel free, I might be wrong.

    Anyway, thanks! I fixed them all, in this chapter I was a bit sloppy I suppose.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Another great chapter. Gohan throwing Goku to the other island is hilarious, but also totally possible in dragonball which makes it great. Red’s assasination couldn’t happen to a worse man; My money is on black making a play for control against piccolo’s forces, with a mini plot there of “who gets control of the world spanning terrorist/mercanary organization.”
