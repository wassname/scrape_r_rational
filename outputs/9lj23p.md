  Jesus Christ, Hakram.

  So now I'm wondering if the last line of the previous chapter--"In the game, as in all things, it was always better to be the betrayer than the betrayed"--was not a statement of intent, but a description of the main obstacle to the trust he seeks? Like in the Prisoner's Dilemma, when the risks of cooperation are too high, betrayal is incentivized--and by offering what he seems to believe is tangible evidence of his precommitment to cooperate, he changes the incentive structure to make trusting him rational, so that he and Vivienne can cooperate and avoid the real-world analogue to his game's "Callow takes all" outcome? I don't know. I think Hakram's a few steps ahead of me.

      Compassion and contrition are almost exact opposites in this story.

      Those touched by contrition know they will never be forgiven, so they become the edgy anti-hero the heavens use to torture people.


      Those touched by compassion become unable to harm even the smallest of life forms, often starving.

  ```
  The Aspect 'failing to bloom' feels important. In conjunction with the recent comment upon Vivienne's physical appearance not being set (hair still growing) unlike other named it seems like the grasp on her Name is...weakening? Perhaps failing to fulfill or lean into her Role to such an extent has caused it.

  The main argument against this is that Hakram seemed to know that Thief would be unable to Hide, otherwise that whole gambit at the end would not have worked. I believe Hakram has a third aspect slot open but I don't recall any dialogue from him that sounded like a trigger for some kind of new nullifying aspect.
  ```

  - u/linknmike:
    ```
    She hasn’t been doing that much thieving recently - is it possible she’s transitioning between Names? She seems to be filling the Role of Spymistress or Chancellor for Cat these days. We saw Masego change from Apprentice to Hierophant on screen, which was very flashy, but it makes some sense to me that Named could also have more subtle transitions over a longer period. 

    I do think it’s more likely that she’s just losing her Role, given the physical changes. Maybe she’ll lose her Name entirely, then gain another?
    ```

    - u/docarrol:
      ```
      Is it that easy to get a new Name? Maybe I need to reread the archives, but I think we've mostly only heard about name changes in regards to transitional Names to their final state. Squire, Apprentice, etc. And all the shit that's going on with Cat, of course, but as always she's a special case, and Squire was a transitional Name anyways.

      I didn't get the impression that most Named ever got the opportunity to get new names. You either have it 'til you die, or the necessary conditions that made you eligible end, making you no longer eligible and it's just gone.

      But maybe I've been thinking about it wrong?
      ```

      - u/silver7017:
        ```
        The Cursed became The Captain, which really doesn't sound like a transitional name reaching a final state. I can't remember specifics, but I feel like at least one other such transition has shown up. I can't think of any instances of names being just lost, but my memory is certainly not infallible. Thus I strongly suspect Thief is transitioning due to having a new Role.
        ```

        - u/xland44:
          ```
          I am pretty sure Cursed was transitional
          ```

          - u/silver7017:
            ```
            is there any evidence anywhere to suggest that?
            ```

            - u/xland44:
              ```
              Yes.

              >The Cursed was a transitional Name, much like Apprentice and Squire. Her Role eventually matured into a different Name, that of “the Captain”.

          ```
          Names and Aspects are more ambiguous than that. Both Assassin and Catherine have been able to suss her out when she was using Hide, and I don't think we've seen anything that contradicts Find being able to counter Hide.

  God, I hate her. I hate her so much.

  "He asked to talk, guess he's gonna kill me."

  "He doesn't want his species to be experimented on or starved for use as mindless soldiers. This confirms my suspicions he's a heartless monster."

  "Wow, he's so evil he can't believe I want to do something good because it's good." (This moments after comdemning him for wanting to help his species and, by extension, condeming that species.)

  "Fuck you for saying you're not going to kill me, and backing it up in a believable way."

  "I've already forgotten he explained why he can't kill me, guess that means he's gonna kill me."

  And Hakram, uh...what? How did you make the leap from her discomfort with your calculated reassurance to "oh, she has low self-esteem"? Why do you regret telling the stealth operative turncoat not to betray the  most  important person in your life? WHY DID YOU CUT OFF YOUR HAND, HAKRAM?
  ```

  - u/Ibbot:
    ```
    >"He asked to talk, guess he's gonna kill me."

    "He's threatened to kill me, and I'm actually pretty afraid of him.  A little paranoia would be understandable."

    > "He doesn't want his species to be experimented on or starved for use as mindless soldiers. This confirms my suspicions he's a heartless monster." 

    He's effectively running Callow, and yet his main motivation is not the interests of Callow.  Conflicts of interest may well arise.  They may have arisen already.  Is it really that hard to understand not trusting someone with powerful incentives orthogonal to the goals they're supposed to achieve?

    > Wow, he's so evil he can't believe I want to do something good because it's good. 

    He's talked about helping an ingroup, which doesn't necessarily relate to willingness to help an outgroup, especially at high cost.  I mean, look at Juniper - the whole reason she doesn't trust Vivienne is becuase Juniper believes that ingroup loyalty is the sole valid basis for ethics, and that higher loyalty to principles is wrong.

    > How did you make the leap from her discomfort with your calculated reassurance to "oh, she has low self-esteem"? 

    She thought that Hakram would get off with a slap on the wrist if he killed her.  She would know that that isn't true if she realized that she was still a valuable part of the Woe.

  >“And yet you fought by the side of a man touched by the Choir of Compassion,” the orc said. 

  I hate to say that Vivienne's paranoia is catching, but Willy was a part of Contrition, not Compassion. AFAIK, there's no such choir, so Hakram was either lying here for reasons I can't suss out, or EE made a typo. That's a pretty big typo to make, though...

  In her boots, I'd hear this and immediately think Harkram was gaslighting her.

  Edit: just saw another poster mentioned the maybe-typo. Oops!

  I am having a tough time with this one.  (Edit: I know very well what the author intended. It just isnt setup as a tradition of orcs orvthe Praesi, nor is it something hakram explained ahead of time. He just did it and apparently expects her to figure it out and somehow be soothed)

  If I am suffering from PTSD (from being lit up by mages) and am afraid that someone is a violent psychopath, having them randomly cut off their own hand in front of me would not make me less afraid. 

  It would trigger my PTSD, scare me even more, and result in both horrible nightmares and an intense belief that it is only a matter of time until the individual snapped the rest of the way. Violently.

  Also, telling me that I am only worth a hand feels insulting. More like a taunt than anything else.

      He cut off his hand in a way that is somehow supposed to be about loyalty?  How is that about loyalty?  Then he says she is worth a hand? Is that a threat?

          Thats just it, there was no bargain.

          Imagine you are talking to someone you are worried is unstable and violent. They let you know they know you are worried, then they break their nose on the table, getting blood everywhere, and tell you that you are worth losing their nose over.

          1) the person never expresses you breaking your nose will help them feel better
          2) you never ask if breaking your nose will make them feel better
          3) there is no tradition of breaking your nose as a form of apology

          So in-story, we have the believed-to-be-violently-unstable-orc just doing the thing and assuming it will help. no discussion about it, just did it. Then he tosses out that she is worth it. We the reader know what he means, but I am not at all convinced she would based on the words used.

          Yes, it is made clear to the reader what he hopes to gain by cutting off his hand, but there is no buy-in from her. Meanwhile violently and unpredictably cutting off his hand does nothing to help the perception that he is violent and unpredictable.

            I mean, in your original comment and first reply you explicitly stated that *you* had a hard time understanding it. Whether it got through to thief is a different beast altogether.

  - u/HPMOR_fan:

    I suspect Hakram did it for political reasons. Word on the street is Hakram and Juniper rule the country and Thief is just a figure head. Now people will see Hakram going to meet with Thief and his had cut of by her blade. It looks like they had a disagreement and Thief took Hakram's hand for it.

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  I've been skipping the interludes, hoping to eventually get back to the main plot, but I read the bottom of this one.  Could someone please explain why the hell Hakram just randomly cut off his hand?
  ```

  - u/paradoxinclination:
    ```
    Thief has been incredibly suspicious of Hakram since that time he threatened to snap her neck if she ever turned on Cat, and her self-worth has taken a beating in the last few books because she hasn't ever had a real solo victory like any of the other Woe. The two issues kind of fed into each other now that Vivienne is stuck with Hakram and basically no one else to talk to, so Hakram decided to kill two birds with one stone by unequivocally demonstrating that he both values Thief and that she can trust him by chopping his (living) hand off.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      ...
      That's it? I had assumed that there was some prior "I will protect you even if I lose a hand" or something. This makes no sense... How does self-mutilation send an "I trust you" message? If someone did this in front of me it would make me MORE nervous, since they are clearly unstable and unpredictable.
      ```

      - u/paradoxinclination:
        ```
        It's symbolic, I think- Hakram vowed to snap Thief's neck with his skeletal hand, and now he's rescinding that oath by giving up his remaining hand. It also serves a double purpose in demonstrating that Hakram values Thief more than his own limbs, which is something that she needs pretty badly right now.
        ```
