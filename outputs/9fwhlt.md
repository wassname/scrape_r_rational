  Have you read the doc future stories? Because Ruby here is basically Flicker, right down to the social challenges and obsessive competitiveness (as a solo activity). Also, I'm kind of glad Juane got exposed early, and everyone's concern over a civilian using those launch pads and a tk probability manipulator doing her thing to her launch pad and drawing the wrong conclusion.

    I haven't, actually!  How highly do you recommend it?
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      Pretty highly. The author is really good at going through the physics of everyone's powers, and making a pretty deep and involved world.
      ```

      The first is okay, the sequels I disliked.
      ```

- u/arenavanera:

  Question for people here: how valuable would it be to cross-post this to AO3?  (What about SB/SV?)

  I know some people don't like FF.net for various reasons, but I'd like to gauge interest before committing to the extra work.

    I like AO3, because among other things, it allows for easy download as EPUB/etc, for offline reading.

        AO3 is [www.archiveofourown.org](https://www.archiveofourown.org), a fanfiction archive, but unlike fanfiction.net each story there also has a 'Download' button, with a choice of formats to download from -- so one doesn't need scraping tools with ao3, it provides itself the option to download the story.

    SB/ SV is better for discussion, I think - you'll get more feedback there.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    AO3 is better

  I just wanna say that I love this!

    :P

    Hopefully it isn't too much of a turn-off.  I can promise you that there are reasonable in-world explanations both for why Jaune decided to go through with it and for why Ozpin let him in, although I'm not sure how long it will be before I can wrap back around to them.
