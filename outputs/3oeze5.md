At a guess I suspect most of the people here who are interested in reading this already know about it. But just in case Hello!

If you are mostly up to pace this is just a reminder of [the most recent update.](http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My%21-Generic-Monster-Girls%21-Dream-Time&p=7856807&viewfull=1#post7856807)

If you have read this but didn't like it I'd love some critique or feedback on what it was that did not work for you. Some things are the nature of the beast, others are not so intentional and I'd rather hear things I know I did on purpose being critiqued as bad then miss out on hearing something I did not intend is problematic.
