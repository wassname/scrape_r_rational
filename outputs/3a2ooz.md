## [RT] The Randi Prize (short)

### Post:

Peter could make coins disappear by snapping his fingers.

It seemed to follow some rules. One snap of the fingers made one coin vanish. The first test he'd done, after discovering this ability, was to set coins out in front of him and repeatedly snap his fingers to watch what order they were vanished in. Higher denomination coins went first. Coins that were closer to him went first. After getting out a ruler, Peter found that "close" was mostly determined by how far away the coin was from his heart. He tested snapping upside down, and on his back, but that didn't seem to matter. He tested to see what happened when a higher denomination coin was more distant than a lower denomination, and eventually found out what governed it; a penny would be vanished if it was more than five times closer than a nickel, and a nickel would be vanished if it was five times closer than a quarter.

By the end of the first day, Peter had blown through thirty dollars in change. His change jar was empty, and his thumb and middle finger were both sore. He had no idea where it was the coins were going. There were more questions beyond that, like what would happen with Canadian coins or the coins from the car wash, but Peter had a bonafide superpower. The only thing left to do was turn it to his advantage.

James Randi was a skeptic, who established a prize in 1964 which would go towards anyone with the ability to demonstrate a supernatural ability. Currently, the prize was a million dollars. Vanishing coins with a snap of the fingers didn't seem to be all that useful, and it didn't need to be something kept secret, so trying for the Randi Prize first (before anything else) seemed to be the way to go. Peter carefully filled out his application, got a signature from his (completely shocked) brother Kris who worked as a physicist, sent it off through the mail, and got his response back a few days later.

The protocol was carefully agreed on. Peter had snapped away more than a hundred dollars by now, many of them in Kris's lab under close observation. The biggest practical application seemed to be in waste disposal; if it was possible for the power to recognize nuclear waste as a coin, perhaps by having it minted, then Peter could slowly clear the world of it. The largest coin in the world weighed a ton, and Peter was fairly sure that he would be able to vanish it just as easily as a simple penny. If the United States could declare their nuclear coins to be worth a trillion dollars each, then he might even be able to vanish them from the safety of his home. (Peter's own knowledge didn't seem to enter into it. They'd done double-blind tests.)

On the day of the preliminary test, Peter was stunned to see that Randi himself had shown up. He had a thick white beard and large glasses; at age 86, it was a surprise to see him out and about. Peter shook his hand, and Randi smiled.

"I won't interfere with the protocol," said Randi. "I won't touch the materials, or offer any objections. We've read what you claimed, and seen the video evidence, so all that's left is to prove it for real. If you're the genuine article, we'll know soon enough."

They had cordoned off a field, at Peter's expense. Everyone attending — about a dozen people in total — had taken away all of their coins. Peter had been out in the field snapping his fingers earlier in the day, to make sure that there were no coins buried underground or laying in the grass. He'd run through the protocol six times before Randi and the proctor had shown up.

The proctor came forward and placed a single quarter on a small black table. The table had been examined beforehand. The quarter had been brought by the proctor from a bank, and there were many more outside the cordoned area as replacements or backups.

Everyone stared at the quarter. Peter raised his hand slowly. He had to work to keep it from trembling. He snapped his fingers, and nothing happened.

He snapped his fingers again. The quarter remained in place. There were a million dollars on the line. Peter had already begun spending the money in his head. He snapped a third time, and a fourth, and kept going until Kris stepped forward and told him to stop. They had a brief conversation as they tried to figure out what the problem might be, but the only thing they could think was that there were other, valuable coins too close by. Peter resumed snapping again, and got as close to the quarter as the proctor and the protocols would allow, but after a hundred snaps, the test was marked as a failure. Randi left, and Peter was left wondering what happened.

The power never came back, no matter how long and how hard Peter snapped his fingers. The brief few days of magic seemed almost like a dream. Peter might have been able to believe that it was a temporary delusion, if not for the videotapes.

Weeks later, Peter got a knock on his door. When he opened it, James Randi stood in front of him, with his thick white beard and a black suit with a red tie.

"I wasn't a fraud," said Peter. "It really was happening."

"May I come in?" asked Randi. Peter nodded, and they moved into the living room. Randi sat down in a chair and massaged his knees. "Peter, do you know how many people have come to me over the years?"

"Uh, three hundred and sixty?" asked Peter. "That's what the internet said. I tried to cover my bases. But I had a real power," said Peter. "It wasn't all in my head. Other people saw it too."

"Do you think that you are unique?" asked Randi. "In the history of the world, do you think that you are the single person to have ever displayed or discovered a supernatural power?"

"I ... no," said Peter. "I suppose not. But then why has the prize been around for so long? Why hasn't someone claimed it?"

Randi pulled a quarter from his pocket, balanced it on his thumb for a moment, and then flicked it into the air. It spun around, making a shimmering sphere as it traced a parabolic arc. When it reached the apex, Randi snapped his fingers, and the coin disappeared.

"Three hundred and sixty tests," said Randi. "None of them passed. The common denominator was me." He smiled, revealing his teeth.

"How?" asked Peter. "*Why?*"

"I've never been able to explain how," said Randi. "The why should be obvious though. If you could take that power from someone, why wouldn't you? The prize draws them in like moths to a flame. All it takes is a shake of the hand."

"I'll," Peter began. "I'll expose you. You stole from me!"

"You haven't been listening," said Randi. He stood up slowly. "Psychics come to me, and I take their powers. Do you understand why I'm here? It's not to gloat. This is cleanup."

And then Peter was alone. He was feeling sad, and tried to remember why. The videotapes, that was it. He'd carefully edited them to make it seem like a coin was disappearing. It had taken hours of his time, and all for nothing. Why had he thought that he could cheat Randi like that?

  Great story, loved it!

  FYI, in case you're not aware, many people who have failed to collect this prize actually do claim that Randi himself is a psychic who has the ability to suppress other people's powers.  For this reason, Randi has taken to not being present for the tests which are administered or even letting himself know the precise day/time they are happening, just so that people cannot make this claim :)

    I was aware that some people had made that claim (not just about Randi, but about all sorts of tests); I wasn't aware that he'd removed himself from the proceedings. That's pretty funny.

  I would be very surprised if this idea hadn't been done better elsewhere, but it tickled me. ([Inspired by this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a03yc/pushing_daisies/cs8gpp4?context=1))

  Edit: Also, my apologies to James Randi.

    Nice. I was expecting Randi to have some anti-magic effect, with a goal of ridding the world of the supernatural. Your ending is much more diabolical.

      I remember reading a short story in which it is discovered that weak effects in scientific results (such as a barely statistically significant result in a study of psychic powers) actually diminish over repeated replication attempts *as a law of physics*, and even strong effects will gradually diminish over time, so that eventually even something like relativity will no longer be true. 

      Essentially, the universe will slowly become less scientifically describable... until, in a few hundred years, the diminishing effect itself diminishes, and the universe becomes sane again.

        Hmm. Well there's the SMBC comic where the laws of mathematics wear out with repeated use.

  Having met Randi and seen a live Million Dollar Challenge, I believe your depiction of how he'd act during a test to be perfectly accurate, at least in the days when he still did them personally. 

  I also think that if he was a magical super villain, he'd probably act a lot like you imagined. Maybe you shouldn't answer the door for a few days, just in case. 

  If you'd like, I can try sending this a few people who might be able to get it to Randi directly. I think he might find it fun.

      Status update:

      The only person I've gotten in contact with is DJ Grothe, but I'm not really sure what the circumstances were regarding his being deposed and having Randi take over the Presidency last year. We're not exactly close so I don't know how to bring it up. I would ask Brian Dunning, but he's still unreachable. 

      That said, I'll save the link and if a good opportunity presents itself, I'll jump on it. :)

  Hahah.  Well at least Randi didn't murder him?

  Many of my "superpowers!" fantasies involve the Randi prize.  Except I usually like to keep my powers a secret, so many of my scenarios involve proving to Randi, personally, that my powers exist, and then encouraging him to just give me the million under the table, rather than have to publicly declare that he's been wrong all along and paranormal powers do exist... ah, the moral conundrums I've forced that poor man through in my fevered imaginings...

  And yet you gloat. If Peter had a gun, that could have ended badly. He's not going to get powers from bullet-proof people that way.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Well, obviously part of the reason is to gloat. :)

    If it helps, you can imagine that Randi has absorbed metal detection powers and can check for the presence of a gun. Or that he's confident enough in his psychic abilities that he could force someone to drop the gun. Or that he's absorbed a few dozen clairvoyants.

  James Randi is one of those people with so distinct a voice that it's impossible to read his lines here without hearing his gleeful timbre.

  This is fantastic. 

  I hope that Randi is doing this to avert risks and not simply to acquire personal power.

  Ben finished writing the story and clicked the little button marked "Submit". That was a good one - the idea had it he at him for a while.

  Weeks later, Ben got a knock at his door...

    In my imagination, while he was a stage performance magician, he got curious about a performer with a trick he just couldn't figure out...

  Very Well Done, sir.

  I am now going to link a TED talk by Randi on the /r/rational mainpage if nobody else has beaten me to it recently.

    I'm not entirely happy about it, but apparently we're getting far stricter than necessary (IMHO) about topics of threads in this subreddit.  [The link to James Randi's TED talk] (https://www.ted.com/talks/james_randi?language=en) was removed from the main page.

      (not a mod)

      /r/rational is a misnamed sub, IMO. It's not for general discussion of rationalism or rationalist topics, it's specifically for rational (fan)fiction. There *should* be a sub for discussions and links of rational interest, but it's not this one.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        There are /r/lesswrong and /r/lesswronglounge, neither of which are terribly active. I think part of the success of this subreddit is owed to the fact that we put our focus on fiction, which is a more evergreen topic than the art of human rationality in general.

        Of note, we will be starting up a Friday Off-Topic thread where you can link and discuss whatever you'd like with this community; the first test of that will be soon, and we'll see how that goes.
