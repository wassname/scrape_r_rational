  I don't think I've ever had my opinion on a character flipped around so rapidly. I definitely disliked Mama and thought she was selfish and evil. Now...I'm a lot more sympathetic. She's definitely selfish and pragmatic, but I can no longer call her evil. There's nothing evil about doing your best to survive in a situation you know you can't escape from. Especially in the way she did it. Despite how two faced she felt after we learnt the truth about the plantation, she honestly did love her kids. And she did her best to give them the best possible life she could within the system she found herself trapped in. That's what a real parent does.

    I wonder if the reason she produced such high-quality goods was because she was motivated to keep them alive as long as possible.

      It may have been a roundabout way of showing that children grow better under genuine love and care. Higher quality goods due to her kids feeling loved and thriving as a result.

  Aaaand we're out. That sure took a while, but I'll be damned if it wasn't worth it.

  So, Ray is Isabella's son. That's interesting, perhaps even natural in retrospect. Though, I'm not sure it matters much, considering how little either of them seemed to care.

  The insight into Isabella's past was interesting, too. It sort of confirms Mamas are picked from potential escapees. And in the end, she gave them a slight push along the way? That's reasonable, I suppose, if this really meant the end of her career anyway. Though, she had better dispose of those ropes entirely, or she might be found out as having aided and abetted the escape, however marginally.

  As for the children... They deserved a couple of pages of enjoying their newfound freedom, that's for sure. It's just a shame that, between that and Isabella's backstory, there wasn't room for anything about what the world is actually like. That question has hung in the air for a long time now.

    Don't think it matters, Isabella's as good as dead for letting kids escape at all.

      I'm not so sure. If anything, suddenly having to switch Mamas would spoil the remaining goods in the plantation. Seeing as she's had an exemplary record so far, I would expect they keep her around as a lowly subordinate, without any of the wide-reaching privileges and exemptions she's had until now. I also find it likely they'll assign her another "Krone", except this time Isabella is the subordinate.

  Well, it doesn't redeem her, but at least Isabella isn't a sore loser.
  ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    I disagree; I think it does redeem her. In that I can't call her evil anymore. Not really.
    ```
