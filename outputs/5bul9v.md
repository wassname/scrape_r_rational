## [WIP][D][BS] National Novel Writing Month: Week 2

### Post:

This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for National Novel Writing Month, which starts November 1st; we'll have four or five of these posts throughout the month.

* Want to check in your some progress?
* Want to talk about what you're writing?
* Out of ideas and want some help?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

(This thread will be pinned after a day or so.)

  I'm still going strong on [Extracts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit). I'm kind of amazed that I'm already up to 28,000 words, including 5800 words so far in today's binge. I expect my word-rate to drop sharply, though; I'm just about at the point where the story starts getting complicated, as some long-standing near-isolation falls away, and I expect I'm going to have to start keeping track of a lot more characters and won't be able to keep the plot as abstract as it's been.

    I'm curious, what are all of the stories you've written? I think I know of all of them: SI, Extracts, Wierdtopia, Myou've Gotta be Kidding Me, LoadBear FAQ, and some stuff on Orion's Arm.

    Has there been anything else written by you (the wonderful author) floating around on the Internet?

      That's... actually a bit tricky to answer. Short answer: "Yes".

      Example; I just did a big of digging, and found what may be my oldest surviving piece of fiction: "[Reality Slips](http://www.datapacrat.com/Art/Fiction/STORIES/REALITYS.TXT)", which I posted to a mailing list in [1996](http://www.datapacrat.com/Art/Fiction/STORIES/SLIPS.TXT) (which I'm still [subscribed](http://lists.integral.org/listinfo/tsa-talk) to :) ).

      You'd need an account at the site to see the NSFW content, but most of the items posted to my gallery at [FurAffinity](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/datapacrat/) were written, or at least scripted, by me. I've been posting various pieces of original content there since 2011 (most of which were drawn by other people to my specifications); from about 5 to 2 years ago (when I started SI), I was focused on building a fairly-hard-SF(-but-furry) universe.

      In the large time gap between, IIRC, most of my creative efforts went more towards role-playing games, particularly PBeMs for which no public record exists. But there could easily be some scattered items I've since forgotten.

  I've barely broken 2k, but at the very least I have managed to do something I've never done before. Written something!

  The annoying part is that my antagonist is so much more interesting than the hero that they've switched roles. Jackie is the one I'm going into detail about and has massive amount of power compared to Alan who is shy and insists on being mysterious.

  So I'm switching the two and instead of watching a rationalist out-think a very arrogant character, we're going to be watching an arrogant protagonist get beaten by a rationalist and hopefully learn something important from him. Note that neither are actually meant to be "evil" but one of them is more impulsive than the other.

  The prologue is really short, but the exciting bits of scientific experimentation is about to start! I plan on actually detailing out how professional researchers actually hypothesize, test, and analyze experiments in a live lab setting.

  Just passed the 15k mark last night. Tomorrow I'll be flying from the west coast to the east coast, and thus losing 3 hours. Hopefully I'll be able to get all my writing finished on the plane, because there's no way I'm going to be up for it after the flight.

  The story is *finally* picking up - recently wrote a pivotal scene that I've had in my head since I started the story last year. I'm planning on continuing to write 2k words a day after NaNo finishes, until I finish Part Two. I want to have this book complete before the summer, revisions and all. Also need to learn how to write a query letter.

  I'm well on my way, and should top 15k tonight, but I'm having to be very careful not to reread what I've written because Sturgeon's Law applies in spades :-(

  I gave someone a magic item without knowing what that magic item does. *Ideally* everything that the heroes gain along their journey gets used by the climax. The problem comes with creating a climax that uses all those Chekov's Guns that were placed earlier; I think I really need to sit down and figure out which guns I left lying around, though most are accounted for. That doesn't solve the problem of *this specific gun*, whose form is not yet known to me, and which I will have to try to slot into the quickly-approaching finale. Not sure whether it makes more sense to build the gun first, or the gun's target.

  (Making sure that all setups have payoffs is another one of those things that tends to be easier to do *after* all the writing is done.)

  (The magic item was something done on a whim, probably good for the story, and *by itself* offers a different kind of setup ... but a bracelet made from a river spirit needs to both set up a rule *and* have its own payoff.)

    Maybe it could let the wearer breathe underwater?  There is a large quantity of gold in the sea by the capital, and gold is always useful, especially if there's a dark, powerhungry mentalist on the throne.  If Henry knows the ritual for walking underwater, it's less useful, but if they become separated, or can't find a tooth that satisfies the strict requirements, it could be important.

  Not doing a good job at hitting the word counts, but I have a few fun moments planned for this little story [here] (https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2016/11/12/genie-2/)

  Hoping to get some escalation, fun references / dialogue, and find some other weird ways of abusing severely limited magic abilities.
