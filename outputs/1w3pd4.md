## Rational Pokemon pre-chapter 5 discussion (also title change announcement!)

### Post:

So I'm finally back in the states (and finally finished reading "Worm"), which means I can knuckle down and finish chapter 5, which is about 3/4 done.

Two things I wanted to discuss with you all first:

1) The title has officially changed! "Rational Pokemon" was a placeholder more than anything, as when I started I had little more than vague ideas of an overall story coupled with some more specific irrational aspects of our favorite pocket monster universe that I wanted to address.  Now that the story has more or less crystalized in my mind, I've decided on a much better title, which I hope you guys will like :)

Henceforth, "Rational Pokemon" is now titled "Pokemon: The Origin of Species."

2) How to handle metamorphosis, or "evolution" as it's colloquially known in-world, is something I'm still wavering on.  My thoughts are to either have it be a slow, steady progression of growth and change, meaning most pokemon simply continue to grow and develop new features over time (such as wings or extra arms).  Alternatively I could stick to the system in the game, where pokemon utterly transform within seconds in a burst of energy and light.

The problems with the latter is it requires a rational (if not necessarily realistic) explanation for the many tangential details surrounding it.  Such as: why do evolution stones or trading evolve certain pokemon?  What's the energy they give off, and where does it come from?  Can it be harnessed? Can it be interrupted, as in the games?

It's the kind of thing I can see myself going both ways on, so I thought I'd ask you guys and gals: which approach would you prefer to see as the "real" way evolution works, and why?

  You could have them go into an hour-long (or longer or shorter) coma to metamorph, during which they form a bioluminescent outer skin that stretches with the transformation.  

  You see, pokémon actually all share a tremendous amount of genetic material.  All pokémon, at least by our world's definition, belong to the same species.  Because of this, they need a secondary system of genetic material to control their form, a bit like epigenetics, except that it is totally physically separate from the normal genome, sort of like mitochondrial DNA, inherited from the mother.  For simplicity, I will refer to the pokémon equivalent of DNA as PGM, pokémon gentic material, and the other system of genetic material as EGM, extra-genetic material.

  In most pokémon, EGM is stored in glands until they reach a certain stage of maturity, at which point it is replicated and released.  This induces the metamorphosis process.  It should be noted that this does not occur at the same age in all specimens, but the condition of a pokémon's health.  In fact, many pokémon go through their entire lives without metamorphosis; most pokémon exibit neoteny.  It is theorized that metamorphosis developed as a stress reaction, expending a great deal of energy to make a pokémon stronger only when it was well enough fed to survive after the transformation, and was fighting enough to need it.  Domesticated pokémon used for battling tend to metamorph much more than wild pokémon because of this.

  As I said earlier, in most pokémon, metamorphosis is a response to being in combat a lot, but there are some other reasons for it to happen.  The most common method trainers use to evolve pokémon is the utilization of so-called "evolutionary stones".  Contrary to popular belief, most likely caused by the film industry's romanticization of the metamorphic process as a simple minute-long transformation capable of "saving the day" at a critical moment, a pokémon does not transform after simply touching a stone.

  Actually, the stones are fossils containing archaic pokémon EGM.  This EGM can be extracted from the stones and made viable, at which point it cam be fed to or injected intravenously into a pokémon, causing it to undergo a metamorphosis that it would not naturally be able to have.  Such pokémon originally had normal metamorphosis, but evolved over time to lose it.

  Another cause for evolution is love.  "Baby pokémon", that is pokémon who do not exhibit neoteny and have not transformed, are the most typical examples of this type of metamorphosis.  In the wild, they would transform as soon as they had enough food to sustain themselves.  Trainers can provide them with this sustenance indefinitely, but the stress of a very young pokémon being raised by humans is usually enough to prevent the metamorphosis.  As such, baby pokémon (and some others) transform only if they form a deep emotional bond to their trainers.

  There are some other conditions of metamorphosis for some pokémon.  A few need certain objects in order to transform.  In this case the objects become incorporated into the final form; it is unknown how this dependency developed in nature.  One fascinating case is that of the pokémon burmy, which covers itself in detrious it finds in it's environment.  When female burmies evolve, this "cloak" becomes incorporated into their bodies.

  There are many other causes and alleged causes for metamorphosis, but most are not understood or confirmed as actual causes.

  TL;DR: What just happened?  Where am I?  Why is my nose bleeding?

    I like it! I was thinking an egg-like shell (similar to the "mysterious" egg-like-cradle-thing babies come out of), but the bio-luminescent sac captures both the glow and brief torpidity. 

    > For simplicity, I will refer to the pokémon equivalent of DNA as PGM, pokémon gentic material, and the other system of genetic material as EGM, extra-genetic material.

    Totes stealing these terms and acronyms. BTW and THX.

Such pokémon originally had normal metamorphosis, but evolved over time to lose it.

    I'm leaning more toward the idea that the stones are mineral-rich triggers for those EGMs that are usually found in the pokemon's natural habitat, which speed up the cycle of the pokemon's metamorphosis due to exposure over long periods: alternatively, trainers might build little "nests" of the stones, crushed into powder perhaps, for their pokemon to sleep on to accelerate the process.

    >There are some other conditions of metamorphosis for some pokémon. A few need certain objects in order to transform. In this case the objects become incorporated into the final form; it is unknown how this dependency developed in nature.

    This I see borrowing the previous idea instead: those objects have the same EGMs needed for various pokemon to evolve into their own unique forms.  So a King's Rock might be a fossilized gizzard from any pokemon that the King's Rock normally helps a pokemon evolve into, and when one of those pre-evolved forms comes into conact with it, the dormant EGMs are awakened.

    Shhh... *strokes hair* No tears now... only Pokemon...

  I feel like the "flash of light evolution" is a bit to iconic to remove it outright though I understand your frustration with getting it to make sense.

  You don't have to stick faithfully to canon in every particular. But maybe you could say that as a Pokemon grows and ages, it naturally prepares to undergo metamorphosis like a tadpole into a frog. For some Pokemon this is a natural aging process, that, at a certain point, ends up happening really quickly, if not quite instantaneously. For others, they need specific, rare minerals that can only be found a few places. When these Pokemon are taken out of their natural habitats by humans, the humans have to supply these minerals themselves in the form of evolution stones.

  As for trading...maybe certain Pokemon have spent enough time around humans that they evolved certain responses? Maybe those breeds were abused to evolve too quickly so they could be sold faster at a profit, which damaged their long-term reproductive viability and, so some Pokemon didn't evolve until they had undergone a trade...somehow...and so the only ones that could breed were the "failed" delayed evolution types...or something.

    ```
    For trading evolution... I'd suggest having emotional security be a factor. The minute they're captured, the pokeball seems to hard-wire a bond to their owner in their minds. Being transferred away from that owner could be a strong emotional trigger for their evolution.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      In the games, trading involves an electronic process to "transfer" the pokemon from one person's ownership to the next, and I think that's what triggers it.  In my version I think I'm going to do something similar in regards to an unbrainwashing program that removes their obedience from their original trainer and replaces it with the new ones, which could trigger the trigger you're referring to. In the wild, this trigger might have occurred in the species when a mating partner or parent died.
      ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I like the natural mineral idea for the evolutionary stones a lot: I was thinking something along those lines, like trainers forming a small nest of Fire Stones or whatever for their pokemon to sleep in to encourage their evolution, rather than simply touching it with one and having it suddenly evolve.
    ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  I very much prefer the flash of light and sudden, near-instant evolution. That's how it's presented in the show and game, and if it doesn't make sense ... well, it's your job to make it make sense.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I agree, it's much more entertaining to have the flash of light and near-instant form :) I'm still vacillating between the extremes of making the world more realistic or keeping it entertaining however, and wanted to know if any others found the idea of near-instant evolution worth dropping in pursuit of the former.  I think we've found a good workaround though.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  The flash of light could be a physical response to sudden massive growth. Something like [this](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3000), maybe?
  ```

- u/ArmokGoB:
  ```
  Hmm, an idea for a more realistic process looking roughly the same: Molting, with the light being the old body essentially burning in a controlled manner. As in, the evolved from grows inside the old one and then it's shed like a gory shell.
  ```

- u/someonewrongonthenet:
  ```
  Random idea: Could have wild pokemon grow slowly in a naturalistic fashion, while caught pokemon evolve in short bursts because of something related to being digitized in poke-ball form?

  That would help condense the number of "weird" things you have to explain (like where all that mass comes from, assuming you actually want conservation of mass to generally be part of the physics)  into the pokeball technology.

  (Note: I've only played the games, so I'm not sure if wild pokemon ever evolved in canon...but wild pokemon *never* evolved in game)
  ```

- u/OffColorCommentary:
  ```
  You're going to run into even worse problems with the laws of thermodynamics as soon as you find a Pokemon that learns Ice Beam.  And more problems with any telekinetic Pokemon.  I'd recommend looking for all the places that you're going to run into this sort of problem and coming up with some alternate physics that cover all of them.

  Given your new title, it sounds like you should focus on evolution, ecology, and biology as the sciences that are considered sacred, and let physics slip.

  If I were to take a stab at it, I'd introduce a number of new atom-sized particles that bond correctly with normal matter but have their own nonsense properties.  Like constantly generating electrons, or forming additional bonds at a distance, or absorbing heat.  Just because breaking the laws of physics is on the table as an evolutionary advantage, doesn't mean evolution will behave any different than normally.
