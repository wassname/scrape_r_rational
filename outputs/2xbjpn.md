  This is a really well-functioning site, and I'm happy to see it continue to be used. Keep up the good work!

  Edit: If I might make a recommendation: Include a "Not interested" button on recommendations. There are certain things I don't want to read too much, but can't (fairly) rate to make my recommendations page a bit more sparse.

      Quite a few pages aren't loading right now (gotten confirmation from a friend, too). Are you updating right now?

      (I have a flight in an hour or so. I was hoping to find something I could download onto my Kindle before then...)

  I have an idea for a few more tags:

  * Free-Online
  * Paid-Online
  * Free-EBook
  * Paid-EBook
  * Hardcopy
  ```

  Wow, that looks like a good site.

  Many thanks. It'll really help me find stuff to read during the slow parts of my shift at work.

  Out of curiosity, what did you build this in?

      I've used it.  It definitely makes things easier if you're working in the expected conventions, although it gets a little hairy as soon as you want to step off the rails.  Definite timesaver for many kinds of websites, though.

  It might be nice to have a "deconstruction" tag.

      What's a "non-Bayesian rating"?

          > The average rating is an average of all ratings for that work, while the bayesian average rating takes into account the number of ratings for that work, the number of ratings for the average work on the site, and the average rating for the average work on the site.

          Could you point me to the math of how that works?  The nerd in me just yelled, "HEY, STATS!"

  I might suggest a filter for status. I have started too many fan fictions and realized only later that they were incomplete and may never be complete.

  EDIT: Spelling has never bean my stroong suit.

  Awesome work. You have my thanks. 

  On "about" page:

  ```
  One thing I would like is to see an Amazon-style breakdown of the ratings.  (5-star x4, 3 star x5, 1 star x1, etc)

  Something else: profiles of the users so that we can see what works they have rated and what ratings they gave them.  This would function like a reputation / matching system, where you could identify people who had tastes similar to your own and follow them.
