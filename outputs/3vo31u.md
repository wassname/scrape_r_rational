## [Q] Examples of realistic rational fiction

### Post:

I've been searching for alternatives to the glorification of irrationality that I seem to notice in mainstream fiction and movies.

I was introduced to the idea of rationality in fiction by Ayn Rand's Fountainhead, although I'm aware she isn't a shining example of rational fiction.

To be honest, in reading your "Characteristics of Rational Fiction" sidebar, I identified entirely with the proposals therein, but I have never felt compelled to delve into either the sci fi or fantasy genres. As a rule, I tend to drift toward satire from many sources.

That being said, I don't want you all to think that I'm lambasting the genres. I am only asking humble questions. 

My question is two-fold: Is rational fiction necessarily sci fi or fantasy related? I imagine the answer is no, but I'll let you guys confirm my suspicion or not.

Lastly, what are some examples of realistic rational fiction?

Thank you.

  The problem with realistic rational fiction set in the now is that the people who are able to write it are much better suited using that ability elsewhere.

  Reality is complicated. It's hard and costly to figure out what information you're missing that you need. Experiments are not nice and neat, /u/eaturbrainz made a point about how SF&F is much more *accessible* to the experimenter. I've complained quite a bit, either internally or externally, about the assumptions that characters in stories are able to make about the results of their experiments, simply because the author didn't think of all the other hypotheses that could explain the character's observations. But basically, fiction is simplified, because it was created by a human brain, and human brains cannot GM for reality.

  SF&F has simple rules on the level of toy models, like a spherical cow in a vacuum. Rational stories are able to deal with those. But look at some of these guidelines on the sidebar:

  > Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

  > The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

  The social aspect is a nightmare. There are over seven billion people on Earth, and all sorts of groups, government agencies, companies, interest groups, that are trying to affect us in some way. The cash flows are ludicrously complex. We don't even know whether the economy is over- or undervaluing certain classes of stocks, because markets are social and depend on assumptions en masse.

  So, reality is complicated. The reason rational fiction does not try to deal with reality is because of this. A rational protagonist that is not given some special systems to study and abilities to exploit, be they fantastic or science fictional, then has to deal with application of rationality to the mundane, which is what the author is supposed to be doing in the first place. Without a special system, they aren't able to accurately describe the effects the character would have on the world around them. Without special abilities, the character is powerless compared to any other of their peers. The rational thing to do in reality happens, to *some* extent, all around us. When people gain a special cause, like maximizing Islam, or maximizing global QALYs, then interesting behavior occurs, but without a comparative advantage in something to the rest of the world, interesting things do not happen. Real life happens.

  So, the reasons are one, but it has two expressions. First, the system that is available for study is the same as in reality, and thus hard to realistically experiment on and fairly boring (why not magic!), and the abilities provided are limited to those in reality, which is not much of an obstacle but then limits interesting stories to people with lots of money and/or very little governmental oversight.

    I feel like either i am missing something or what you are saying comes with extra assumptions about the nature of rational and\or realistic fiction.

    I mean, sure the things you write will make it kind of impossible to write realistic rational fiction where the MC conquers the world without understanding the full power structure of the world.
    But how would that really prevent writing good rational detective stories for example? or a drama? horror? thriller? all of those are possible without breaking the list on the right of this sub..

    having said all of that, even if you did attempt to write a rational realistic story where the MC unites earth under some actual central government, neither the "realistic" nor the "rational" aspects demand that every single thing you say will be scientifically proven. if you believe the world works some way and you wrote a story that way, even if you miss interpreted the political power balance in some country, or the cause for economic issues in another, it still will be fine. the point of rational fiction is that you won't make things conveniently happen for your story to progress. meaning less literary shortcuts. and realistic fiction is about stories that could happen in real life, meaning no invented world mechanics.

      Small scale is certainly possible, that is true. I'm not sure what drama is exactly as a genre, but it sounds a lot like it depends on miscommunication.

      >if you believe the world works some way and you wrote a story that way, even if you miss interpreted the political power balance in some country

      The problem there is not even getting everything correct, it's simply the complexity that would arise when the entire world is the scope of your story. Significant Digits manages to do well to make the world-optimization subplot satisfactory, but it's using gross simplifications, because the politics and machinations themselves are not what the story is about. Neither is realism the case in Death Note; the only efforts of the UN are to create a very tiny detective force in Japan with a memorable cast of characters and direct relation to the protagonist's father, big surprise. Making a realistic story *about* world optimization would be incredibly difficult.

        A drama could be about many things i think, could be about a family handling a child being diagnosed with cancer for example. I don't see any issue with making that setting rational.

        It will definitely be difficult to write a realistic world unification rational fic where a single character based on it's abilities optimize the world entirely.
        but you could write about someone trying to do that by for example running for presidency or somesuch.

    Of course, this does mean that *having a concrete goal around which plans and strategies can be inferred* is a minor superpower in real life.

    It took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out that this was about fanfiction and not just a reversal of the current treatment of specfic (which is obviously treated much better than fanfic, or earthfic in this story).

  The trouble is that, unless it requires social power you can't obtain, if you come up with a clever idea for a realistic exploit, it's generally more rational to implement it than write about it. Relatedly, I've had a lot of ideas about how evil forces on the Earth today could optimize for their utility functions, and I've kept quiet about them for fear that the ideas might reach them.

      Yes, but they're harder to come up with, vaguer, and/or worse, for entropic reasons.

        As EY doesn't put it, it's much easier to fuck ~~everything~~ something up than to get ~~something~~ everything right.

          No, fucking *everything* up *all at the same time* is pretty difficult.  Problem is, fucking up one substantial thing still has quite a lot of personal cost.

          Like, the primary reason we *don't* have a society that can easily be destroyed from the inside by one fuck-up is because those kinds of social structures die in embryo *because they suck*.  *But*, our societies and structures haven't been optimized *in particular* for robustness to individual mistakes.

          Or actually, I can think of a few that *are*, but they have their other-side-of-the-coin, too: if you engineer the US government to be extremely robust against the personal ideologies of ambitious legislators, then it's extremely robust against the personal ideologies of *good* ambitious legislators.

          Reality doesn't have a built-in alignment system, so it's hard to build human structures that measure alignment well-enough to make themselves *more* useful to Good than to Evil (and for purposes of this post, assume Good and Evil hold their usual D&D definitions, because why not).

  I like to think that a good example of a realistic rational fiction would be the television series The Wire. There are many actors in the system, all of them with realistic values and all of them proceed to fulfill their values in a reasonably rational manner, given the constraints of their ability / resources and the conflicting values of other actors. And of course everything goes to shit and it's impossible to really blame anyone for it because that's the complexity of real life.

  I don't know what the general r/rational's stance on it is, but I think [House of Cards](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856010/) isn't far removed from a realistic rational fiction. The characters are motivated by (more or less) realistic ambitions and I don't think the way in which they go about achieving those is in any shape or form orthogonal to the Characteristics of RF.

  Yeah, the main difficulty is coming up with ideas that will work in the real world. It's very difficult but possible. The Sherlock Holmes stories are rationalist fiction, and predicted much of modern forensics.
