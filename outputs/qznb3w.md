## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I don't think I've seen *Arcane* mentioned ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmAurh012s)), which is a bit surprising given how popular it is, but it was really good.

  I had expected there to be a lot of common tropes given that it's a video game adaptation, but the writing was solid and the characters interesting. They act like real people (or as real as one can be in a fantasy steampunk setting) instead of caricatures meant to fit a mold.

  The voice acting's really good, and the art style is great. There's an attention to detail, even just backgrounds, that goes above what I was expecting.

  I won't say it's completely free of tropes, but it doesn't really rely on them heavily to make the story easier. The only thing I really didn't like was how the police had male and female uniforms, where the women had to wear a skirt while the men wore pants.

  It's a solid show, and was just renewed for a second season. I'd definitely give it a watch.
  ```

  - u/Brassica_Rex:
    ```
    Arcane is a really *competently* made show, which comes with pros and cons. In more detail:

    - The visuals are absolutely amazing and make the show worth watching on their own. After being let down by Marvel's What If, Arcane reminded me of what animation can do. Arcane has the best western animation I've seen since Mitchells vs the Machines, reminiscent of Spider-verse at times. (If you couldn't tell, I'm a sucker for this CGI-augmented 2D-like art style.) The fight between (heavy spoilers) >![Jinx and Ekko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZNmqR0z5xs)!< is a highlight.

    - The art is the standout, yes, but the production is general is slick, smooth, and most important of all, memorable. From the endless variety of great character designs to the voice acting (shoutout to Powder's VA, good child actors are not easy to come by and bad ones can easily mess up a show *cough good omens cough*) to the score/soundtrack. Some people may have doubts about the hip-hop/rock songs, but you can't deny they set the show apart and prevent it from being generic fantasy world #46 (probably my biggest complaint about Dota: Dragon's Blood).

    - The plot and narrative are likewise competently executed. It's like someone took a list of 'things to include in a good narrative' and checked off all the boxes neatly. This is a good and bad thing. To elaborate- Arcane feels like a paint-by-numbers production- but I don't mean that is the disparaging way it's usually used. Even paint-by-numbers pictures can look good if there are enough numbers and the spaces are sufficiently small. That's how I feel about Arcane- someone paid very close attention to good shows and carefully analyzed why they were well received, and dutifully put those bits in.

    - But it's a bad thing in the sense that sometimes it feels like Arcane plays a little *too* conservative. I never really felt surprised by any plot twists in the show. I'm torn as to the extent that this makes it a bad thing- if you *don't* follow the rules, you get stupid stuff like GoT S8 or Rise of Skywalker.

    - The reason I'm not making this a full review with its own post is that, well, Arcane isn't actually rational fiction. The worldbuilding looks nice enough but there's not much substance to it. Integrating magic and technology doesn't really do much for the story apart from providing character motivations. They could have it so much more interesting, but instead we just get blue shiny MacGuffins that do whatever they need to do to drive the plot forward.

    - I'm not a huge fan of the story itself. I definitely think they had enough time to actually tie up all the characters' arcs to be more or less where they are come the game, leaving them for cameos/minor roles in subsequent seasons, which would focus on a new set of characters (Infinity Train is a great example of what I'm trying to get at here). Instead, the plot, which wasn't the densest to begin with, gets stretched uncomfortably thin, and it kind of drags towards the end. The most egregious example of this is Victor's arc, who spends half a season staring intently at a shiny blue rock while occasionally coughing up blood. It's not *that* bad- the characterization is good enough that I don't mind seeing more of these characters in the future- it's just more of a missed opportunity for me.

    - ... and of course there are the female enforcer uniforms. They're just so distracting with how impractical and obvious-fanservice-material they are. I know it's from the game, but it's not relevant when discussing Arcane qua show. Frankly, that entire aspect of LoL's character design is a large part of why I dislike its aesthetic.

    In the Dota vs LoL war I'm a Dota player through and through, but there's no dispute that LoL's Netflix show is miles better than Dota's Netflix show. You could say, 'but Arcane took 6 years and a ridiculous budget to make'... but that's not relevant. Arcane is in a whole other tier.

    It's evident this was a labor of love. The next season is going to be make or break for me. 6 years to make a season is obviously not going to fly, so it remains to be seen if Riot/Fortiche can maintain this level of quality going forward. I think animation quality is going to be my make or break factor here- see One Punch Man, where my opinion of S1 is SO FREAKING COOL and my opinion of S2 is 'eh barely finished it'.

    Based on the chatting I've had with friends I expect that there'll be lazy narrative tools aplenty and that the good guys are the ones who wants to prevent the status quo, both of which makes me unexcited about it. Your point that there isn't that many lazy narrative tolls does make me more likely to see it.

    Relatedly, I've been wanting to make a rational fanfic set in the League universe for years but never found the time. A lot of things could be explained if runeterra was created to produce living weapons by the celestials(a group of divine beings that thinks that star constellations is a good medium for communication) to combat the void.

    Does anyone happen to know a ratfic or a portal fic set in that universe?
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      >the good guys are the ones who wants to prevent the status quo

      It's a mix. The good guys have different beliefs; some just want to help their family, others their people, some want to protect everyone, some want to maintain the status quo, some want to punch all their problems in the face, some value diplomacy, some want to make the city a better place but still discriminate against the "criminals" under them. 

      Even the main antagonist has a point that the Undercity has been treated like a trash heap by the people topside and wants to make "his" city a better place to live. But his belief that the ends justify the means, willingness to treat people as disposable and ruthlessness set him apart.

      In general, they're a fairly diverse bunch (mostly as a function of their upbringing) with their own beliefs. But as far as being good goes, there's no "one size fits all" answer.

      This seems really promising. The premise is uniquely interesting and the setting is interesting - I'm looking forward to where you take it. 

      In terms of feedback it feels a little aimless - MC understandably want safety but to me that's not a super compelling narrative. Additionally, >!Dawkins conclusion felt really forced and that's a shame because I imagine it'll be a driving plot point going forward. For instance it was never clear to me why Dawkins thinks that she is the leader of the Emeralds with Alexander acting as her hand compared to the simpler explanation that Alexander overtook the gang and she left.!<
      ```

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        First of all, I'm glad you liked it so far!

        That said, yeah, the aimlessness is bothering me too, and I'm hoping to spice up the narrative with a bit more action and plot soon. Related specifically to this, the biggest problem I'm having is that writing about Issa's >!loneliness and the inability to make meaningful connections with other people which is supposed to be a major character trait!< is difficult to make into a compelling plot (or at least my skills aren't quite food enough to make it so). 

        About the interlude, >!it's something I'll revisit/tweak eventually and was rather rushed, but my main goal was to try to make the opposition seem less incompetent--they *are* an effective interstellar bureaucracy after all. So far, Issa has been convinced that she's pulled the wool over everyone's eyes about everything she does, and I wanted to illustrate that while she's good, she's not getting away with as much as she thinks she is.!<

        Thanks for the feedback though; when I go back and tweak it, >!I'll try to make Dawkins conclusions a bit more logical, but his conclusions being off-target or overstated are supposed to align with his department's drive to produce results first and foremost. He's supposed to act like something of a salesman, and he's trying to sell a narrative of a "big break" that he hopes will get him a promotion/kickback eventually, even if his theorizing has some shaky foundations.!<

    Last and First Men and Star Maker, by Olaf Stapledon, are well worth checking out. The oldest examples I know of, written in 1930 and ‘37 respectively. Prose can be a bit dry, but they are an absolute font of ideas and deserve more attention. 

    The first is a history of humanity from the then present day through our eventual demise, and the second is the same, for all life in the universe. Creating hiveminds, and collective consciousness are major parts of both!

    [Hive Minds Give Good Hugs](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/45048/hive-minds-give-good-hugs) didn't grab me with the first dozen chapters, I was never a fan of "I got isekai'd time to waffle through a wilderness survival arc" starts to stories, and the "isekai'd into alien bug queen with a swarm" thing is the same as what I'd already read in "I don't want to be the Hive Queen" except with a hive mind instead of telepathically-controlled drone colony (Hive Queen which is just a generally average story, so better than average Royalroad fare but not exactly worth a recommendation). All that said, it's from the same author as Vigor Mortis, which is brilliant, so that's solid justification to at least mention Hive Minds Give Good Hugs here as possibly worth looking into.

Evelyn's response is the kind of ridiculous self-sacrificing that even fairy tales don't include because it stretches believability more than magical beans do.

  A couple of book recommendations.

  [Artifact Space by Miles Cameron](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56097208-artifact-space). This is a military sci-fi with the arc of a coming-of-age fantasy, which is a positive for me since I usually find mil-scifi boring. Miles Cameron is [Christian Cameron's](https://christiancameronauthor.com/about-christian-cameron/) pen name for fantasy ([Traitor Son](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13616278-the-red-knight), [Cold Iron](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30344847-cold-iron)). This is his first sci-fi.

  Why do I recommend the book? It's just really good. The writing is excellent, but the standout features are the same as I've seen other reviewers of Cameron mention: his attention to detail and verisimilitude. I don't know how Cameron brings verisimilitude to a completely fantastical future scenario, but he somehow manages. Despite this, the book is largely well paced and remains gripping throughout, with one small slow section near the middle.

  For comparisons, I would rate it above Project Hail Mary but not The Martian. The Expanse (books, not TV) also comes to mind as a comparison, in the quality of characterisation, plotting, and mechanics of operating in space being generally accurate. Artifact Space also has a more authentic feel to the military elements. I would rate it about on par with the best of The Expanse, so in practice better than any individual book.

  [Oh Great! I Was Reincarnated as a Farmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57968407-oh-great-i-was-reincarnated-as-a-farmer). What?! A LitRPG of published book quality, if it were another genre? Sarcasm aside, if you like LitRPG and are on this subreddit you should read this, because I'm going to claim it's rational. 

  It's a deconstruction of portal fantasy LitRPG. It has few original elements, but it takes its own premises seriously unlike literally every other LitRPG I've seen except WtC. Characters generally act, plan, and have beliefs that make sense in their context; the system, although not fully explicit, at least seems "neutral" in the way natural laws do rather than specifically set up to either screw over the MC or give them special advantages. The MC screws up, but actually changes how he does things to get better results in the future, as opposed to lucking out enough times until his stats brute force any problem.

  I think a few quotes will be illustrative rather than me writing more:

  >“It means I was paid to play games.”

  >“And you think that will help you make money in our world?”

  >“Well, your laws kind of sound like what we would call ‘mechanics’ in some of the games I used to play. It was sort of my job to understand those mechanics and learn how to take advantage of them, finding weaknesses that could be used to my team’s advantage.”

  >“Ah, in our world, the scholar class fills this function. They study each class, finding each method for gaining experience more easily, and sell that information to the class they specialise in.”

  >“We have a thing called walkthroughs that people read to do the same thing. But what I’m talking about is more specialised. It was my job to find ways no one had ever thought of doing something, adding weird quirks together to create unexpected results.”

  >“Oh, you were an exploitationist. That can be quite profitable if you are successful.”

  >“How profitable?”

  >“Very in some cases; exploitationists receive a 25% experience bonus when anyone uses their method to gain experience. Of course, that will only apply to your class, as you cannot receive experience from another class.”

  >“That’s what I will do then.”

  >“You will fail. Scholars and exploitationists have devoted centuries to discovering new ways of gaining experience. New methods for exploitation are now all small discoveries, and rare.”

  >“Alright, maybe I won’t do that.

  ---

  >The sword was another one of those stupid rules. Farmers couldn’t wield swords or weapons, like at all. Apparently, they would buck in our hand, throwing themselves out of our grasp. The arrogant furry asshole claimed that it was a common drinking game for farmers to see how long they could hold on for before they lost their grip. ...

  >I mean, speaking from a purely physics line of reasoning, where the hell was the energy that threw the sword from my grasp coming from? What was creating it? It wasn’t like I had some mental block that wouldn’t allow me to pick it up. The sword physically didn’t want to stay in my hand. Something was actively trying to force it out. I mean if this was a full immersion VR game this might make sense. But this wasn’t a game. I was in another world. Something I couldn’t see was physically stopping me. The energy expenditure to stop me from doing something so trivial was insane.

  >“I am all for testing a theory, but what you are doing is now bordering on insanity,” Salem said, his tone bored.

  ---

  >“If the foundation of the system is farming, shouldn’t the system be more rewarding? Everything you’ve told me about farmers says that it’s one of the more difficult classes to level. It takes more than a decade to get to level five without assistance.”

  >“Ah, you have made a false assumption from living here in Blackwood. That is my fault. This was originally built as an independent village. The farmers’ forefathers were hermits who rejected society. They individually own their farms which makes them ineffective. Traditionally, farms are large operations where hundreds to thousands of farmworkers work under a landlord. Farmers as a class are not meant to grow independently but as a collective. How to explain…ah…think of farms like an assembly line rather than individual constructions. You told me you have them in your world so it should help you understand. Working as a group speeds up their growth.”

  >“Even if that is true, it would still make more sense to make the class easier to level…unless, how high does your average farmer grow in their lifetime?”

  >“High forties,” Salem said.

  >“And from what you’ve told me, a farmer is at their most cost-effective at around level thirty which means they spend the majority of their professional life locked at that level bracket. This means the system is designed to stop a farmer from leveling further. It doesn’t need a whole lot of farmers around level ninety; it needs a whole lot of them around level thirty.”

  >“Yes.”

  >“So the reason I feel like it’s rigged against me is because it is rigged against me.”

  >“Yes.”

  >... “I’m beginning to believe your assessment of the situation. And I’m really not interested in farming, and I will need to make money eventually. I figure there are a few books from my world that will do just as well in yours as they did in mine and if I can learn to read and write your language maybe I can translate them. It should be enough to make a living. People are always interested in listening to us incarnates on account of our title making us more interesting.”

  >Salem chuckled. “As far as plans go it is not terrible or original. There are many incarnate who have done the same. Perhaps with my guidance, you will be one of the ones who are successful enough to purchase experience.”

  >“I hope so.”

    That dialogue feels really stiff, and comes across as an infodump. I get that the author has to give background info to the reader, but giving too much at once isn't great.

    Anyways, I gave the first chapter a read, and it's not very encouraging,

    > The small acolyte cowered, but she did not run. I sat there, trembling with fury, angrier than I’d ever been, but she was like ten. And I wasn’t about to hit a ten-year-old, no matter how angry I was, even if she had accidentally killed me.

Secondly, if you are planning to beat her for killing you, temple regulations require you use a cane. In the past, we’ve had too many priests and priestesses a little too eager to lay hands on our young acolytes.”
    > 
    > I stared at the archbishop, confused. Her tone was far too calm. “Wait, you want me to beat her?”
    > 
    > The archbishop shrugged, not at all concerned by my anger. “She is going to be punished for her actions, and whether I do it or you do it makes little difference to me.” She turned to the girl whose eyes were glued to the cane. “Your instructors have been too lenient, Damella. They gave you permission to use this altar for minor rituals. You used that permission to sneak a dead body in here and attempt a full resurrection. Now, we must deal with the results of your actions, actions which have irrevocably changed the trajectory of someone’s life. You will find no more chances, no more special treatment. Today, you face judgement. Today you receive the most severe reprimand I am allowed to issue and it is honestly not enough after what you have done…so prepare yourself for punishment.”
    > 
    > The girl didn’t protest. She didn’t deny her actions. She moved forward and placed her hands upon the altar bending forward slightly, not bending over like they used to do in Catholic school, more like how people used to stand when they were flogged. Her body trembled as she bravely resigned herself to her fate.
    > 
    > The archbishop stepped forwards and brought the cane down across the girl’s lower back. Whack! Damella shrieked. Three more blows followed in quick succession, one on the back of the thighs, one on the middle of the back and the last across the shoulder blades. Whack! Whack! Whack! The blows were so quick the girl didn’t have time to inhale before crying out, so only breathless whimpers followed.

    >I’d gotten in exactly three swings with the cane before the archbishop took it back. The excited grin that suddenly appeared on my face, no matter what it looked like, hadn’t been some sort of perverted enjoyment. Yes, I was excited, but not for what was going on—well, not for that part of what was going on. No, my excitement was for the damage prompts. Each strike elected a point of damage. And each point of damage created a little prompt.

    Those quotes are, as the saying goes, self-recommending.

    There's majority of the reviews on RR are about an idiot MC though which I'm strongly allergic to. What do you feel about that?

    Skimming through the first two chapters previews on RR, this immediately stands out as an idiot MC moment:

    > “Alright, maybe I won’t do that. So we’ll hang out in our room for a few days while you teach me the basics and then we can go buy a few weapons and start leveling.”

    > Salem sighed again. “Why do you need weapons?”

    > “To kill monsters.”

    > “And why are you planning to kill monsters?”

    > “So I can level.”

    > “Of course, it is so obvious. Except you are neither a hunter, a warrior, or an adventurer, so killing monsters will gain you nothing but the loot they drop.”

    > I stared at Salem over the edge of the tub. “What…are you saying I can’t level by killing monsters?”

    > “What part of the class farmer indicates to you that you should be slaying monsters?”

    > The uneasy feeling was returning. I could sense the curveball. “No, no, no…you get experience from killing monsters. It’s the rules.”

    > “Perhaps in your world, but here, in our world, farmers gain experience by farming. This includes the planting of crops and the raising of livestock, but not the slaying of monsters.”

    > I scowled at Salem. “Bullshit. You’ve got three days to teach me the basics and then we are going monster hunting.”

    Because the first thing you do, when you have no idea how the RPG world works, is to assume everyone else in the world is wrong and your preconceptions of how the world works is right. And this comes immediately after the MC has gotten bitten by his preconceptions twice in a row in quick succession.

      I think it makes sense in context. He's not thinking clearly and the full reality of his situation hasn't hit him, so he's latching on to the first thing that gives him hope in order to avoid processing his grief about losing his family and the effect him suddenly dying would have had and so on. Essentially, he's in denial.

      I guess people brainlessly calling "idiot MC" whenever someone makes a less than optimal choice is to be expected, but he really isn't an idiot. He's just human and dealing with a lot of repressed emotion at that point, and I don't think his situation feels fully real yet.

      This is explicitly dealt with in the text, by the way. It's one of the better "oh shit I'm in another world having lost everything" reactions I've read. Most stories either have the MC just ignore it or have some crude, over-simplified reaction. It's also much closer to how grief really works, often, than most stories.

      E: Reflecting, I guess you can see him go through the stages of grief; Anger, bargaining, denial, acceptance. Granted the whole "stages of grief" model is itself simplified, but there is definitely a grain of truth to it, which lends a bit more humanity to the MC than you usually get.

      E2: To more fully address your concern, he does make some questionable choices, but then he also makes some excellent choices and learns from his mistakes. Notably, his first instinct is (after getting his head back together) generally to enlist the help of experts wherever feasible, get the relevant information, and spend the necessary time making preparations. It's a bit of a spoiler to talk about the climax so I won't, but I promise you'll enjoy it :)

  So just out of curiosity are there any good fics that deconstruct the bad boss trope? Basically I'm looking for fics that show how villains that only command others through force and fear and mistreat their underlings just for fun won't get them any results. In fact, such a command style will likely reduce the chances of getting more people to work for them, and the henchmen that currently work for them are likely to desert or stab them in the back the first chance they get.  
  Note: I'm just looking for fics that deconstruct bad bosses not bad parents or parental figures since that is another can of worms all together.

    My first thought is the AW Death Star project management fic, Instruments of Destruction
    ```

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
    ```
    Off the top of my head:

    * A practical guide to evil

    * Only villains do that 

    * The Devil's foundry 

    Kinda fit what you're looking for, to varying degrees.
    ```

  - u/pldl:
    ```
    I've given this some thought, and I think the best answer is that this trope is already self-deconstucting in the matter you describe.

    Your concerns on this being a poor management style are often addressed within the story.

    Bad bosses often do get betrayed by their minions. At least half the time Bad Boss is used, they get betrayed by people they mistreated. Bad boss is probably the most efficient way to justify team-switch because it removes loyalty from consideration.

    Bad bosses might be extremely powerful, making it difficult for most people to even consider actual resistance. If they ever lose power near their minions, they are always killed by them. 

    Bad bosses might have limitless cannon fodder (usually demon lords or something).

    Most importantly, Bad bosses basically always lose. It's basically a glowing neon sign made by the author saying "THIS BAD GUY IS ALSO BAD AT BEING A LEADER (and you know it is going to come back and bite him)".

  I read a bit about the Russian Revolution, and felt incredibly saddened by the fates of the Anarchists and the Kronstadt Mutineers. Can anyone recommend a story with a similar vibe as the Russian Revolution, but with a happier ending or while being less bleak?

  To ask for something completely different: I want to read about "outed" magical girls. Where everyone knows they're fighting against witches/demons/evil, and they get tons of help and support from the adults instead of having it stay secret. I think it would be really nice to read something like *Yuki Yuuna is a Hero* without the main characters being so isolated.

    [To The Stars](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars) is definitely the latter and very good to boot, though it's set in a sci-fi future.

    "Fall revolution" series by Ken MacLeod kind of related to Russian Revolution mixed with tech singularity, but it's not especially rosy.

    "Floating World" by Cecelia Holland, anarchysm is important in the plot, but it's as much or more bleak as real-world Russian Revolution. 

    As a rule if you have anarchism in science fiction it's usually a sad tale.
    I can't recall any anarchism in (good) fantasy though. IMHO it shouldn't be a problem to have anarchism with happy ending in fantasy, don't know why it's not happening,

    From the non-fiction, you can read about Spanish Civil War, where anarchists played important part, with the as bad outcome as in Russian Revolution.
    ```

    - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
      ```
      > As a rule if you have anarchism in science fiction it's usually a sad tale.

      A few happy anarchist societies come to mind:

      * Eric Frank Russell's "...And Then There Were None" (1951), which was later tweaked/expanded to become the last part of [The Great Explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Explosion) (1962)
      * James P. Hogan's [Voyage from Yesteryear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_from_Yesteryear) (1982)

      Whether L. Neal Smith's [The Probability Broach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Probability_Broach) (and sequels) and Iain M. Banks's [the Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series) count depends on your definition of "anarchism" and, in Banks's case, "happy".
      ```

    - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
      ```
      > but it's not especially rosy.

      Dunno, after the nuclear fallout has settled, MacLeod's series shows *two* stable Anarchist societies, one communist and one capitalist. That's a lot more optimistic about the stability of anarchist systems than I usually see.
      ```

  - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
    ```
    I can think of only one alternative history of the Russian revolution with the following characteristics:

    * a happy ending
    * an anarchist/socialist perspective
    * available in a West European language

    *Voyage de mon frère Alexis au pays de l'utopie paysanne* by the Russian economist and gothic fiction author Alexander Chayanov was a self-described "peasant utopia" first published in 1920. A French translation was published in 1976 -- see [the French Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Chayanov).
    ```

    - u/thebastardbrasta:
      ```
      It doesn't have to be alternate history. It could just be very obviously inspired by the actual revolution, like the incredibly large amount of anime very obviously inspired by WW2. And I would also be happy about a story where the Whites win the civil war without annihilating any hint of idealism.
      ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        In [Vassily Aksyonov's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Aksyonov) 1981 (Eng. tr. 1983) *Island of Crimea*, the remnants of the White Army managed to prevent the Red Army from capturing the eponymous island [sic] in 1920. A few years later, the island [sic] transitioned to liberal democracy. It did quite well for itself over the course of the next 50 years and that's where things stood at the start of the narrative. Unfortunately, the ending is not what you are asking for, so it's not a perfect match, but it's the best I can think of at the moment.

        What makes the Russian revolution and the subsequent Civil war appealing to alt. history fans is the number of parties and factions involved. If you examine just the socialist part of the political spectrum, there were 7 nationwide socialist political parties and a dozen major factions in 1917 alone and that's not counting political parties formed by ethnic minorities. Once the Bolsheviks seized power in November 1917, some joined them in a coalition government, some became a loyal opposition and some formed an alternative government in the Ural-Volga region.

        Again, this is just nationwide socialist parties. Anarchists, liberals, monarchists, minority nationalists, etc had parties and factions of their own. They sometimes allied with other factions and sometimes fought against them. Even the Bolsheviks almost split in early 1921 and they were probably the most cohesive major political party during that period.

        If you tweak a few factors here and there, you can come up with any number of different permutations and outcomes.

    It's technically Alternate-HIstory, but if you vibe with that then I'd thoroughly recommend **[Reds!](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Reds)** (TVtropes page linked because there's a couple different threads, I believe the [SufficientVelocity one](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/reds-a-revolutionary-timeline.48563/) is considered the 'final version', the version I read was the ).

    Obviously, not quite a fic as popularly defined, but it does a pretty good job of interspersing "excerpts", narrative segments, "news reports", etc.

    Elevator pitch is that a series of butterflies around the turn of the 20th century leaves America in a somewhat more fragile state, and the Socialist Party a permanent political contender instead of slowly dying out in the 10s and 20s like in real life. Events cascade, and the Great Depression breaks America's back, sparking off a major civil war with the dissident left as the ultimate victors. It's, obviously, pretty directly inspired by both the Russian Revolution and the series of uprisings and civil wars that swept across Eurasia in its aftermath.

    I'd consider it optimistic in the sense that it has an ultimately very hopeful view of social revolution and its consequences, and doesn't feature any major reaction crushing everybody's dreams, or consider that a necessary consequence, like in god-knows-how-much western media that features social revolutions of some sort. The author seems to sympathize with left-libertarian currents, judging by the portrayals as well.

    ----

    You can also check out stories written by early socialists. Jack London, author of Call of the Wild, also wrote **[Iron Heel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iron_Heel)**, a novel eerily prescient of the rise of Fascism, which ends on the victory of the 'Brotherhood of Man'. It is, however, fairly didactic. 

    Lenin's famous pamphlet on tasks and methods of communist organization, What is to be Done, was in fact titled after **[an 1800's Russian novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_to_Be_Done%3F_(novel))**. While highly political, it is structured around a romance plot, so be forewarned.

    Edward Bellamy wrote **[Looking Backward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_Backward)** in 1888, and it's about a time traveller being pulled to the socialist future of far-off 2000! That framing device, of course, does mean that you don't really see much of how it got that way.

    There's also some good contemporary lit along the lines of what you're looking for. Ursula K LeGuin (rest in peace), titan of science fiction, wrote **[The Dispossessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed)**, which is considered a modern revival of utopian literature, and was written as a bit of a meditation on anarchist utopias. 

    Honestly, there's tons of these, they just tend not to feature revolutions as a central element, if at all, as early utopian socialists tended to prefer their political imaginations... *unblemished* by historical experience, and the wave of 20th century revolutions and their repression hadn't happened yet to knock them out of that.

    Terry Bisson's **[Fire on the Mountain](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/166902.Fire_on_the_Mountain)** is a narratively-told alternate history novel about a successful black revolution in the south being sparked off my John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, with the framing device being a hopeful portrayal of an independent socialist black republic in the south.

    Honourable mention to Ken Macleod, who's written both far-future and day-after-tomorrow science fiction circling socialist politics, although my opinion of his writing swings wildly from book to book, so you may want to pick through them on your own and come to your own judgements about if you want to spend time on them.

    ----

    Finally, I'll say that history can be *depressing* and *inspiring* depending on where you set the beginning and end points for your considered portion. China Mieville recently took a break from writing excellent speculative/weird fiction to put out **[October](https://www.versobooks.com/books/2731-october)**, a really gripping narrative-style zoomed-in history of the Russian Revolution, specifically the year of 1917 only, which I absolutely love. You really get a sense for the world-shattering upheavals that were the February and October revolutions, and the sense of hope in the air, and he manages to both show the broad-strokes strategic and world-historic elements and evolutions, and really get you to know the characters who took part, from Lenin to the Czar and everyone in between. In the epilogue, he writes that the eventual freezing-over of the revolution and its hopes was "not a given, was not written in any stars", and I think the book does a pretty good job of showing that.

    Hi I’m the author 😂

    >!Book 4 follows Ian in the ascendant realm. Almost immediately upon arriving he learns from another ascendant that his world is doomed because the soul corruption from the Infinity Loop is far more dire than expected. He then seeks to find a way to return back to warn people, or at least find a way to contact people back home.!<

    >!Meanwhile, he finds out that he’s made a potent enemy out of someone from Ari’s faction and flees. He makes new allies along the way. Stuff happens (I’m not going to spoil everything) and he finds someone who is willing to help him — for a cost. Maria also comes back into the picture and they’re forced to work together to save their world.!<

    The description above is pretty terrible because I’m trying to avoid as many spoilers as possible. I will say that the beginning starts a little slow but the reception of the book overall seems to be very positive. Hope you decide to continue and feel free to ask me any questions.

      Haha awesome, thank you, author! 

      Just a heads up- I think you may need to take out the spaces between the exclamation mark and the spoiler text to make the spoiler tags work right?

      Congrats on the book launch btw. May it sell well!

      No problem with your avoiding spoilers, you've def convinced me to continue on. I was concerned that >!after ascending to the next realm and leaving behind all the characters whom we'd grown attachments to, the audience would have a hard time caring about the new realm's cast/ characters. It sounds like his home world will definitely stay relevant, with Ian one of the rare ascendents who continues to care about his origins post apotheosis.

    Same author also wrote *[Moon Shot](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/moon-shot.14085/)*, if you want a fic that takes *Worm* and makes its hope for the future even more bleak. Similarly features an SI who has the potential to turn things around.
