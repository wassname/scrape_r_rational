## Hermione Granger and the Silent Country, ch. 3: A Fine Line (pt. 14 of There is Nothing to Fear, a Gryffindor!Voldemort AU)

### Post:

The latest chapter, "A Fine Line," can be found [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/68499257). 

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

  >“There’s Ravenclaw for the smart kids, and Slytherin for the other kind of smart kids, and Hufflepuff for the kids who work hard, and then Gryffindor for the bad kids?”

  *Interesting.*  That's quite the different reputation that Slytherin and Gryffindor have achieved in this timeline.  I get that Gryffindor is now tainted by its association with Riddle, the same way Slytherin was in the canon timeline, so that makes sense, but Slytherin now being associated with "the other kind of smart kids" seems odd.  Would Slytherin now represent social intelligence?

  Also: the poor hat spends all year coming up with a new song, and Tom mutes it so that no one can hear.  That's just cruel.

    Social intelligence + general shrewdness / lateral thinking. 

    That's how the BB students see it, anyway.

    Can't let the hat propagandize at the impressionable students!

  I wonder how Riddle looks from a left-wing perspective. I mean having a society that discriminates to the point that certain people(/species) are cut off from schools and opportunities is a thing, but the scale of it in magical Britain, and the difference in what you can achieve with and without a wand, would people "accept" the cost of totalitarian Riddle as a net gain?

  I mean current left-wing mainstream stuff has plenty of proponents of non-violence, people point to Gandhi often, but he also wanted the Jewish people in WW2 to "offer themselves to the butcher's knife" because he lacks empathy (he was a racist sexual predator btw, you don't sleep naked with your 18 yr old grandniece nearly 6 decades your junior if you're a decent person). I know this is just a singke, very dramatic, example, but there's been enough people literally fighting for their rights over history, who have only achieved something at the cost of bloodshed, that complete dismissal of those means by people without those lived situations, it seems so privileged. I mean revolutions, civil wars, less bombastic/immediate things like the Black Panther Party and some Antifa groups.

  I may have gone too specifically political there, but like the sheer difference in quality of life and rights for Goblins here is so much more major than what wizards lost it seems to me. The fact that all the Riddle perspectives are from people either human or human-passing is also worth noting.


  Also, re: muggleborn forced adoption, this seems a bit more grey than at first glance. Like Hermione's parents literally cannot see ghosts for example, there are huge parts of wizard culture (and ability) that they are literally incapable of teaching to their child. For example, if you lost your capability to walk in exchange for being raised by your birth parents (who themselves could not walk) instead of foster parents, would you make that choice for yourself? Would people who had spent their life able to walk make the same choice for you as a child? I've had enough issues with (birth and not) parents and had enough friends in the same boat that I'm dismissive of birth parents (or otherwise 'unverified' parents) having any special inherant merit, but probably am too bias against it here.

  Loss of culture is a significantly more difficult question, but I guess it's easier to pick up muggle culture later on than wizard culture later on? Like so many muggles literally do not know wizards exist in the first place. And it's a lot easier  to learn to use muggle tools as an adult than it is to learn to use a wand as an adult, as well as losing a lot less opportunities than you otherwise would have. I'd be better off as a wizard without a smart phone than a muggleborn without a wand. That said, answering in such a way is concerning, I'm Australian and our Stolen Generation stuff is Fucked Up.

    One thing is certain: this Riddle is a *far* more interesting antagonist.

    I am assuming this is a one point of divergence fic, where the only difference is the Sorting Hat's successful argument to Tom Riddle that his fear of death is a weakness best purged through Gryffindor companionship. In that case, we can be certain he *is,* in fact, a villain. He does not personally care for the people he protects, because he is entirely incapable of empathy. His concern is immortality, though of an apparently different sort. He's doing all of this solely for himself.

    He appears to have traded Stalin's terminal paranoia for *something else.* He isn't purging every competent person in a position of any power for fear that they might overthrow him, and thus causing administrative disaster, famine, and military disorder. Indeed, with such a small population, who will never fear starvation due to their magic, it wouldn't have mattered much if he had been Stalin's equal on the ladder of paranoia. He could not cause a Holodomor if he tried. But Dumbledore saw a flaw in his being, something which would cause him to fall. Moreover, Dumbledore, who championed the rights of all, was fighting against the man who did the same. There is something wrong with Riddle besides psychopathy.

    But I really don't think we know enough to say whether this Riddle's rule is a net positive. The upsides are obvious, and as you have said, clearly worthy. Far more magical sapients are visibly included in all walks of public life. There are no children missing from canon, implying his revolution was scrupulous in sparing their lives. He does, at least, have some sort of compelling reason to abduct muggleborns, to protect them from the consequences of uncontrolled accidental magic. The Lost Generation could not have hurt themselves or others had they simply been left alone, while an unaware magical child clearly can. He's even treating the Basilisk with dignity, which I wouldn't have thought to do.

    But there are far too many questions. They teach Dark Arts to children. Maybe that means it's a defense course with real teeth, but it could also be indoctrination and the swearing of binding oaths. We haven't seen nor heard from the House Elves yet, and the Centaurs are similarly absent. The Sorting Hat has been silenced. It's pretty clear that discipline at this school involves some form of torture, though we don't know what, why, or how it is justified. And, as is likely to be further explained in the next installment, they open each term with a duel, which they are required to watch whether or not they want to.

    It is, as Hermione puts it, ominous.

      > In that case, we can be certain he *is*, in fact, a villain.

      Motives shouldn't be a concern, only actions. There have been plenty of great people throughout history who were mostly concerned about themselves, and plenty of terrible people fully convinced they were in the right and that what they were doing was best for others.

      If his goal is to be immortalized metaphorically by creating a more just society then that's good. If his goal is to create a society that might find a solution to actual immortality that doesn't involve killing people, one which can be applied to everyone, then that's also good. We don't know what his actual goal is yet (although the former seems more likely given his characterization).

      That all being said, until we know the full extent of his actions, we definitely can't say if he's evil or not. Mr. Sable is ominous. The sorting hat is ominous. Instilling dissociation into his followers by convincing them they become someone else when they put on the mask is ominous. If Riddle doesn't turn out to be actually evil in his actions it's either because he's not actually the antagonist, which would be weird; or a failure of the author's morality.

        Or because the author doesn't write characters like that? I didn't expect to read a comment like this in this subreddit. 

        Imagining that people are evil TM is something from a disney movie

        Utilitarianism is not a "failure of morality" and it's hard for me to imagine someone writing this unless you are claiming to be a prophet who has somehow access to objective morality

        The book will be much more interesting with a nuanced antagonist, though it's even more interesting if society is the antagonist, sociological instead of psychological.

          Evil according to my perception of morality, of course. Subjectivity is implied. I'm not doing that Disney shit, I'm saying that if all he's done is the worst of what he's presented as having done so far then he shouldn't be presented as the antagonist. We shouldn't be expected to sympathize with people whose goal it is to defeat him, as is almost definitely the case with Harry and probably will be with Hermione. 

          The failure of morality wouldn't be just in making him utilitarian, it would be if the author made him the antagonist and presented him as villainous even if the worst thing he's doing is just extreme methods to achieve a just cause.

          I agree with your statement on sociology being the villain, but that's not the story I've been reading so far, so it seems unlikely for that to happen.

            The story has spent a lot of time on societal implications but yeah the great man theory works against that. And it doesn't seem like Hermione is going to be that much changed by the institutional differences of her life

              The main difference with her seems to be that she's more confident, which the author might be doing to make up for the possible absence of Ron---I noticed he wasn't mentioned this chapter even while the twins and Ginny were. Hopefully Harry's time at Durmstrang has changed him a lot more, because I'd be happy to see him switched to his opposite the same way Riddle has been.

      If Hitler or Stalin were only concerned about themselves the world would have been improved (probably), psychopaths and sociopaths are a tiny proportion of society and racists, nationalists, and supremacists are not composed entirely of them. Look at how much suffering humans cause to non-human animals, it's not a requirement that you lack empathy to hurt others. Indeed if anything someone who lacks empathy treats everyone equally (unless it benefits whatever goal they have) unlike the people who do the most harm who have an ingroup where they are empathetic and an outgroup who they do not care about.

      - u/Frommerman:

        I'd argue the primary problem with Stalin *was* that he cared only about himself. He was an extraordinarily paranoid man, which is why he gulaged all the administrators who might have been able to prevent famines, and also all his good generals.
        ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          A paranoid person would not be best served by putting himself in charge of a country which is one of the best ways to paint a target on yourself.

          He had other motivations but one was because he cared about his country and how it was ran and other things like that. He didn't accidentally rise to the top, nor did he randomly implement policies. He forced collectivization when he easily could've not because he cared about his ideology
          ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:

    That's a good question, and it's difficult to answer because Riddle's Britain is such a mixed bag.

    The goblins seem to have only benefited, no question about it: They get to have wands. They are permitted, but apparently not *required*, to attend Hogwarts. Also (to point out a couple things that haven't come up yet), they have guaranteed seats on the Wizengamot *and* goblin property laws take precedence in interactions between goblins and wizards (this includes the Sword of Gryffindor). 

    Other nonhumans, part-humans, etc are also doing better, it seems. 

    The Wizengamot itself has been reorganized and is, at least on its face, a more democratic institution (the pre-revolutionary Wizengamot had only five directly-elected seats out of fifty). 

    Muggles are *probably* benefitting overall (Britain's actions have really strengthened the nuclear disarmament movement) but let's not forget that [the French government thinks the British are abducting muggle kids](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27264121/chapters/66607840) and has no idea why (too many kids are disappearing for them to all be muggle-borns). It's really hard to say that Riddle's regime is "good" for muggles, when all the good stuff is a side effect of "Riddle doesn't want Britain to be targeted in a nuclear war" and meanwhile there's, well, dozens of kids disappearing in Scotland alone. Saying "but more people are being saved in the case of a nuclear war, so the math checks out!" feels like it's missing the point. 

    It's also difficult to really spin the muggle-born abductions in a good way. As readers have pointed out in the past, Riddle is a magic supremacist, so it's probably not too far from the truth to say that cultural cleansing / indoctrination is not just a side effect of stealing muggle-borns, but the whole *point*. A more progressive strategy would be to keep muggle-borns with their birth families but approach them long before it's time for Hogwarts (ideally, as soon as you notice them use accidental magic). 

    But the question isn't "is Riddle's government good?" It's more like "is Riddle's government good *enough*?" Can we tolerate the skulls on the road if we think that there are fewer skulls now than in yesterday's world? 

    That's a harder question to answer, because we don't necessarily live in a world where skull-free roads are possible. Suffice it to say, Riddle couldn't stay in power if everyone in Britain turned against him, which means that he has to actually keep at least *some* groups happy. Is it possible to remove some skulls over *here* without adding more skulls over *there*? What if Riddle's government is actually the best system possible under the current circumstances, because anything else will break down the coalition that maintains it or even because Riddle himself is necessary to the system because nobody else has generated enough trust with e.g. the goblins? 

    All this is to say that, despite being a socialist, I couldn't personally accept Riddle's Britain, but a Stalinist would probably have fewer issues.
    ```

    - u/t3tsubo:

      A good analogy for Riddle's justification for abducting muggle kids would be doctors forcing deaf parents who have deaf kids to give the kid a hearing implant when the parents would otherwise have raised their kid in "deaf culture".

That said, child protective services sometimes do play important roles; when it's ok is just a more complicated question than you're giving it credit

      > Saying "but more people are being saved in the case of a nuclear war, so the math checks out!" feels like it's missing the point.

      That's utilitarianism. You might feel confident that there's no nuclear war because you're alive now but if we were the last remnants of a destroyed planet then I expect you'd be saying "What of course let Hitler live if it keeps nuclear war from happening" 

      It's totally reasonable to respond to extinction level threats with serious action. If a gamma ray hits the earth tomorrow the few survivors in the space station will wish say, that we didn't go into lockdown and sent a colony to Mars instead. (this is obviously a false dichotomy but it's illustrative)

      Socialized parenting is progressive in any case, parents raising their children is traditionalist
      ```

      - u/callmesalticidae:
        ```
        Oh, sure! What makes the utilitarian calculus weird for me in this instance is that all of the good effects (heck, *all* of the effects, really) on muggles are just happenstance: Riddle is doing stuff that *just so happens* to reduce existential risk for muggles, and "is this good for muggles?" doesn't seem to enter into his decision-making at all. 

        (So, "Riddle's regime is a net positive for muggles right now" might be true, but it's overlooking the vital point that the math could change at any moment because Riddle isn't actually *trying* to improve muggle welfare, and he would *pose* an existential risk to muggles in the moment that this seemed like something he could and ought to do.)

        > Socialized parenting is progressive in any case

        Right now, the muggle-borns aren't getting socialized parenting, they're still being parented by specific sets of parents, just not the parents they were born to.
        ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          Sure, it's like how animals can become better off because of human laws but it's just happenstance. For example when royalty wanted hunting grounds it was good for the animal because here was a preserved area for them.

          >(So, "Riddle's regime is a net positive for muggles right now" might be true, but it's overlooking the vital point that the math could change at any moment because Riddle isn't actually trying to improve muggle welfare, and he would pose an existential risk to muggles in the moment that this seemed like something he could and ought to do.)

          I'm just considering it from "intelligent life" in which case if muggles need to be sacrificed it's better than nothing surviving in the empty universe. Of course, false dichotomy 

          >

          Yeah I was being lazy with my use of words. It's not collectivized but exchanging biological children is not a traditionalist perspective. Obviously most of the examples from our world are of attempted ethnic cleansing but you can use progressive and traditional tools to that. Breaking up the family units of aboriginals for example is not traditionalist even if it was done by traditionalists
          ```

          - u/Frommerman:
            ```
            Are there *any* examples of the systematic fracturing of the family units of an entire category of people resulting in a remotely positive outcome? We do it for children of abusive or drug-addicted parents, certainly, but that's not quite the same.  There's generally investigation, due process, and efforts at remediation before we resort to taking the kids away. Riddle appears instead to be abducting children the moment they express magic, and mind-wiping the parents so they can't complain.

            Like, did we do something like that with the children of Nazi loyalists? I don't think so, but it may have actually been a decent idea just to accelerate de-Nazification and turn that entire generation against their parents as quickly and seamlessly as possible. But that's the only kind of circumstance where I can see this going well.

    >I wonder how Riddle looks from a left-wing perspective.

    I'm going to need to set this up a bit.  Please keep in mind that any definitions of "left" and "right" are my own, and I fully expect you to hold different definitions.

    First, I'm going to discard the idea that the "social" and "economic" ideas of the left and right are somehow separable.  The social ideal of the left is a flat, diverse society, where no one has any more power than anyone else.  Their economic path to this is socialism (or, as you move closer to the centre, a "fair trade" economy).  The social ideal of the right is hierarchical, where those who have demonstrated merit are put in charge of society.  Their economic path to this is free market capitalism (or, as you move closer to the centre, regulated capitalism).  You can't really extract one from the other; the social ideals of the left are the source of their economic ideals, and the same is true of the right.

    Now, I'm sure that you're all familiar with the "political compass", which displays a square where left and right is one axis, and authoritarianism (up) and statelessness (down) is the other.  This axis is about how much power a state (or other similar institution) should have to further your ideals.  So, the further you are to the left, the more the state (such as it exists) should be benefiting everyone, the further to the right you are, the more it should be benefiting the meritorious over the lazy, the criminal, and the otherwise abhorrent.

    There is an inherent lie to this compass, in that a square is entirely the wrong shape: three of the "corners" can't exist.  You can't reach the "stateless hierarchy" corner, because any functional hierarchy is basically a state by a different name.  You can't reach the "stateless flat, diverse society" corner, because such a corner requires commonality of belief, and whatever institution is enforcing such commonality on a diverse populace is basically a state by a different name.  You can, theoretically, have a flat, diverse society with an all-powerful state, but the rules you'd have to construct to prevent those working for the state from benefiting themselves, their families, patrons, etc., are exactly the kind of rules that humans are good at finding loopholes in, so it's practically impossible.  Hierarchy/authoritarianism is the one corner of that graph that can exist; that basically describes feudalism, which is how most of Western society was organized between the fall of the Roman Republic and the Reformation.

    There's one more axis I want to bring into this, which is legitimacy vs tyranny, and this has to do with the *public perception* of the government.  Let's discard the left-right axis, for the moment, and look at the relationship between this axis and the "up-down" axis.  A state which is universally regarded as legitimate *will not* be overthrown; a state which is powerful enough *cannot* be, and a state which is **both** is basically invincible.  However, there's a nice, wide quarter-circle towards the weak-state/tyrannical corner where a state is vulnerable to being overthrown, regardless of whether its ideals are towards the left or the right.

    So, as a leftist, politics is the art of using the government to break down hierarchies and promote equality, while rooting out people who would use it to increase hierarchy to their own benefit, and giving the government enough power to do so, but *not* so much power that it becomes impossible to overthrow if it slides into tyranny.

    ...It's not an easy balance to find, and one of the biggest problems in left-wing politics is the knowledge that to reach total equality requires either tyranny or complete intellectual conformity, and this tends to lead to purity tests, infighting, and even, in rare cases, violent purges (e.g. the Reign of Terror in France, or the Great Purge in Soviet Russia), which are inimical to the spirit of a flat, diverse society.

    With all of that sorted out, let us consider Riddle's Britain.

    On the stateless-authoritarian scale, it is near the far top of the graph, nearly perfectly authoritarian.  Riddle is completely in charge of his Death Eaters; the Death Eaters are in complete control of the State; the State is powerful enough to control the wizarding world, and the wizarding world has completely subsumed the Muggle government.

    On the tyranny-legitimacy scale of public perception, there are two possible perspectives to look from.  The first is the community of wizards/witches and magical creatures, and, from their perspective, the government probably looks legitimate enough.  Casting down the nobility and raising up the magical creatures, and adding elected seats to the Wizengamot, along with bringing families like the Malfoys into the fold, have probably given Riddle enough support among the magical community that a large number of people feel that things are better under his rule.  There is undoubtedly (quiet) dissent, but, with Dumbledore gone, no apparent organized resistance.  For the muggles... we don't know what things are like.  Probably bad.  We haven't been given a window into the Muggle world, other than that brief glance at the aftermath of the dragon attack (Muggle casualties disregarded and breathless concerns about Muggle explosives) which doesn't bode well for them.  But no matter how bad things are for the Muggles, they probably don't have the strength to resist the might of the wizarding world, if they even have the faintest idea who is oppressing them.

    As for left-right...  The Death Eaters are now the government, and one thing that this series has not done is *tell us what the Death Eaters want*. We have [vague insinuations](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15449145) of "reforms that were more extreme than anything that Riddle had thus far dared to voice except through his Death Eaters"; we have James [swearing](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24335107/chapters/58675660) to "fight, and suffer, and die for the cause of the Death Eaters," but no statement of what that cause is.  All we know is that they follow Riddle without question.  So, what does Riddle want?   We know of two things that he wants, that do not appear to be the consolidation of power for its own sake: he has personally sought out the Deathly Hallows, and the Veil of Death.

    So, with all of that preamble: how does Riddle look from a left-wing perspective?

    He's fucking terrifying.

    He's appropriating left-wing rhetoric in the name of consolidating power; he is enacting some left-wing policies for the purposes of populism.  However, the only true goals that I can infer from his actions are a quest for immortality through the Deathly Hallows, as well as gaining power for power's sake.  Yes, he has probably done some good through the nuclear disarmament of Britain, but, in doing so, he has likely removed Muggle Britain's ability to threaten his reign (which is likely the main reason why he did so).  He has done some good by demolishing some of the wizarding world's internal hierarchies, to the advantage of muggleborns and magical creatures, but he likely did so only for the political support of the Gryffindors and the creatures themselves, and has used that support to entrench an even more harmful hierarchy, with himself at the top, and Muggles in oppression at the bottom.

    He is exactly the reason why the political left often seem to value the norms and mechanisms of government more than the results which those mechanisms produce: we know what dangers lie down the path of Robespierre and Stalin, when revolutionaries talk big talk about "the Greater Good," and then achieve their goal, accrue too much power to themselves, and start purging dissidents.  The biggest difference between someone like Riddle, and Stalin and Robespierre, is that those latter two were mortal and mundane.

    So let me raise my voice against the utilitarians here and say that yes, he is a villain, regardless of the small existential good he's done thus far by disarming one country.  And he's all the more terrifying of a villain for his rise to power being so plausible.

      >Hierarchy/authoritarianism is the one corner of that graph that can exist; that basically describes feudalism, which is how most of Western society was organized between the fall of the Roman Republic and the Reformation.

      You've identified feudalism as the authright  corner, but go back further in history and you will find two of the other corners.

      >You can't reach the "stateless flat, diverse society" corner, because such a corner requires commonality of belief, and whatever institution is enforcing such commonality on a diverse populace is basically a state by a different name.

      You can, if there's a large commons. The presence of a large commons makes it difficult for anyone to exert coercive power, as people can always disengage and support themselves using the commons. Removing the *practical possibility* of oppressing others removes the need to have everyone buy into the ideological goal of not oppressing others. You can find examples of this dynamic in hunter-gatherer societies which happen to live in abundant natural environments with easy access to all of life's necessities.

      Sadly for libleft!humanity, the commons are gone, and unlike in the past our capacity for violence has expanded sufficiently to cover the entire world, so the possibility of "escaping" to the commons is gone.

      >You can't reach the "stateless hierarchy" corner, because any functional hierarchy is basically a state by a different name.

      You can, in a society which does have the concept of "legal" and "illegal", but still has practical disparities in terms of power, control, and capacity to do violence. It's not a very nice way to live. (It's also not really what libright had in mind, as libright generally does want a state to enforce property rights)

      You can find real examples of this in societies which are transitioning from foraging into subsistence agriculture. Edible wild animals and plants are in decline, so they've started scratching at the dirt to supplement their diets... and that means the beginnings of property, of defending land, and of not pissing off whoever controls that land if you'd like to eat, but that's not a state.

      >You can, theoretically, have a flat, diverse society with an all-powerful state, but the rules you'd have to construct to prevent those working for the state from benefiting themselves, their families, patrons, etc., are exactly the kind of rules that humans are good at finding loopholes in, so it's practically impossible.

      I agree that this one has not *yet* existed, but it does seem to be what modern social democracies such as Norway are aiming for, and what China/Russia promised but thoroughly didn't deliver.
