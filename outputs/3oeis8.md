## [MK][BST] Causing worldwide societal collapse.

### Post:

If I were hypothetically trying to start a society-destroying class war and had access to a boxed AI somewhat amenable to my goals(whose passwords were kept by someone who'd only give them out if they were convinced that I was a larger existential threat than the AI), a ready-made group of rioting Japanese students(high school educations) and families(people in mid-level professional positions) about 1 thousand strong and a reasonable amount of money(say 8 digits worth of american money), what should I target first?

For anyone who wants to know why I'm asking this, I'm trying to write a rational!Danganronpa prequel and I need to know how the hell [SDHSD](http://danganronpa.wikia.com/wiki/Ultimate_Despair) would grow and destroy global society.

  Class war does not destroy society. If you want to destroy society, target transportation and communication technologies. Internet backbones and distributors, airlines and aircraft factories, ships and shipworks, fuel supplies, power plants, and roads.

  The governments, police, and militaries are your biggest obstacle, because if your terrorist group is any good, your operating areas will be placed under martial law. Guerrilla tactics are necessary.

  Even after destroying a lot of infrastructure, it will be very hard to cut off long-range communication and transportation over large territories. At some point satellites would need to be destroyed, through hacking, annexing their ground controls, and launching sabotage payloads.

  This would be difficult to accomplish with only tens of millions USD, so you'll need a good source of income. It is hard to maintain a good source of income when you are trying to destroy the things that make that money valuable.

  You have access to a boxed AI, so ask it. How is it boxed?

    What's going to run without labor?  And who's going to work when they know they'll be executed as a class traitor?
