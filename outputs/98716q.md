  Your scenario's real key isn't opacity of neural networks, it's perfect coordination between actors with common interest to perform only activities that are positive sum for their entire community, without any commons problems.  This is not likely to emerge by accident in opaque systems short of general superintelligence.  It's not a communications issue, it's an incentives issue.

  Humans are black box neural-network intelligences as well, just natural instead of artificial. [Killing](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Brazilian-Indigenous-Leader-Guardian-of-the-Amazon-Murdered-20180816-0009.html) [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays#United_Fruit_and_Guatemala) [for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex) [profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto#Cost-benefit_analysis,_the_Pinto_Memo) [is](http://time.com/4989641/water-air-pollution-deaths/) [nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandal) [new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenfell_Tower_fire#Aluminium-polyethylene_cladding). Corporations can be thought of as limited-liability neural-network-guided paperclip maximizers, where paperclips = profit. As the Grenfell Tower fire illustrated, the difference between £24 per square meter for fire-resistant materials and £22 for combustible materials can be enough for human profit-optimizers to decide to drastically increase the odds of letting the building and its occupants burn to death to save a little money.

  AI is not scary because it might kill us or let us die for profit. We're already dealing with that from other people. AI is scary because it can do it better. Because it can replace us. And because it will disregard our lives once we're no longer needed. Profit is just another type of paperclip.

  Your scenario requires some extreme leaps of logic and events that could never happen in our world.

  People don't just IPO ideas, stock prices don't rise that quickly even if the algorithms saw an advantage in them doing so, because of how they work and how risk / reward is calculated.

  By the time we had perfect information algorithms trading in our markets which is never, but let's assume near perfect then, we'd have ai automated hiring if there was still a need for people to work by then.

  And you should also keep in mind, most business are small and private, they couldn't care less about stock prices. We just get this skewed view of public companies as being more relevant than they are because they are public companies and therefore more media attention is put into them.

  \>  If you have significant number of people spending a significant amount of their disposable income at McDonalds, then in the long run you've got a very advanced McChicken.

  This is just incorrect, things don't improve because they are popular or good products. To improve you have to risk it getting worst because that's how you improve, by testing different methods.

  If you are winning you have no reason to take the risk for a marginal improvement, and you have even less reason to allocate the time and resources to seek said improvement, because you're already winning.

  Winning harder is not the goal, the goal is to win with the lowest possible costs so you can have the highest possible profits.

  Edit\*

  \>  So, when some sociopath corporate guy with a drone fetish comes up with the idea to manufacture lethal drones to use against civilians? 

  This never happens because we have something called laws, regulations, rules, governments, UN intervention... 

  And even in the impossible scenario that it did pass through all these obstacles it would last long because civilians would destroy it themselves. 5 dudes that had family killed by drones; bomb the business, kill it's leadership etc. This is far more likely to happen than anything else that would have to happen to create said scenario in the first place.

      I was just replying to your question, do you think this could happen in our world? Or whatever.

      Anyway I'm not interested in agruing, let's just say I still think you are incorrect after reading your reply.

  Whatever people think of the plausability of your argument, I had at least as much fun reading it as I did writing the story. Awesome job.

  I think the idea of AI evolving a ‘behavior fog,’ a sort of persistent illusion which could excuse efficient behavior which humans might otherwise object to, is pretty cool.

  Please don't use `^tm`. Use the TM symbol (`™`): ™

  >Not Being Killed By Drones™

  It's an actual character, not a combination of characters. Just copy/paste it in.

  My interpretation of the story was that the Loom was some kind of rival network. The author of the story repeatedly mentions fractals, and in fractal geometry, similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales. I thought the ending of the story was basically implying that the "competitive model" of Rade's world, with its trading algorithms and so on, was also occuring at a higher meta-level between the drone network and the Loom network. Whereas the drone network is portrayed as uber-capitalistic, I interpreted the Loom network as more socialistic (although that was left kind of unclear and I might be reaching).

    I liked the drones. I thought they were cute.

    They only kill people sometimes. For a semi-unplanned superintelligence takeoff, that's far from the worst outcome!
