  This is getting *climactic*.  A lot of pieces have been removed from the board on both sides, and the biggest, baddest, most-foreshadowed weapons have been moved into position for the final battle.

  This month's chapter was exciting and satisfying, but I'm *really* looking forward to *next* month's.

    As someone who has never read this, should I start from the first story *The Last Angel*? Or can I start from the beginning of this story?

      I would highly recommend starting with the first, as the second is a direct continuation of the first, so without it you're missing some significant context. That said, the author did make some efforts to make the second readable without context by subtly reintroducing characters and major concepts, but I'd still read the first.  


      I mean, the first is a fantastic read as it is, as it gears up from creeping horror to full on space opera.
