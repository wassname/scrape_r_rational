It seems like a perfect fit with this sub.

    Yeah, have you read it yet? It's just so entertaining. I've learned so much, lol. I never expected actually learning something from a Harry Potter fanfiction

      He's being sarcastic. That's at the top of the recommended reading. If you scroll down the sidebar, you'll see /r/hpmor listed there because it's mentioned so often that it's a common acronym.
      ```

        I sorta figured it out after people called me out for being a troll/ignorant/sarcastic.

        Man, do I feel stupid.

          I don't think you should feel stupid. Especially don't let the rational people on this subreddit convince you that you're unintelligent because you were ignorant.

          Instead, let this be a lesson that if you plan to post to any forum that you should check the stickies at the top and the sidebar of any subreddit. Don't post to a community of people and tell them the basics of what they already know. ;)

          Yeah, this isn't something to feel stupid for. Reddit just has serious trust issues, and this is pretty much the funniest possible story you could recommend to this community. It looked dubious to most people whether you were making an ironic joke, considering your comments on how perfectly this story fit the sub. But it does seem like it was legit, and it was just an innocent misunderstanding, and is exactly as funny as I hoped it was. 

          Seriously man, I mean you were spot on about how much it fit this place. Chewing you out for not doing enough research beforehand is silly. Glad you enjoyed that story though.

      this is the fic that started the rational fic genre.  this is like going on /r/fantasy and asking if people have heard of some book called "The Fellowship of the Ring" ;D
      ```

- u/FireHawkDelta:
  ```
  That's an understatement. This sub started as an offshoot of the HPMoR community looking for similar works.
  ```

  - u/OriginalPosterz:
    ```
    ...are you serious?

    In my defence, I really wasn't aware of that. I've just been lurking for about a few weeks, reading some of the material here (Unsong, Guide to practical evil, Heroes save the world).

    No, but seriously, that is actually a pretty huge coincidence. Then again, there's no such thing as coincidences (Cue x-files theme)

      From subreddit wiki linked in the sidebar:

      >Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality - a brilliant story that blew people's minds, and created the genre of Rationalist Fiction. People who loved it created a community for sharing similar stories, discussing Rational and Rationalist Fiction, and writing HPMOR-inspired works.
      ```

      - u/MysteryLolznation:
        ```
        To be fair, there aren't that many people who bother reading the sidebar. Otherwise, there wouldn't be "READ THE SIDEBAR" in bold letters on so many popular subreddits. Less so are there people who bother reading the sub-wiki.

        Although, I must admit that /u/OriginalPosterz is either trolling or is painfully unaware, and I can't seem to decide which is worse.
        ```

        - u/tokol:
          ```
          It could be a reddit-savvy attempt to create a "Test post. Please ignore."-style post for /r/rational. Folks love ironically upvoting this kind of on-the-nose naivetÃ© (or, at least, I do).

          Even if it was intentional, I'm not sure I'd describe that as trolling though. What would you call it?

            I thought it was funny as hell. Sounds like something I would've done if I hadn't found this from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.

              The most important takeaway for you here is that while you may be better than you were at 13, you are still only 16 and in 3 more years you will feel the same way about your 16 year old self. Think about that sometime lol.

                Am I the only one who doesn't feel this way? I mean, I believe I am smarter now (21) than I was as a teenager, but I wouldn't have anything against having a conversation with my past self. In fact, I think it would have been pretty interesting.

                I hope this isn't an indication that I haven't improved myself. I don't think that's it. But I really don't feel like I was doing that badly a few years back. 16 years is a perfectly respectable age. In the age of Vikings, you went out to sea and battle once you were 15, and were then considered a man.

                  ```
                  I've met 16 year olds who don't play at headstrong, fronting, throwing opinions around, who understand that other people know things they don't. They won't necessarily seem like massive idiots to their future selves, even though they'll be just as ignorant as anyone else at that age, they're better at living with it.

                  You might have been one of those.

                  I pretty much hate every version of myself younger than 17. I did a lot of growing up in my 17th year and became the man I am today. I continue to learn and grow but that was my big turning point I look back on. That's probably a different point for different people.

                    While both OP and I have been to /r/teenagers, and /r/exmuslim, it does actually suggest that we're the same person, oddly enough.
                    This is actually pretty eery, if I do say so myself. Our ages are different, although that doesn't really prove squat because if I, indeed, was his alt, I could have lied about 'my' age.

                    I've been on this thread for a while since the original post made me cry tears of mirth. The OP also seemed painfully unaware, which made it all the more funny. Also, RES shows when new comments are added to a thread, so whenever there's a new one, I just check back in.


                    I guess the reason we write similarly is because of our browsing habits...? I mean, if we're influenced by the same things, then it could impact our writing style.


                    Then again, ye olde Occam's razor does dictate that your theory is right, as it carries fewer assumptions, as mine is just 'we're not the same person, it's all a coincidence'.


                    Huh, I really don't know how to argue about this. I'm starting to doubt myself.

  As you have been repeatedly informed, yes. We know of it XD.

  The funny thing is that the Harry Potter fanfic community really dislikes it. Well, some of them like it, but there seems to be this resentment against HPMoR since it gets recommended so often in that subreddit, and the people there generally doesn't like it. They have some genuine and well placed criticism, some of which I agree with, and some of which I don't. 

  One of the criticism includes scientific mistakes or misinformation with different facts, which I tend to agree with (Although there's not just mistakes either of course). But the fic isn't really for science, it is for rationality and philosophy, and the scientific principles are still true. So I would still defend it.

  I think it's a great piece of fiction, but it's not really a Harry Potter story. It's much more independent than most fanfics, and that's probably one of the reasons why /r/harrypotterfanfiction doesn't like it.
  ```

  - u/UnfortunatelyEvil:
    ```
    For me, the writing wasn't that good in a literary sense. I identified more with Method's Harry Potter than the original, and I loved most of the new world concepts, but it took effort to get through.
    ```

- u/abcd_z:
  ```
  The biggest gripe I have with that fanfiction is that Harry, every other character, and by extension Yudkowsky himself, seem to fetishize being analytically clever, to the extent that it stunts what should be normal social skills.  As one person commented online a while ago, conversations between Quirrel/Malfoy/Potter tend to take the form:  

  > âHere is an awesome manipulation Iâm using against youâ

  > âMy, that is an effective manipulation. You are a dangerous manâ

  > âI know, but I also know that you are only flattering me as an attempt to manipulate me.â  

  > âMy, what an effective use of Bayesian evidence that is!â

  That whole "which level are you playing at" nonsense is another example of what I'm talking about.  
  Normal people don't worry about stuff like that, trusting their fast-response social intuition instead of using their slow-response intellect to try to rationally figure out if another person is telling the truth (which isn't any more likely to be correct, and may even be worse, due to fast-response working so well with subconscious indicators).

  Additionally, Harry doesn't seem to ascribe any personhood to people who aren't as smart as he is, dividing the world into PCs and NPCs, and saying things like he doesn't see any reason for Weasley to exist.

  Also, [this page](https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/) in an archive of one person's excellent analysis and criticism of HPMoR, though it's missing several entries due to the original going down.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think EY is a bit more self aware than you give him credit for, he's stated multiple times that Harry is based on a younger vesion of himself who was more arrogant and made more mistakes. (The biggest is a spoiler but will be familiar to anyone who has read it) 

    I think it isn't always obvious because the bits where Harry is proven wrong aren't really highlighted and mainly take place in the background. E.g. its implied that the political system is more complicated than he thinks, but its never explicitly said out loud. It might have been good to add a scene where an adult character says to him "yes we've thought of arbitrage, but that would wreck the economy and make our existence obvious to muggles. So its forbidden under the terms of the 1400 goblin treaty"
    ```

    - u/Bellaby:
      ```
      Not to mention that Harry is a flawed narrator. We see (the vast majority of) the story through his eyes, of course he always seems obviously right.

      I agree that EY is much more self aware than his fictional harry. Its not a blind self-insert, though it might seem that way for those not willing to take a proper look and to just slam a popular rational story with anything that will stick

    +1

    I've always found it funny how much I like some of the fiction linked in this sub, given how much I can't stand MoR.

    I think the _main_ thing wrong with it is that the author is utterly convinced that everyone else is irredeemably stupid and incapable of having ideas of their own. The way he writes the "banking" system as something a fifth grader could get rich off of, and the law system as this weird Dark Ages formal aristocracy, and so on - it reeks of having zero faith in anyone else _even to act in their own self-interest_.

    (This comes out in the LW Sequences as well. There's some good stuff in there - I use the blegg/rube thingy about categories a lot - but it's not easy to wade through the condescension.)

    It seems like so many of the problems in the story stem from that everyone-is-sheep mentality. He diverges from canon willy-nilly because the canon isn't rational and has no value. Harry talks down to everyone and they go along with it because when God-Emperor Hariezer speaks, the sheep listen. Everyone's decisions revolve around Harry - taken to ridiculous extremes in that chapter where he successfully(!) intimidates Snape for asking him a few questions.

    Like, it's a mostly-shallow nerd fantasy along the lines of Ender's Game, and I don't begrudge people for liking it (I used to like those stories myself!), but the insistence that it's so much _more_ than a shallow nerd-fantasy is annoying.
    ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      >  it reeks of having zero faith in anyone else even to act in their own self-interest.

      Oh yeah, that's pretty much explicitly stated later in the story where Quirrelmort vents about nobody willing to go to war to stop him.

      >  Harry talks down to everyone and they go along with it because when God-Emperor Hariezer speaks, the sheep listen.

      McGonagall starts out roughly similar to canon, and the extent of her "character development", if I can call it that, is learning to go along with whatever Harriezer says.
      ```

      - u/blast_ended_sqrt:
        ```
        I think the quote that sums it up for me is that one, near the end during that ten-chapter moping session, where he says "There's no one else who could be responsible for anything". I dunno where that mentality is coming from but it does _not_ describe the world I live in.
        ```

        - u/derefr:
          ```
          It describes the world many (not most; many) people live in, dealing with things like CYA bureaucracies and petty corruption.

          You mightâespecially if you live in a city, or in a country, where most people who live there now do so because at one point they moved there voluntarilyâlive in an especially willpower-enriched filter bubble. Most of the world (esp. the third world) is not like this.

      I mean, look, not to start an argument here, but you're kind of strawmanning here, like, a lot. I'm not going to address what you said head-on, except to note that when your characterization of your opponent reads like

      > Harry talks down to everyone and they go along with it because when God-Emperor Hariezer speaks, the sheep listen.

      either your criticism is accurate, in which case your opponent would have to be a literal drooling moron, or you're deliberately leaving out nuances in an attempt to mischaracterize them/make them sound stupid/inflame other people. Guess which possibility is the more likely one? (Hint: it's not the one that relies on assuming your opponent is a total drooling moron.)

      Like, at this point I really have to ask: why did you write this comment? If it was to convince people who like HPMoR that they're wrong to do so, then (1) that's pretty misguided, IMO, and (2) the wording and tone you used pretty much guarantee that that's not going to happen. If it was to make an anti-recommendation against HPMoR to people who haven't read it yet, then I think you picked the wrong subreddit to comment on. But to be honest, I don't think it's either of those two reasons. I think you posted a comment lambasting HPMoR because [it's fun to make fun of people/things you don't like](http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/), because you wanted to score Internet points, and (if I were being uncharitable) because you wanted to get a reaction out of people.

      Is this unfair? Is this unreasonable? Maybe so. But unfair or not, everything I've written here has been an honest explication of my thoughts. I'm sorry if I sounded a bit short with you in this comment, but quite frankly, if you refer to the main character of HPMoR as "God-Emperor Hariezer", you have no grounds to complain about the tone of someone else's reply.

      P.S. Note that at no point have I actually tried to defend HPMoR. I haven't done so partially because (1) I don't have the time and (2) I don't think it's particularly in need of defending, but mostly because (3) I dislike the implied contextualization, in which HPMoR fans (who I imagine constitute *a substantial majority of this subreddit*) are immediately treated as the defendants to your prosecutor, just because you wrote a comment criticizing HPMoR. I can think of no other community in which the *default response to someone coming in and blatantly strawmanning your positions* is to treat their points as if they were somehow salient enough to be worth arguing against, and yet this appears to be exactly what happens here every single damn time somebody criticizes something we like. (Remember that SV thread about "Why rational fiction is inherently problematic" that basically blew up both there and on Reddit, people?) This is a bad thing, I don't like it, and I'm tired of it happening.

        And the charitable way to rephrase *that* is "because you want to find, and socialize with, others who have similar dislikes to your own."

        Personally, I've never found that picking friends by what they *dislike* makes for a very good filter, but some people do it.

        That's what's so funny to me! He writes at length about things like how rationality is badly represented in stories, then turns around and commits a lot of the same mistakes.

        How likely is it _really_ that some poor wizard family wouldn't have figured out the Gringotts arbitrage trick? Mr. Weasley, with his muggle fascination? Fred or George? If breaking the wizarding economy completely really is _that easy_, I simply cannot believe the Weasleys would stay poor. If EY thinks they would, that means they exist in the story not to pursue their own goals, but to be part of the "stupid, backwards wizarding world" backdrop that EY so desperately wants to set up.

        And this is a common thing. EY goes on many, many rants (even IN MoR) about how important and hard it is to admit you're totally and entirely wrong - and yet, Hariezer himself never has to do this. He talks about how cheap it is to have "smart" characters recite long lists of facts or numbers, and yet Hariezer's primary method of communication is long-winded rants full of jargon which often have inaccurate details, and are sometimes flat-out wrong (see the physics rant from chapter 2).

        I mean, I _like_ the advice EY has blogged about. I think most of it is good if you're trying to write an intelligent story for a nerd audience. That's why I wish he'd used it in MoR.

          > How likely is it really that some poor wizard family wouldn't have figured out the Gringotts arbitrage trick?

          Really unlikely. However, spoiler alert:

          Harry notices late in the story that Voldemort fails to imagine *nice* ways of accomplishing his goals. It's a cognitive blind spot.

          Harry has some of those, too. One of them is that, having noticed that his situation is unusual (being a scientific wizard), he tends to believe that he is *the first* to be in this situation; that he always gets first mover advantages. He persists in acting this way even after being given the diary of Roger Bacon, a scientific wizard who lived hundreds of years ago.

          (Entry 1723 in Bacon's diary: "Tried the arbitrage thing. Goblins showed up with glowing knives. Won't be doing that again.")

          The story doesn't support the idea that Harry actually *does* always get first mover advantages. He pretty much gets *one*: partial Transfiguration. But it very much supports the idea that Harry *erroneously believes* that he will always get them.

          (Entry 413 in Bacon's diary: "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME.")

          And Harry is *incurious* about his forebears. He makes no attempt to read Bacon's diary.

              Yeah that one really bothered me. I was down with Harry being super special awesome and figuring out Partial Transmutation because of his superior understanding of quantum physics and how that would be a unique skill among wizards. I wasn't down with Harry just being such a magically good person that he had a better patronus and yada yada - that's where it jumped the shark for me.

                Not only that, but... I think Wertifloke in "The Waves Arisen" summmarizes it best while describing rinnegan:

                >âYeah, but come on, a single skill which is supposed to grant perfect chakra control, and the ability to read minds, and to resurrect the dead and to summon giant fighting centipedes? That doesnât even sound like a real technique. It sounds like a list of cool powers written down by a nine year old with no idea of, like, balance, or consistency.â

                Yeah, but, come on, a single spell which is supposed to destroy otherwise indestructible wraiths, and the ability to pass secure messages, and the ability to find a person you know, and the ability to detect other patronuses, and the ability to ressurect dead while nothing else can, and can be used by an 11-year-old, and can be independently discovered by an 11-year old, and doesn't require much sacrifices?

                  Aren't abilities 2, 3, 4, and 6 all already abilities of the basic Patronus? All Harry added was power to enable 1 and insight (in combination with Quirrel iirc) that 5 is also possible.

              Quirrell gifts Harry with Roger Bacon's diary, which is written in Latin, which Harry never takes the time to learn, so nothing of interest ever happens with that plot thread.

          So this isn't related to your post, but who is Hariezer? You write like it's EY, but when I google it I only find a big review.

    > Normal people don't worry about stuff like that, trusting their fast-response social intuition instead of using their slow-response intellect to try to rationally figure out if another person is telling the truth

    Normal people don't worry about stuff like that *under normal circumstances*. You do tend to think that way during e.g. hostage negotiations, or when working as a political diplomat.

    Which is to say, when the stakes are high enough.

    > Harry doesn't seem to ascribe any personhood to people who aren't as smart as he is, dividing the world into PCs and NPCs, and saying things like he doesn't see any reason for Weasley to exist.

    I'm pretty sure that's a thoroughly accurate portrayal of the same kind of "never actually been wrong before, so doesn't know what it's like" eleven-year-old I remember being.

    Also, y'know, [](#s "Harry is Voldemort.") Justified sociopath; not a role model; etc.

        No: the *story* is what we're supposed to be learning rationality from. Meaning not just what Harry says, but the ways he turns out to be wrong, and is called out as wrong, by the other characters and narrative.
        ```

        - u/abcd_z:
          ```
          Except the story never really calls him out as being wrong.  The characters sometimes disagree with him, but they're ultimately portrayed as being in the wrong.  

          Harry lost his time-turner because he was abusing it.  Later on he gets it back because he could have averted a tragedy if only he'd had it, and he verbally browbeats an authority figure into giving it back to him.  

          Harry sneaks gold into his pouch, something that was against the established limits, then it turns out that McGonagall should have let him do so all along.  

          McGonagall starts out as a strict authoritarian, but by the end of the story she learns her lesson and goes along with the corrections Harry gives her in front of the entire school.  

          Harry ignores the rules against experimenting with transfiguration to no negative repercussions except Hermione chewing him out, which he doesn't really take to heart, and he's ultimately justified in doing so because he learned partial transfiguration out of the deal.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            You're cherry picking. Harry loses his first battle because he doesn't trust his soldiers. Harry escalated the bullying because he doesn't trust Dumbledore being wiser than him. Harry ignores the evil stuff Quirrel does because he's lonely. Harry gets Dumbledore locked in the mirror because he thinks he can outsmart everyone.

            The list of failures in HPMOR is something I've literally never seen anyone get right. It always reminds me that I need to get going on a reread where I document them all :P
