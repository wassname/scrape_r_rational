  Honestly seems a little naive by the DKE. The empire attacks one of their cities, surely the army would be ready to deal with a counter attack. Now they're down another two high level citizens.

  Also I'm getting more and more curious what OP build Rain is going to discover. The last couple chapters have been filled with super high level potential opponents he's obviously going to have to deal with eventually. Even if he just needs to get to the "don't get squished like a bug" level, he's got a ways to go.

    ```
    The number-crunching people have been doing in the semi-official build spreadsheet suggest some really incredible numbers coming out of all the synergistic effect stacking if Rain can get past level 25 while meeting the requirements to unlock the Legendary Dynamo perks, which should include but probably won't be limited to getting +5 to skill level caps in the five skill trees he's investing in.
    ```

      Looking at the sheet, that seems when he reaches the unranked zone damage cap.

        Rain's build is sufficiently broken past silverplate that the recent munchkinry is probably best read as a way to give him advancement without making him instantly OP.
        ```

        I'd honestly like to see that rather than the 1000th "secret special power no one knew about" completely pulled out of the author's ass that we usually see in other web novels.

        EDIT: a story doesn't need secret powers to be interesting. The unexpected and interesting parts can be the events, the interaction between characters, the setting as a whole.

        Well, we don't know what the class benefit will be for Rain at silver. 

        We know a minimum of his abilities, but that's assuming his class benefit stays the same, which is impossible. 

        Rain would get something on the equivalent of Amelia's skill reallocation ability, as they both have Legendary classes.
        ```

    I don't think the DKE was naive. Remember that this was a sneak attack army sent to capture Fel Sedanis before it was under the control of the DKE, so it was not unreasonable for the DKE to assume the army would have been scaled to be able to take the city, no more. I believe the narration mentions the Lightbreaker is the Empire's most powerful individual tool. Without him this strike force would have trounced the army. There is a whole war going on, the DKE had no way of knowing he was allocated here. And they need to be careful about allocating their own resources.

    Besides, as long as the barrier stands, DKE has no immediate need to relieve Fel Sedanis. I believe this was more of a "that army was unprepared for a siege, we can probably destroy it cheaply"-attack, than a "we really want to relieve Fel Sedanis, let's send as many people as it takes to break the siege" one.

    > Also I'm getting more and more curious what OP build Rain is going to discover. 

    I hope that one of the accolades can give him a temporary skill point, as that would give him access to (almost) the same tricks as Ameliah for unlocking prerequisites and getting synergies.

    He has seven more Wards visible and fifteen other auras (including Suppression and Fall).  Leveling all 15 non-Wards to lvl 10 should be relatively easy for him, and would give him an Aura Synergy multiplier of 3.3x (instead of his current 1.8x).  Somehow leveling the Wards as well would boost it to 4.0x.  This would result in a 240m range at 24x power with extend/amplify/focus (or 190m @ 48x, or a 0m @ 139.2x, depending on Aura Compression.)  It could still be doubled by Channel Mastery.

    That would also unlock Prismatic Intent, which is a huge power boost on its own.

    ---

    Has anything been said about T4 skills?  I assume that it would take 100k XP to unlock a tree, but I don't think that it's been completely ruled out yet.  Specifically, if he tried it and de-leveled to 13 from the XP loss, then he could (mostly, kind of, probably) pull off the tricks I outlined above.  

    My main concern with this idea (other than whether it's possible at all) is if it's too much soulstrain for him to ever handle.  He only has ~130 T3 skill trees left to unlock, and I'm not sure if that's enough to train his soul to lose that much XP at once, especially since he's just barely over having problems with spending 22000 XP spread throughout the day.

    ---

    I wonder how quickly he could build his Focus/Clarity tolerance if he just alternated between Winter and Velocity singularities, and whether that would boost his general stat tolerance in the same way.  He has quite a bit of room to grow before he maxes out the ring.  If equipment limits are based on total XP instead of actual level, then he could get quite a bit more powerful without any more changes.

        > it's unlikely for a single accolade to measure up to what her class provides.

        It really doesn't measure up, and Rain's build can take advantage of the (hypothetical) skillpoint accolade better than anyone else.

        Ameliah's class lets her basically respec into anything she wants, with fewer limits than people who choose that build from the start.  The accolade lets people use one chosen skill and put ranks into others.

        If Rain got a full-respec at-will ability, he would be much more powerful.  He could still get full ranks in everything, but he could also:

        - Use Prismatic Intent, Immolate, and Heat Ward at the same time to level Heat Ward, and the same for other elements.
        - Drop Immolate and Refrigerate, and replace them with the vastly-superior Shear, freeing up a skill point.
        - Probably see a couple hidden skills that he would meet the loosened restrictions for.

        Furthermore, *most* people can't get a skill to level 10 in a day, which makes the accolade a specialized advantage for Rain instead of a general one.  How many people would lose access to a lvl 10 skill in exchange for a bit of synergy?
        ```

    - u/ironistkraken:
      ```
      IDK that seems a little too op.  His build is hyper focused around aoes centered around himself right? For a lv 50 class upgrade the ability to move the aoe away form himself feels a lot more in line.
      ```

      - u/lillarty:
        ```
        His *build* is focused on auras, but his *class* is just "bet it all on mana regen"

        It wouldn't make sense for the mana regen class to upgrade into a "center your auras around other objects" class, considering there's no inherent link between auras and mana regen. Maybe his focus on auras will give him the ability to switch to an aura-focused class, but that would almost certainly remove the huge boost to mana regen from Dynamo, so it would have to be incredibly powerful to be worth taking.
        ```

- u/ironistkraken:
  ```
  first off, I think leveling is exponential.  So in strength difference between level 1 and 10 is a lot less then between 40 and 50.  Also its really cool to see late game builds.  Now we know why val wanted to stay on his path so bad, it becomes super op.
  ```

  - u/morgf:
    ```
    I guess you meant the difference between 41 and 50.

    But a better way of thinking about it is that when something is exponential, the power ratios are the same for equivalent level differences. If someone at level 10 is twice as powerful as someone at level 1, then if it is exponential we can conclude that someone at level 50 is twice as powerful as someone at level 41.
    ```

  The pacing issues of the last few chapters are ridiculous. The watch is ambushing Velika! Lavarro is attacking Westbridge! The empire is attacking Fel Sadanis! Oh man, finally all this build up is going to be rewarded! Nah, we spend a bunch of chapters of rain doing math in a dark cave. Oh and he gets a pet slime. It's cute.

  Lightbreaker is too dumb to be sympathetic -- he knows Fecht is powerful, but there are at least two others of similar power. Oh, I can't take the empire killing so many people, best help them kill a bunch of people. Also you'd really think the DK citizens would be smarter -- apparently Lightbreaker is a well known enemy and they still get tricked everytime. Obviously the empire thinks they can kill a few citizens, or they wouldn't be there.
  ```

  - u/Amagineer:
    ```
    Given what Val implied about his dad (that he's dead, not that he's captured, at least IIRC) I think the inference to draw wrt Lightbreaker being too dumb is that he's been magically brainwashed. He's always described as the man in chains too, even though I don't think he's literally chained up.

    I've got no excuses for the DKE Citizens though.
    ```

    - u/nohat:
      ```
      Yeah, its possible, but we haven't actually seen any particular indication that's the case. We really don't know what is possible magically speaking. I think the chains just represent his personal perspective, not magical brainwashing chains.
      ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      The Citizens seem universally overconfident. Possibly because the only way to become a Citizen is to aggrandize yourself so hard that they take notice. They also seem to think that whatever the glass-sphere artifact is, it makes them more powerful than any other group, when really it just elevates relatively-strong people to very-stronghood in a world where the upper tiers of power are unknown. Their whole setup is overconfidence incarnate.
      ```

  - u/SecondTriggerEvent:
    ```
    Yeah, needs more focus on Rain so he can start interacting with the plot again. Don't need three quarters of a chapter focused on fodder fights just to introduce a new villain (who's not relevant at the moment).
    ```

  - u/ironistkraken:
    ```
    I think the chains he wears are enchanted.  I doubt he follows because he thinks its the best option, I think he is forced.    


    For the pacing issue, I can see the problem, but all he really is at this point is a human sized mana generator.   If he was in the city he would just be hiding form the riot.  The pay off when he they realize he is the only person with high clarity in the city that no one can access since westbrige is dead.
    ```

    - u/nohat:
      ```
      He isn't actually wearing chains. From what we are told he was imprisoned and then persuaded that Fecht was so powerful it was better to help him conquer the world since he was going to win anyway.
      ```

- u/Fiazba:
  ```
  Hypothesis: The leveling system in Delve is a safety mechanism to prevent players from accidentally killing themselves via soul strain.

  So, we know from Jamus (and Incarns) that boosting someone's stats high enough can cause severe damage and eventually death. We also know that some forms of soul strain are directly tied to player level (Equipment). What if the leveling system was put in place by the System's designer to prevent people from leveling up until their soul can handle it? It would explain why some abilities (the Watch's truth sense) seem to read Rain as a higher level than he is, because without this safety mechanism, his soul would be over level 25 in most aspects anyway. Narratively, it explains why so much emphasis has been given to soul strain and the gold ring, and why this pushup sequence in the cave is so important. Rain is not going to make his own essence monster out of a Crystal Slime, he's going to strengthen each aspect of his soul to the point that the System recognizes that he can safely level up to 19. This hypothesis explains why all of the Monolithic classes can come so close to accidentally killing themselves, but none of them do. They are the "edge cases", with the System designed such that they just barely cannot commit suicide without the use of equipment or another player's abilities. 

  I wonder if Essence Monsters give you some sort of temporary soul strain resistance, allowing you to level up without dying. This would explain why it is transferable within a certain period of time, because it is temporary anyway. You've got a week to naturally build up some soul strain resistance to a level where the stats you've gained won't kill you.
