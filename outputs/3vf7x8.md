## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Random question; who else knows how to solve a Rubik's Cube? I recently decided to learn and was so surprised at how easy it was. Within a month I know a couple of methods of solving a 3x3 and can solve a cube in less than a minute. Also it's a nearly effortless way to impress people.

    When I was twelve years old, I spent three months trying to solve a Rubik's Cube that I found.  I finally went to the library and took out a book on solution techniques, and discovered that the Cube had been disassembled and reassembled in an unsolvable position.
    ```

    - u/trifith:
      ```
      If someone puts it back together in anything other than a solved position, it's probably unsolvable. There are significantly more unsolvable ways to put it together than there are solvable.
      ```

      - u/Chronophilia:
        ```
        1/12 of all starting positions are solvable, so it's far from impossible.
        ```

        - u/trifith:
          ```
          Which means 11/12 starting positions are not solvable, so it's not likely.

    I learned this a while back, and I'm glad I did. It was a fun few days.

    Anecdote time!

    I actually started learning on a bus on the way out to a summer camp I worked as a counsellor for. I had the algorithm beside me for the bus ride, but was distracted and would keep losing my rhythm or make a minor mistake and have to start over, once I got the the camp, I had less time, but I would still practice with it during my downtime (the kids loved watching it and hearing what I was doing and why).  It should be mentioned here that they were third to sixth graders.

    About thirty-six hours after I started, I finally solved the cube! I felt enormously proud, and all the kids were ecstatic. They all begged to see it (to check that I had, indeed, solved it completely). As they passed it around, it came to this one kid.

    And this kid....he weighed the cube in his hand, that cube I had spent hours on. He looked right into my eyes, saw my pride and joy. And, without hesitation, chucked the cube as hard as he could at the wall.

    It shattered into a dozen pieces.

    Why?

    I have no idea.

    Kids.

    - u/Jace_MacLeod:
      ```
      Not particularly relevant since it was years ago, but did the center frame or any the cubes actually break? Rubik's cubes are surprisingly easy to take apart and put back together again, assuming all the pieces are intact.

      It's an excellent way to cheat, actually. Usually much quicker to just solve it normally if you already know how, but all the anecdotes about people taking the stickers off and putting them back on again are rather amusing, since that's literally the most effort-intensive method of cheating possible.
      ```

      - u/HeirToGallifrey:
        ```
        They did break--unfortunately, the centre piece (the three axes) snapped in two, and there were a couple cubies broken in half as well. Disappointing, but at least I got a story out of it!
        ```

    Just earlier this week, I spent an hour with a website trying to solve my cube. I messed up once -- never could keep my clockwise straight from counterclockwise -- and ended when I'd solved the bottom face and the bottom two rows of each side. But none of the algorithms for the top face are making any sense; can you share a source for solving it?
    ```

    - u/Magodo:
      ```
      I used [this](http://rubiks.com/blog/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube) to learn initially.
      ```

    - u/HeirToGallifrey:
      ```
      [This is the site I used](http://solvethecube.com). I found . I found it to be the most clear and simple, plus it has advanced and intermediate methods as well.

      Also, something I realised embarrassingly late: the final algorithm will mess up everything, or at least give that impression. Hold the cube in the same position, rotate only the top face, and have faith; it will work out.
      ```

  - u/cellsminions:
    ```
    It's easier to learn than most people expect. 

    I was once on a loooong bus-across-the-US volunteer trip that I found out very early on I didn't want to be a part of, much too late to back out. I managed to stay sane by buying a Rubik's cube at the first stop and then teaching a person or two how to solve it on the 6-8 hour bus rides between destinations. They usually picked it up in about an hour, and I'd have them spend the next hour trying it on their own and answering questions along the way. One of them came up to me a month later to show me that they still remembered how to do it. 

    It's a unique way to make friends if you happen to be stuck with a lot of time.
    ```

  - u/TimTravel:
    ```
    Yeah it's not hard. I'm weird because I do it top bottom middle instead of top middle bottom.

    5x5x5 cubes are just more time consuming, not actually harder.

    ```
    I used to win money in High School speed solving a 3x3 cube. Not much, and it didn't last long before nobody would bet against me, but it was mildly useful.

    Too bad the algorithm has faded from memory these days.
    ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    I learnt to solve one in high school. It impressed my friends for a few weeks. Then I forgot how, but relearned how in college. Now, I'm pretty sure I'd have to wait a decade to forget how to do one.

    Also, the method I learned was the most basic of algorithms where you just need to get the white cross, and then you solve it piece by piece practically. Unless you get lucky, it's hard to get a sub 1:30 time using this method.
    ```

    - u/Magodo:
      ```
      > it's hard to get a sub 1:30 time using this method.

      Not true, I bought a smoother cube and worked on some fingertricks, but yeah the lower bound is probably around 45 seconds for the layer method.
      ```

      - u/Kishoto:
        ```
        You probably have an additional step where I don't. With the method I learnt, the most you ever needed to memorize were four different statesfor each step. Other, faster methods would have you merging some of these steps, meaning you'd need to memorize an increasing number of set ups, so you could solve it with less information (aka less of the cube being solved)
        ```

  - u/IomKg:
    ```
    Is that algorithm useful for anything else in real life?
    If not what is the purpose of studying it? unless you develop the algorithm yourself how is this different than just letting someone else tell you how to solve it?
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      >it's a nearly effortless way to impress people

      I don't know what more you want.
      ```

      - u/IomKg:
        ```
        Studying something just to impress people isn't a very worthwhile thing to do for me at least, which is why i queried for other possible benefits.
        ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      Solving it the first time by figuring it out myself was an experience I'd have lost if I'd looked up the algorithm. Solving a Rubik's cube again now that I know how is more of a fun thing to occupy your hands with. (It gives a little mental "ding!" of achievement every time, which may or may not be a thing for other people.) So if I couldn't figure it out the first time myself, that's what looking up a method would get me.

      But there's also really complicated algorithms with lots of subcases to solve a Rubik's cube very quickly. It's not currently a priority, but it would be interesting to try to learn one of those: a very hard challenge that's very different from things I've done before and produces tangible impressive results.

    Warm blankets are good insulators, because they reflect your body heat back at you. Cool blankets would be good conductors, but layering isn't a good strategy, because the trapped air itself acts a good insulator. Combine that with the density necessary for your heavy blankets, and...

  I'm working on a CCG (like Magic and Pokemon), just for fun (not planning on selling it).

  Looking for theme ideas that'll fit the mechanic I'm planning on using. Both players will build their decks beforehand, trying to do something clever but not obvious. You hand your deck to the other player and they hand you theirs, you look through it for a minute or two (timed), then you start playing. You play through, then you switch decks and play with the one you built in the first place, and whichever deck won the first time, has to win better when it's creator is playing with it.

  So, what theme makes sense to have you play twice, the first time with your opponents deck. I've got some ideas which I'll hold off on posting them for a while, so as to keep the idea space open.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    The first concept that springs to mind is double agents. One player is a Soviet agent pretending to be an American agent, while the other is an American agent pretending to be a Soviet agent. Once their covers are blown, they go back to their original sides.
    ```

  - u/CaptainLoggers:
    ```
    The idea of figuring out how a deck works as you play reminds me of Sentinels of the Multiverse, which does that in a cooperative setting. I think part of the key is the many moving parts with which to interact with and thus be useful to the team (deck, discard, allies, enemy boss, enemy minions, environment). 

    As for a theme, I'm imagining a competitive game with multiple win conditions, scorekeeping that allows for the comparison, and cards which can pursue multiple different conditions either simultaneously or exclusively to obfuscate which your deck is built towards achieving. 

    To that end, perhaps a theme of Civilization, with cultural, military, economic, political, and scientific victories to pursue. Perhaps every Civ has the cards to build towards 3 of the 5, and you and your opponent have to figure out which of those 3 this deck is best for. 

    Another idea that just came into my head was mad scientists. You and another classic mad scientist have broken enough each other's respective lairs simultaneously and are both seeking to take over the world. Similar to the above idea, you could win the world by controlling the political system, extorting the world's economy, military subjugation, cultural control, or sabotaging your opponent. That has the right feel of you trying to figure out how your opponent's mad science and gadgets work while he does the same with yours.

  I've been thinking about what I want to write next, once I've finished all my deliverables for current projects, which has led me down the rabbit hole of looking into [personality typologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Personality_typologies). There are a ton of these out there and lots of them just read like straight-up character personality descriptions, so I think it would be pretty neat to use one of them as a template for a group of characters. I could just pick a random typology like [Enneagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality) and say, "Alright, there are going to be nine principle characters that more or less hew to these types, which is going to define their conflicts and friendships.

  There are just *so many ways* to type people, which I think plays to my natural love of ordered systems. I have a lot of questions about how accurate any of them are (whether these typologies have undergone any sort of blind testing and whether they can make accurate predictions) but there's something comforting about the idea of saying "there are nine sorts of people" or "there are four sorts of people", which feels better than saying "there are between three and sixteen types of people" or just "there are people and we're really crap at figuring them out in any ordered way".

  There was a post on the frontpage of TIL today about Japanese blood type personality theory, which would be really interesting if true, which is why people treat it as though it were true; if you could know someone's personality from a simple blood test, it would simplify your interpersonal dealings enormously. The same goes for Western Zodiac signs.

  Any personality type systems that you particularly like? Any you think would adapt well to fiction?

    For ensemble casts I like to do a spin around the [Holland Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Codes). Setting up a variety of problem-solving strengths (and weaknesses) forces cooperation, inspires arguments, and helps establish conflicting goals and passions.

    All sorts of excellent fodder to inspire productive dialogue with multiple believable answers, and generally keep the story moving.

    I'm reading The Games We Play by Ryuugi, a fanfiction which crosses RWBY/The Gamer but has its own extremely in-depth world-building, and a lot of the mythos draws from Jewish mysticism. So a lot of the story draws from the metaphysical ideas in Kabbalah, whch focus heavily on the 10 'emanations' of God, the Sephirot. 


    Looking into the Sephirot has yielded some interesting creative ideas for me regarding what kind of ideas characters can typify. So a character could typify Gevurah, divine judgement without mercy. Or Chesed, which is divine compassion and mercy. 

    Or a character could typify Keter, which is "Being desire to bring the world into being" and " although it contains all the potential for content, it contains no content itself".  So this character could b someone who has no intrinsic direction to his/her life but rather has a lot of potential-- their very identity is based around being potential itself. 

    This is all getting rather abstract and unintelligible, but basically, I think mystical mythos/tradition have a lot of archetypes that are useful for creative work.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I'm reading that as well and *just* got to the section where the Sepheriot is laid out. The name "Keter" prompted me to go look up the reference, because I'd seen that before (as an SPC classification).

      Interestingly, RWBY itself uses a very classical four humors ensemble, down to the color coding (red humor = sanguine, yellow humor = choleric, etc.). And though I haven't gotten to the reveal of the Riders, if there is one at this point, I thought that was drawing on some kind of Four Horsemen thing.

  Since I *have* been stumbling upon several good story recommendations that’re hosted on spacebattles.com, I’ve been thinking that it should be like darklordpotter.net, more or less. Turns out they have overly sensitive moderators, and stories hosted there can actually suffer from it. Not happy with this, but whatever.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    Overly sensitive moderators seem to be abundant in sustainable, big online communities (Teamliquid is an example of a webforum with very aggressive moderation but a very loyal and active community). This is not a coincidence. 

    Small communities don't need serious moderation since they self-moderate quite a bit. Outside of very occasional off-topicness, for example, r/rational is pretty much self-policing. We all know each other and post things we like. 

    Big communities are toughter. Communities that have upvotes/downvotes like reddit can be, to an extent, self-moderating and allow a light moderation touch, even when they get big. That's really great. That being said, upvote/downvote tree commenting (compared to a traditional bulletin board reply age sort system) isn't used everywhere since it has its own drawbacks. Part of what draws people to places like 40kO, TeamLiquid or SpaceBattles is the format. However, bulletin board format has its own problems too! And really big bulletin boards are hard to moderate.

    You'll notice there aren't a lot of big traditional forum communities that are both 1) good and 2) lightly moderated. This is because your moderation options for a big community like these are limited! If you are too light on moderation, things go downhill really fast because individual users don't have the power to "downvote" a thread, and replying to a bad thread bumps it, so telling off a bad poster actually makes things worse, etc.

    So basically your options are "Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy" or "Police State", and if you want people to actually post fanfics, it has to be the latter, or you have to use a different format. [Team Liquid](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/tl-community/17883-tlnet-ten-commandments), for example, has a set of rules that begins with "This is our house" and is broad and empowering to the moderators. 

    In general, I would like a fanfiction community that was 1) big, 2) BBS style, 3) lightly moderated, and 4) not a wretched hive of scum and villainy. I'm pretty sure it's not possible to have all 4 of these at once, though.

    ```
    Anecdotal, I'm just an EMT who's asked a few policemen about their perspectives, but the most important thing from an LEO perspective is they need to be able to identify who's a shooter and who's a civilian immediately.  Some pointers they gave were along the lines of: Only draw your weapon if you expect to be shooting it immediately, immediately disarm if you encounter LEOs and explain why you are armed, and don't pull your weapons around LEO's unless you've already gotten permission.  As far as actually stopping a shooter, that's really hard to do unless you get the drop on them from very short range with a concealed weapon, and unless you're both lucky and above average with your aim and tactics, you're as likely to be a hindrance as a help.  The takeaway was, basically pretend to be unarmed unless you get an opportunity to take out someone you're absolutely sure is a shooter from very close distance.

    It [wasn't an active crime scene](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/04/reporters-rush-into-home-san-bernardino-shooting-suspects):

    > Miller said that law enforcement contacted him on Thursday night to say their investigation was complete and he could enter the property. He arrived on Friday morning to assess the damage caused by officers when they searched the home, fearing that it was booby-trapped. “I opened the door,” Miller said. “Once you open the door … they kind of forced their way in.”

    > At a later press conference, FBI assistant director David Bowdich said the agency had returned authority to the apartment back to the owners after the search. “Last night we turned that over back to the residents,” he said. “Once we’re out, we don’t have control of it.”

    It's still abhorrent behavior and proof of how terrible news reporters are when they smell blood, but it's not disruption of a crime scene because the crime scene had already been handed back to the owner of the property by law enforcement, at which point he would have been perfectly within his rights to strip the place bare [edit: depending on renter's rights in California]. (He also would have been perfectly within his rights to call the cops on the reporters for trespassing, but doesn't appear to have done so.)

    What do you mean by recommendation? Story by author one likes, personal recommendation, community endorsement, sorting ff.net by favorites/reviews, ... ?

    If you mean what I do when I want to read a fanfiction without knowing which in advance is to go on ff.net and filter/sort a fandom down until I find a description/length/characters I like and start reading.

    As for why I guess that if I find the canon story fun then a good fanfiction should be able to do that at least as good and provide new perspectives/ideas. Also many fanfics which actually get recommended one way or another often do reference the fandom at large.

        I have read about 7-8 Discworld novels and they were kinda ... neat I guess but I would never get the idea to recommend them to somebody else.

        Imagining my own adventures in the world of Harry Potter and Naruto is easy and I have done so many times but in Discworld it seems to me that somehow there is one story in a book which just ends when I am done reading.

        And I guess I mostly read fanfiction to improve and extend my favorite fictional worlds by the views of many people to be able to better play with these worlds.

          Discworld is a collection of small stories in a big setting. HP and Naruto are big stories in small settings. In Discworld (and HHG2G), it feels like there's so much more world left to build, while in HP and Naruto you feel like you have the entire setting once you're done. Not to mention the difficulty of approaching canon flavor for things like Discworld and HHG2G, which are at least partially famous *for* their flavor.

    When you say motivation, do you mean how do I go about finding good fanfiction or are you asking what in general motivates me to read as an activity?
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I WILL NOT TREAT SECULAR SOLSTICE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PETITION THE RUINOUS POWERS OF THE WARP.  I WILL NOT TREAT SECULAR SOLSTICE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PETITION THE RUINOUS POWERS OF THE WARP.  I WILL NOT TREAT SECULAR SOLSTICE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PETITION THE RUINOUS POWERS OF THE WARP.

  Even if there's an Etcy store where you can get little bronze pendants of the Elder Sign, the sign of Tzeentch, etc.
