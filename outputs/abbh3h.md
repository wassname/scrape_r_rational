## What's with the flagrant abuse of the QM Copenhagen interpretation observer effect in fiction and elsewhere? (mild spoilers - Ball Lightning by Cixin Liu).

### Post:

So to start with I'd like to say that I don't know all that much about quantum mechanics, and so this may all really be about a hole in my understanding, and if that's the case then please correct me, and thank you.

Now, to demonstrate what I'm talking about I'll quote from the novel *Ball Lightning* by Cixin Liu (Warning -- spoilers):

>In the presence of an observer, its state collapses to a determined value. This value is consistent with our experience in the macro-world, so it strikes the target. But without an observer, it exhibits a quantum state where nothing is determined, and its position can only be described as a probability.

>“Can’t we just put a camera onto a drone?” the lieutenant colonel said.

>“A camera is an observer, too, and will likewise collapse the quantum state. This is why I had all of the monitoring equipment shut off.”

>“But the cameras don’t have consciousness,” Lin Yun said.

>“Now who’s being anti-materialistic? The observer doesn’t need consciousness.” Ding Yi grinned devilishly at her.

This handily demonstrates this reoccurring trope. It is my understanding that something I once read roughly explaining the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in plain English can be extended to understand the "observer" of the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics:

>The reason it's impossible to know the position AND momentum of a quantum scale object is that in order to measure this information it is necessary to bounce a photon or similar particle off the quantum scale object, which will change its position and momentum in unknowable ways. (Rough paraphrase from memory.)

It is my understanding that the observer in the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics is not a human or a camera, it is when a photon or other similar particle (a fast electron, etc.) interacts with whatever we are measuring that its waveform collapses and it is "observed". No conscious minds required. 

Now I understand why new age gurus jump on the psudoscience they can get out of the "needs conscious observer" idea, and sci-fi writers might like it as something to play with in the same vein as portals in Worm, or just magic, but the thing is that it seems like a lot of people really believe this. I've seen so many variants of this "needs conscious observer" idea in so called "science" articles, with ridiculous stuff like one I once read that had some gobbledygook about how if people didn't occasionally "observe" the moon it might go somewhere else. If my understanding is correct, even if the moon were subject to quantum effects, it is being "observed" every time a photon or other particle interacts with it.

Then there's things like /U/lolbifrons post in one of my previous threads:

>Copenhagen isn't simpler mathematically. It privileges something special about human perception that even Copenhagen subscribers can't fully explain without post hoc hypotheses.

And this is not that far from quotes I remember reading from supposed scientists! 

So, do I have something wrong, or is my understanding basically correct, that an "observation" in the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics is not something made by a mind, but any elementary particle interaction? And if my understanding IS right, why do people, apparently even scientists, keep on mentioning completely unrelated things like human consciousness when what's really going on is so simple to explain?

  This is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle not the observer effect. Also it's the layman explanation for the uncertainty principle that isn't technically correct. Even if we had a magical non-interacting measurement stick, and measured the particle with our measurement stick, we still would only be able to find position and momentum to within the exactness specified by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is an inherent property of the wave-like nature of matter in our reality - it's not something you can "clever" your way around.

  Yes. This is correct.

  "Seeing things changes the result" is a simple meme people can digest. 

  "Particles colliding during observation causes wave functions to collapse and thereby changes the result" 

  "What's a wave function?"

  "An equation describing the quantum state of an isolated quantum system"

  "What's a quantum state?"

  "A vector that encodes all information about the current state of the system such that probability distributions for observables can be extracted"

  "What's a vector? What's a probability distribution? What's an observable?"

  ".....seeing things changes the result!"

  "oh ok"

    Particles colliding during observation? But particles could collide during anything right?

    The particles don't have to be from observation, do they?

      >But particles could collide during anything right?

      [It doesn't have to be a particle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-zXT5bIBM0#t=33s). It can also be a force. And it doesn't have to be a collision, it could also be an absorption. The core idea is that to observe the quantum system you need to interact with it physically in some fashion, and that interaction causes the collapse. 

      >The particles don't have to be from observation, do they?

      No. But usually when we do things like the single electron double slit experiment, we are placing the system in isolation so the quantum effects don't get drowned out by noise. So there is only *an* electron going through the slits and nothing else. The observer effect is the observation that, even in such ideal circumstances, you would still change the outcome by observation due to the requirement of physically interacting with the particle to observe it.

        So quantum systems collapse all the time from random forces? And in isolation we can only test one thing before it collapses

          With enough random forces it stops being a quantum system and just becomes regular old human scale reality. This is the heart of the correspondence principle:

          https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle

          With high enough quantum numbers you start to get ever more classical results.

          We don't know for sure. We know that a big and chaotic enough quantum system tends to lose a lot of its coherence by virtue of all its internal interactions. *However*, it can still remain in what is known as a 'mixed state', aka a superposition, and that does not go away by any known mechanism.
          ```

  ```
  Ci refers to a  vague category of interpretations that include the perception stuff.
   Copenhagen subscribers are not a coherent group whith the same beliefs.
  And we keep finding quantum effects on bigger stuff, making some people have to change their interpretations.

  It's not that simple, I believe. When a particle is in a superposition (e.g. an atom is decayed and not decayed as in the Schrödinger's cat set up) and we send another particle there to probe it, then QM first of all says that our test particle is now in a superposition as well: one part of the superposition interacted with the decayed atom and the other with the not-decayed atom.

  However, we only ever observe one result. So the question is: at which point does the "wave function" (or the superposition) collapse? The Copenhagen interpretation doesn't give an answer to this. It just says that the collapse happens at some point before the experimenter observes it. People used to think that only atoms and at most molecules can be in superposition, but scientists are managing to get bigger and bigger things into superposition.

  So it's not that strange that some people say that it is [consciousness that is causing the collapse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Wigner_interpretation). I guess they're arguing that consciousness always seems to us to be not in superposition but everything else can be, or something like that. The overwhelming majority of physicists doesn't think that though.

  (Of course, if you grant that objects of every size can be in a superposition (even humans) then this problem goes away and you have arrived at the many worlds interpretation. In the many worlds interpretation, every possible outcome of the quantum measurement is observed by a "copy" of the experimenter in another "world". Which is to say the experimenter is in a superposition of having observed the decayed atom and not having observed it. The two superpositions then continue to lead their own merry lives.)

  The heisenberg uncertainty principle is totally unrelated to the observer effect. Your explanation here

  >The reason it's impossible to know the position AND momentum of a quantum scale object is that in order to measure this information it is necessary to bounce a photon or similar particle off the quantum scale object, which will change its position and momentum in unknowable ways. (Rough paraphrase from memory.)

  is *wildly* off base, not just "you misremembered a bit" but on the level of "why do you think gravity is caused by air pressure"; it's a misconception which is corrected by the third paragraph of the wikipedia article on it. The reason the uncertainty principle exists is because momentum and position are [complementary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(physics\)), and such uncertainty is simply a property of all wave-like systems, rather than caused by some other quantum mechanical effect.

  Sorry if this seems rude, I'm just kinda confused as to why you mentioned the uncertainty principle at all. The rest of the post is mostly correct, yeah, the role of observation in quantum mechanics is misinterpreted *wildly* and sometimes maliciously. There was even an april fools' joke related to HPMOR to this effect, where someone set up a website with a similar-at-a-glance URL to HPMOR's and added a paragraph to a chapter about how observation is done by conscious beings.

  The concept of the observer is kind of a fuzzy concept in the CI. The closest thing to a rigorous definition of the "observer" is something like "when the ~~system involves so many particles that the state vector~~ state vector is so complex it can't remain coherent", but what's "too ~~many particles~~ complex" is never defined, and some variants really do privilege consciouness. It's really very handwavey.

  There's only one work of science fiction I've seen that actually does a decent job of depending on the CI in a way that doesn't break the suspension of disbelief for me, and that's _Quarantine_ by Greg Egan.

  Spoiler! >!In _Quarantine_ the collapse is something that happens in a specific structure in the brains of higher primates, and it gave them a competitive advantage over brains that depended on an extended un-collapsed (multiple-world-interpretation) state. Before this structure evolved, the state vector never actually collapsed.!<

  There's a lot of handwavium involved here, but you can't spell "Copenhagen Interpretation" without waving your hands around a lot, and if you don't try and overanalyse it it's really a great schtick.

  This may be a more helpful explanation, or it may muddy the whole thing. Oh well:

  Imagine you have an automated turret defense system. Every morning you check the grounds in the distance and one day you  find bullets everywhere. Based on how your system is set up and where the bullet holes are you can get some information about the intruder.

  Your observers are the bullets. Your observed particle is the intruder. Yes, it will change it's behavior in response to being "observed" via machine gun fire. But it's not thinking about how you'll know its movements from the bullet patterns it's thinking about not getting shot (or in quantum mechanics, bouncing around because of the impacts, being pushed around by the various forces/fields being generated around it, and so on).

  Incidentally, if your story doesn't have intelligent Gods observing everything all the time but relies on the intelligent observer excuse it's not a rational story. It's not internally consistent  because   life as  we know it would never have a chance to form if stuff teleported around all the time.

  If it does have an intelligent God watching everything, and someone has discovered a way to make God look away for a moment to create magic I want to read it.

  People are just... stupid and uncritical. Lot's of people are still running around with the idea that the human mind is somehow privileged and special (if you want a taste of that, discuss some of it with friends of friends, like your parents friends). So they see the science guy use the word "observe" and OH! that's what people do! Or they see other people say that the observer is an actual person, and just go "yeah, that seems right."

  I mean, if people aren't fundamentally stupid, how come every thread about technology has people complaining about boomers just absolutely not getting it. Hell, people in our own generations can't follow along with the simple rules for computers. Look at how many don't believe in climate change, or believe in trickle down, or any of a hundred thousand stupid, harmful ideas.
