## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  The second season of The Dragon Prince dropped last week (with improved animation during action!). 

  Anyone else find time to watch it yet?

    It's pretty good.

    The pacing is still all over the place, but the story gets deeper, and we get a pretty good idea of what the motivations of the different characters and factions are, how they got where they are, and what's at stake if the protagonists fail.

    The characters are all compelling and fun, even Viren (whose behavior still makes no sense). The child-queen-who-turns-out-to-be-a-hardass character is a bit of a cliché by now (hell, *She Ra* did it too this year), but she's still a treat to watch; I like how in her scene, she's both clearly intimidated and unsure, and yet she stands her ground in an extremely stressful situation.

    Also that one scene where Claudia goes Palpatine is amazing.

    (overall, I'm not impressed with the Dark Magic plot; watching it after reading *The Dark Wizard of Donkerk* feels like watching BvS after reading *The Metropolitan Man*; alexanderwales really needs to stop raising our standards so much)

              There are a couple of reasons.

              1. It can be perceived as cashing in on a family member's fame.
              2. There are a lot of creeps and weirdos out there, and they might try to use/leverage that information in ways that you wouldn't like.
              3. There's also lots of media out there who are creeps and weirdos in a more profit-motivated way, and exposure of personal information has potential to hurt in unforeseen ways.

  I've watched The Good Place recently due to it being recommended here.

  How do I put this......I'm simultaneously disappointed and in love with this show.

  It's a show that explores the idea of a undeserving person who gets into Heaven (aka The Good Place) and I just *love* how it brings up ethical considerations and moral dilemmas.  But every *single* time that they raise a serious concern about what Ellen should do, the show goes with a joke instead of the ethical argument it could raise.

  Basically, it's a sit-com with very interesting themes that are only noticed if you are already in the mindset of thinking about such things. My mother says that she wouldn't normally watch it since it comes off as a typical sitcom which bores her, but she likes watching it with me because we would then have interesting conversations about the ethical arguments that the episodes reference in the background.

  So, while I think it's a decent recommendation to this subreddit, just be aware that it's a sitcom and the interesting ethical considerations are very much a background aspect of the show and not the main focus.

  PS I've only seen the first season and have no plans to watch anymore of it unless I'm watching it with a friend or family so we can talk about the ethics involved in each episode. By myself, it's too boring to watch.
  ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    Yeah, no one should have recommended the show as focused on ethics. It’s not accurate, but it is remarkable for bringing up any ethical discussions at all. 

    The main reason I liked *The Good Place* was that it’s a great comedy show with actual forward momentum. The second season is even better in this regard. The sci-fi and ethics jokes are the cherry on top.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Yeah, no one *said* it was focused on ethics directly but when it was recommended here, people were talking about the ethical dilemmas related to being in the afterlife and knowing your karma score which gave me a skewed impression.
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        I think as well, another thing about it is that it kind of "reboots" after each season (not literally, but each season has a whole new reveal / new stakes/ etc that changes the show), so it stays fresh, and there's new stuff going on. Like, it's one of the rare shows that  seems to maintain quality (or even *get better*) as time goes on.

  /r/slatestarcodex, probably the closest thing to a popular rationality subreddit for discussing stuff like biases and using math to make optimal choices, has recently closed their weekly culture war threads.  Apparently a few people who had really controversial opinions(e.g pro-pedophilia, pro-racism, etc.) who regularly commented there gave Scott Alexander a bad reputation for being associated with it, and Scott recently suffered a nervous breakdown.
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    This is a very disingenuous summary.  In [ Scott Alexander's post on the subject](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/), the central thesis of it is that people opposed to "racists, sexists, and nazis" were following him around and constantly doxxing him on twitter, harassing his real life friends, and called his work and lied to try to get him fired.  

    Scott wasn't worried about a bad reputation from people posting in a thread; he was worried about an organized campaign of hate and lies against him.
    ```

    - u/appropriate-username:
      ```
      I don't get how your reply is incompatible with GeneraI's comment. /u/GeneraIKenoA didn't say the bad reputation of the people posting in the thread *directly* affected Scott. He, like you, said that the *association*, where it is implied that the association is indirect, is what was bad here.
      ```

      - u/xachariah:
        ```
        Sure it's technically correct.

        But it's kinda like saying that in the run up to WW2, many Jews decided to emigrate because their cultural differences caused them to have a bad reputation in Germany.  It kinda misses the direct external causes.

    For people wondering where the successor to the Culture War threads are now, it has been moved to a new subreddit called r/TheMotte.

    ```
    Would you care to give us a bit of a summary on your take of how it came to this? It'd be useful to get a user's point of view for a lot of us here.

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Note: I will be attempting to adhere to this subreddit's policy of "No U.S. politics whatsoever" while still answering the question.

      > If you’re against witch-hunts, and you promise to found your own little utopian community where witch-hunts will never happen, your new society will end up consisting of approximately three principled civil libertarians and seven zillion witches.

      In this case, it was a little more than that.

      1. Scott had/has a habit of going after "the left" for various things that he dislikes and steelmanning the far right because he wants to engage with them in a spirit of mutual understanding and charity. (By most reckonings, he would be fairly far to the left.)
      2. Scott's ["Reactionary Philosophy in a Nutshell"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/) tract attracted a lot of reactionaries, in part because he was presenting a better, more coherent political philosophy than most reactionaries. The follow-up [Anti-Reactionary FAQ](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/) came almost half a year later, and didn't really do that much to dissuade the reactionaries.
      3. Moderation in both the SSC blog and the SSC subreddit was of a particularly rationalist mode of free speech, where no idea is too obscene or dangerous to be heard, so long as it's reasoned moderately well. This naturally attracts people with fringe views, and naturally drives out a lot of people who are unwilling to tolerate fringe views (whether because they find them that distasteful, because they get tired of feeling compelled to argue against the same fringe viewpoints week after week, or because they don't like being associated with that sort of person).
      4. The Culture War threads in particular attracted a lot of reactionaries, especially during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Because it was one of few relatively inviting homes for reactionaries, a lot of them showed up relative to the normal population. Included with those reactionaries were plain white nationalists, or people who had made the jump from being reactionary to white nationalist.
      5. This drove a fair number of people away (myself included), which intensified the problem. The "human biodiversity" subject was banned from the subreddit sometime last year, IIRC.
      6. Both Scott and the mods of the subreddit have gotten pressure to get rid of the culture wars stuff, in part because it had a bad reputation, and in part because it seemed to be generating a lot of heat and very little light.
      7. Scott got harassed and threatened, with every indication that this would continue into the future.

      Personally ... as a mod of this subreddit, which is for the sharing and distribution of rational fiction, I somewhat often remove posts that are strictly about rationalism, usually from people who are apologetic and just saw "/r/rational" and then didn't look any further before posting. People would ask me where to post instead. Similarly, we banned discussion of U.S. politics in these Friday threads (mostly the heat and light issue, partly because it was making this place unpleasant), and people have asked where they can talk about such things instead.

      I've directed a handful people to /r/slatestarcodex, and a few would come back with "wow, there's a lot of racism, transphobia, etc. there", a sentiment which I agree with, and which has helped reinforce my negative opinion of the place, specifically the culture war threads. From my perusal of the replacement subreddit, it doesn't appear that their particular slant is much different than that of the culture war threads, at least from look at the highest upvoted comments.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Scott himself made a blog post on it recently and explains it far better than I could. If you want more regular user thoughts there's a discussion thread in the subreddit right now.

      https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/

      The only point where I disagree with Scott is that I definitely think the Culture War thread was decently right wing. And it's not just that I've never been anywhere else right wing, I've spent a fair amount of time browsing /r/the_donald and such and know what conservative opinions are.
       But it can be hard to judge, since the Culture War thread didn't fall on the most typical left/right dividing lines. Like would a post defending praising Trump for pushing for the decriminizalation of homosexuality internationally count as right wing or left wing?
      ```

      - u/Cariyaga:
        ```
        I mean... he did research on whether it was left or right wing and it seemed decently neutral.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          His research conflicts strongly with my personal experience in the threads, and the personal experience of many others. Also he didn't post the comments he deemed liberal or conservative, so maybe he has different standards than I do. Maybe it's just that there are a lot of lurkers who don't comment or take surveys but upvote conservative opinions so conservatives seem to be more common, I do not know.
          ```

          - u/xamueljones:
            ```
            >His research conflicts strongly with my personal experience in the threads

            I understand what you are saying, but there is a reason why people should not pay attention to anecdotes. Memories are strongly biased and impressions can be very different from the reality of a situation.

            For example, what if there are very few right wing comments, but you think it's more common than it is because they stand out (aka more memorable) than the more common left wing commentary?

            If you want to convince people that the CW threads are more right wing than what Scott says, you should investigate where you think his research failed to properly investigate and run your own survey to prove it, instead of simply saying "I don't agree with your survey, because it doesn't fit with my experience."

            Personally, I actually think Scott's survey is flawed in one serious way. While it was worthwhile to investigate the political affiliations and opinions of the commenters, I wish that he had created a pie chart of the *issues* debated in the threads and whether or not more debates were about left wing politics or about right wing politics. Unfortunately, I can't do this myself because I'm not very politically savvy and I wouldn't know any better if I tried to categorize the debates myself. I feel like a majority of the debates are about agreeing with or being against right wing politics, but it's only my impression and it's a fairly subjective division to make as well.

              If you want to do a better analysis, then you could look through [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/arzglg/a_statistical_analysis_of_the_rssc_culture_war/) and use it to categorize users. Specifically, you could look at [this image](https://i.imgur.com/dR4QJlQ.png) and profile who the most active voices in the CW threads were. (If you do so, please do it without pinging anyone.) My own quick-and-dirty random sampling of names on that list confirms my bias on the matter, but I don't have the time/patience/energy for anything more rigorous.

              Edit: You could also use something like the (currently nonfunctional) Mass Tagger or Reddit Pro Tools to cross-reference users based on their karma in other subreddits, though you would have to pick those other subreddits and the karma threshold for them carefully, and it all might be better done by writing your own tool. Either way, I think that Scott's analysis wasn't very good, and didn't get to the heart of what people like me were saying about the CW thread (and the subreddit as a whole, which the CW thread bled out into).
              ```

            - u/None:

              I have gone through the most recent /r/themotte thread, and most of the top level comments sorted by top seemed centrist or right-wing to me. I don't particularly care enough to more thoroughly research and document more.

              I agree with this but from what I understand of rationality, a proper rationalist wouldn't take Scott at their word either because as /u/GeneraIKenoA rightly pointed out, it's hard to say whether the comments Scott used are really right wing or not because they weren't provided. So, while you seem to be implying that people should believe Scott's research, I think it makes more sense to maintain a neutral belief until *someone* presents research that has the source comments as part of it.

                I didn't say that I agreed with Scott's research. In fact, I even point out a flaw in his survey in the last paragraph of my comment.

                I don't think Scott's research should be trusted. It was just that the rebuttal seemed to be more along the lines of using anecdotes rather than pointing out the flaws in Scott's investigation.

                It may have seemed like I support the research because I was arguing against GeneraIKenoA instead of agreeing with him and arguing against Scott.
                ```

        - u/ThatDarnSJDoubleW:
          ```
          He wasn't very active in the threads, and his research was just ten comments that he glanced at and didn't actually post for anyone else to look at.

          He didn't notice how many comments conservative vs liberal topics did, how many upvotes each got, or *how* conservative conservative topics were vs how liberal liberal topics were.

          My experience was that the right wing opinions were far to the right of the average conservative; the left wing opinions were mild, inoffensive things that are believed by the average moderate conservative as much as by the average leftist or center-leftist.

     * [SCP-3930](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3930): it genuinely doesn't exist, which is why it's interesting.

     * [SCP-3309](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3309), [SCP-001/Swann](http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandrewswann-s-proposal): metafictional objects. The second is my favourite [SCP-001 proposal](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-001).

     * [SCP-140](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140): a reality-warping book.

    * Tales:

     * You're already familiar with [the Antimemetics stories](http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub), I take it?

     * Tentative recommendation: [*The Cool War*](http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-cool-war-hub), a series about the *Are We Cool Yet?* Group of Interest. I found it interesting, but it may not be what you're looking for.

     * [*Visions of a Better World*](http://www.scp-wiki.net/visionsofabetterworld): why the Foundation doesn't usually exploit SCP objects.
