## [BST] How much resources would you need to conquer the world?

### Post:

Imagine you've just met green-haired girl, and she asked you to conquer the world. And then she told that if you refuse, you're going to die horribly, and she will ask someone else. Now she's ready to give you any assistance you need, be it information, technology, money or superpowers. Of course, she prove her capabilities with some impressive feats.

By "conquering", this girl wants you to be able to unite most of the Earth population behind possibly unethical task. Invading other sentient species is a good example. Nobody cares about official titles - you can rule from the shadows, but you need to be efficient about it. Also, you need to keep at least 80% of current population alive and able. And you have a time limit of 10 years.

But she also told that you're not the only one she contacted. She's holding a tender of sorts, searching for a lowest bidder. You don't know exact metrics used to determine a "cost" of resources, but generally more powerful (Death Stars) and more precise (full brainwashing) costs more. AGI is unavailable, neither are self-replicating robots or large-scale robot factories. Also, creativity brings some merit. Intentionally losing tender is not an option - not only would you die, but your friends/family risk living in a world conquered by someone else.

Any clever ideas?

  I aske her to give me undeniable proof that she has the powers she claims to have, so that others can be persuaded. I can pay her for that proof with loaned money, so that total cost is 0 USD.

  I persuade world population with that proof, that resistane is futile, and that they should just let me conquer them, for a promise that except for one thing I will do that is non-negotiable - I will create worldwide democracy.

    I don't think UN (or any other body) would ratify going to interplanetar war with other species, however good of a proof you're going to present (unless it contains serious threat, and this needs to be pretty efficient to both win tender and do the job). I think alot of people would try to dispose of you somehow.

  Code Geass?

    That was my first thought as well. 

    Geass of Absolute Command would likely be enough. Just establish a macro that you could call "Action A" or "Action B" for quick commanding, Include within it several or all of the following:

    * "Perform perfectly normally except obey any verbal command I give you prefaced with the words 'Would you kindly'?"
    * "Do not harm me, or through inaction allow me to come to harm."
    * "Inform me or any attempts or plans by others to harm me."

    And so on. Create a good macro and use that. This is important because it is a thing that works only once per target, but lasts forever when used. The objective is to balance personal safety with retention of free will.

    Then test if the Geass can be used as an Oracle (ie. Geass someone to answer P=NP. Are they forced to tell the absolute truth, the truth they know?) and any other number of edge cases.

    Then, once your macro is set, just hit everyone who may be a threat to you (likely almost everyone) with your above Geass. Maybe add a number of trigger words so that it isn't so obvious to non-Geass people when you give commands [which you shouldn't need to do often, since your Geass should be coded to make them act in your best interest. 

    Your ideal situation is a quick ascent to power in which everyone just assumes you are that charismatic and nobody ever thinks you have any kind of special power.

    This is what Lelouch *should* have done.

  More powerful and more precise costs more.  Fine.  What's the cost of my gaining ownership of most of the world's major oil wells, mineral deposits, and investment banks through a network of shell companies?  I negotiate with the girl I've promptly labeled "Lyra Heartstrings" for trolling's sake to find the optimal trade-off point between getting my entry to the essential markets and having a low contract cost for her.

  I figure I could even start with something small, like using cultural understanding or very minor mind-control to start bringing the mineral wealth of Afghanistan to global markets (EDIT: Can't do that in 10 years, CRAP), amassing a solid billionaire-hood for myself, with which I can plot my takeovers of the other markets and my acquisition of relevant governments.

  From there I'll be able to control enough of global political opinion-leadership to push public policy in much of the world whichever way I want it.  If I put in a low-enough contract cost to start with to support some evil mind-control or something, I can even use that or similar on recalcitrantly honest officials.

  EDIT: Lacking the mineral wealth of Afghanistan, and assuming gaining control over Saudi Arabia is too costly, I'd negotiate for some technological Phlebotinum capable of launching the next Google-grade tech startup within 5 years to attain multi-billionaire-hood.  Or I could just use Phlebotinum to replace an existing mega-billionaire who's capable of all this stuff I need.

  BASICALLY: THE KOCH BROTHERS.

    Do you have any evidence for or against the ability of "muggle" multi-billionaires to get complete controlof the world (enough to declare total war on different species) in 10 years? I'd say, given the amount of multi-billionaires, it's not that trivial, otherwise someone would already do that. Elon Musk is THE prime suspect here.

  Breedable mind control parasites that you can control from anywhere on earth.

    I'd like to elaborate on your plans. Do you intend to mind control only political/business elite? Army? Full world population? First plan could go haywire when general population learns of that "interplanetar war". People would be re-elected, and even if you mind-control new leaders again, people still wouldn't like going to war. And some medical test could notice the parasytes, and that would completely derail the plan.

    On the other hand, full-population mind control wouldn't go throught the tender, in my opinion.

  So, she wants you to become the director of a large media empire?

  As long as there's no powerful opposition to the thing I have to convince people of, at least - George Soros (and allied media groups) and Roget Ailes (and allied media groups) can oppose each other, but imagine if they both wanted to blow up [Pupulon](http://www.pbfcomics.com/162/) - who's to oppose *them*?

  Step one: enlist the aid of someone competent.  
  Step two: get out of the way and let *them* do it.

    Which is precisely what your Mystery Magical Benefactor is already doing. The recursion only works if you're good at finding people more competent than yourself.

      Well, yeah, but at least I'm almost certain to be better at *that* than said Mystery Magical Benefactor. After all, I have strong doubts as to the difficulty in finding someone more suited to the task than me.

  a guessing power like Tattletale of worm or maybe a transmittable "like me" curse (shake hands and now you want to make me happy above all). I would go as low as to ask only to get an IQ 4-sigma above average, 60k dollars,  and instinctual charisma to rival Hitler and the pope at their best.

    Accord's power would probably work better here. Ability to solve problems that scales in relation to the problem.
