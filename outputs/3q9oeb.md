  NURSE STABBED IN DUMMY AFFAIR

  NJ. A nurse at Morris Folger Memorial Hospital was found stabbed to death this morning. Local Surgeon Dr. Peng has been arrested and has confessed to the crime. Peng was apparently overcome with rage when he encountered the nurse, J.O., in mid-coitus with the hospital's training dummy when he came in for an emergency. Security footage was made available to us showing him stabbing the nurse thirty-seven times with a surgical scalpel. Peng, who was almost incoherent, claimed that the dummy had been "his"; apparently he had been listening to its genitals for medical advice. At this moment it is unknown what drugs, if any, the well-respected surgeon was on at the time. Hospital officials have voiced disbelief and bewilderment at the grisly crime, though a staff member who asked to not be named told us she "saw it coming miles away".

    Oh *wow* that humour is black. A coping mechanism for her grief, I presume?

    Also, the nurse is J.O.? I bet the reporter loved that one.

      For the record, hilariously enough, those parts of the joke were unintentional.

      I am not a native speaker. I just read this and went "Oh wow, that cannot possibly end well."

      Unrelatedly: does anyone feel like we're getting the other half of an absurdist story here? I mean, if you read something where a surgeon consults the dick of a practice dummy for advice, would you go "clearly a teleworking medical analyst has hacked that dummy" - no, you'd assume they were hallucinating or it was a demon or something.

        This is already an absurdist story. A telepresent hacker-nurse roots a bag of nanoactive meat to haunt a doctor who paints the faces of his patients into balls that he rolls around in naked by answering yes/no questions with a foot-long boner. This is as fucking absurdist as it gets!

          Weird, as I was reading it every individual step seemed somewhat plausible at the time, and yet I can't disagree with your description.

            It is a thing of great beauty and power.
