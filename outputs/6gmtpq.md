## How would you best go about implementing a prison in a VRMMO?

### Post:

So, I've been writing a litrpg story for the past year. Death Game style, with few few obtrusive game mechanics.

How would a prison be best implemented, knowing that magic exists and player factions would be hesitant to spend much resources, in wealth or manpower, on the issue?

There is no system in the game itself for player punishment or an ethics code. Players can build structures. There are mines and etc.

The complexity of my thoughts on the issue isn't far beyond 'concentration camp in the woods' at the moment. I'd like to find a use in a VRMMO for prisoners that would be considered secure and profitable for the prison wardens.

  So, cheap incarceration methods?

  The first thing that comes to mind is the bomb collar. Leave the perimeter, attack somebody, cast a spell, try anything funny, your head is blown off. A system that errs on the side of prison integrity might generate false positives, creating a tenous and cruel existence, at relatively little cost to the incarcerators.

      The only thing I'd worry about is that bomb-collars are a little overdone

      Could always go with shock collars instead.

  Why am I in a death game?  And can I talk to the outside?

  One possibility is that we opted-in to a season of Ironman-mode RPG.  So, 'death' is just perma-removal.  In this case, I'm OK killing my fellow PCs.  It's a valid tactic, and I'm not going to get punished after we all escape.

  In that case, factions can just tell someone that they're confined to their room for the next 3 days.  If the person tries to escape, just stab them and don't feel bad about it.

  Another possibility is that we're playing Sword Art Online.  Everyone's forced into the game.  We want to escape.  The real world government can probably watch us. 

  In this case, killing is morally hard **and** means that I could get tried for murder when I get out of the game.  So I really, really don't want to kill anyone outside of immediate self-defense.

  In this case, my thought is that I don't really need a prison (in the sense of a physical locale).  I just need a way to punish people, and to keep them from hurting anyone else for a while.

  One option might be to exploit the way RPGs have so much exponential leveling and dependence on gear.

  Anti-Social Bob is annoying.  The guild decides to sanction him.  So we strip him of his gear and drop him into the middle of an absurdly high-level town.   Bob is too low-level to hurt any of the PCs, and he can't meaningfully leave without getting eaten by monsters.

    This is the kind of thinking that makes rational fiction great. Excellent thinking outside the box; it would be really interesting to see the social effects of this kind of partitioning played out in a story, not just as a prison system. There are so many ways you could take this. Off the top of my head, black-market transportation, social hierarchies causing segregation, power monopolies and isolation, the effects on trade and how the extreme first-mover advantage affects the kinds of people in each group. Then you'd need an identity system for this to even work as a prison system, and putting that in place brings up a whole other section to explore.

  Oh, I think I read your question wrong at first. You mean the prison is not only built inside the VRMMO, but also *by* players of the same MMO and *for* other players of it, right?

  >How would a prison be best implemented

  Anyway, the answer would greatly depend on the game mechanics of this VRMMO, including its magical system and player interaction capabilities. Other important prerequisite questions: why can’t \ won’t the wardens just kill the prisoners instead of bothering with their incarceration, and why won’t the players just quit the game once they’ve been imprisoned?

  Depends, I suppose, on whether there's a functioning government, or just a collection of local factions. 

  If the latter, and ethics aren't a problem, you could have them in a basic locked cell, plus or minus teleport jammers or mana drainers, if such things exist and are needed.

  If you'd like to have slaves, you could have them do tedious tasks which, if repeated a lot, give out moderate resources. Having them do basic farming/fishing/mining minigames to get the basic resources of production are good, since it can be run by anyone regardless of level and can be overseen by a guard with the only weapons/mana availible. 

  A few well-behaved prisoners could be given early level blades and put in parties with a well-armored guard to farm pig-skins from level 1 boars.

  If you have control over the only entrance and exit to some dungeon/instance, you send in a few lesser-liked prisoners to farm for mid-level gear, with some higher-level guards on the outside to prevent any funny business. 

  Those last two do leave the danger of an inmate leveling too high for safety, but if you can see stats in some way that's controllable.

  Is there any reason why you can't just dig a pit somewhere and throw the criminals in?  If hunger is an actual issue, you could just throw food in every now and then, simple enough. If they can use magic to fly out, line the walls with anti magic stone. If they can climb, cover the pit with a hard lid and a stupidly heavy rock, with only a small hole to throw in food.

  For added security, you could make the prison in right next to a raid boss that takes way more people to kill than the number of criminals in the prison. That way if they get out, the raid boss kills them.

  > secure and profitable for the prison wardens

  If you want profits, you could hold a death game within the death game. Make the prisoners play games with their lives at stake, and sell tickets to watch. Or well, regular gladiator style fights and betting works too.

  Alternatively, with the world being a death game and all, there's plenty of uses for guinea pigs, sending criminals into dangerous areas first to check if they are safe. Lease out your criminals for profits if you don't care about their lives.

  I believe that your fundamental premise is incorrect.

  Prisons in a "death is real" anything goes, PvP, sandbox game would be extremely valuable for a player faction, and I believe that people would be willing to spend lots of resources on them.

  BUT, you could add on some sort of prison labor system.  Maybe there is a crafting system that requires lots of repetitive, and time heavy labor. Or maybe players generate mana over time, and you can harvest that mana from the prisoners.
