## The Promised Neverland, chapters 1 to 4. A Shounen Jump manga that, so far, feels impressively rational.

  So...this was amazing. Not much else to say really, things make sense, the characters are interesting and not too clichéd, and while the main character isn't completely rational she's intelligent and her decisions still make sense.
  ```

  - u/FishNetwork:
    ```
    I agree.  They hit a good balance with the rationality.

    The characters are making reasonable steps towards their goal.  But they still feel reasonably human.

    I just hope that the argument about [](#s "saving everyone") doesn't drag on forever.  It would be way more interesting to see a "good" character accept an unpleasant truth.
    ```

      Honestly, I kind of want her plan to work, mostly because the objections are all totally valid and if they can make it workable and believable, I'll be quite impressed.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The story probably won't drag on with that and future dilemmas. See, it's a Jump manga, so if it doesn't have action or humor, it needs as little filler as possible in order to dodge the metaphorical axe
      ```

  Eh, always wait for 10 chapters mark, imho. There were quite a few mangas that started incredibly well, but had a huge quality drop in just a few weeks.
  ```

- u/AugSphere:
  ```
  Starts out interesting, but I'm not sure of how far the story will have contort itself to allow the idealistic gotta-save-everyone hero and her I'll-do-everything-for-the-one-I-love sidekick some measure of success.

  Every time I see this "I refuse to admit/don't care how impossible it is" bullshit I just start hoping that the hero doesn't beat the ridiculous odds for once and gets everyone killed. Will probably devolve into typical shōnen fare soon enough.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Oh yes. The moments when the ignore-the-rational-characters-and-do-what's-right get screwed are so sweet, though. Like the *Rick and Morty* episode where Morty decides to save that cloud gas.
    ```

- u/biomatter:
  ```
  I'm going to come back and read this in a little while, but for the record, do you mind giving a brief synopsis of what this is? Plot hook, briefing, description, or whatever? Thanks!
  ```

  - u/Schpwuette:
    ```
    Oh, sure.  
    The official synopsis is: Emma and her friends have a pretty good life at the orphanage they grew up in. Though the rules may be strict, the caretaker is kind. But why are the children forbidden from ever leaving...?

    I'd rather not say any more. The first reveal is pretty impactful, it's worth not spoiling yourself.

    But if I were to give it a genre, I'd say it's a [minor spoilers I guess?](#s " dark sci-fi prison break story.")
    ```

    - u/gbear605:
      ```
      At the start of chapter 4, it calls the series [](#s "a shocking fantasy prison break series").

      Edit: also, I strongly recommend the story. Definitely counts as rational, and maybe even rationalist, depending on the future chapters.

  The most recent chapter in particular gave me a strong rational feeling - rather than merely trying to be Spock logical, they are aiming for a particular goal. They know what they want!
  ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  Was a very interesting read. Just curious, do you know what the release schedule is like? Weekly? Monthly?

  [Also](#s "the ending to chapter 1 blew me away emotionally, even though I sort of started expecting it from the little, subtle clues that the narrator was dropping.")
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Weekly. Mangastream is the unofficial scan, but Viz also has picked it up officially (but you need to pay).
    ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  Calling it now: Norman dies. 

  Starts off pretty good, but shounen usually goes off the rails fairly quickly after. I did really enjoy these first few chapters though!
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Was pretty good. Though I expect it'll lose it's rational status as more chapters come out.
  ```

- u/Charlie___:
  ```
  Man, after the first few pictures I was really expecting them to be clones of rich people, being raised for their organs in a generic dystopia.
  ```

      The Island. 

      It was quite good, a solid 3.7 out of 5 imo.
      ```

      - u/ZeroNihilist:
        ```
        My only real problem with that movie, at least from what I remember, is that the clones have that annoying "memory leak" problem that's common in stories about clones.

        If clones inherit memories and skills from the original, you can clone extremely smart and knowledgeable people and use the clones to greatly increase the pool of smart and knowledgeable people you can throw at problems.

        It's not an instant solution to problems, but it would mean that The Island could be a competitive scientific and medical power in its own right.
        ```

        - u/TheGeorge:
          ```
          Yeah I never like that element either,  it adds a silly supernatural element to what is otherwise quite good sci-fi.

          But the rest of the film is quite good. I'd watch it on Netflix, and actually on purpose rather than just wanting some cheese in the background. Wouldn't buy it though.
          ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  I can't imagine any way the kids would escape in a rational universe, especially if they try to take other kids with them.

  The obvious obstacle n°1 is that the moment they go over the big prison wall, their tracker emits an alarm signal and maybe releases an anaesthetic in their bloodstream. The general problem (which has been kind of ignored by the manga so far) is that the monsters would have no reason to teach the kids any skills or knowledge that might be relevant to prison breaking.

    >The general problem (which has been kind of ignored by the manga so far) is that the monsters would have no reason to teach the kids any skills or knowledge that might be relevant to prison breaking.

    Actually they did reference that. There's a panel somewhere where they talk about how training the kids would usually not be a good idea, but they do it for the sake of quality.

    [Here it is.](http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/003/3625/9)

    Norman showed he knows how to pick locks - I don't know how he'd have picked that up... but maybe he's smart enough to figure it out from a mention in a novel or something?
    ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    That's part of the difficulty. Also I feel they'll have to figure out how to deactivate the trackers at some point.
    ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  As with some other people, I'm concerned the rationality will devolve. It's really easy to start a story off rationally, but I worry how it will progress. Especially considering the Ace's commitment to being irrational.
  ```

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  Well, damn... just as I'd finally reduced one manga from my weekly read list, in goes another one...
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Really feels good to see someone posting it here since I have been following this from chapter 1 when it was announced. Also it's the fastest wsj manga to be picked up for English translations, so it can go a long way if done right.
  ```

- u/renegadeduck:
  ```
  So, Ray is strategic, Norman is tactical, and Emma is… strong? She's the character that needs to have everything explained to her.

  Still, fun. I'll keep reading.
  ```

  - u/gbear605:
    ```
    She's the reader.
    ```

  - u/rhaps0dy4:
    ```
    What is the difference between strategic and tactical?
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      Tactics is mission-level, strategy is campaign-level.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Mind you, it's Shonen Jump, where even long running, strong titles can fall off
  ```
