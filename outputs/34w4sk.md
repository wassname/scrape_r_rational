  It's an interesting concept but the consistent misuse of the term cognitive bias detracts from the video. This isn't "understanding", it's just muscle memory.

    i dont think thats necessarily fair, plenty of things that we think of as "conscious", like doing math, actually have a lot of muscle memory techniques. The LW types have a precise definition of cognitive bias, and thats is generally good, but i think it has a sort of "common" meaning that includes this use, and not in a way thats contradictory to the LW meaning

  I had the same experience when I switched keyboard layouts from QWERTY to colemak. Learning it wasn't that difficult, but then I realised I couldn't use a qwerty layout any more, it wasn't just slow or something, I couldn't type at all. Years and years of typing using QWERTY and it's just gone in a month.

    So, I've used QWERTY, but I never touch typed with it (I wasn't particularly slow, though). I then, a year ago or so, taught myself to touch type on dvorak, and it basically didn't affect my ability to to use QWERTY at all (apart from the fact that I'm a little out of practice now because I usually use dvorak). I wonder if that's only because I didn't touch type with QWERTY or if it's simply different from person to person.

  I'd be really interested to try this, I used to be pretty into dinghy sailing, in which the steering is "naturally backwards".
