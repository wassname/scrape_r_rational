  Not a typo, but I felt a little jarred by the sudden use of second person pronoun in the otherwise third person narrative voice.

  >  Use him terminated and be done with it.

  I had to parse this a couple times. I think it means, "Use <Nic's connection> (for deliberately unspecified purposes) <after killing him>." In which case, the Minister seems unguarded enough to talk about killing Nic to his face but guarded enough that he won't specify how they intend to "use" his connection. As a reader, I don't think we know if connections can be used on dead people. If that's the case, the text would still be easier to read if it was something like "Terminate him, use the connection, and be done with it."

    Thanks, man. That was very helpful. (It was meant to be 'Have him terminated...).

      Ahhhh. That makes much more sense.

      On more a story note, it feels nice to have Nic getting closer with Minister Delcroix. There's a satisfaction to seeing Nic grow in influence and become more of a player of his own, especially when he earns it using his 'good student' powers.

      In that vein, getting full access to the Librarium was really cool. With the chapter's last time skip though, it seems like we're already almost back at Ranvar, but (other than make him happy and explain how he spent his days) we really didn't get much use out of it. It could have been a nice time to put in some world-building.

      Also, just how is Nic paying for all of his transportation? Earlier in the story, it sounded like Nic had to save for a few weeks for a single round trip to the city, and we haven't seen him come into any new income sources.

        I'd say the biggest issue writing a web serial is the inability to look at the whole and gauge where it needs tweaking. With a traditional novel, you would write the whole thing and then adjust for pacing and general flow and development. Add some world buildinng here, take it out there, and so on.  

        With a serial written on the fly, you can't do that, so it's very hard to judge, plus the added constraint of having not much time (and even less when things go awry irl) mean I never really know if I'm rushing or stretching until some time later.

        It does help when people mention it, I can stop it going to far down one road, but I can never really fix it to the level I would like. It's very frustrating. 

        Mostly I write on instinct and mine are good enough to get away with it (mostly), but I am guilty of rambling/being abrupt at times. I'm not sure how I'm ever going to really get on top of the problem, though. 

        BTW I'm writing this mainly because I have a chapter to write and I need to procrastinate somehow.

        P.S. I think he had money saved up for travelling, which he hadn't used up, until now.

          Hey, thank you for the thoughtful reply.

          I'm still trying to be more of a wise reader [(from the sidebar link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1w4llw). I'm enjoying your story and respect the effort it takes you to write something like this. It sounds like you took my comments as constructively as I intended.

          As some positive feedback, I think the Dizzy part of this chapter helped "fix" my confusion about their earlier interaction at the base camp.

          I always keep that in mind when I read web serials. I like the story so far. Maybe sprinkle in morsels of worldbuilding like /u/tokol said, that's always nice (can be mundane stuff like architecture, clothes, foods, etc).
