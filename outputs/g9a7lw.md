## Creating A Philosopher King

### Post:

Due to current events, I've recently been entertaining the idea of a 'Leader Caste' which would be best suited for administrative and civil work. From there my mind went off the tracks and wondered if it would be possible to train a human being to be a good leader from birth. Would some form of genetic engineering be required, or would nurture suffice? Exactly how would such a child's life be structured, and what if the experiment were to fail? What lessons would they be taught - what would be considered indispensable to good leadership and what would be window dressing? How would you do it? 

I've only read of one work which had a similar premise: Rex Electi by W.P. Kimball. In this work the Roman Empire never fell, and to prevent horrific succession crises and even more horrid rulers dozens of children (all genetically children of the current ruler) are raised by noble families and introduced to various adversities to see if they have what it takes to be the new Emperor or Empress. It's alright, though the editing from what I recall leaves something to be desired. Your thoughts?  Is there anything you've read that has a similar premise? Please let me know if this should instead be posted elsewhere.

  That seems like just a bad idea on its face.  Human history (since agriculture, anyway) has been the story of groups getting power and then using that power to benefit themselves over other groups, often inventing reasons why they deserve those advantages.  Democracy, as it has been said, may be a horrible system of government, but it's better than anything else we've tried because it's designed to be resistant to that particular flaw.

  > From there my mind went off the tracks and wondered if it would be possible to train a human being to be a good leader from birth. Would some form of genetic engineering be required, or would nurture suffice?

  I think nurture would be sufficient.  There's nothing specifically genetic about effective leadership.  That said, there are several obvious choices to make if you're going to make genetic changes for the sake of leadership - making the person physically attractive always helps, and removing some of the natural illogical biases would definitely be a good idea.

  As for what you'd want to learn, critical thinking would be number one, paying special attention to what kinds of logical fallacies the human mind are easily led into (both to avoid them yourself and to exploit/protect against in your followers), followed by public speaking, and building a vocabulary of languages and cultures to encompass everyone you're going to be leading.  They should learn enough to be a jack of all trades in all of the major aspects of the economy, to know how they support and interact with each other.

  And have them travel between all of the various cultures of the world and interact with people, families, and villages from each of them, to recognize that they are people exactly the same as they are.

  >Exactly how would such a child's life be structured, and what if the experiment were to fail?

  If you were actually to try this (again, I think shutting entire classes of people out from power is a bad idea, both historically and ethically), the best way to do it would be scientifically.  Make a list of all of the aspects you want in a leader, and try different approaches to raising children until you have one that yields the best results.

  > Is there anything you've read that has a similar premise?

  I remember a short story set in a prison, where everyone in that prison had been raised into a caste, including an administrative/leadership caste, and they try to plot an escape; I don't remember the name of the story or the author.

    If you're suggesting that genetics do not play any role in leadership, this is not true. There is definitely a genetic correlation to intelligence as we've found in studies of genetically-identical twins who were raised by different families. There is also a [genetic component to emotional intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denis_Bratko/publication/23302097_A_Behavioral_Genetic_Study_of_Trait_Emotional_Intelligence/links/00b7d517fa7861daf8000000/A-Behavioral-Genetic-Study-of-Trait-Emotional-Intelligence.pdf) which has shown fairly strong correlations with things like assertiveness (0.74), adaptability (0.73), social awareness (0.80), impulsiveness (0.76), etc. High intelligence and emotional intelligence are both definitely contributors to effective leadership, so the impact of genetic correlations with those traits has to be taken into consideration.

    Of course, as you've said, beauty will play a role in leadership as well. For example, people tend to correlate [beauty with trustworthiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4020344/) which would obviously improve leadership effectiveness, even if there no difference in real leadership ability.

    Of course, to tie this back into the original topic, if we can fiddle with genes to improve IQ, EQ, and beauty, there's no reason to limit this to a leadership caste. An entire world of smart, emotionally-intelligent and beautiful people is probably better for everyone than a world where only a small leadership caste is like that.

      >If you're suggesting that genetics do not play any role in leadership, this is not true.

      No, that's not what I meant at all.

      What I mean is that the aspects of leadership that relate to "nurture" are so much more important than they completely overwhelm the "nature" aspects.  A "natural-born leader" without leadership training will probably be completely outperformed by someone who is less genetically suited, but has been properly trained for the role.

      >Of course, to tie this back into the original topic, if we can fiddle with genes to improve IQ, EQ, and beauty, there's no reason to limit this to a leadership caste.

      That's another one of those ideas that seem good on the surface, but become problematic the more you think about them.

      Let's leave aside beauty entirely, which is difficult to define objectively and universally.

      The problem with boosting IQ is that it corresponds to a very specific subset of "intelligence:" mainly math skills, language skills, and abstract thinking.  And, fair enough, when people are good at those, they're generally smart in other ways as well.  The problem is that the IQ test seems particularly vulnerable to Goodhart's law (when a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric).  You'd end up with these people who are good at taking the IQ test, but not at applying intelligence practically.

      I'm not as familiar with EQ, but I imagine it would be vulnerable to Goodhart's Law as well.

      Tinkering with people's intelligence through genetics seems like a crapshoot: sure, it could go really well, but I can imagine just as many ways it could go really poorly.  Cybernetic augmentation (adding processing and memory capacity to brains, but leaving the underlying wetware mostly unaltered) seems like a much better option.

      I think the problem is more, the way those things interact to make an actual good leader is way too complex to be genetically programmed somehow. You can have someone who's smart and puts that intelligence to evil. You can have someone who's empathic and lets that make him indecisive when he needs to make a hard call for the sake of the needs of the many.

  I think everytime this experiment has been proposed, ever since Plato's Republic, the process and result of a program to breed and train rulers has been a smokescreen for the author's political views. Basically, if you personally want to write on the topic, firstly be aware that there is no rational answer as there is no successful solution in real life. There can only perhaps be a process of rationally educating someone in rationality and superficial leadership traits. However, that must in turn be rooted in the program's implicit support from the rest of the ruling caste for its results.

  So educating the ruler is only the last step. The first step is contriving the rest of society to obey such a ruler and contribute the resources required to support them. Equally important is ensuring that society does not revolt, which will probably requiring its utter defanging to ensure the ruler caste's dominance.

  In the end, educating a ruler from a ruler caste is unlikely to result in an especially just or desirable ruler. If society is too vibrant, expansive, and rich, the ruling caste will be obsolete due to the fact that as generations pass, inevitably their training will fall out of date, or you leave their training at the mercy of too many uncertain factors. A society where a ruling caste can be a viable solution requires that a static, unevolving or only slowly changing society where the ruler is also materially superior to those whom he governs so that revolution is unthinkable and impossible. Thus, don't train a human to rule humans. Train an AI, or an immortal superbeing.

    Or train humans to be better at settling differences, without as much need for strong leadership.

    I don't think that's the first step, the first step would be research into sociology and the fundimental nature of leadership which would help the second step of convincing people as well.

      We have performed a lot of research on leadership and yet it seems that great people nonetheless rise due to structural factors in society as much as by their own merits and the skills they learn. In addition, a great human leader designed by the system may still fall short if great natural leaders in the population are allowed to rise to oppose them. That's why macro-level control over society to ensure the dominance of the elect is necessary.

  Margaret Weis's *Star of the Guardians* space opera novels have this as a premise; the Blood Royal were the successful result of a project to create good rulers, and the "democracy" that replaced them turns out to invariably elect whichever candidate has spent the most money on propaganda.

    Except they weren't actually good leaders.  Like all aristocrats they were more obsessed with each other than actual good governance and people with the will to control the government took over.

  Training-to-be-a-leader is something that has already happened in noble or politician families, to various degrees of success.  'The Prince' comes to mind first as a book filled with good insights (and with nice examples!), but I'm sure there must be far more about good obtaining, holding onto, and using power.  


  I liked the idea of the 'Philosopher King' when first coming across it out of context, and then when learning more about the details and the context became rather disillusioned with it after gaining the impression that it was originally propounded by a philosopher--essentially someone saying "You know the thing that I do, that currently has little association with ability to hold onto or do much with power?  We should put people like ME in charge."  A bit like a certain Greg Egan book in which a character says "We should let ME mostly shape the Singularity, because I'm a casual science journalist, and so who better?"--bias of viewing one's own field with a better impression than others might view one's field.

  There are a ton of problems with this premise.

  1. Creating a caste hierarchy diminishes empathy by its very nature.  You could get around this with genetic engineering to increase empathy; however, lots of perfectly good, empathetic people are willing to stop their empathy at some pre-defined boundary.  See every genocide ever.
  2. Leadership is not some mythical quality that solves all problems.  A good instinct for leadership without a functional bureaucracy means an ineffective leader.
  3. We already know how to create a bureaucratic caste and it works really well.  Examinations to enter, pre-defined performance reviews, universally defined salaries and advancement for self-chosen educational activities, internal accountability review boards, etc.  Basically take people, tell them they can work a job for life with fair pay and no worries, as long as they are educated and do a good job.
  4. Genetic engineering would help, because it could raise average intelligence from on the current scale 100 to 120.  But we already have a ton of people on the normal end of the curve already.
  5. Our mechanisms for making functional bureaucracy work astonishingly well by Historical standards.  Most Westernized democracies live under some of the most effective least corrupt governments ever by Historical standards.

  I think that you're not thinking meta enough to have any chances of success. No matter how you initially resolve the nature/nurture question, the *main* problem is how to set up the whole system to prevent its erosion, otherwise it's doomed from the beginning (like irl Rome was).

  This is not something we have figured out irl, even though we are really incentivized to. Democracy and regulated free market economy is our best approximation.

  So don't think what combination of eugenics and education the 'leader caste' would employ. Think what mechanisms would force feedback to ensure the 'leader caste' has a vested interest in raising well-being of other castes. Then think what mechanisms would prevent the leader caste from dismantling the feedback loop. Basically, think what would happen if the worst possible individual gets to be the Leader, think how the worst possible leader is stopped and replaced. Don't think how to create the best potential leader.

  edit: there was too much 'would'

  That system in Rex Electi is, um, literally how Rome worked? Of course membership into the ruling class wasn't random, it was a wealth and lineage based class system. But ultimately the nature of the Roman political elite was roughly similar to that. Children of the elite are given a education and are expected to work their way through the ranks of the political system via success in business, administration, law, war and whatever they could get their mitts in. It worked for a time but didn't exactly prevent the rise of shitty Consuls or the ascension of people like Sulla who were kings in all but name. And eventually it was the power struggles between this learned political class that broke the Republic and help bring about the Empire in the first place.

  Even during the Empire it was never solidly feudal style familial succession. Most emperors were already well situated as statesmen or generals before their ascension. Becoming Emperor involved a lot of politicking, a lot of adoptions, a lot of co-Emperors, and a LOT of coups and ascension of Emperors via the popular support of the soldiers, far more so than the title just being passed to an heir. The Roman political class persisted through all of this and, again, didn't exactly prevent shitty Emperors.

  Honestly, to get ideas for this subject it'd be just as well to read history. Read what the Romans or Greeks or Persians or whoever thought about statesmanship and their political philosophy. Read about the civil service examinations of Imperial China, that sort of thing.

The world is set up sort of like you describe, with Nobles being >!biologically augmented with not just intellect-enhancing features, but also enhanced durability and other neat gadgets!<. The main character, of course, is not one of those Nobles, but a young experiment of the Academies. Him and his friends are sort of state-sponsored terrorists tracking down and eliminating resistance against the Crown and the Academies. Nobles don't come into play until a few arcs in, but when they do, they steal every damn scene they're in.
