  Reposting. Not exactly rational, but the world building is pretty good, and the characters have their moments ("It's Basically a Fort" is a great example).

  This one is fun and fairly rational.  Moves a bit slow once you come current, since he only posts about 3k word chapters twice a week.  Might be worth waiting until it's done posting in July.

    I once estimated that the story would finish in July, but I should correct that. The last update of the current "book" will go live on June 4th i.e. there are three updates more including the one that hits in 90 minutes. The sequel will begin fairly shortly thereafter on around June 23rd.

    Er, if it's not clear from the insider information I'm the author. ;-)
