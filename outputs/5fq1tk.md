## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I'm working on a setting that mixes vampires and werwolves with lovecraftian abominations. And I need ideas and in particular a magic system for it.

  If you know of any horror magic system could you link it?

  Or if you have ideas? My own ideas so far include: All monsters originated from human experimenting rituals on lovecraftian abominations. One of the Lovecraftian gods is made of Sound. He covers the whole planet and chanting can interact with him and do magic.

  Of course it is heavily inspired by Bloodborne but I wanted something with no parallel worlds and for it to make sense. 

  For example how I plan to introduce the CHurch. Most of monsters need to kill/eat/torture humans to survive. They can't hnt indiscriminately or humans will go extint. They are also unwilling to reduce human to cattle as different monsters group have different opinions on how to do it, and a lot of them have friends among humans. So the solution is the Church. It is an organization that regulates human hunting. If a person wears a cross (can be only given by Church roughly 10% of population has one) he is off limits as food. Rogue monsters are dealt by church hunters (usually monsters). Disputes between monsters are also often settled with Church help.

  Any idea/cotribuition/critique/extrapolation is incredibly welcome.

    What's the setting for, because that changes which answers are appropriate.

    For example, it would be pretty flavor appropriate to have werewolves become possessed by an eldritch creature from beyond when the stars are right, thus changing their forms to become more bestial and instilling them with a perverse bloodlust ... but that's not really appropriate to a roleplaying game, because you're taking away player agency.

    Also, what kind of horror magic system do you want? One which is explicitly about horror, or one which evokes horror, or one which has horrific consequences?
    ```

    - u/hoja_nasredin:
      ```
      > One which is explicitly about horror, or one which evokes horror, or one which has horrific consequences?
      Never thought about it this way. I think evokes horror is what I will be going for. Not sure how to pull it off. Horrific consequences are easy, but horror during casting that is not just a "nice animation"?
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Casting involves self-mutilation, flaying away pieces of yourself until the dark gods say you can stop. Their price is not always the same; they can smell desperation and will urge you to a fever pitch of tension, like a haggling salesman who pushes every customer just to the edge of walking away in unhappiness.

        Casting is degrading. The dark gods want blasphemies from you, not just against what your society says is right, but against your own beliefs and values. They will ask you to call yourself names; they'll find your weak spots, those aspects of yourself you most hate, and force you to attack those aspects relentlessly for their pleasure. They will make obscene demands of you, because they feed off your displeasure. When you are finished with a spell, you will have to wash off the words you wrote on your skin, you will vomit up those things you were made to eat, you will likely be sore and bruised ... but the memories will remain, and though you might shrug them off as nothing, the dark gods are good at leaving a scar on the psyche. (Imagine the dark gods as being something like 4chan /b/.)

          Nice. I was going more on the route of Gods are so alien they don't care about human followers. Humans can interact with them and get some perks, but the gods don't even notice this.

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    One of the ideas lovecraftian horror has explored is that modern religions are descended from the original cults that worshipped eldrich abominations, so this could tie in pretty well to that theme. It sounds like you're going for a bit of a gothic horror vibe, so I'd recommend having a magic system with some element of sacrificing humanity. 

    Gothic horror is at its best with villains who choose to to do bad things when they don't need to and the heroes want to do bad things when they know they shouldn't. The fundamental fear it explores is temptation, so it's always easier to make the evil choice. I personally prefer when the temptation is personal rather than practical.
    ```

    - u/hoja_nasredin:
      ```
      >  sacrificing humanity. 

      This is a really intresting point. If turning in a monster would have been a straight upgrade why not all humans turned into monsters? Humanity is a little bit vague. What should people lose when they turn? What will they lose as they continue turning more and more mosntrous? Ability to reproduce? Sanity (but then you can't have powerful intelligent monsters)? Empaty towards others (this way big monsters society destroy themselves as everyone is selfish)?
      ```

      - u/trekie140:
        ```
        I left humanity vague specifically because it tends to vary in stories and I think it should depend on the characters. It shouldn't be so straightforward that rationalists can view it as a simple sacrifice for the greater good, it needs to have a punch to it. The tv show Penny Dreadful is not rational by any means, but at least the first season is a good example of gothic horror since nearly every character has a disturbing capacity for evil. They *want* to make the wrong choice even though they know it's immoral or even against their interests. The true antagonists of the series are the inner demons that they constantly struggle with.

        To more directly answer your question, I think sanity would be the best choice. Insane characters need not be stupid, they just have irrational goals. They can have their own patterns and train of thought, and may even be aware of their faulty reasoning, but what makes them monsters is how they embrace that aspect of themselves instead of fighting it. If the monsters are generally more powerful than humans, then their insanity may be one of their few weaknesses since it keeps them from taking the most effective course of action and leaves them vulnerable to fulfilling their arbitrary goals.

        The problem with tying sacrifice into anything else is that it becomes a cost-benefit analysis. The question of whether or not to use magic ends up being based on whether the sacrifice is worth it, but when it's a person's sanity you can't be sure what will happen or to what degree. I've always felt that horror stories have to defy rationality simply because fear defies rationality. The supernatural should defy reality as we understand it so it can scare us. Lovecraftian horror is especially good at this since the basic idea is that our understanding of reality is just a lie we tell ourselves to stay sane.
        ```

  - u/FishNetwork:
    ```
    I'd suggest imposing a rule that all magic will corrupt people, even if it doesn't physically hurt them.

    The reason for this is that we're used to stories about people facing physical danger.  Dragons are big and scary.  But ultimately, they have stat-blocks.  So do massive evil armies or dark wizards.

    To get the Lovecraftian sense of personal-insignificance and inevitable doom, I think you'd want to go beyond that and introduce dangers that can't really be fought.

    For instance, the Church's magic might be "good".  But, to use it, people have to really become aware of [human suffering and the costs of inaction](http://unsongbook.com/chapter-35-the-voices-of-children-in-his-tents/).

    So, monster hunters would be useful.  But they'd measure normal human experiences (like travel, or family dinners) in [dead child currency](https://web.archive.org/web/20161019091419/http://raikoth.net/deadchild.html).  

    The strain from this means that 'good' magic users are eternally pushing themselves to the point of sickness and injury.  And being around them forces mundane mortals to face the fact that they don't care /that/ much about doing the right thing.

    I'd do something similar with the monsters.  Vampirism / lycanthropy should have major costs beyond injury, pain or an obnoxious diet.   Otherwise, we can imagine ourselves in the monster's position and white-knuckling our way through the downsides.

      Yeah, I have played V:tM and V:tR. Read the new werewolf but not the old one. Currently thinking of having 3 main breeds of monters: vampires with mostly social ablities, werewolves  with mostly physical ones and Kin with mostly mental ones. Kin will be some more lovecraftian/cosmic monsters. They will prey on minds of people, eating memories, sanity and sometimes everything. Not sure which powers to give them.

      What else should I check on W:tA besides Black Spiral Dancers?

          ```

- u/Rhamni:
  ```
  In a story I'm writing, there's a group of non-magicians trying to survive in adverse condition. They mysteriously find themselves in a ruin city in the middle of Bumfuck, Sahara. It gradually starts to look like they weren't just picked at random or ended up there accidentally, so people start getting paranoid and trying to figure out if there are any 'traitors' or conspirators among them who might know more than they say.

  One of the things I am planting the seeds for as I write is that one of them (the 'baddie') is a magic user. The way the main character figures out who it is that they find exactly one person who is able to make things work that should not work. For example, they find brackish water in a cave system. You can't just filter salt out of water, the particles are too small. Yet one character just happens to find filters that can filter out salt. One of the characters is bit by a snake and injected with venom that later kills another character. Except, the first victim doesn't die because the mage manages to 'suck the venom' out of the wound fast enough. In reality, this is not something that can be done. The venom spreads through the blood far too quickly for that.

  So my question for you people: You like it when things are factually accurate/science is used right. But... if you're reading a story and the characters start racking up half a dozen *undeniably* false claims and the other characters/the plot doesn't seem to care for a hundred pages, does that annoy you, or are you comfortable with factoids being allowed to sit until they collide with science much later in the story? I wonder if, from the reader's perspective, it looks like I'm just writing bullshit while trying to sound smart. There are clues smattered throughout, like the chemistry student (from an earlier century) being frustrated that *he* can't replicate the filtering mechanism, but they are probably easy to miss. So my question is, how subtle is too subtle, and are you comfortable reading a story where for a while it looks like the writer is propagating Bad Science?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I haven't heard of this idea being used before.  If, for at least part of it, the characters are reacting to this with some level of incredulity (like the chem student), I'd roll with it.

    Also, the payoff sounds pretty awesome.  (Though I'm a little confused as to why an antagonist would keep up a charade for so long, but I'm sure that's plot-relevant).
    ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    Here's one potential problem: your main character has to eventually realize these are scientific inaccuracies, which will require significant knowledge up-front, which means they will probably realize these should be impossible immediately. Will it ruin the story if they keep pointing out that Steve is breaking the universe?

    Some things could potentially slip by the radar. For example sucking poison out of a wound is not recommended since poisons typically absorb very quickly and putting your mouth on the wound can be counterproductive since it can introduce bacteria into the wound. Even so, that's not to say it could absolutely never work for any type of venomous bite. And even if that's the case, not all snake/spider bites are venomous, and not all bites from venomous animals result in delivery of significant amounts of venom (if they recently bit something else, for example). So, call it a 99.9% chance that Steve is an idiot and that bite wasn't venomous to begin with, and an 0.1% chance that Steve actually saved that guy.

    Another potential problem is motive. Why would Steve teleport all of these random people to Bumfuck, Sahara? It seems like he has very little to gain from the exercise.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      I'm very glad that potential problems were raised, and even happier that I can answer them, at least to my own satisfaction. Hopefully they satisfy you as well.

      MC has virtually zero scientific knowledge. His one skill is the ability to talk people into things. The objections are raised by people who *do* have understanding of their own specialities, most of whom only witness a single impossibility. When they object, they are just ignored; people think they must not know everything, or perhaps there is some random factor in play they don't know about. In the case of the snake bite, they find out later that the venom is lethal indeed, since the same kind of snake kills someone else when Steve isn't around. Now, the first snake could have simply exhausted its supply, or perhaps sucking on the wound did work, etc etc, and these possibilities are raised. On its own, it is not strong evidence of mage-in-disguise. But as the MC starts absorbing Ancient Lost Knowledge (mostly early 20th century-equivalent science), he learns a lesson in inferential distances (while the book is not meant to be rationalist, I am taking this one thing almost straight from Yudkowsky's sequences), and as there are multiple cases of experts saying this one thing shouldn't happen, he starts to consider the possibility that instead of all of them being wrong, maybe all of them are right.

      Steve's motive for bringing people to Bumfuck Sahara is something that makes sense in the book, I hope. In short, there is an incredibly strong taboo surrounding the long dead civilisation that used to live here and their superior magic and technology. In the end they kind of all got killed off by magical WMDs that left the city standing. Steve thinks this taboo is bullshit. He can't recruit other mages to go with him there or they will burn him at the stake, nor can he go alone or he won't survive for very long (and frequent supply runs to civilization risks discovery). So he spends a few years hand picking slaves that have specialised knowledge and skills useful for survival in the city but no knowledge of history. He arranges for all of them to be transported across the desert, then hides among them when they stop for the night. When the slaves wake up the next morning, they are just sitting in the middle of a salt desert, with only the ruin city in view. They find this suspicious, but they also really like the idea of not being slaves anymore, so they set their confusion aside for a while.

      Steve sabotages all attempts at actually leaving the city (as some people want to do), but otherwise just helps out a bit with the whole staying alive thing and spends most of his days just chilling in the libraries of ol' Nazi Hogwarts Moria.
      ```

      - u/Norseman2:
        ```
        That seems reasonable. I think that would work just fine as long as the ways in which Steve breaks the universe are not blatantly obvious to a modestly informed reader, but do become blatantly obvious when you think about them. Sucking poison from a wound is a decent possibility. Filtering salt out of water with some random thing/substance found in a desert seems unlikely unless it happens to be a reverse osmosis filter. I think most readers would understand that dissolved sodium chloride molecules are *very* tiny.

        It think you could also make the story fairly educational if you pick things that modestly-informed readers may believe and then debunk them in the course of the story. I feel like these would be more enjoyable because you'd end up learning about a lot of things which you may not have known were bogus. Wikipedia is helpful as always with its [List of common misconceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions), though I feel like many of them are uncommon, at least among modestly informed readers.

        The trick would be to pick some of those that you think a modestly informed reader would believe, which you also believe you'd be able to explain why it obviously and logically cannot be correct.
        ```

        - u/Rhamni:
          ```
          That's a useful list! Thanks. I've just skimmed it, but I'll give it a closer look. I have a few more impossibilities, but there may be room for more if I find some I like.

          Filters not working on tiny salt particles makes sense to me, but I've asked a few friends with zero interest or aptitude for chemistry, and they didn't know that. They just accepted it in a Star Treky way where you just accept that Data says sciencey things and the plot moves on. So I think that works. And hey, if readers catch on to one or two of the impossibilities, that's fine. As long as they don't think the book is Bad Science and put it down, which is what I'm concerned about.
          ```

            >And hey, if readers catch on to one or two of the impossibilities, that's fine. As long as they don't think the book is Bad Science and put it down, which is what I'm concerned about.

            To avoid this, you could try describing things in a way which allows for some uncertainty that the impossible effect is even occurring at all. Poison from a wound is easy enough, and all you'd need to do is have someone ask about whether we know whether the wound was poisoned to begin with.

            For salt filtration with some random substance/item from the Sahara desert, you could probably get away with it if the salt filter is rather large and sits out in the sun, leaving the possibility that it's actually just a solar-powered water distillery. If you're using a desert plant for the filter, there could be doubt about possibly just leaching relatively pure water out of the plant without any filtration actually occurring.

            As long as you have to juggle probabilities of "Magic", "Coincidence", and "No statistically significant effect", you should be able to avoid turning readers off before they reach the big reveal.

  I'm going to be DMing a D&D campaign soon where the world starts from the prompt "gods outnumber human(oids)".

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    If they outnumber human(oids), then whenever you run into a random person on the street, he's more likely to be a god than not. Random strangers might ask each other what they're the god of, and since they're the largest species out there, you'd get a *lot* of demigods after a generation or two. It might be possible for a god of something to disguise himself as a mortal - and it that's common, then when your adventurers claim to be mortal, other people might not believe them.

    Actual mortals might be considered somewhat crippled or disadvantaged by *not* having divine powers/abilities, and might end up being second- or third-class citizens. A mortal with a loose approach to truthfulness might easily claim to be the god of *something* (generally something minor) which would be embarrassing if he runs into the real one.

    Unless mortals are allowed to worship multiple deities simultaneously, or unless they're allowed to worship each other, there must be some deities with no worshippers at all. (Most fantasy stories seem to imply this is [a bad thing](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly) for them).

  So I was wondering how one might maximize the advantages of superhuman reflexes and a body that has no nerve signal latency, but no super strength or the such the main advantages are to the brain and nervous system.             
  The brain is so upgraded that one could at the extreme spend months of subjective time in a virtual environment deliberating with copies of oneself in one's mind mid combat.                 
  It already occurred to me this could justify using two automatic weapons at the same time with this; since you could calculate perfectly for recoil and even use it to guide each shot into the next. However even this doesn't quite seem like the fullest optimization of these abilities.         
  It occurs to me you might want to use some sort of spring boots to be constantly doing parkour style stuff to make you hard to hit, since it wouldn't impair your shooting ability with these abilities. Plus it occurs to me that with perfect memory which is also part of the package you could be very well adapted to fight if you suddenly set off a smoke bomb, plus you could likely use something like echolocation some blind people use.                 

  Basically i'm wondering what kinds of combat advantages might come with non-qualitative superintelligence. The kind of fighting you might see from a humanoid robot with a extremely fast human level AI in it. Some extra technological advantages might be appropriate if it wouldn't be impossible for a civilian to get ahold of them.
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    It would allow near-infinitely precise control of the body, correct? Then the character should leverage that to maximize the amount of information gathered and actions done in each moment.

    The clothing should include tiny reflective surfaces scattered across the limbs and on shoulders, which should allow near-constant 360-degree vision. Tiny cameras would be more preferable, but that depends on the setting.

    Small mirrors could be thrown to give a view of an obstructed location; while baseline humans would be unable to throw them with the level of precision necessary to ensure that the mirrors would be oriented to them at the right angle at the right time, and would be unable to perceive the reflection in a split-second it would be seen even if they do, our superhuman is not restricted so.

    Perhaps other highly sensetive devices could be included in clothing or implanted in skin, to be activated by precise combinations of muscle contractions. Poisoned needles, communication devices (both transmitters and receivers), remote controls, flashlights, lasers, it depends on the level of technology available.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      That's pretty clever. I'm definitely having these people wear glasses with monitors that display some compressed version of the feed from a 360 camera on their head. They could just run a program in their head that would interpret the warped image into something they can make sense of. Also giving them tiny mirrors to throw, or maybe just mirrored ball bearing, since they can dewarp the visuals from those similar to the 360 camera thing (though I don't know how much). They would throw these in order to see around corners and see things from different vantages.               
      Tech level is modern, but with some extra breakthroughs due to much more space travel. They use a lot of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pulse_propulsion rockets.

    Being able to calculate where your opponents are shooting from could be worth a lot in the right circumstances.

  - u/oliwhail:
    ```
    **No** nerve signal latency? If that applies to signals within the brain as well, that's going to be a fundamentally different kind of processing going on. You might be justified in giving such a character effectively infinite thinking time, for example, as a way of narratively demonstrating what hapens as the whole of their cortex reaches a steady state simultaneously.

    If you just mean very very fast nerve signal transmission, then the kinds of combat applications you mention are one way to go, but I'm not sure direct combat is the biggest contribution you could make compared to the logistical and tactical impact that kind of brain would be able to have.

      Ah yes I've read that one, though I doubt you could really perform that well as a single individual without the ability to interact with new ideas. In the story they have _lots_ of geniuses able to spur each other's thinking and whatnot.                
      I doubt a single individual in isolation could gain the same level of comparative advantage that they could in that story. Not to mention that if you are willing to spend all your time in a environment you create isolated from the world, then there is an obvious danger of gradual wireheading. A great portion of people with these powers end up interacting with the world only to get what they need to survive, spending all their time blissed out or otherwise not producing productive work.
