## Need more rational mystery fiction suggestions

### Post:

I need more book suggestions which have a deconstruction of plot inherently built into its story structure.

Note:

1. I've finished reading all of Keigo Higashino's English works (Includes Newcomer).
2. Fanfiction suggestions are welcome. But I'd prefer a non-fanfiction. I'm mostly looking for another set of authors like him.
3. Manga/Comic suggestions are welcome too.

  *If on a Winter's Night a Traveler* by Italo Calvino is a magnificent metanarrative mystery about the act of picking up a book called *If on a Winter's Night a Traveler* by Italo Calvino. Extremely beautiful and good.

  Also check out [*CORDYCEPS: Too Clever for their Own Good,*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868) which I think has the honor of being the only member of the epistemological mystery genre.

    I should try it again. I remember starting reading it when I was pretty young and all I felt was frustration at how often I was left hanging by a new story that I had just gotten engaged by. Which... I guess... was the point, so mission accomplished XD?

  Deconstructions of plot eh

  Waves Arisen would be my recommendation.

  For me, the ultimate mystery and meta-mystery deconstruction would be the Visual Novel [Umineko no Naku koro ni](https://store.steampowered.com/app/406550/Umineko_When_They_Cry__Question_Arcs/) . I highly recommend it, especially if you're willing to engage with it despite its crazy blend of rational and irrational elements. I can say more if you're interested, but I'd suggest going in as blindly as possible to preserve the integrity of the experience!

    Seconded, way up. One of my favourite works. Still, if the visual novel format is not for you, there is also a good manga version... but stay away from the anime.

  Could you explain a bit more about what Higashino's work does in terms of deconstructing plot, without spoiling the books? Which one should I read first?

  In terms of deconstructing mystery/detective/thriller conventions, I would suggest:

  The Chain of Chance and The Investigation by Stanislaw Lem

  The Name Of The Rose and Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco

  The Death of the Author and A Closed Book by Gilbert Adair. I haven't read his Evadne Mount trilogy, but it is apparently a deconstruction of Agatha Christie's work, so might be relevant to your interests.

  I couldn't get into it, but maybe also The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton (protagonist keeps experiencing a murder mystery plot, waking up as a different person involved each time).
  ```

    Higashino's work highly showcases the logic of "Hold off on proposing solutions".

    If I had to paint a high-level picture, think of how an engineer would try to reverse-engineer a device they were not allowed to look into.  What tests they would perform. His greatest ability is knowing precisely what the test results would yield and then work backward to the inconsistencies.

     If I had to reverse-engineer a Higashino, I guess I'd first try to come up with the perfect crime, and then prove that a perfect crime is not really possible based on slight giveaways that are inherent to solving any problem. The inverse of the rule: "Don't come up with any plan which depends on more than three things to go in your favor". Any further discourse and I might be giving away spoilers.

    If you had to start, go with the three Detective Galileo novels:

    1. The Devotion of Suspect X
    2. Salvation of a Saint
    3. A Midsummer's Equation

    Then go with the Detective Kaga Series:

    1. Malice
    2. Newcomer

    And at last, you are left with two more English translated works:

    1. Journey under the midnight sun
    2. Naoko

    Naoko is a different breed of suspense. So, I'd say you should keep it till the end.

      Thanks. Based on this, most of my suggestions are not much like his work, but I hope some of them sound interesting to you anyway.

        Well, I have a habit of hoarding books to my to-read list. So no worries. All recommendations are welcome. Cheers.
