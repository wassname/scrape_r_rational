## [RT] Volume 2, arc #1 complete for My Life is Not a Manga, or Maybe...!

### Post:

The first major arc for volume 2 of [My Life is Not a Manga, or Maybe...](https://notamanga.com/) is now complete! If you enjoy a genre-aware character who tries to think his way around his problems but is still fallibly human, you might enjoy Not A Manga. You can read it on the official website or Royal Road:

**Minor, high-level spoilers to follow.**

Please note that while volume 1 is a slice-of-life high school harem story, volume 2 is an *isekai*. A number of people were disgruntled at this switch, but it was something I'd planned before I started writing the first volume. It's always bugged me when reading *isekai* (or portal fantasy in general) that I'm never rooting for the main character to return home because their home life is a complete unknown. "Oh, I miss my family and friends!" Yeah, big whoop. You're living an awesome, over-powered fantasy life with a beautiful cat-girl fawning over you, what more do you want? It's not like I know anything about your family other than possibly their names (usually not even that). For Not A Manga I wanted to try implicitly playing with this dichotomy between reader and character's motivation by getting readers invested in the main character's real life before pulling the rug out from under everyone all at once.

In any case, the second arc for volume 2 will involve a new POV main character and a slight genre shift (nothing big; just switching sub-genres of *isekai* for our new POV). The first public chapter for the second arc will be available March 4, 2020 (had a week of downtime thanks to a week-long family vacation). Hopefully you enjoy!

  Do you have a release schedule you're targeting for volume two?

    ```
    I release one chapter a week (with the unusual exception of this week), and there will probably be around 40-50 chapters in total (we're about halfway there). So likely complete in around six months.
