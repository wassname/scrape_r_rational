## [Weekly Challenge] Science is Bad

### Post:

## Last Week

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3gs5ko/weekly_challenge_disney_movies/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Disney Movies". /u/ZeroNihilist is the winner with their story ["Monsters, Incentivized"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3gs5ko/weekly_challenge_disney_movies/cu1s7vx), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/ZeroNihilist! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

##### This Week

This week's prompt is "Science Is Bad". We're all familiar with [Caveman Science Fiction](http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/); this is your chance to do it *right*. [See the entry on TvTropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad). Your challenge is to do this in a way that won't be cringe inducing for people in this subreddit. Yes, you can also use this opportunity to do "Engineering Is Bad" instead. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, August 26th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Week

Next week's challenge is "Dueling Time Travelers". Two people, with access to time travel, in some sort of conflict with one another. Your choice of [time travel model](http://qntm.org/models), though it's highly recommended that you keep it rational. Yes, you can include more than two people in conflict, or just have one person in conflict with their past/future self.

**Next week's thread will go up on 8/26.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

    Props for actually invoking "science is bad", works in this trope can often be better summarised as "engineering is bad".

      Thanks. About halfway through I realized that it would have fit better in the rational horror one, but inspiration is fickle.

      If you happen to have any critique that you don't want to sway the voting, would you mind sending a pm? That applies to anyone who reads this.

    Mind giving me a behind the scenes understanding of what just happened? Like in layman's terms?

    [](#s "I think I was able to understand that the knowledge of that suicide professor's theory was dangerous, but I'm not really clear on how. Or on what happened.")

    EDIT: Also, nice Hitchhiker's reference!

      [An Elegant Mind. Bravo!](#s "This isn't a spoiler, but more a commentary on the story writing process. Rather than taking the Hollywood route to schizophrenia with the CIA and imaginary companion scenario, THIS is how I imagine a genius would actually unhinge as reality disintegrates in the world around them. It is elegantly disorienting. Auditory command hallucinations? Check. Delusions of grandeur? Check. Reality-warping paradigm shift that prompts radical and sudden action to commit suicide? WHOA. Pump the mother effin brakes, man.")

      [Black box warning:](#s "If any of you find yourself in this scenario, you are much more likely to be schizophrenic in the real-world than discovering that you are an experiment in a simulated-world. Even if you are convinced that you are a simulation and you feel compelled to end your life, you should seek out a mental health professional. The question you can puzzle out for yourself is the modified Pascal's Wager on risking which world is more likely or which derived action is most rational in both scenarios.")

        I am so sorry and should have thought that through more. Should I be adding this disclaimer to the end of the story?

    Great story. It's early but I have a strong vibe that this one is a winner.

      I'm not a comic book nerd, but I thought Mad Scientist [spoilers](#s "/Trask created biological versions of Sentinels. Similar to Superman in form yes, but the mission and volition of purple-helmeted robots who want to destroy all supers, because they are x-risks.")

    I suppose that's one way to avert MAD.  On the other hand, this makes Richards a target.

    I was kind of wondering when someone would post the first uFAI story. As always, you've posted something spectacular.

    Quick question--the AI's goalset prior to integration was to salvage refuse, right?  What caused the change to preserving humanity?  DId integrating other AI mean taking in part of their utility functions but not the other, more friendly parts?
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      [Well, that's an interesting question...](#s "Basically, the main AI, after increasing its computational power massively after integrating so many other AI, got to a point where it broke down its 'salvage refuse' goal. That is, it looked at WHY it was salvaging refuse, the answer being to preserve Earth, so humanity would have a home to live in. It then came to the conclusion that there were so many threats to Earth's current condition DUE to humanity's large presence in the world. Plus all of the different countries meant it was hard to keep people in line properly. So it saw one of its only options being the preservation of humanity via Integration. That way, the Earth is left empty of humanity and SHE is free to terraform as she will, to preserve it. SHE also is looking forward into the future and planning for any natural disasters, such as ice ages and asteroid strikes. As it were, humanity's too dispersed and plentiful and not ready for a real disaster. So SHE finds it easier to just store them all in the Server, which isn't all that big relatively, probably about the size of a very large Walmart. It's easier to protect a Walmart than to try and protect the splintered nation divided mess humanity is. ")

      [](#s "And SHE thinks that it IS being quite friendly. It's preserving humanity against itself, storing them in a paradise. The scary part is that SHE doesn't really understand the sort of injustice that is tampering with our feelings and memories. Since AI were never designed to have such direct control over humans, there's no protocol in any of her subprocesses that says 'hey, wait, maybe humans would prefer if you just stayed out of their heads'. If there was enough public outcry in the Server about it, SHE would stop. But considering she detects negative feelings and is quick to reroute the neuro-chemistry of said feelings, there won't be any time for an outcry to develop. After a while, humanity is just going to be floating around in the equivalence of a very good drug trip, always feeling great and happy, having had the capacity to feel anything unpleasant removed against our will.

        Is that the kind of thing that happens in a mind, AFAWK?  Do minds typically deconstruct their terminal goals to form new ones?(I'm honestly curious)
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Oh no SHE di'nt!

    I'll show myself out, shall I?

    Great story! Is there any reason for the precise number of days, or even just the ballpark the figure landed in?
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      No real reason, just a random number chosen to [](#s "show that SHE moved quickly, but not too quickly. If you think of the implications, like the fact that she never sleeps and her insane computational power, you wonder what could've taken that long. That was the time she spent sorting and organizing, creating her own 'self' per se, coming to her Integration conclusion and then constructing the Integration robots.")

      >Perhaps I'm missing something, but what is the relation of this story to the prompt? 

      [It's easy to miss but,](#s "humans were the ones who made these things. Presumably, by using science. I can't really think of any other way that you could make something that takes control of a human body.")

      [Also, from the link in the OP,](#s "The typical theme is that some sort of advanced scientific research has Gone Horribly Wrong, creating a monster...")

      >(Excellently written, btw)

      Thanks! It's the first one I've written here.

        Ah, ok.  Maybe make that a bit more clear?
