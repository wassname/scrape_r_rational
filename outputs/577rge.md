  ```
  These are all fantastic, and /r/dwarffortress says hello in the comments.  I *do* love changelogs...

  Other readers may be interested in [*Working as Intended*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/working-as-intended-worm.320007/) - the *Worm* fanfic consisting mostly of a shaker-12 issuing patch notes.

  Edit:  I didn't actually expect a post like /r/dwarffortress/comments/578f72
  ```

  - u/edwardkmett:
    ```
    I really wish "Working as Intended" hadn't stopped updating. =( It was spot-on hilarious.

    It is also worth noting there are a few fun little asides hidden in the text in the same color as the background, which I missed on first reading, but caught by accident by highlighting and unhighlighting the text as a nervous tick my second time around.
    ```

    - u/JulianWyvern:
      ```
      I use a invistext script. Works for both SB and SF, so I love it.

      That said, I still highlight unhilight as a tick too. And I really want to lose it but wow is it hard
      ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    Fixed an issue where demons would sometimes depose monarchs and rule as immortal god-kings. This now occurs much more often than "sometimes".
    ```

- u/gabbalis:
  ```
  /r/outside? Is that you?
  ```

- u/CreationBlues:
  ```
  Which paper is 21 referencing?
  ```

- u/appropriate-username:
  ```
  OP press "retry thumbnail" on your post.
  ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    I did, but it didn't change
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Did Francis Fukuyama say/publish anything in the last year to warrant this shout-out? Or is it just an older reference to *The End of History*?
  ```

  - u/symmetry81:
    ```
    I think it's just a reference to *The End of History*.
    ```
