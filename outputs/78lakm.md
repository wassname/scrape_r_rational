      I know, but Zombie the Second was a living horse as opposed to a raised one, and she mentions chargers being expensive here when she can easily take a sick one that's otherwise useless, essentially getting it for free.

    I think she's currently got a far winged horse. It's unlikely Cat's necromancy is going to work on that once it's dead.

    Here's a quick and dirty primer:

    **The leaders**

    * Duchess Kegan Iarsmai of Daoine: Pretty self-explanatory. She's the leader of Daoine, a mostly independent section of Callow (they were unconquered by the Legions, but agreed to swear fealty to the Tower). Daoine itself has an elite fighting force known as The Watch, who seem to have stronger abilities due to their connection to a god of some kind. Watch members were kidnapped by Akua/Diabolist to use as ritual fodder to make her city float. Kegan wants them back.

    * Commander Adair: Kegan's right-hand man, oldest friend, and leader of the Watch. Not much info on him; he was mentioned briefly in the chapter "Commanders." Seems less willing to work with Praes and Cat than Kegan.

    * Grem One-Eye and Istrid Knightsbane: Mentioned by name, but not actually at this meeting. ~~Both are marshals (higher rank than general)~~ (Corrected thanks to /u/TideofKhatanga) Grem is a marshal while Istrid is a general, and they control the first and sixth Legions respectively. Istrid is Juniper's mother.

    * Marshal Ranker: Commander of the fourth Legion. Female goblin with a burned hand. 

    * General Afolabi: Commander of the 12th Legion. Doesn't trust Cat and was put in his place in a previous episode, but Malicia seems to have influenced him to behave better. Soninke race.

    * Brandon Talbot: Grandmaster of Callow's heavy calvary Order. Callowan noble, distrusts Praes but follows Cat. 

    **The members of the 15th Legion**

    * Juniper: Orc nicknamed the Hellhound, general of the 15th Legion. Terse, intelligent, and a stickler for rules. Has a bit of a hero-worship crush on the Black Knight. Daughter of Marshal Istrid.

    * Hakram: Named the Adjutant, Cat's right-hand man. Has a skeletal hand, poor skills at hiding his booze, and many paramours due to being the first Named Orc in generations. All around best bro.

    * Aisha Bishara: Staff Tribune, de facto political negotiator for Cat due to her noble upbringing and knowledge of politics and Praesi. Taghreb race (Corrected; thanks /u/skwint)

    * Ratface: Nickname of Supply Tribune Hasan Qara. Taghreb race. Acting quartermaster (?) for the 15th. Gets Cat her wine; has issues with Praesi nobility due to his upbringing (bastard son of a noble father who keeps trying to have him killed). Used to date Aisha. 

    **Not at the meeting but discussed or involved.**


    * Pickler: Not at the meeting, but brought in the table for it. Goblin female, head of the 15th's Sapper corps. Both Nauk and Robber have a romantic interest in her. She likes testing her new designs for siege weaponry.

    * Akua Sahelian: Not at the meeting but discussed. Named the Diabolist (formerly Heiress), proud owner of the flying city of Liesse. Cat's current arch-rival. 

    * Masego: Not at the meeting because he'd rather set himself on fire. He probably meant that literally. Named the Hierophant (formerly Apprentice). Lost his eyes during his Name transition but still can see with the artificial ones he made from his magical glasses. OTP with Archer in my head canon. 

    * Zombie the Third: Cat's third horse in as many books. This one is a pegasus from Arcadia that she stole during a fight.

      ```
      Istrid is a general, not a marshal. There's only three Marshal of Praes at any given time and the third one (a Sonninke IIRC) stays in Ater due to being in charge of keeping the Wasteland in order. A mission which recently involved killing most living beings in Wolof.

      Also, we had a look at the last Named Commander of the Watch in one of Cat's Name dreams. IIRC, it's at the end of book 1 when she prepares for the Grand Melee.
      ```

      - u/AurelianoTampa:
        ```
        > Istrid is a general, not a marshal.

        Drat, right you are! Corrected that.

        >There's only three Marshal of Praes at any given time and the third one (a Sonninke IIRC) stays in Ater due to being in charge of keeping the Wasteland in order.

        I think it's actually a female Ogre, Marshal Nim. [Erraticerrata mentions her here in a comment on this page](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/chapter-17-aplomb/).

        >we had a look at the last Named Commander of the Watch in one of Cat's Name dreams.

        True; I didn't mean to imply Aider was Named. I think the article specifically states that he isn't, but some Commanders are.

      What a comprehensive response. Very generous of you.

  - u/None:
    ```
    The _only_ one? Probably not. But I have a hard time imagining most people would have forgotten Knight Guy, Grandma Goblin, Pipe Cleaner, and the Watchful Bitch that quickly.
    ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    I had no difficulty keeping track of them, but I re-read the story once already.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Ranker is the goblin Marshal of the other Legion that's marching with Cat. We got a PoV from recently. Her second in command is Afolabi. Cat doesn't like Afolabi because he has ties to the Wasteland families, but we haven't seen his true colors yet. All we've seen him do so far is clean Cat's pipe and talk to Ranker. Kegan is the Duchess of Daoine, a province allied with but mostly independent from Callow. The Daoine army is called the Watch and they're like the Human Rangers of this world. They have some pact with some mysterious deity that Akua is currently messing with. Commander Adair is her second command and the putative General of the Watch. We haven't seen him do anything before, nor does he do anything here. Grandmaster Brandon Talbot is the leader of the Knights of the Broken Bell, Cat's new Callow Cavalry.

    Everyone else is part of the 15th.
    ```

    - u/Jangri-:
      ```
      I'm fairly sure Afolabi is in charge of a legion of his own. Ranker is a Marshal of the 4th Legion, Afolabi is a General of the 12th. I don't think Afolabi is her second in command, it's more like the Marhsal rank is superior to any General
      ```

  I was thinking about the Duchess Kegan. What is her motivation to go in to the grinder with Summer? Her objective is to free the Watch members and revenge, right? She has enough army strength to take on Diabolist on her own, right? (even if Cat gets defeated by Summer without her forces) I guess one factor is she lacks magic power?
  ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    > She has enough army strength to take on Diabolist on her own, right?

    No, I don't think she does. When they first reach Arcadia, [Daoine has 5k Watch members and 15k regular soldiers](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/08/23/chapter-25-advance/). This number is definitely [decreased by the end](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/09/18/chapter-32-close/):

    >On our side, nearly six thousand. Nauk’s two thousand men at the beginning of the campaign had been whittled down to a bare five hundred. **Most of the rest were Deoraithe regulars and fewer legionaries, though the Watch had allegedly lost a tenth of their number.**

    So, assume that if Nauk lost 1500, the Watch lost 500, and of the 4000 other casualties, the majority were Deoraithe regular troops. That means Kegan's personal force is down to 4500 shock troops (the Watch) and maybe around 12,000 regular troops... and that's before the Summer Queen nukes several hundred combined forces at the end of the chapter, and doesn't count any losses from earlier fights in Arcadia. 

    In [Villainous Interlude: Exeunt](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/08/07/villainous-interlude-exeunt/), at the start of her fight with Summer, Diabolist's forces included:

    * 1000 *walin-falme* devils (tall bat-like devils that fly and attack with spears or swords)

    * 3 "ancient devils" said to rival Fae royalty for power

    * A captured Duchess of Summer used to power her rituals.

    * At least 10,000 soldiers. Using later discussions, it sounds like she had closer to 18,000.

    * A city full of refugees available for blood sacrifices as needed. In Chapter 33, Cat mentions that the city's population is around 100,000, so the majority are likely civilians. 

    * A flying freaking city.

    * Her father, probably one of the most powerful non-Named mages in the country if not world. 

    * Her own Name, which lets her kill thousands of fae at a time and go head-to-head with two high royals and fight to a draw. 

    Now, she loses some of this force; half of her devils die out, [two of the ancient devils are killed, and thousands of her troops die (but are then raised from the dead to continue fighting)](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/10/16/chapter-35-questions/). But she still has all the other advantages. The Deoraithe have only the Watch (awesome, but limited), no Named, and no real ability to mobilize and get to Liesse without the help of the Legions' war machine and supply lines. You asked:

    >What is her motivation to go in to the grinder with Summer?

    I think it's because she can't take Diabolist on on her own, and moreover she can't mobilize and move her force across Callow without the consent and/or assistance of the Legions. And Cat's portals cut the travel time from several weeks to several days. Allying with the Legions is the only way she has a chance of succeeding.
    ```

    - u/um_m:
      ```
      Good analysis. Ok, so she can't take on the Diabolist on her own. 

      However, she basically has no feud with the Summer so has no motivation to bleed her forces further. Therefore, let's assume, with the cost to train the Watch on her mind, she refuses to go against the Summer thinking that with the support of Winter, Cat can win on her own. If that's the case, since Cat needs her to track down the Diabolist and match her forces, then Cat would have no choice but to go on her own, right? 

      My basic point is that Cat has no negotiating power over Kegan since she can't threaten to not deal with Diabolist, so she is bound by that responsibility to accept help from Kegan when offered but can't force her. Notwithstanding a potential partnership at the end of the War - Kegan swearing to Cat instead of the Tower or something.

      My argument might be bit wonky, but I thought it would be interesting to look at objectives of the players and their [power in negotiating](https://books.google.lk/books?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) to achieve those objectives.
      ```

      - u/AurelianoTampa:
        ```
        Huh, pretty interesting line of thought! I'm not sure if the counters that come to mind actually address it fully, but I'll give it a go.

        > My basic point is that Cat has no negotiating power over Kegan since she can't threaten to not deal with Diabolist, so she is bound by that responsibility to accept help from Kegan when offered but can't force her.

        Cat does have a few cards she can play to force Kegan to join her, though I am unsure how effective they would be:

        * First of all, we don't know the full relationship between the Watch, the source of their power, and how Diabolist's ritual is affecting it. There could be other considerations at play; the ritual could weaken the rest of the Watch, or it could be killing the lesser god that powers the Watch, or any number of things. Whatever is happening it's severe enough that Kegan is willing to muster 20,000 troops to rescue the 13 members of the Watch who are being used. That implies whatever Diabolist is doing, it's got a large impact upon Daoine.

        * While Cat and Kegan both want Diabolist beaten, they want it for different reasons. For Kegan it's to rescue the Watch (and punish Diabolist). For Cat it's to free Liesse (and kill Diabolist). You are right when you say that Kegan could simply sit back and watch Cat go after Diabolist anyway; but that doesn't mean Cat will free the Watch or stop using the ritual. Kegan only knows Cat by reputation (and by the reputation of Praes) before the two forces join up - she could easily imagine Cat's goal is to take Diabolist's weapons for herself like most villains would do. Heck, that's practically Malicia's goal already! By providing troops she both ensures that there's a better chance of stopping Diabolist, and that her troops will be rescued after.

        * While unconquered during the Legions' war against Callow, Daoine did still agree to pay fealty to the Tower. As such it's expected that they work with the Praesi when the need arises.

        * Cat's not entirely without other options she could tap if Daoine backed out. She could renegotiate with Winter for additional support; she could request help from the Tower, especially since Malicia is now buttering her up and Wolof's rebellion is finished; she could turn to other sources for troops such as summoning devils (although this is not recommended when facing a Name all about summoning devils). Daoine is a strong part of her force, but not a majority of it. 

        * Also, think of the costs for Daoine sitting this out or turning on Cat. After Diabolist, the Free Cities, and Procer are settled, there will be a lot of veteran troops in the Legions eager for more blood. And Daoine makes a prime target, especially if Diabolist's ritual weakens the Watch. Sitting out now means Daoine is in a more precarious position down the line.
