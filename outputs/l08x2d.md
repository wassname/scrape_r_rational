  I'm sad to see Tunnel Vision go. She was an interesting and compelling antagonist, and I was sort of hoping there'd come a point where she and the protagonists were, if not allies, at least not enemies. Ah well. It works well as a conclusion to (this part of) Ana's arc, anyway, in that Ana only got her new body when she was willing to give up on that goal and commit suicide for someone else's sake. 

  I feel awful for Max though. Not only did her life's work go up in smoke, but she also just lost her best friend and perhaps the only person keeping her sane and grounded. I do hope we see more of her, if only because I don't want to be left with just my imaginings of how miserable she must be right now.

  > “Yes,” said Grace.  “That is the difference between us.  I am an ant.  You are a beetle.  You have protected yourself and justified it, again and again, even if it meant letting the world crumble.”

  > *Is it really that simple?*  I’d stood by Paragon, even when they weren’t looking out for me.  I’d refused to steal other people’s bodies, even after I’d been expelled from Paragon, and after Lorne had lifted the tracer on me.

  And this is the thing that's always bothered me about the simplicity of that "ant and the beetle thing," for all that I like the metaphor. Some ants are dumb as hell, and plenty of beetles have convinced ants that sacrificing themselves for the beetle is the ant thing to do. Even if you're doing what is objectively the right thing, not everyone who opposes you is doing so out of selfishness or malice. Selfless people can be misguided or mistaken.

  Oh, you tease.

  > *Wes versus Tasia.*  I stood up, and blood rushed in my ears.  “Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?”  My throat clenched.  “Who won?  Who the fuck won?”

  Oh, you fucking tease!

  This community focuses a lot on consistency and character motivations and character mistakes and stuff, so this isn't said enough.

  This story is absolutely amazing. Some stories have great worldbuilding but the author struggles to write... like, actual things that happen in that world and characters who live in it. This isn't one of those stories.

  The characters all feel compelling and living and believable, even when the story takes a few easy shortcuts. The confrontation between Ana and Tunnel Vision was really tense and exciting, and the payoff when Ana wakes up and sees a woman in the mirror is just perfect.

  A lot of stories have emulated the Wilbow format over the years, and this is easily the best of them (sorry PGtE).

    Oh, absolutely. I love how many things this story is able to blend together: a realistic and morally complicated (not to mention very relevant) revolutionary drama, extremely relatable character arcs that make tangible the struggles of marginalized groups, all told in a world that's rich and compelling in both its realistic (the politics, the society, the history, etc.) and fantastical (the magic and background weirdness) elements. It's also unashamedly progressive as a fuck, which is really nice.

    I think there was a comment on the last chapter saying that the story would be better if Ana was cut from it, and that absolutely boggled my mind. Ana's the emotional core and basically the thesis statement of the story, and people want to get rid of her? She's one of the big reasons it's as good as it is! Without her, you have a lot less of an emotional connection to the revolutionary plot (and frankly to the world in general), the moral complications of Commonplace vs. Paragon are a lot less apparent and immediately pressing, and you completely lose the examination of how oppressed people can earnestly and selflessly fight FOR their oppressors. I sometimes wonder if people are reading the same story I am.

    (I'm a slut for PGtE though, so I'll fight you on that last bit)

  Well that really wasn't what I was expecting. Goodbye Grace, you were too good (but not really) for this world.

  At least Ana has her eyes open. Though what she'll do now is up in the air. She's still got the Lavender book to read as well.
