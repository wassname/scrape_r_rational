  Just read this in a single sitting, pretty enjoyable exploration of 8 (more like 7) different powersets being pit against each other in a simple game.
  ```

    Same here. In addition to there being a ton of interesting ideas, I was amazed by how *condensed* it all was, like there was something new and exciting happening in every panel. I think you'd have a hard time cutting anything without making the story worse, which is pretty impressive.

    The one thing I didn't like was the weird anti-rational tropes. Seriously, "we have to stop him from using his immortality for evil"? What does that even mean? And how would you "bring chaos to the world" by becoming immortal? It's always seemed bizarre to me how a writer who clearly put a ton of thinking into their work can still be so lazy when it comes to tropes like that. Seriously, just change the Macguffin from immortality to something that can more easily be abused, like the power to control the human body or something. It's not that hard.

      Characters still have competing values, even if they're "Good" or smart. "Immortality is evil" isn't even a particularly weird anti-rational trope, it's fairly common and standard, so it makes sense for most characters in the story to feel that way, even without us assuming the author's beliefs.

      But keep in mind that this character, who is an absurdly rich oil tycoon who honestly believes money should be able to solve all problems and was okay with hiring a hypnotist to trick people into doing work without pay, is probably not the kind of person you want to become immortal by magic fiat.

      Instead, his failure has forced him to fund a research organization dedicated to developing immorality through science, which is really the better-case scenario for everyone.

        Wait, since when is immortality evil? I've never heard this trope anywhere else, and I'm currently at Ch12 in this and haven't noticed it here either
        ```

          >I've never heard this trope anywhere else

          ...you've never noticed "Immortality is evil" in any other piece of fiction? I find that genuinely shocking. It's like [everywhere](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality), and often nonsensically. Like Dragonball Z, where only villains try to wish for immortality to the point where Vegeta stops caring about it after he's no longer a villain, or Dr. Who, where The Doctor can live for hundreds of years, if not more, but iirc when a villain-of-the-week starts sacrificing people to seek immortality, it's not the whole "Sacrificing people" thing that the Doctor focuses on so much as berating him about how living a long time isn't worth it because you lose the people you love, as if that wasn't just a reason to find a way to save them too.

          it will show up if you keep reading

          (also I agree with daystar; I think the author is using the trope as a building block, but the resolution suggests they don't really think immortality is inherently evil)
          ```

- u/tjhance:
  ```
  this was amazing and exceeded all expectations
  ```

    one thing I liked about this was how most of the characters remain relevant to the end (in contrast to your average anime tournament arc where the chaff are weeded out so we can have a battle between the two main characters in the finals). As such the story is able to keep building and building on its ridiculous ideas.

  That was so good. That was so good. **That was so good.**

  - u/DAGuardian:
    ```
    Have you read worm by any chance?
    ```

    - u/SecondTriggerEvent:
      ```
      People keep asking me this! Is it something about my name? It's a reference to Serbian hard rock/heavy metal band Trigger. Back in 2011, my friends and I were pumped for the release of their second album, so we made Reddit accounts to celebrate the event.  


      Anyways, yeah, Worm was also **so good.**
      ```

      - u/DAGuardian:
        ```
        Well yeah, second trigger events are in worm
        ```

        - u/SecondTriggerEvent:
          ```
          I know, haha. I was attempting to make a joke. I shall see myself out.
          ```

          - u/DAGuardian:
            ```
            Sorry, it wasn't your fault. It's the internet's!

  Reminds me of [*And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit-hole Goes*](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/), by Scott Alexander.

    Yeah I was half waiting for (ending spoiler Rabbit-hole) >!the muscle guy to somehow win it all.!<

    Any more stories like these? I much prefer the quick one-sitting stories than what normally gets posted here

      Not many. Ted Chaing writes good story stories, but otherwise you’ll have to search for “rational short stories.”

    ```
    I just want to point out that as good as the story was, "And all we had to do was to convince Redpill to neg entropy" is the greatest comment of all time.
    ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  That was so freaking incredible and I really like how the personalities and the decision-making of the characters were just as relevant as their powers. I really feel like it could have been a totally different story if you swap around the powers instead of just simply saying that one specific power would always win no matter what.
  ```

  - u/hh26:
    ```
    100% agree.  I also like how the losers kept teaming up with surviving competitors and there were multiple powers relevant at the same time, instead of one versus one.
    ```

- u/LupoCani:
  ```
  Adding nothing whatsoever to what's already been said, this was impressively distilled. A series of reasonably standard powers, assigned to a small cast of colorful personalities, and condensed into a small enough number of chapter that's something important is happening on every page. The (madness called) scheming quickly escalates to involve pretty much every character in every round, so characters are never really eliminated as such. In all, it's a brief but very engaging read.
  ```

  This was amazing!

  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time
  ```

- u/rationalidurr:
  ```
  This very good. This super duper good, want more.
  Best thing is the most optimized power won and almost everyone benefited from scheming in the end.
  ```

- u/HarryPotter5777:
  ```
  Late comment, but a mechanic I was totally expecting to see in the final round: >!Because the three card sets were cyclic, circle always beats triangle, triangle always beats square, and square always beats circle in any of the three sets. So when Mitarai says one shape, you can always choose the shape that will beat it by selecting another of the cards in the muscle guy's hands within 0.3 seconds.!<
