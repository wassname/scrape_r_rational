## (Request) "The boys" really needs the "Metropolitan man" treatment.

### Post:

I'm watching Amazon's "the boys" and it's quite enjoyable, haven't read the comic yet.

Might enjoy it more if the protagonists weren't constantly making mistakes.

Would love it if 

!spoilerÂ alert!
>!Butcher was still working for the government!< 

and used his limited resources to do the best impression of Lex Luther from metropolitan man he can.

  What mistakes in particular? The only one I can think of offhand was >!not doing a better job disposing of Translucent's skin!<. Aside from that, everything seemed pretty believable. Sure, doing an audit of all the  >!newly-installed RF shielding!< after someone fires a bullet would be a good plan, but I personally would not have thought of it and the characters were under a lot more stress than I was.

    I would think professionals can scan for hidden cameras, would find that >!hidden camera in that bear.!<

    And the hidden camera on >!mesmeriser that burned them all.!<

    I'm not saying I would do better, but would enjoy reading a hyper competent non super powered protagonist just pick them off one by one.

      Mesmeriser used a standard door with a camera in the viewing port, not something that stands out and it is in the markets currently

    Engaging in physical combat with a supe who's skin is diamond hard when your strategy amounts to hitting them with a crowbar.

  It's not very similar to the comic at all. In the comic they have superpowers.

    Yeah I was iffy on it (them being normals) at first, but as it went it on, I felt like it worked much better thematically and narratively to have The Boys be normals. I also didn't much care for the comic and gave up on it pretty early, but enjoyed the heck out of the show.

      I've only read summaries, but wasn't it fairly central to the plot that they got special treatment *because* they had superpowers? That they only got away with being such colossally nasty, unredeemable disasters because literally no one could stop them?

        The people hunting the superpowered assholes were made into normals.

  You should really just read the comic. Everyone's a Level 1 Intelligence, with no one making obvious mistakes besides wee hughie, for a reason,  and your spoiler is true.
  ```

  ```
  Its already a kindof deconstruction of superhero stories isnt it? Doing a deconstruction of a deconstruction doesn't seem very interesting
