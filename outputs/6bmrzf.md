  Masego  is the best.

  > “That doesn’t sound good,” Apprentice said. “I suppose it’s a good thing we have you along.”
  >
  > I glanced at him.
  > 
  > “What’s that supposed to mean?”
  > 
  > “You’re very good at murdering our opposition,” he said, genuinely believing he was giving me a compliment.
  > 
  > I occasionally forgot Masego had been raised by villains. For him that probably counted as praise.
  > 
  > “You don’t know for sure I’m going to kill someone,” I said.
  > 
  > “Not gonna lie, I’ll be disappointed if we don’t,” Archer noted.
  > 
  > “I’ve done diplomacy before,” I continued.
  > 
  > “I don’t think extorting the High Lords counts,” Apprentice said.
  > 
  > “Or looting that angel,” Hakram added.
  > 
  > “I think bullied might be more accurate,” Masego said.
  > 
  > “If you guys keep this up I can guarantee you someone’s getting killed,” I said.
  > 
  > “That’s the spirit,” Apprentice said, patting my shoulders. “Now let’s move along, Catherine, we’re blocking the way. You really need to pay more attention to your surroundings.”
  > 
  > He strode into the hall before I could come up with a reply, still gaping.

    He really is. Masego also seems pretty loyal to Cat despite being an immoral monster. I hope we have several side stories involving him.
    ```

      ```
      I'm sure we will. 😃 Masego is a critical part of Cat's possie.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      There's a lot of unmined potential in one of his dads being an incubus.
      ```

  ```
  I am now 100% on the "Archer joins the cause" train. She's a delight. Even has the sass of the fifteenth down.
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Yep. It's going to be fun to get to know her more. She still seems like a bit of an enigma at the moment. I do wonder why she's joining Cat and whether Ranger asked her to.
    ```

      ```
      Cats band of adventurers needs a 4th
