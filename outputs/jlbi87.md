  Got some *incredibly* high tier original worldbuilding going on here. The creating mythology post was just as interesting as the sentient species one, IMO. I just wish that more of this lore had been used in the actual MoL story.

  Is "impotent" the intended word here? Seems like the opposite word would fit the rest of the sentence better /u/nobody103

    The dragon was made largely impotent. The restrictions were good enough to make the dragon largely impotent but not perfect.

      Ah, I first read it as the restrictions were impotent.

      e.g.

      > Though largely effective, the restrictions placed by the gods could not be made perfect...
      ```

    Err, you're right. I've changed it now. Thanks.

  This guy's worldbuilding is incredible, but I worry that by publishing it like this he won't feel free to recycle the ideas into his next actual novel (provided it doesn't take place in the same world)
