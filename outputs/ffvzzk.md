## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I read [Shade's First Rule](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TTDGKP2/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) and its sequel over the course of the week, and really enjoyed them.

  I did nearly drop the first book because the main character was handed what looks like an obvious idiot ball in the first couple of chapters - he stops and tries to analyze a magical fight where one of the participants is actively trying to kill him, instead of running for safety. 

  But it turns out that's a genuine character flaw, and one that I feel like most rational characters would have in reality - a lot of the time rational fiction treats thinking as a free action, when it really isn't. You can't afford to spend a couple moments pondering stuff in the middle of a fight, and that lesson is beat into the main character over the course of book 1.

  The book also poses a really interesting munchkiny problem: if you're a deity designing a set of classes for your people, how do you sneak power into them in a way that your fellow deities won't notice?
  ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    I'm about a third of the way into the first book, and see what you mean.

    Though I don't think the protagonist's fascination with magic is that well justified.

    Dude is 16 years old, in a town where every adult has a class and access to some magic. Even for peasants (Worker class) mundane tasks like lighting a fire have spells.

    Yet he's acting like he has **never** seen magic used. Even though his very poorly introduced friend / father figure is a high level mage.  Yes, popping off a fireball in the middle of town is irresponsible, but not badgering him to demonstrate *something* is beyond belief.

    Mana is cheap, so that isn't an excuse.

    Also, WTF is the protag talking about saying he rarely meets anyone as smart as himself with his 16 Int. He meets a level 70+ worker, with 4 stat points per level,  even with two points auto-assigned, that still leaves 140+ available... dropping 10 or 20 into Int at some point is quite likely.

    Unless every non-mage is *so dumb* that they treat Int as a dump stat forever.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      I mean, he's a conceited and self-centered 16 year old kid. It's kind of understandable. I don't think he really understood that his friend was a high level mage, either - he mostly thought of him as a librarian.
      ```

      - u/ansible:
        ```
        > I don't think he really understood that his friend was a high level mage, either - he mostly thought of him as a librarian.

        If it was me, and I was a magic-obsessed teenager, I'd have asked the librarian every single little thing I could think of.  He'd be sick of the questions, and probably would want to murder me at some point just to shut me up.

        In Azarinth Healer's world of Elos, it is considered taboo to ask anyone about their class, skills or stats, and Ilea (the protagonist) is a recent arrival, so it was understandable that she didn't know about everything.

        But this Ruwen has lived his whole life in this world.  Didn't his parents (who only died / disappeared a year ago) have "the talk" with him at some point when he was growing up?  Not the birds and the bees, but the stats and the skill trees.  (har har)

        Since mana total is based on Int, I'd think that he'd know *someone* (which he totally does) who has an Int higher than 16.
        ```

        - u/nohat:
          ```
          This is a common problem. The author wants exposition, so the main character is completely ignorant. It's part of what makes isekai work, because there's an good explanation for that.
          ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          > If it was me, and I was a magic-obsessed teenager, I'd have asked the librarian every single little thing I could think of.

          They have an interaction in the second book that makes me think this was basically their relationship before the story started. 

          But again, a lot of teenagers spend their time talking about themselves in various ways, and don't bother asking other people about their lives. I'm sure he knew the librarian was a mage, but I don't think he'd really internalized that knowledge until he saw the fight. After all, not every mage in this world is a combat mage.

           His mage/librarian friend was also keeping things on the down-low, which is probably another reason why he didn't realize just how powerful the guy was.

  Read Wake of the Ravager that was recommended in last week's thread and I really enjoyed it.  Have to disagree with the recommender's question mark of the Harem tag though, the story definitely is harem and becomes increasingly more so as the story goes on.

  Any other recommendations for people who enjoyed WotR aside from He Who Fights With Monsters/Delve that others gave in the comments last time?
  ```

  - u/nohat:
    ```
    I read it and enjoyed it as guilty pleasure type reading. It's not terribly rational though. While the main character does use some cool magic exploits and combos, his biggest trick is just using the ridiculously overpowered dupomancy, something that is well known and unrestricted. There's really no excuse for why he came up with these uses but no one else had.
    ```

    - u/TacticalTable:
      ```
      There is a sort of excuse, in that the Genosians are basically the most savage and taboo people in the region, and their summoning is based off of it. They certainly wouldn't be teaching the technique to wandering wizards, and getting so skilled at it is very hard without a solid bent source.
      ```

      - u/nohat:
        ```
        I'm not even talking about the calvinian summoning (because as op as that is, it does have geonosian craziness and Elliot messing with the system as an explanation). Just regular dupomancy for regular old duplicate duplicate white phosphorus or whatever is crazy powerful. Everyone recognizes how useful it is and (off screen) starts using it as soon as he does. Calvin has a high mind stat... for a teenager from a sheep village. Someone else would definitely have thought of that. For consistency the author really ought to have made dupomancy one of elliots special unlock abilities (like the also crazy op shadow boxing).
        ```

        - u/TacticalTable:
          ```
          Isn't it possible that it is an Elliot perk? He hasn't exactly been forthright about which are his, and that was early enough that they didn't speak much about it. I do agree with you in this case.
          ```

          - u/nohat:
            ```
            I don't think it is possible. He was taught it by Uncle Bekvah(?), the captain complained about dupomancers being considered useless for fighting after his demonstration, and selling the vials to other mages has apparently made the blacksmith a fortune.
            ```

  - u/ViceroyChobani:
    ```
    >Harem

    Y'know, I've noticed more and more as time goes on that I instinctively skim past cringy harem plots in webfics.  This is not the first time.  I only realize it when it's pointed out to me.  An interesting character...flaw? Trait?

    (I was the guy who recced WotR last week.)

    Anyhoozles.

    I've posted it here before, but I think that the [Dire Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27993770-born) by Andrew Seiple has a vaguely similar tone.  Happy-go-lucky murderhobo type vibe (though in this one there's no actual murdering).  Good, clean, insane fun.  Premise is a fairly typical superhero world in which the protagonist is a debatably mad scientist who just. wants. to uplift. society, but the stupid heroes keep getting in the way.  Highly recommend the series.  Just don't take it too seriously - it's very over the top, in a self-aware sort of way.
    ```

    - u/ACCBDD:
      ```
      Seconding the recommendation of the Dire Saga - its so ridiculously over the top when it needs to be and there's also [a great crossover with Worm by the same author!](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/)
      ```

  - u/1000dollarsamonth:

    Its been recommended before but you should try out the gilded hero. Arrogant young master is top tier if you ever read a xianxia novel before.
    ```

    - u/cjet79:
      ```
      I wish I'd held off on gilded hero and waited for like thirty more chapters. I like the author, but sometimes his buildups can take a very long time. And i'd rather get through the buildup by reading more than waiting longer.
      ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      I want to anti-rec Gilded Hero.  It's technically proficient, but anti-rational and not a really fun read.  I hear it called 'realistic' over at RR, but I'd go with 'grimderp' instead.

      I'll stick to the first couple thousand words to not spoil anything, (chap 1-6 spoilers) >!but the story reveals in chapter 1 that it's got a hard system.  Like, stat levels, classes/skills you get from stats, etc..  Getting a skill makes you have a huge World of Warcraft style ding with a flash of light and thunder.  Skills are big deals with requisite stats, and the early goal is to get a skill.!<

      >!Aaaand it takes weeks of in-story time before anyone even asks what stats anybody has.  I thought it might be a system unique to the MC, but literally everybody on the planet has stats and none of the trainers thought to ask while they were fumbling around trying to get skills.!<

      >!Not for any reason.  The author just seemed to have some scenes they wanted so they ignored the physics of the world so they could have those scenes. That's all.!<

      As far as I can tell, the whole story is like this where there's no verisimilitude and it would take all of 5 minutes of thought for characters to act realistically instead.
      ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Yeah it definitely is harem, and Calvin's princess skill all but confirms that. I really like how he uses his dupdomancy skill. Also the pseudo quest thing going on is pretty cool, the patreon supporters suggest new upgrades for skills which show up every 5 skill levels.
    ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I too binged this one overt the past week, and greatly enjoyed it. It's somehow effortlessly clever and funny, and I found myself thinking many times how much better this freaking free webnovel is then just about any book I've read (and paid for) in the past year, and certainly better than any comedy book I've read since Pratchett died. 

    And man is it original! The setting is a bit humdrum at times, but then all of a sudden the magic system or worldbuilding will shock me with how cool and clever it is. Not to mention the plot, which I suspect is at least partly inspired by some of the best parts of HPMoR.  

     I often see glimmers of Mother of Learning and Worth the Candle in the powers and power interactions, as well, like how the MC gets a lot of cheats, but it never actually feels like they're cheats because not only does he never stop being challenged, he also never stops challenging himself and pushing himself further, often crazily so.

    But yeah, the only real mark against it is the unfortunate presence of the dreaded harem, made even worse by the increasing flanderization of the female characters, which in the later chapters has become bad enough to detract from my enjoyment of the story a bit.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Fun fact: Wake of the Ravager is partially written as a sort of inverse quest; the author polls his Patreon for skill perks / mutations, then balances them and gives them to the character as options. I've been a patron for a while, and one of Calvin's defining skill perks comes from a suggestion of mine (so I'm pretty proud of him)
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        Which skill? I'm caught up, so it wouldn't be a spoiler.
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          It's been a while but I either suggested Third Eye or the mutation that adds intent sensing to it way back in the beta. I was pretty happy when his enemies started actively planning to counter the combo in recent chapters.
          ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      There's also weird arcs where the main character becomes ridiculously bloodthirsty and everyone else just kinda rolls with it? Especially the last arc.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        You realize that Calvin is basically >!an alternate version of Elliot, right? That when his mother tried to summon a perfect hero, the system incarnated Elliot into the body of a newborn, I.E. it thought Elliot(or an alternate version thereof) was the perfect hero to tackle all the world's problems.!< I suspect that this is [HPMoR SPOILERS] >!a deliberate reference to HPMoR, where Harry Potter was a mindwiped copy of Voldemort's soul who was raised as an infant by caring, loving parents, and turned out reasonably well-adjusted, and who was the only one who could psycho!voldemort(it takes one to know one kind of thing.!< 

        >!So either the system made Elliot an advisor to himself, or more likely Elliot avoided getting mindwiped by copying himself into the system(itself a deliberate play on the xianxia trope of having an ancestor ghost advisor, I think).!< Yes, Calvin is impulsive and arrogant and reckless and that's bad, but that's baked into his character from the very beginning and >!he's being punished for his hubris, as he should be.!< His negative traits are also obviously being aggravated by Calvin's >!unbroken string of successes, and above all by having Elliot as a little amoral devil on his shoulder egging him on to greater risk/reward scenarios, with the threat of turning The One against him if he doesn't advance fast enough.!<

        Like I said, I think that outside the harem stuff this writer is on top of his game, big kudos to him.
        ```

        - u/Anderkent:
          ```
          Yeah, I realise that - my problem is that everyone around him seems completely okay with whatever he does. The princess especially - she's supposed to be the diplomat.
          ```

          - u/GlueBoy:
            ```
            Kala is a smitten teenage girl. Ella is a smitten teenage girl that's a bloodthirsty cannibal. Grant is an amoral mercenary. The troops are fresh off of a bunch of victories and a literal triumph parade, as well as mostly young and impressionable. Who's going to gainsay him?
            ```

            - u/Anderkent:
              ```
              Kala is the one I'm most bothered by, and Grant to a degree. Kala is a smitten teenage girl *on a diplomatic mission being actively jeopardized*, and she has not before been presented as completely amoral or unable to think around Calvin, so setting up _mass slaughter_ should at least make her a little uncomfortable?
              ```

              - u/nohat:
                ```
                Remember that magical power is directly granted by being next to huge amounts of death at once. Nobles are already taken out to nice slaughters to get magical power. Kala already has at least 6 breaks (meaning she was next to 10k people dying at once). You would expect some cultural differences in morals, because I very much doubt all these slaughters were purely natural.
                ```

                - u/Anderkent:
                  ```
                  Sure, though it wasn't really shown before in her character. But there's also the part where Kala was sent to this country because it's one of the three regional powers, and they were supposed to _ask for help_. So even if Kala doesn't think twice of slaughtering their neighbours army for warp, how are they going to get help now? And even before - needlessly antagonizing their hosts during a diplomatic venture to make more money (when they were guaranteed great returns just doing the trading / using the automatons as craftsmen).

                  I guess my main issue here is that Kala has personality exactly to the degree that it's convenient to the main character. Any time Calvin wants to do something that Kala shouldn't approve of, it's not even that they argue and he has his way - it's just never brought up.

                  Anyway that part of the arc is over now, fortunately, so I'm happy to move on.

                    Well they did find out that half the leaders of this country were actually supporting their enemies, and they are slaughtering those guys army, while bankrupting them to prevent them from aiding the ilethans more.

  The trope of underestimating an overpowered main character has been done to dust by now, but what about overestimation? Specifically, something like the MC going on a jaunty adventure with no clear plan, which figures of authority work themselves up about and completely misinterpret as having some clear reasoning and deep political motivations, with some tragic background to go along with it. 

  I've read some stuff with tidbits of this, the most recent being the non-rational Naruto fic [Reverse](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5339486/chapters/12328958). Also [Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4), though it doesn't quite go as far as I would like it to. Are there more works with this sort of trope in them? Doesn't have to be rational.
  ```

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    [The Saga of Tanya the Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saga_of_Tanya_the_Evil) is a strong example of this trope.

    The protagonist is a salaryman who was isekaid into an alternate universe in which magic is real. He grows up as an orphan girl (Tanya) pressed into service in World War I due to her strong aptitude for magic.

    Other characters view Tanya as a prodigy who is bloodthirsty to spearhead the fight and/or a valiant saint who sacrifices herself for her troops and her homeland. In reality, everything Tanya does is a desperate attempt to get herself redeployed away from the front lines. Unfortunately for her, her superior officers and underlings keep misinterpreting her words, and her plans go unaccountably well despite her best attempts to fail.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Also, this is a common theme in Tanya fanfics - [Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/) has Tanya accidentally succeeding her way through the interwar period, and [Delinquency Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-delinquency-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.788149/) has Tanya accidentally winning at anti-imperialism through capitalism in the post-war period. 

      Actually, Delinquency Record is super close to "the MC going on a jaunty adventure with no clear plan, which figures of authority work themselves up about and completely misinterpret as having some clear reasoning and deep political motivations" - Tanya just wants to make enough money to retire and avoid the authorities, but they keep on hunting her down which means she needs to keep on making geopolitically destabilizing moves by accident. 

      (the names of the fanfics are based on the Japanese name - Yojo Senki translates into something like "A Young Girl's War Record")

    Overlord has a version of this. While the main character is one of the most powerful of the setting, he isn’t nearly as intelligent as everyone makes him out to be. Admiring the beauty of the world out loud sends his servants out to conquer it, for example.

  - u/cjet79:
    ```
    [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) has a bit of that trope going on. Other characters assume human altruistic/hardworking motives on the OP. But OP is actually an experimental monster in disguise, and actual motivations usually boil down to 'more food' or 'better protection'.

    [Vainqueur The Dragon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon) Sort of does it occasionally too. The dragon is often doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. Like saving his chief minion, so that minion can pay off his debt. Or killing off an evil necromancer because that necromancer turned his stash of gold into lead. Or fighting off evil/arrogant fairies that want to kill off all other sentient life, because the dragons believe they are the ultimate rulers of the world.

    If you want to write 'real'-feeling NPCs, then in practice Level 1 Intelligence ends up looking more like cunning or even stubbornness. A character who knows what they *think* they want, and goes out of their way to get it/refuse to be distracted from it, even if it's a poor long-term strategy - is immediately relatable in a way that 'swallowed-the-dictionary-and-sounds-like-every-other-character' NPC number 15 doesn't.

  Any suggestions for something that's, for lack of a better term, Wizards As Fuck? *Earthsea* definitely fits the Wizards As Fuck vibe, while *Mother of Learning* and *Harry Potter* do not. All three certainly contain magic, but only Earthsea has the sort-of-Arthurian vibe I'm looking for.

  I suspect something's wizardness depends strongly on both the mechanics of the world (true name magic, geases, the fae, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords) and the structure of the plot, but I lack the vocabulary to express it more concisely.

    _The Magicians_ by Lev Grossman maybe? 

    KJ Parker's more magical stories might fit the bill also, though they tend to be short stories; they are apparently collected in _Academic Exercises_, though you can find a few of them online, like [_Amor Vincit Omnia_](https://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/summer_2010/fiction_amor_vincit_omnia_by_k_j_parker)

    Edit: oh I remembered some others: 

    * Max Gladstone's Craft Sequence (starting with _Three Parts Dead_)
    * China Mieville's _Kraken_
    * A lot of Neil Stephenson's books do the wizard thing, but from the tech side. _Anathem_ is the most wizardy of them though.

        I guess it depends on what you mean by "Wizard As Fuck", but my interpretation is something like: 

        > Magic exists. It has Rules. The Rules are incredibly complex, to the point where they're nearly impossible to describe in words. However, by becoming Wizard As Fuck, the main character gains a transcendental understanding of The Rules, and is thus able to Do The Real Magic.

          I dunno, I think I agree with /u/EliezerYudkowsky. The Magicians is mainly about failure and disillusionment, neither of which is really all that wizard at all. The magic system is somewhat beside the point.

          I disagree with you but, in the process, agree with you. I think the book is about learning Real, Magical Magic (so, check), but then finding that it was never what you wanted, and you still have all your old problems. The magic is beautifully depicted, but thematically it's just standing in for all the things you wanted as a child, and how they're inevitably (in-novel) going to let you down.

    Lawrence Watt-Evans' Ethshar series has stories about witches Wizards, Witches, Sorcerors, etc... With a Single Spell is a good one to start with.

    "Off to Be the Wizard" by Scott Meyer has wizardry which is actually programming. It doesn't go too deep into the programming aspect and is more lighthearted wish fulfillment but it was a fun read.

    The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss is good and about a school of magic. The third book will be released any decade now.

    "A Wizard's Life" trilogy by Eric Guindon is decent. The magic system isn't rational at all and the plot isn't too complicated but I really like the ending.

    Have you tried the Dresden files?  Ignore the TV stuff and start on book 3 , but the large interlocking sties, fey and escalation seem to be a lot of what you are asking for even if it starts with a hard boiled detective it get's fairly Merlin-esk even in the 3rd book, which really is where it starts.

  I'm so glad that I decided to revisit the Dunes series. It has been a long time.. and yet few things come close to Frank Herbert's awe inspiring world building.

  Has anyone come across any good Dunes fanfiction or spin-offs? I'd even love to read  short character sketches, they don't have to be completed or long.
  ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    I don't have more Dune works for you, but you should check out a few of Herbert's other books - "Godmakers", "Under Pressure", and "Soulcatcher" are the ones I recommend; Godmakers in particular for Dune fans.

  I recently came across a *very* long-running Quest called [Grandeur Rising](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/grandeur-rising-eastern-fantasy-empire.311224/), which has been running since 2013 (though it seems to be in a bit of a slump right now.) The prose is pretty workmanlike - no real complaint, but nothing special - but it's a very engaging read for the experience of running and uplifting an empire. It's actually sent me on a bit of a hunt for more good Empire Management quests/stories.

  Note that the earlier posts aren't threadmarked - the second post has an index for them. The first threadmarked post being called Turn 41 Part 2 makes it seem like there's one missing, but Part 1 is just the same post without the latter half. (That sent me on a wild goose chase!)

  Street Cultivation book 2 ([found here on royal road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid/chapter/404675/book-ii-chapter-1-preview-soul-application)) is nearly complete and will be shifted to Amazon shortly after it's done, so if you want to read it for free, now is the time.

  It's a modern take on wuxia/xanxia. It's pretty well written and mostly I've enjoyed it. Book I has a few chapters up for free as well and the whole thing can be bought on Amazon.

    What makes this interesting beyond just the economics aspect of the premise?

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      It's got a much more personal and relatable power scale than the average Xianxia; for example, the main character's major mobility power-up in the second novel is that he >!buys a cultivation-powered bicycle, and now he can get places without public transit!<.

      It's a progression fantasy, but instead of punching out Cthulhu the main character is working his way up in the world like many young adults without family resources do.

      Nothing, IMO. I found the author's writing pretty meh, particularly the characterization and worldbuilding. Also he kept setting up tropes and then sloppily subverting them, which--no offense intended--he's not a good enough writer to pull off, yet.

  I have been reading [The Throne of Heaven](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-throne-of-heaven-a-bleach-rewrite.56774) which someone posted in this sub last week or so, it's a rewrite of Bleach that attempts to make sense and tie everything together from the very beginning. It's an enjoyable read if you're fan of the series and can get past the fact the writer is in desperate need of a beta.

  Another Bleach fanfic that I also would like to recommend is [Arana](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bleach-worm-arana.305947/) by the (in)famous Ryuugi (so don't expect it to be finished, ever). It's a Worm/Ward crossover, but you don't need much knowledge about Ward to enjoy it since it pretty much does away with canon early on. Honestly, I'm not sure whether I would say there's much about the fic itself that is worth writing home about (aside from the last few chapters which are great), no I'm recommending this more due to the sheer amount of worldbuilding/rants/informational posts that it has, which are probably twice the word count of the fic itself. How much value you get out of it probably depends on how much you care about making some sense out of Bleach's highly convoluted setting, and how much Ward bashing you can handle (although most of his criticism is pretty legit, but it's a pseudo-rational analysis of a work that is not trying to be rational at all so tread with care I guess).

  Anyone know of any other good, or at least decent or interesting Bleach fics that are worth reading?

    I really enjoyed *Hogyoku ex Machina,* a Peggy Sue (i.e. time-travel) fic, and *Not Quite As Planned,* an Arrancar!Ichigo fic. Both were quite enjoyable in their own way, and though the former is a lot closer to “rational” than the latter, both capture a lot of the original Bleach’s charm.

    [The Loyal Ones](https://thralls.weebly.com/novel-index.html) has that kinda vibe going on. Fantasy world where "demons" are a slave caste, compelled by human magic to fight and labor for free. The protagonist is one such slave demon.

    [Lord of the Mysteries](https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html)? It's set in fantasy 19th Century Europe with ironclads and airships alongside Lovecraftian monsters and secret orders practising hermetic rituals. Note it's a translated work though (from Chinese) so the word choices are a bit janky.

    I definitely agree that industrial/colonial age settings should be more thoroughly explored by writers compared to the thousands of medieval age fantasies we already have. Well, ones that aren't just remakes of Sherlock Holmes, anyways.

    Neil Gaiman wrote a short story called 'A Study in Emerald,' which is about Sherlock Holmes investigating a murder in an alternate timeline where the gods of the Cthulu mythos have taken over the earth.

    Anything that isn't on SV or SB I go and grab an RSS feed for.

    If your problem isn't tracking all of them but actually having the time to read all of them, the only real solutions are to make more time for the hobby or bookmark where you are with some and come back to them later.

    I ask Calibre+FanFicFare to read the mail folder I'm sending update notifications to.

    If a novel (or fanfiction) isn't from a site that can send notifications AND be managed by FFF, I tend to just not start reading it (I have to filter my readings somehow and this is one criterion).

    For the handful of stories managed by FFF, but without notifications, I have a custom column that tells me approximately how late an update is. When I feel the could be an update, I ask FFF to check.

    When stories are updated, the Reading List plugin marks them for upload on my ereader, which then updates the reading progression.

    * putting on hold

    * finished

    Along with each entry I put the chapter I ended at. And every weekend I just go through my currently reading list and update everything else by hand. I know it's not the most efficient method since it's done manually but it's kinda satisfying seeing things tick up gradually yknow.

  [Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lillijoy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy#toc) [RT][WIP] might be the best thing I'm reading right now that I haven't seen on the /r/rational front page before. It's set in a post-singularity future where a superintelligence has imposed a set of rules on anything less powerful than itself. These rules include things like: don't replicate uncontrollably, and their effect on the setting includes a cyberpunk alternate reality controlled by a game system. Pretty wild stuff.

  On the other hand, [Re: Trailer Trash](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash) [RT][WIP] might be the best thing I'm reading right now that I haven't seen on the /r/rational front page. It's a do-over fantasy where the MC gets accidentally Quantum Leaped into her own childhood. She approaches the situation in an incredibly pragmatic way, modulo still being a real human being with the flaws and motivations of a human being. She sets about fixing the problems that plagued her youth, but everything doesn't go perfectly just because she has future knowledge.

  I've been reading [He Who Fights With Monsters](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters#toc) [RT-ADJ?][WIP] and it's been pretty darn enjoyable. Some wacky protagonist syndrome, lampshaded. Interesting magic system and some satisfyingly large power scales. The beginning chapters were weakest for me, but I liked it more once other characters showed up.

    If you want something fun with some really interesting magic try Magik Online. It's kind of like litrpg, except that the players have an app on the phone which lets them buy spells to use. But the thing is that spells can be used almost endlessly, which leads to some interesting fights. Also the spells have some really good creativity, and they go from moving soil in a 10m radius around you to being able to exterminate planets. It's currently on hiatus but it ended at an okay spot.

    Wake of the Ravager might be similar to Nanocultivation, in that it's set in the far future with high tech stuff (it has a system and AI). It's enjoyable and can be hilarious at times, but it does have a harem (although it's done in one of the better ways I've seen).
