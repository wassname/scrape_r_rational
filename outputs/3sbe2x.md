  The end of Journeyman's story--he didn't get closure, which is part of what made him who he is.  And the start of a new thread.

  We'll see if anyone gets the in-joke about the security researcher's name. 8-)

    Bruce Schneier would like to talk to you.  :>

    I like this one -- you're good at 'emotional' and the bit at the end makes a nice chaser and mood shift.

      When Schneier first started becoming well known, there was a meme for making cryptography jokes about him in the style of Chuck Norris jokes, so I used that for the name of the character based on him.

      A good example from the Disqus comments on the chapter:

      "Chuck Shiner doesn't know the meaning of the word ciphertext, because to him, everything is plaintext."
      ```

        Cute.  Cute, and extremely obscure.  I don't feel bad at all about missing that one.
        ```
