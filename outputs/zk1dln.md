## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I have another niche request this week. Anyone know any stories with good bow-wielding MCs? Some ads reminded me of how exceedingly rare they are, and I did greatly enjoy Ranger’s Apprentice as a kid.

      Anything with the archer fantasy is fine, as long as it’s an interesting story with a guy shooting arrows.

      >This is the time period where the English longbows were changing up conventional warfare making it so that any peasant with a longbow could potentially kill an armored knight who were practically invincible on the battlefield in the past.

      Did they not have crossbows back then?
      ```

      - u/SigneowTheCat:
        ```
        Longbows were substantially more powerful than crossbows of that era and much faster to fire. The tradeoff is that they required a lot of training to use effectively. A skilled archer could fire about 12 shots a minute, while a crossbowman could, at best, fire two a minute and was completely vulnerable while using a windlass to reload, often also requiring cover or a pavise shield so as not to be a sitting duck. Despite these drawbacks, most countries other than England did indeed use crossbows instead of longbows.
        ```

        - u/Izeinwinter:
          ```
          Because if you had a stack of crossbows + bolts in the armory, you could raise an effective force to use them in a couple of weeks. 

          They were also strictly better for defending fortifications. You couldn't really do the "Peek over the battlements and shoot a fool, then duck" thing with a longbow.
          ```

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        If I remember my history correctly: At the time professional longbowmen could still "out DPS" a crossbow-user because the longbow was cheaper and had a higher range / fire-rate compared to contemporary crossbows. The disadvantage was however that to reach this level of skill (more than ten arrows a minute, above 300m range) lots of training and strength was required.
        ```

        - u/ansible:
          ```
          I wonder how they compare as to number of shots fired.  Drawing back a 150lb pull longbow can really tire the bowman out fast.

          Also, as a slight aside, crossbows can be a lot faster these days.

          https://gogun.co/products/cobra-r-series-siege-crossbow

          If you have the magazine, the reload time is less than 5 seconds. Not as fast as a fast and well-trained bow user, but still pretty fast compared to the old days.  Of course, they have magazines for bows now too:

          https://gogun.co/collections/fenris-magazine-and-accessories/products/fenris-bow-magazine-limited-edition
          ```

      - u/TREB0R:
        ```
        They did have crossbows, which do have a higher stopping power than longbows and don't require the years of training a longbow needs. They just take a long time to reload so the rate of fire from a longbow outweighs the benefits of the crossbows in this time period. I also think that crossbows were expensive at the time, but don't quote me on that
        ```

    ```
    The main character of [Elder Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42441/elder-cultivator) uses the bow quite a lot. I believe it was his primary weapon, but I'm not 100% sure on that.

    It's a decently solid series. Not super rational, but most people were fairly reasonable and likeable.
    ```

- u/DangerouslyUnstable:
  ```
  Came across [Thresholder](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/60396/thresholder) in the A/N from TUTBAD and gave it a read. Given that Alexander Wales is a pretty popular author in these parts, I was surprised I hadn't heard of it yet (certainly possible I missed it, but I'm pretty good about checking these Rec threads as well as whatever hits the main page). So in case anyone else also missed it:

  It's currently updating, started as one of the writing month challenges so initially didn't get any edits, although I believe that AW is currently cleaning it up a bit.

  It's about a geography grad student who steps through a portal into another world and discovers that he is not the only person jumping worlds and that this portal jumping is part of a pattern (there is always an opponent, there is usally an ally, etc). We join the story on world #3.

  It's a bit rough still, but I've enjoyed it so far, and AW is generally a pretty popular author, so I figured I'd share it.
  ```

    The setting, a Walesian take on Vampire the Masquerade, is absolutely brilliant. I really want him to lay it all out and then I want to run Blades in the Dark with it.

  Hi, the other day I read Skitterdoc 2077 on SV and found it pretty decent so it put me in the mood for some longer Cyberpunk(TTRPG/PC-Game) Fanfic or some original cyberpunk(genre) fic. I would really appreciate any recommendation.

    [The New Man](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-new-man-an-adam-smasher-si-cyberpunk-edgerunners.20227/) is an Adam Smasher SI in questionable questing.

  I have a request, please. Time loop story, online somewhere. The main character discovers that “the cool kids” among his college or school group are time loopers; IRC they play songs on guitar that won’t be released until later. He tracks them down and begs to be let into the group. They warn him, he insists, they let him in.

  I can’t remember enough else about the story to find it again, hoping someone else does.

  - u/chiruochiba:

    You might like the short story ["The Yellow Wallpaper"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yellow_Wallpaper).

    The protagonist is a Victorian era woman who is confined to 'rest' as treatment for 'hysteria'. It turns into an almost Lovecraftian descent into madness.

    The story is in the public domain and is available in [many formats](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/1952).
    ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    [Palus Somni](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25475/palus-somni) has a pretty Gothic setting, but the horror is a lot more body horror focused than the genre usually implies. Brief pitch: A nun monastery is one of the last places in the world where monsters haven't devoured all the humans yet, and now one of the sisters is found dead hanging from a tree.

      I really like the story of The Earliest Spell lord, but I don’t think the author did the math here. >!It’s claimed that spells are just combinations of random words with basically no meaningful restrictions. There’s around 10^5 English words (more if you include other languages, less if you include some basic untold restrictions.). It takes a minute to test something. There’s less than 10^6 minutes in a year, so if you had all of humanity (10^10) going through spells constantly, then after 100 years, you’d get 10^18 words tested. There’s (10^5)^4=10^20 4 word spells meaning there’s a 1 % chance of finding any given 4 word spell. The chance of someone ever stumbling onto a given same 5 word spell is around the chance of being struck by lightning this year. No one will ever find     any given 6 or more word spells. The rise of stealing Spell Lords seems really really unlikely in a random timeline and the chance of running into someone else using the time travel spell is basically impossible unless you tell someone.!<

          Re: math
          >!i totally agree that her getting the specific time travel combo suggests she got lucky out of like 10^50 simulated universes, and it’s not crazy that someone else in the downstream tree also guesses the same thing and travels back to the start. What I find tricky is that spell stealing is so common in multiple universes. I guess the two main questions are what the density of spell words in the space, and how many different combos give the same spell. Other than the time travel one, her collected spells from different universes that she doesn’t manually transfer should be practically disjoint!<


          Cool story! I have some guesses based on the math, but nothing that explains everything. >!So she’s a human ship exploring the solar system with hard coded checks to come visit Earth every 10x time (I guess as a memorial?). Earth itself is completely gone for like a billion years (turned into computonium for the ship?). Seems like all the humans at some point decided to upload. Hospital simulations suggest she was once human. Interesting thing is she can delete the whole archive but she can move/relabel individual pieces and then delete them or their references, so it seems like she’s been picking away at her sense of self until nothing remains. Given the repeated references to Dimitri and Hermes, I’d guess those were her original friends/lovers.!<

  Can anyone help me find a specific story?


  The only details I remember from it is a single very specific scenario:


  * Someone is trapped in a mirror or similar.
      * The mirror image of the world is realistic and functional near where the reflection is.
      * The mirror world is devoid of interactable people. They may be absent, or inanimate statues, etc.
  * Further away from the reflected area, it progressively loses detail in a 'simulation'-ish manner. 
      * A nearby room might be blurry or missing objects or objects lack detail.
      * The outside of the house might look like a 2000s-era rendition of a house from a video game.
      * If you keep walking, the world starts to be all flat shapes and basic colors until nothing is recognizable.
  * The person in this mirror was trapped for a while, possibly their whole life.
      * They may have been created in the mirror.
  * I get the vague impression that there might have been some elements of 'horror subversion'.
      * At face value, you'd expect it to be a scenario from a horror story.
      * However, the person in the mirror was relatively normal, communicative, and not overly hostile.
      * They may have had trauma that you would expect from being trapped in this scenario from a long period of time.
  * I also get the vague impression that communication was recently 'restored'.
      * Example scenario which may not be exact: 
          * magic ghost is created
          * spends years trapped
          * another person figures out communication or travel before the start of the story.
          * story presents aftermath of a now-relatively-ok person stuck in the strange mirror with palliative help from outside world.


  I don't remember anything else from it unfortunately. I think it's moderately likely this was from a rationalist or rational-adjacent story for various reasons, so I think this subreddit is a good place to ask. I'm not sure if the monday thread is the right place for this request, and if it isn't I'll put this in the next Open Friday thread. But if anyone can help me, I'd appreciate it.
  ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    My first thought is Rose Thorburn from [Wildbow's web serial Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/), she appears in chapter 2.
    ```

    - u/Buggy321:
      ```
      After skimming through that a bit, I don't think that's it. The "mirror world is realistic, loses detail simulation-ish-ly" part is the firmest detail I remember, and that doesn't match how she describes her world.
      ```

  - u/lucidobservor:
    ```
    This _sounds_ a lot like an SCP or an SCP story, but I assume if you remembered reading it on that site you'd be asking elsewhere. The specifics don't sound familiar to me, but if you _do_ you remember where you read it, that might be helpful information to include.
    ```

    - u/Buggy321:
      ```
      Now that I think about it, it does sound a bit like a SCP scenario. But I don't remember where I read it.


      The most I can do is that it seems vaguely like it came from HPMOR or one of HPMOR's recursive fanfics. But i'm absolutely not certain about that, and i've thought about it enough that I could well be fabricating false details at this point.
      ```

  - u/Nick_named_Nick:
    ```
    All of the other details (that make it NOT what I’m about to say) aside, the first thing I thought of was that space elf dude in The Dragon Prince who is trapped in the mirror. 🤷🏼‍♂️
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      Ok, since you brought up The Dragon Prince, I'm going to ask....has anyone tried to watch the most recent season? Is it just me or did quality take a _huge_ dive relative to the first ~~two~~three seasons?

      Did all the original writers leave or something? It was bad enough that I literally gave it up after 2 episodes, and I really really liked the first ~~two~~three seasons, and I don't usually like dropping things I have started. I think it might be the biggest dropoff in quality of any TV series I personally have watched. It was utterly baffling. 

      That being said, for anyone who hasn't watched it, I'd still rec the first ~~two~~ seasons. They have a satisfying enough ending/wrap up on their own.

      -edit- I misremembered and though that the original run was 2 seasons, when it was actually three. The first _three_ seasons were amazing, and this most recent one, the 4th, had the seeming decrease in quality. Given the 3 year break between season 3 and 4, I wouldn't be surprised if the answer actually was "all the original writers moved on to new things and they just assembled a new writing staff".
      ```

      - u/DRMacIver:
        ```
        Yeah, the latest season was just incredibly bad. Among other things it just had a massive tonal dissonance problem, where it alternated serious emotional moments with fart jokes and pratfalls, in a way that felt incredibly jarring.

        (It's always had a mix of the two, but in this season it felt like it did a worse job of both and also a worse job of separating them)

        I don't have a good explanation, but different writers certainly seems plausible.

  Has anyone read Wish upon the stars? Could I get a cursory do or dont start ?
  ```

  - u/Krakenarrior:
    ```
    Wish Upon The Stars reminds me of The Path of Ascension, specifically in its worldbuilding. People here like the worldbuilding of Path, but dislike the rest of the story as it’s not very rational. 

    I got up to the part where the protagonist joins the heroes guild (at least he toured it as far as I remember), and I stopped there. 

    I would say, if you like Path’s worldbuilding and want a different take on it, I’d at least read a bit of Wish Upon the Stars, but be warned, it’s not going to have rational characters.
    ```

  - u/AngryCoffeeBean:
    ```
    While I have not read this story, I have read other stories by the author MalcomTent. They tend to have pretty interesting premises, but fall really flat on the execution. 

    The characters are not particularly rational, and often make severely questionable decisions that work out in their favour only by author fiat. The characters tend to be pretty one dimensional as well. The author also seems to have very little real world experience and that shows quite often in their works.

    Maybe Wish Upon the Stars is better, but I wouldn't count on it.

    If you have HBO or their equivalent local offering (I signed up not too long ago)

    - Succession is wonderful world of not mrudoch and the not murdoch kids jostling for inheritance positioning
    - Veep is a tightly written and hilarious comedy about the VP, which apparently is mirroring the Kamala Harris / Joe Biden relationship
    - The Rehearsal is just wild must watch tv. I cannot do it justice. Just watch episode 1 and let it convince you.
    - Harley Quinn the animated series is absolutely fantastic and I'm stunned I haven't heard more about it. Very modern, with the core of the show around Harley and Poison Ivy's relationship. It's got a very Bojack like vibe in how it's written. For example Clayface joins Harley's crew but his dream is to be an actor and works primarily as an infiltrator but a very bad one. Incredibly inspired writing all around and probably the best batman tv show since the OG/Batman Beyond.

    Non HBO things I'd recommend

    - Atlanta - still probably the best comedy show on air. I've seen nearly every episode of the season put forward as it's best and I think that's the level it's operating at. It's impending end makes me sad, I feel like Glover still had a lot more to say and the storytelling straddles the line of nuance and obvious.
