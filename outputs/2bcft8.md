  When I updated my stories, I had forgotten this one; It hadn't been updated in a long while.

  I loved the reference to General Chaos, I cackled and everything.

  Nothing else to say right now, still reading it.

  Edit: Actually, what's up with the thumbnail? Why Code Geass? [ ](/ajconfused)

  Edit^(2): Oh. Ohh. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh... [spoiler](/s "Naruto gave Hinata a... failsafe(That doesn't seem like the right term) against the Nine-Brains. Damn.")

  Whee!

  Well, this was a nice chapter. I enjoyed the trick at the start :)
  That new technique naruto learnt seems really helpful - just thinking, but wouldn't Hinata's technique work fine if you could remove the recoil damage from it? That means clones could do it fine, right?

  So, I noticed here that [Possible Spoiler](#s "Gaara seems slightly different. He is more polite about his willingness to kill, to the point that he seems less like a sociopath attempting to validate his own existence through the pain of others, as in Canon, and more like he has been effected by the Shukaku's moral code to the point of thinking completely differently than a human being. In effect, his goal system and thought process are different due to his 'merging' with the Shukaku, who has a completely alien thought process. On the outside he is almost as dangerous as he was before, but he has more control because it isn't due to held in rage and fear, but to a different way of thought.").

  This is supported by what we have seen of Kyubey's thought process so far.

  Thoughts?

    ```
    If your assumption holds true, Gaara would be the first (in-canon) opportunity to sketch out the thought processes and goals of tailed beasts with any degree of comparability to their human equivalent. He could offer valuable insights in what colour spectrum the motivations of such beasts are: are they greyscale, orange and blue, or so far removed from colour they smell like chlorine pentafluoride?
