## Hypothetical Meetings between Earths

### Post:

How would an identical government arrange a meeting with another government in secret?

I am writing a stargate fanfic in which SG!Earth USA will try to contact our USA.

  Forgive the brevity; on my phone.

  The first question is authenticity. Anyone can say that they're from an alternate earth, the difficulty is in proving it. How much does SG Earth know about our Earth? Can they pinpoint some historical divergence? Can they dig up some classified material that they shouldn't have? Those add in an easy path to proving themselves.

  If you've got that, all you really need is to get passed up the chain of command. Governments have these pathways in place already for defectors and whistleblowers.

  Presumably they're using the quantum mirror to explore alternate dimensions? The mirror opens into the corresponding location in the alternate dimension, so they can step through anywhere they want, including into the Oval Office. The mirror opens a window through which both sides can see the other, so what would happen is that the President would see a window open in midair with some people on the other side standing in another Oval Office. Were I the SGC I would open the window, wave and say "hi, we're friendly explorers and we just want to talk. We'll call back tomorrow at this time so you can have some time to prep."

  The next day I'd have a small, unarmed team step through. I'd leave the window open with armed backup just on the other side, but out of sight. I'd also make sure that I could repel an assault if the alternate USA decided to try one. Again, all of that would be out of sight. 

  At this point we've established extra-normal abilities and "we're from a parallel dimension" would be reasonable. We could ask for the local alternates of the contact team to be brought in so they could compare histories as another piece of proof. 

  The first substantive thing to talk about is why we're here. There must be some goal -- explore, trade, colonize, etc. Things will go very differently depending on whether SGC-verse wants to trade alien tech for oil as opposed to "we need a place for several thousand people to retreat to before the aliens kill us all."

  I'd want to negotiate from a strong position, and it wouldn't be hard; we have tech hundreds of years beyond real!USA and they'd be crazy not to work with us in exchange for it. Being the only ones on the planet with staff weapon tech and X302s would put the USA firmly back on top as the world's only hyperpower. Unspoken would be the fact that, if we wanted to, we could use that tech to blow the crap out of anything local, and no security can stop us because we can open a doorway inside even the most secure bunker.

    You could have a scene where there arguing about whether to line up the edges of the gate so it's literally invisible except where someone's image intersects the edge, inverted like a perfect mirror, or off center.

    I would not recommend opening it to the oval office without getting permission first. It could be taken as a threat.

      Any contact you have with a government official is eventually going to end up on the POTUS's desk; might as well cut out the middlemen. And I think my script is pretty non-threatening.

        I might step it down a level- The governor's office is less dangerous and could get to the POTUS quickly.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          Sure. Especially if you choose a major governor like NY or CA as opposed to one like SD. Also, choose one that is in the same party as the POTUS -- at least in your world.

  I'm suspicious of any thread in this subreddit that has hypothetical in the title. As the rational FICTION subreddit, you don't need to specifically call out that it's not real unless you're trying to deflect suspicion.

  If you know the location of secret military bases, then minimizing the number of people who know about the alt-earth is relatively easy.  Simply send an agent up to the front door and knock on it.  Get arrested and interviewed, and pass on some whistle-blower/defector style information that needs to be passed up the chain of command.  

  Once you have the direct attention of someone in a sufficiently high position, tell them about the alt-earth, and hopefully arrange for them to send an agent to verify it, then you're done.
