## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Humans, the dogs of the galaxy

  >No expert could have predicted that the most notable aspect of human psychology to aliens would have been the convergence of the ability to form parasocial relationships and the propensity for pareidolia and anthropomorphization. Combined, this imparted humans the ability to form genuine bonds of loyalty, affection, and even love with beings outside their species (and even objects!), and was unheard of before the introduction of humanity to the larger galactic community. 

  >Despite other sapient species being better able to restrict their base impulses and cooperate fruitfully for mutual self-interest, humanity's innate capacity for indiscriminate empathy has given them a reputation for gregariousness that far outmatches reality. Initially, at least. 

  >Combined with their astounding hardiness and adaptability, relatively fast reproduction and low metabolic footprint it was almost inevitable that after a thriving black market trade in human genetic material that humanity would go on to become the underclass of the galaxy, general purpose servants and foot-soldiers for a myriad of alien races throughout the galaxy.

  Thoughts?

    As a sci-fi premise I love it. 

    As hard sci-fi, it's a bit difficult. Like, we associate the shape :) with a smiley face, hence pareidolia, but alien faces wouldn't look like that. Very few people find spiders cute, for example, and if you google "[cute spiders](https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*ojnyA7GmLlgN_LsW1F4owg.jpeg)" they have the :) sort of face shape that makes our mirror neurons (or whatever) sing. I mean, look at what I assume is a more typical [spider face](https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/otv-XWGkzFKdXHpVQK1CaVxjW2k=/396x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FNetwork%2FImages%2F2018%2F08%2F22%2F15%2F47%2Ftrapdoor-1.jpg) - I don't have an easy time having empathy for it. And aliens would be *more* different. 

    But if you live in a world of rubber forehead aliens, or anything that is vaguely humanoid (the :) shaped face meeting that definition for me), and that's your "gimme" (reasonable enough in hard sci-fi IMO), then I think it's really cool and neat. I'd love to see humanity in more varied roles than just "soldiers", since that's pretty predictable: diplomats and the like.

    I dont know, its hard to know where humans will stand in term of qualities when compared to other space-faring species (assuming we get there).  I think most species that get off there home planet will have a great ability to form group identity and cooperate.   I also don't know why people think humans will have a shorter life span when compared to alien life.

      This isn't an analysis into human psychology or an attempt at comparing it to xenopsycology. It's just the premise for a story, a bit deconstructionist of the "human fuck yeah" genre where we're exceptional individualists who kick ass, and instead humans are relegated to the role of sex freaks and convenient [minions](https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/hitcn/211/despicable_me_2_minions_wallpaper1_96776.jpg).

    I can see humans bonding with aliens (we are freaks) but find it a bit hard to believe that we'd allow ourselves to serve others so much. Could be justified by a long period of servitude. Real cool that we'd spread out that much.

    A year to make a kid being fast says something about the species of the Galaxy. Maybe only being able to reproduce N amount of times or it taking N amount of years or N factors having to be fulfilled. Or maybe we've changed to have a shorter gestation period.

    Not too sure about hardyness, I'd expect reptile or insect like aliens to be tougher. Because scales and chitin. I can see adaptability yeah.

    Kinda weirded out about aliens wanting human dna unless it's for cloning. Though why black market??? Are all the humans clones now? What I mean is why does black market trade of human dna lead to servants and foot soldiers.

      >we'd allow ourselves to serve others so much

      The idea is that these aliens bred and trained humans specifically for whatever purpose they had in mind. That's why "black market genetic material". So they basically get treated like the yellow minions in that cartoon. 

      >Not too sure about hardyness

      Humans are ridiculously hardy(resilient, robust). Humans eat a huge variety of different foods, can survive (if not thrive)on a monodiet of many of those foods, and can subsist on 0 calories for weeks. Most of the Incas, for example, lived on a diet of around than 1200 calories a day.  Also we are present in every single land biome in the world.

        I should point out that human don't stack up remotely well on the metrics you describe compared to most animals. For instance primates lost the ability to produce vitamin C, and humans evolved smaller digestive tracks and weak jaws due to cooking. Compared even just to our own distant ratlike ancestors humans have a much more restricted diet. Also human caloric requirements are pretty demanding by animal standards: Compared to many non endotherms which regularly go months without food, humans don't stack up well. After all humans are placental mammals, which have the highest body temperatures and metabolic rates aside from flying animals. Hell even among placental mammals humans have a high metabolic rate by virtue of evolving as pursuit hunters who cook our food.

        PS: I don't know why more HFY stuff doesn't try to focus on the traits humans have which actually stand out among other animals. Mainly that humans sweating allow us to beat almost any animal in endurance in a hot environment.

    The xenopsychology here seems pretty iff, since humans propensity for attachment outside their species is a trait neither unique to primates nor even to a specific phylogenetic lineage. From looking at earth life it seems much more plausible that humans (and other animals) have imprecise social instincts, because evolution in general only cares about what's good enough. This is evident in examples like jewel beetles trying to mate with beer bottles that satisfy the lazy checklist of features they were given by evolution to identify females. Ultimately it would be weird for an intelligent social species to evolve social instincts complex enough to avoid the human flaws described, without that providing a tangible advantage in the ancestral environment. For instance a social instinct which deliberately excludes other species from empathy doesn't make any sense unless you coevolved with other intelligent species.

    This scenario also necessarily inherits the logical problems common in space opera fiction. 

    In order for humans to fill this sort of role in a galactic community, you need a number of civilizations to arise at around the same time (to have remotely equivalent tech levels) and somehow lack any sufficiently advanced AI or genetic engineering/cybernetics.
