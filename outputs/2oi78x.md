  Any reviews to this? I've read MoR up to the current chapter, how's this for a read?

    It opened with a good deal of promise and has mostly done well. In my opinion there are times it struggles, usually in the form of somewhat implausible rushed transitions, but I definitely feel the good outweighs the bad and continue to enjoy reading it.

      I'll give it the ol' college try. Thanks bro.

      This aligns very much with my views too. I give your review 5 stars.

  I find the comment at the end interesting.  While this kind of full-powers-vested negotiation is terrible for back-door trade agreements, it would have been damn nice for the negotiators to have when *actually trying to end long-running wars*.  I can't help but think that the Israeli-Arab conflict could have been over for 6 years now...
