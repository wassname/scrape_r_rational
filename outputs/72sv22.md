## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I've had a setting bouncing around in my head for a while now for a pen and paper RPG that I'm calling "Thousand Gates" (working title).

  Instead of a single world, there are effectively infinite mini-worlds called realms.  These essentially follow the biblical model of cosmology, with a flat land surrounded by a spherical firmament.  They vary in size and composition, with most containing a single biome.  Their land area ranges from a few dozen square miles to a few hundred thousand square miles.

  These realms are connected by a shifting network of "gates".  These are points in space surrounded by an aurora-like aura.  When an object touches the point in the middle, it and every object whose weight is supported by it is teleported to the realm it is connected to.  They'll appear near the gate on that side, but not within the aura and won't be touching the gate on that side.

  This is a high magic setting, and magic can be used to to do many things including influencing gates.

  Below are some rules/features of the world I've come up with.  I want to make it so people/players can have a real impact without completely breaking the setting.  Let me know if you  have any suggestions for it.

  * While magic can be used to teleport, it can't be used to travel to a different realm.  You have to use a gate for that.
  * A Realm must have at least one gate at any time, and realms/gates can never form a closed loop.  All realms are always connected to all other realms if you use enough gates.
  * Gates normally last between a few days and a few weeks before disappearing.  Magic can be used to extend this indefinitely as long as the spell is maintained (usually by a magical object kept nearby).  Gates can also be forced to disappear with magic, though this can take some time, especially if the gate had previously been reinforced.
  * Gates do not appear inside or underground.  The firmament must be directly above them, and a certain percentage of vectors leading from a point must contact the firmament without contacting any material for that point to be a valid gate location.
  * If conditions change so that a gate is no longer in a valid position (someone builds a roof, for example), the gate will move into a valid position.  This is predictable enough that it can be used to move gates to specific locations.
  * Magic can prevent gates forming in certain locations (you don't want one directly above your stronghold, for example)
  * Since gates teleport the thing they touch and everything whose weight is supported by it, this can lead to some problems.  If someone walks up to a gate and touches it, they'll leave their shoes behind.  A vehicle with wheels may appear without its axles or wheels.  Since this is a setting with a lot of magitech, I planned on having flying ships as the main form of transport between worlds.  Just let the prow touch the gate and the ship+cargo is transported as one.

  I envision large empires made of connected realms using magic to prevent the formation of new gates across most of their territory and stabilize existing gates, with a few realms on the "edge" acting as the frontier.  Some isolationist empires might only allow a single gate into or out of their territory.

  What are some of the things you envision happening in a universe like this?  Potential challenges?

    >While magic can be used to teleport, it can't be used to travel to a different realm. You have to use a gate for that.

    Just a reminder that teleportation needs to be handled carefully because it's super exploitable. For instance in mid-to large sized realms you should be able to teleport metal rods hundreds of miles above a city (which unless the atmospheres operate via magic and the whole dome is always filled) then let them accelerate through empty space with the result of [well...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment).                    
    Of course you might choose to simply make this sort of kinetic bombardment attack difficult but not impossible and incorporate it into your setting, allowing you to incorporate elements of MAD if you wanted. These sorts of attacks might mean that all extremely valuable targets are kept either hidden or in realms that don't extend high enough to pull off these attacks.            
    Also if you controlled your gates/territory extremely closely then you might be able to stop this sort of attack depending on what you need to pull one off.

    Of course if you can open two way portals (within a realm) there are way more exploits, but just using teleportation the biggest issues are pulling massive energy out of it, usually through gravitational kinetic energy.

    Also it strikes me that kingdoms are likely to try to majorly influence the climate through the use of gates. For instance a desert realm opening a gate to another one in a ocean realm partially immersed in water (or fully depending on how much water blocks the gate vectors). This would allow them to have one of their gates in be a river (and very difficult to leave through which may even be intentional) so the ships going wouldn't really need to fly either.                      
    Similar strategies could also be implemented for affected the temperature (also using submerged gates since water has so much heat capacity), humidity or expanding/creating or shrinking/removing bodies of water.

    It strikes me that the main source of mechanical/electric energy is also likely to be gates which open to bodies of water at a higher elevation to drive massive turbines. Hell if they don't need to open to some "equivalent" position in the other realm then you could set up a loop of gates through which molten metal or something similarly dense flows/fall constantly, in order to extract massive amounts of kinetic energy.

    Given you didn't say that gates need to be the ground I imagine empires are also going to need to ward all the sky/space up to the firmament above their cities to protect themselves from a gate based type of kinetic bombardment attack.

    By setting up the right arrangement of gates above the atmosphere it should be possible to make structures that are continuously falling in order to experience zero G's.             
    Also those object would build speed indefinitely this way which potentially allows for gate based kinetic attacks to cause arbitrary amounts of devastation. Also you could probably make great use of the time dilation in a continuously falling structure that had reached near lightspeed (which would need to be well shielded against radiation).             
    Yeah the whole continuously accelerating gate loop idea is so ripe for potential abuse as well as insane potential. Of course you might well need multiple cooperating governments to manage it which might eliminate the chance of rogue agents using it but would certainly introduce some MAD politics, (after all can you shield every part of every realm in your empire?). Not to mention the devastation could be so bad that you could destroy a realm that wasn't totally shielded just so the explosion would travel through gates there into your enemies realm.

    One of the biggest challenges is going to be maintaining the infrastructure that allows an empire to persist. Not only will occurrences similar to the fall of the Roman Empire be more common, but they will in some respects be impossible to recover from (Earth geography is constant, but gateverse geography is not, so if you lose the gate to the fabled world of the Really Useful Stuff, it's probably gone forever). 

    I've got an idea kicking around for an unstable world where the paths between A and B change over time (meaning that neighboring countries will likewise change) and the only way to keep things nailed down is to connect them with an iron road. 

    Something more unique to the gateverse would be the practice of constructing immense fortresses in front of or around any important  gate. I imagine that it would be very difficult to invade any properly-organized empire, since you can not only set up an indefinite number of walls and other defenses in front of it but reinforce the location from behind the gate. Normally, a fortress under siege is on its own, but a gatefort that is under siege effectively has an entire country within its walls.

      Tying into the empire collapse thing, I was planning on having one nation that began when a city-realm in an empire intentionally collapsed the only gate to the rest of the empire in order to escape some kind of calamity.  The city then began reinforcing gates into uninhabited realms and colonizing them, spreading into a new empire.

      This might even be how most independent nations form; a kind of civilization mitosis.

      As for the fortresses, I agree.  War between civilizations will be difficult and probably usually end with one side collapsing a gate and separating from the others.

      But with a high-magic setting, even the best fortress might not be impervious if the players are smart about it.

    Hmmm. No closed loops - or no loops at *all*?

    If there are no loops permitted at all, then if you and I are in realm A, and I have access to the gate that leads to realm B, then there is *no route* that you can use to get to realm B except by going via my gate. I can magically reinforce my gate, and put loads of troops and wizards into defending it, and tax any trade that goes through the Gate to my hearts' content.

    ...wait, come to think of it, there is a way around this. If you can slip from realm A to realm C through a different Gate, and then close the gate between realms A and C, then realm C will be temporarily entirely disconnected from the Realms. It will, of course, immediately reconnect to a random Realm... and if you're lucky, you might be able to get from that random realm to B without going through my heavily taxed Gate.

    ...this leads to an idea for an NPC. A smuggler, who has his own private mini-realm (one of the really small ones). He buys a bunch of cheap stuff, stuffs it in his mini-realm, then goes in there himself and shuts down the Gate. He then finds himself able to get to a different, randomly chosen Realm, with access to a bunch of stuff that was cheap where he came from and on which he has paid no import duties, and presumably access to a whole new market... so a kind of inter-realm smuggler. (A very useful character for an RPG, because he can easily have just about anything in his private mini-realm, tends to randomly turn up anywhere, and is quite willing to sell it to anyone if the price is right. Pay him a bit more, and you can buy the "no questions asked" special as well; in case of danger, he retreats to his mini-realm and closes the Gate behind him.)
