## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have weak telekinesis.  You can apply 1 Newton of force by focusing, on an object or region of space, with a level of precision and dexterity around the average person's hand-precision.

  How do you test this power's limits?  What's the most effective use of this power?

    Lift a ChipSat into orbit.
    If this is for a work of fiction, lockpicking and hacking might be relevant.
    Surgery, especially the same kinds as you'd normally need to thread a long endoscope through blood vessels and the like.
    Move around a camera streaming to a display I'm watching; this feedback might let me move the camera arbitrarily far away and behind obstacles, and it'd be much smaller and quieter than a quadcopter, and can be pushed through obstacles without getting tangled, etc.
    If evil, apply pressure to just the right part of someone's brain to impair their judgment and make them suggestible, or make them fall asleep, or fly into a rage, or whatever else would benefit you socially. 
    DE-orbit satellites is a lot easier than getting them up into orbit. Can be used offensively or for ones that are supposed to be decommissioned.
    Political assassination; hide in a crowd, and use any of the myriad kill options the power fives or just use it to anonymously weld a more conventional weapon like a tiny syringe of poison.
    Pick up small arthropods that you might risk squishing if you used your sausage fingers. 
    Slightly inconvenience people you hate by making them spill drinks, untying their shoelaces, toggling caps lock, wiggling loose wires, placing flies into their food, etc.

    What is the range? Does it work through obstacles? What is the cooldown on this ability, if any?

    1 Newton is pretty weak, but if you don't need line of sight, it is probably enough to kill someone by attacking their brain with telekinesis.

    1 Newton is also enough to lift up a coin and move it around, which is proof of supernatural powers and so would let you win the Randi Prize.

    And if you live long enough for space exploration to really take off, 1 newton telekinesis constantly applied can save a lot of rocket fuel on an interstellar journey.

    Well I don’t know what “1 Newton of force” is, so I would probably begin by moving progressively heavy shit. Can I move my self/bed/fridge/car? Does it cost me anything other than time (I.e calories, muscle strain, etc?) 

    Once I figure out the practical weight usage I’d move on to this “by focusing” thing. Can I make a feather float and then forget about it, and it stays floating? Does making heavier stuff float require more direct concentration? For instance if I can “forget” about the feather, can I “forget” about something heavier? 

    Once I have this stuff figured out I’d begin exercising it. Can I make it stronger? If I really can’t improve it then I’d start playing a sport. I can probably make a ton of money playing golf. Or if the telekinesis is relatively “free” I would have to look into generating power. I wonder if that would be cost effective.
    ```

      It’s about 1/10 of a Kg (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)#Examples).  If you can apply this internally and get tactile feedback you could repair things without taking them about and perform artery pinches to kill people.

        Wow so scratch most of my comment then, I’d probably play whatever dice game is at the casino for quick money. Then I’d maybe work on surgery skills, yeah. Maybe dislodging blood clots? Or identifying them. That is a really small amount. I’m not sure how to best munchkin it. Depending on range I could be really effective in space? Like a barrier to particles.


        Edit: okay so something I just thought of: aren’t there standards of measure for scientific stuff? I could be the most accurate 100gram measurer of all time. That could be valuable. 

        Does electricity have a weight? Can I munchkin this into controlling tiny electrical currents?

        Edit: so electricity doesn’t have weight, so that is out. But if the telekinesis is line of sight based (I would need to test this) I could handle really dangerous chemicals remotely. There’s got to be some mixing or chemists (not drug dealing) out there experimenting with really dangerous shit who’d love to not have to dress their guys up in tons of PPE.

  If you give Frodo a lightsaber Sauron gets a Deathstar: the power.

  You can take objects, powers, alternate rules of physics, and entire magic systems out of published and established works of fiction.  But for everything you take out, someone evil gets a slightly better object/power/magic from the same work of fiction.  If the object/power/magic has a clearly evil counterpart, it will likely (with some caveats) be what they get.

  By published and established it means read/watched primarily for enjoyment by at least 10,000 people.

  If you use the same work of fiction several times it becomes unusable.

  To give some examples: if you take out a lightsaber for yourself, someone evil will get a lightsaber and a blaster.  If you give yourself light sided force powers someone else gets Sith force powers, and they are more powerful.  If you take out the light side of the force as a whole, the dark side as a whole also becomes accessible and it is quicker, easier, and more seductive to learn.  The powers aren’t always exactly opposite, especially if you have a counter lined up or there is no clear opposite.  For example, if you have the Elements of Harmony from MLP ready to purge the dark side as soon as you bring out the light side, instead some Neo-Nazis get a star destroyer.  Or if you take out the Holy Grail from the Bible, you might get Satan or a literal beast from revelation or a metaphorical beast of revelation or any number of things since it lacks a clear opposite.

  Super tech often comes with alternate laws of physics, making it impossible to reverse engineer, unless you bring in the alternate physics into reality as well.  Seemingly reverse-engineer-able tech, like super intelligent AI will often cheat with alternate laws of physics.

  You can take out fanfic variants (if the fanfic has had at least 10,000 readers), but then the evil opposite is even less predictable as it can come from any fanfic variation, not just the fanfic you used.

    Acquire high-level D&D wizard spells. Your evil counterpart might be higher level (and possibly a druid or something), but it doesn't matter. 

    Because you're expecting this. You have done your reading and planning, and they have not. 

    In the time it'll take them to recover from the shock, figure out the extent of their abilities, wonder if they should perhaps put some defences up just in case etc., you'll have divined their location and cast an instant death spell.

    This strategy works for any similarly complex and lethal powerset.
    ```

    - u/fish312:
      ```
      Easier, just take a 9th level spell. Your evil counterpart gets a 10th level spell, which due to Mystra's Ban, has been excluded and cannot be casted. Profit!
      ```

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      This wouldn't be as simple as you're making it sound. 9th-level spells are the best a player character gets access to, but there's some overpowered abilities for monsters/gods. Your counterpart always gets the better power, so you know for a fact they're getting some bullshit legendary abilities and resistances if you're getting the full repertoire of a high-level Wizard. You try to instantly kill them? You can't assume they would have few enough hit points for a Power Word to affect them, and even if you were that lucky, they have legendary resistance; they choose to have it not affect them and immediately retaliate. 

      You can still win with preparation (there's nothing a high-level Wizard can't defeat with sufficient preparation) but it would be time-consuming and expensive to prepare the kind of magical arsenal required to take out the "death star" counterpart to your *Wish* spell. Assume you'd be fighting a god from D&D, rather than another player.

        Hey, I don't have to go all the way to 9th and force the other guy into epic bullshit. I can stop at 8th and let the other guy get 9th.

          ```
          Entirely fair, but Wish is *really good*. Not necessarily in terms of combat, but in terms of real-world applications, which you would presumably be using it for after you ~~murdered in cold blood~~ preemptively defended yourself from your counterpart. Really, 9th level spells in general are the ones that would be large-scale game-changers to be able to cast. Don't get me wrong, Illusory Dragon is cool and all, but being able to cast True Polymorph and turn a chunk of limestone into a *real* dragon, permanently, would be much cooler.
          ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:

    The obvious meta strategy here is don't give good things to good people, give things that are really hard to use for evil to evil people, and hope that to balance it some good person gets something good.

    Will the opposing power line up to be more powerful in concept, or more powerful in execution? To give a theoretical example, say I give myself a magical power that requires some level of training in high-level mathematics to use, with the expectation that the other person will get the opposing power (requiring high-level training in, I don't know, archeaology to use). Will the other power be powerful enough that the evil person would be more powerful with no knowledge in it, even if I have large amounts of knowledge with mine? Or is it possible that I am more powerful due to my required knowledge, while the other person doesn't have it? Or will this not matter, because the opposing power will be given to someone who has knowledge in archaeology?
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      It could be end up either way.  To use your archaeology based magic example if it ends up with a person that doesn’t know archaeology, it would be easier to use, requiring relatively less knowledge of archaeology than your power requires in math.  Alternatively it might end up with someone that knows lots of archaeology.  Either way, the evil power ends up being slightly better in some way.  This doesn’t mean with enough practice and training you couldn’t match or surpass it (studying more math, crowd sourcing math work, etc.) the evil power just has a head start.
      ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    What happens if I take the Sith force powers instead? Would the evil person get the light sided force powers? Would they be forced to temper their emotions and personalities to use and stay within the light side, lest they fall to the dark side and become powerless because the only sith force powers are mine?

    Really this question could boil down to finding things that require goodness to use, and forcing them upon the evil person. Or finding things that reverse-corrupt people so they turn good, whether they like it or not. (You would get the evil/corrupt version of the thing, but you could just, *not* use them.)

    &#x200B;

    Alternatively, you could take parts of things that don't do anything until they are combined. For example, you could take 3 dragon balls, while the evil person gets the remaining 4, which is slightly better than 3. None of the balls have any use until all 7 are combined, at which point the owner gets a wish granted. So this would end up becoming a battle between you and the evil person to gather all 7 dragon balls, and the evil person wouldn't really have an advantage.
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    What happens if you choose the most powerful thing from a given work of fiction? There's no more powerful thing to give the evil side; does the meta-power invent a stronger variant of your thing? That is, can you beat it by having already saturated your fictional source?

    The only other munchkin option I can think of is to find a setting with powers that take a very large amount of preparation and training, and perform that training well in advance of actually using the meta-power to introduce the thing you're training for. Still quite a gamble.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      It would probably invent a slightly stronger variant and give it to an evil person.

      Preparation and training would work to maximize your ability to leverage your power.  If the dark side user doesn’t train well, you could surpass them.

      Teamwork and synergies between powers would also work.  I.e. train an entire group of Force Users knowing that dark side force users can’t work well together.  For synergies... if the dark side is active, get the Elements of Harmony to purge it, and use your light sabers to beat down whatever dark magic comes out of MLP.

      I was hoping someone would come up with a chain of different powers to draw on, using the powers from one setting to counter the evil powers from another.  It would end up being a gamble, but if you could manage to get ahead of the evil powers you could snowball into arbitrary powers capable of solving global problems, making the risk worth it.  The new Sith Lord might be able to beat your force powers, but can he also beat your Green Lantern Ring and Harry Potter magic (which would require you to take down a Yellow Lantern Ring, and a dark wizard but once you go the powers stay with you).
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        Oh, you can take more than one thing? I thought it would just be a one-time thing, so I didn't think about chaining.

        Hmm, if you take more than one thing, what about the evil person? Is it the exact same evil person getting stronger versions of your things every time? Or are there different evil people getting them? This distinction is very important.

        In case 1, since it is the exact same evil person every time, you could first pick a REALLY OBVIOUS but not particularly useful thing. That would let you identify the evil person ASAP. So for example, you could pick an ordinary building from any slice-of-life modern day story, and they would get an ordinary skyscraper which is slightly better than your building. Such a skyscraper appearing out of nowhere would be blatantly obvious, yet not be particularly exploitable.

        This would let you narrow down the evil person's location quickly. Repeat with more obvious items until you identify the evil person. Then you can capture them, knock them unconscious, and then you have free reign to summon pretty much anything you want, except for powers that would cause the evil person to regain consciousness or can be used unconsciously. 

        So case 1 is pretty much the best scenario, where it wouldn't be that difficult to gain nigh omnipotence.

        In case 2, the things you take on have slightly stronger versions that can go to different evil people, but the things will always go to you. This presents an opportunity for summoning items that only work when combined, but are useless when separated. 

        For example, the 7 dragon balls. You can summon each ball one by one, so the evil people get one slightly stronger ball each, whereas you get all 7 so you can actually get a wish while they can't.

        Of course, this runs the risk that the same evil person may be selected multiple times, or said evil people are close enough to cooperate and defeat you. So ideally, you wouldn't choose dragonballs, but rather something else that can be split into tons and tons of useless pieces.

        So now the question is, what fictional thing optimizes this criteria? Could you summon a standard RPG system, then constantly summon 1 xp over and over every nanosecond? That way you would get crap tons of xp and become super high leveled, while the evil people get more xp as a whole, but the xp is divided so they only get a bunch of mid-leveled evil people that you can curbstomp? This is not quite ideal either, because the evil people become stronger than everyone that isn't you, and can do a lot of damage before you hunt them down.
        ```

        - u/scruiser:
          ```
          I was thinking it would be mostly case 2, with different evil powers going to whatever evil person was suited to utilizing them.  This might be the same evil person if their particular mix of evil and skills matches well with a particular set of objects.

          > So ideally, you wouldn't choose dragonballs, but rather something else that can be split into tons and tons of useless pieces. 

          I wasn't thinking of that exact exploit, but I did include a rule that stops this particular form of munchkinry:

          >If you use the same work of fiction several times it becomes unusable.

          If you can come up with combos across different works of fiction such that you only need 2-3 items/powers per work of fiction that could work.
          ```

          - u/Dezoufinous:
            ```
            I think this is very easy.

            Let's go with Dragon Balls example.

            evil person is not silly, and most likely won't just believe that their dragon balls are really working. They also can't test them, because they won't have all 7 at once.  
            So all you need to do is summon one dragon ball (the evil one might get two of them or so), then get the evil's person ball (kill him or just steal the ball) and then repeat (if limit is 3 times, then summon two balls at once or so).

            even if you wish for dragon balls detector for the second wish and the evil's one will get a better detector, then you're still at advantage because you know it works magically and evil one can have his doubts

            That way you can get easily 7 dragon balls basically for free (without giving anything to evil)

            the greatest power you have here is the knowledge and preparedness, not the exact magical item summoned, so you have to use your knowledge (or the evil's one lack of knowedleg) as your advantage
            ```

      - u/jtolmar:
        ```
        Oh, does the meta-power only consider the powers granted in isolation? Then using Chrono Trigger, I grant myself the spell Life 2 (raise recently-dead with full health), a friend the sword technique Cyclone (spinning sword attack), and another friend Robo's laser spin (it's lasers). Of those, the only one whose dark mirror I'm particularly concerned with is Life 2. But they combine to make the triple-tech Lifeline, which grants all allies an auto-revive the next time they would die. That seems like a great thing to go around spreading across the countryside.

        edit: Using Chrono Trigger as a source is a bit of a gamble, given that it's a setting with significant time-travel. I don't think Life 2 is strong enough to warrant evil time travelers as a response, but I'd definitely sit down and research other systems inspired by CT before committing to a plan that brings it in.

  You have the ability to emit light from any part of your body, up to emitting light from your whole body. This light has the same spectrum as sunlight. In effect, it looks somewhat like sun on a noon with no clouds. You can only emit light, no heat is emitted. The light is only emitted in the visible spectrum, so you're not gonna be melting anything or giving people cancer. You can control the brightness from that of a 60W incandescent bulb up to the apparent brightness of the sun on a bright, clear day.

  What can you do with this power?
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    Does emitting light require more calories than not, and does emitting more/brighter light require more calories than emitting less/dimmer light? If not, hooray for free energy! I contract with whatever solar company is willing to pay me the most while including a clause in the contract that some percentage of the profits they make from my energy will go to poverty alleviation. 

    Am I protected from my own radiation? If I make my hand sun-bright and put it on my chest, will my chest get sunburned? If my eyes are radiating, can I see? I hope the answer to the first question is "yes," because otherwise I'd have to be way more careful--it would be great to go sun-bright and have perfect darkness to sleep in while still providing energy. Otherwise I guess I can just get a glass chair and build one wall of my house out of glass, and sit with my back facing that wall while I read/play video games/whatever and use my back to power the panels.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      No extra energy required, the light emission is a supernatural ability.

      No infrared heat is emitted, since the light is only in the visible spectrum. You are protected from the radiation and blinding  intensity of your own light. I'm not sure how much risk there is of getting cancer from intense *visible* light, but it shouldnt be too much. 

      I'm not sure how much it is, but  there is a limit to how bright something could be in the visible spectrum. Any brighter and you're emitting radiation at smaller wavelengths. So I'm wondering if being used as a free energy source is all that useful when the scale is so low.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Solar panels mostly use visible light to generate energy, so you'd be able to essentially replicate the sun for that purpose (but better, since you don't set and aren't blocked by bad weather). The main issue would be maximizing the surface area of panels with line-of-sight to you. Best bet is probably a house made of clear plastic in an enormous enclosure with an interior covered entirely in panels. Plastic and not glass so that if any of the panels or components fall on it it won't shatter.

  You are aware of a string of magical runes which can be tattooed onto a person in order to make their body as tough as steel. The full inscription is around two dozen characters long and has no technically restrictions on size, so long as the marks remain legible and are not significantly altered or smudged. Having the runes covered by clothing (or even armour) is fine, but having someone drop an ink blotch over one of the characters or managing to damage the skin over the inscription (despite the protection) will cancel the entire effect until the change is reversed. 

  The 'tough as steel' effect only applies to the physical durability of the body. It does not result in increased mass, conductivity, magnetism, ductility, elasticity, brittleness, visual properties, specific heat texture or anything similar, nor does it limit the beneficiary's range of motion, flexibility, speed or ability to exercise properly. In effect, no force can damage the beneficiary except to the degree that said force would also be able to damage a volume of steel identical in size and shape to the beneficiary - if they are shot with an arrow, the arrow will only penetrate their body as deeply as it would a steel statue of their exact size and pose in the moment that the arrow struck. This will never increase the damage dealt; if you were to apply some force or chemical reaction which would do more damage to steel than it would flesh, their body is instead treated as flesh for the purposes of how badly the beneficiary is harmed. This notably does not include any resistance to being moved; blows which actually injure a beneficiary are almost always sufficient to knock them several feet back.

  This technique is widely known and practiced between two rival feudal kingdoms. The runic inscription is usually applied to a soldier's upper left arm (assuming they're right handed - it's applied on the right side for southpaws) and armoured with a metal spaulder, but some forces prefer putting it on the lower back or on the back of one of the legs instead, depending on the degree to which they wish to make the inscription inaccessible to enemies vs. how easy they wish to make care for the inscription itself.

  Your task is to figure out what form of martial arts (taken expansively to include everything from marksmanship to grappling to body throws to swordplay) and equipment (taken with similar expansiveness - if you have a solid reason for why every company requires a battering ram, so be it) could be usefully applied between two groups of professional soldiers who are all benefiting from the above protection.

    What's to stop someone from putting the inscription on them twice, in relatively easy to access locations? Would the power stay active until both inscriptions are "damaged"?
    ```

    - u/Username2upTo20chars:
      ```
      The fact that the body is as durable as steel would make the appliance of two or more inscriptions far harder independent of other 'rules'. So complete all wanted inscriptions up to the second last rune. Then finish them completely. Whatever might be useful to get ink into steel-like skin I don't know. Far more force and durable needle or acid maybe.

      Or maybe tattooed can also mean *paint on the skin* here. Or scratching.
      ```

      - u/I_am_your_BRAIN:
        ```
        Under this framework blemishes break the runes; may be easier to have an extra stroke added at the end of inscription duplicates, which can be removed to 're-activate' the inscription OR which can be scraped off etc. once the first inscription is active to have multiple live

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Right--if this works, the natural endpoint is supersoldiers covered head-to-toe in runes, and the standard weapon of choice is a nitric acid bomb.

      - u/grekhaus:

          ```
          The second is an incredibly minor tradeoff for being immune to ink hoses. Seriously, if that is a show stopper, you really, incredibly, badly need to reconsider who you sit down to dinner with. OOh. Creative dentistry. Engrave the runes onto your teeth. This will, of course, damage the enamel.. but once done, steel strength teeth anyway, so no real downside.

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    in this case a pen is mightier than a sword: the best course of action would be for bot combatants to grapple and search each other for the inscription and then try to cross it with a pen, so that the power is temporarily nullified. Then stab them with said pen over and over again until they die. Arms race would go towards developing more and more durable, and more and more permanent dagger-pens.  


    The modern age version would be something like a carbon nanotube meshed titanium dagger that constantly oozes thick, permanent ink.
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Nets, bolos, lassos, pit traps, ect. 

    Nothing about this stops anyone from just tying you up or entangling you. Finding and messing with the inscription is a mugs game with a resisting opponent, but a martial art based on lots and lots of rope and grappling works regardless if you can find it. 

    Also, anyone wishing to be hardcore about this would obviously inscribe on their tongue.

    Note that this means the consequences of loosing a battle will nearly always be entirely financial - the loosing side will have few-to-no casualties (mostly people drowning in mud or otherwise choking to death while restrained) but lots of prisoners taken, so ransoms all around.

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  So you have a magical rune capable of taking enough heat out of a room or compartment to transform it into a walk-in freezer and shunt said heat all into, say, a steam boat's boiler with enough efficiency that it affects how much fuel consumption it requires to keep the boat moving. And it can be expected to do so for *at least* ten weeks in a row without needing to be recharged.

  Given that the society that has this rune doesn't know about electricity and that the magical rune is rare and hard to replicate (forget mass production), what is the simplest way to create insane amounts of value?
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    This depends on the specifics of what makes it rare. If there a limited but regular supply, you set up a refrigeration business - selling blocks of ice for iceboxes, and ice-cream. Before ubiquitous refrigeration, and  in places that do not have it today, food spoilage is an enormous problem, so there is a lot of value in cold storage and you can extract a pretty high percentage of it.

    If it is rare but irregular in supply, - it is written in the heartblood of a vampire, and hunters tend to turn up with five vials of the stuff at once, and then you do not see any for ten years, kind of thing, you cant do this, because cutting of the supply of iceblocks when people count on them would be... bad. Pitch-forks and torches.

    So what you do is head to the largest, richest, city you can find, wait for high summer, and sell frozen treats until you run out.
