  Since it's a shared effect, it's got to have some limited area or you'd be experiencing timestops created by people all over the universe all the time.

  The area of effect would have to spread at lightspeed or you'd break stuff at the edge of the effect. If it lasts five seconds, it's at least worldwide.

  So at the very least if you have the ability you'd be experiencing apparently random timestops every time anyone in the world use it.

    In which case, you could coordinate with other people who have this ability to stagger its uses for prolonged timestops.

      ```
      What stops you from spamming the ability?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Physical exhaustion.
        ```

  - u/tomintheconer:
    ```
    I think the time is stopped everywhere but you can only move in a limited space around yourself.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      So you munchkin it by triggering it at the exact distance from the other timestopper that half their body is timestopped and half isn't.
      ```

    ```
    Hmm. So you know that someone else is playing silly buggers with time. How do you contact them?
    ```

      Morse code with your time stops.

  Ahh, about time we got some JoJo in here. It's not really rational, or rationalist, but it certainly emphasizes quick wits and creative problem-solving. Plus Battle Tendency is one of the best examples of munchkinry-against-the-odds in fiction. We should do more of these, preferably including [](#s "King Crimson") and [](#s "D4C"). 

  Despite the fact that it stops time universally instead of bolstering the user's subjective time (or at least that the characters believe so), the World has a Range C, or about 20 meters. It's never explained if this is a limit of the time-stoppage (that is, everything in the universe stops, but only things within 20 meters of the user can be altered during stopped time) or just that it depends on how far the user can run or throw things given five seconds. 

  The explanation of the World's power is that it moves so fast time can't keep up, and a lot of its power lies in its destructive capacity, precision and speed (for the uninitiated, the power manifests as a really tough spirit entity hovering around your shoulder). Just possessing it practically guarantees you victory in any remotely fair fight or competition against a non-World user. You can bat bullets out of the air, perform surgery, repair watches and so on, without invoking time-stop at all. 

  If a decent munchkin in DnD had the World as a homebrew spell or ability, they'd quickly find it to be cut-price Time Stop, with only one round of free movement and attack. Of course, they would still go first if someone activated Time Stop at the same time as them, because Time Stop is just changing the user's perception and interaction with time while the World stops it outright, but its real strength would lie in how many dozens of bonus attacks it could be argued to land in that one round. 

  It's also worth noting that, in-story, its user can move for up to 5 seconds and do useful things in that time because he's [](#s "a 120-year-old superhuman vampire") and he's been practicing. The average person would canonically manage one or two seconds with strain, with slower progress from training. This is also not subjective time- you and another user, both in stopped time, will be able to agree on how long it lasts. Assuming you have the stamina and don't know Morse, you could communicate through the number of seconds alone. 

  Another tidbit: if they weren't the one to stop time, a person with this ability can choose at what point to start their own. In other words, if you can move for one second, and someone else can move for five, and they initiate the World, you can take your second of movement at any point during their five, or just before their time ends. 

  If we're operating in the JoJo universe, then talking's a free action, and this is prime real estate for observation and strategizing (the deciding factors in most JJBA fights). In JJBA the World is also an almost unique power, and roughly one person in the universe will have it at any given time. Experiencing time stops from elsewhere in reality is a non-issue, and even if they *are* happening non-locally you may not notice them unless you're paying attention. 

  In story, the user can manipulate objects and allow motions or reactions to happen, but the nature of how isn't made clear. For instance, things can still explode and burn in stopped time with shockwaves after time resumes, but thrown projectiles tend to stop a few inches from their targets and then hit after time-stop is over. 

  In reality... well, I have to admit I don't know what theoretical physics has to say on the subject of stopping time, but I doubt the consequences would be rosy. If the range is really limited to the planet, you might be able to destabilize its orbit if you built up enough time. If it really were just twenty meters, then as soon as you stopped time the rest of the Earth outside your radius would rotate and roll away at a rate of 460m/s, effectively launching a 5-second user into the ozone layer. If you stopped a little early, this would make for an effective launching system for small air or spacecraft, presuming they build momentum prior to your use of the World. 

  It can be used for psychological advantage, such as when the user [](#s "stops time and moves an opponent down a flight stairs he's walking up, in order to convince him he's going mad with fear"). It's a very showy ability, at heart, and could be passed off as teleportation or supernatural speed to throw off potential threats. (If nothing else, you could win a million dollars from James Randi.)

  At its most mundane, the World's useful for anything time-cheap you don't want to be seen doing. Pickpocketing, turning off cameras, pressing all the buttons on a phone at once to prevent someone from making a call, unplugging an electronic device with plausible deniability, sneaking past people, and so on. I would include gambling in this list, too, except people and cameras might notice that you seem to shift in your seat at an imperceptibly fast pace.
