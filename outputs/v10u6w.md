## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I like the concept of a Faulty Utopia, a kind of flawed paradise, a heaven minus one. In rational fiction circles that tends to end up being post singularity AIs with an almost correct utility function. 

  [Friendship Is Optimal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) and [The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect](http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/) come to mind as the most prominent examples. 

  Notable mention is the Black Mirror episode *San Junipero*, which is not a novel but a TV episode in the same vein. And I guess "The Matrix" would be one of the original works that explore this trope.

  Not a main focus of the story but in The Salvation War the "Heaven" afterlife is portrayed to be a really bland place where even salt and spices for meals don't exist. >!It eventually gets liberated by a militarized humanity.!<

  Any other interesting examples?

    (Spoilers for Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect)

    I remember reading it a long time ago and it has lot of things I like about it compared to other, "[AI is a crapshoot](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot)" stories, especially since it makes it clear that a superintelligence doesn't need to be in any way malevolent or disobedient to be troublesome. 

    However I found it kind of dissatisfying, the characters don't seem to explore the full breadth of potential for Prime Intellect's universe aside from, "death jockeying" (essentially to-the-death spectator sports aided by the fact that Prime Intellect can heal almost any injury very easily and can be prevented from intervening through voluntary contracts) and wireheading (asking Prime Intellect to put you in an orgasmic coma.)

    Plus it shows its age by basing PI's ethics on Asimov's Laws, the novella deconstructs Asimovian ethics very well but people already well-read on the alignment problem will find its Reagan era portrayal rather dated. 

    There are so many stories you could tell in that universe about how human cultures would evolve rather than assuming that it'd just be stagnant.

    I still recommend Williams' work.

    I'd love recommendations for Faulty Utopias that don't boil down to, "If we had X Utopia, we'd just all get *bored* without suffering to be had."

      I got super into Williams about 5-10 years ago and devoured *everything* on his site (his casino stories are great), and there's a bunch of little side stories set in the MOPI universe. They aren't nearly as good - no doubt a reason that they were on an obscure corner of his website - but they did a lot of worldbuilding. I recall, for example, that he had a concept (similar to what I've read in OSC, actually) of e.g. the Catholics having group worlds with their own standards put on them. I think there was more.

      It's a great universe and I really loved Caroline. The ending was interesting, if controversial.

    Potentially the Culture series by Ian Banks might count?

    Living in the Culture is *enormously* better than anything we currently have, they enjoy an actual Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communist Utopia. Everyone within the Culture lives post-scarcity lives, and for exorbitant demands like personal planets or greater, have the option to experience them in full-fidelity VR; and are catered to by largely benevolent Superintelligent AI called Minds. 

    The primary flaw, as I see it, is that the Culture is *restricted*, they and other polities in the setting are obsessed with minimizing their footprint in the galaxy, and consider endless expansion as reprehensible, even if such an entity shared all other values with them. That gets them labeled a "Hegemonising Swarm", but it's not restricted to mere Grey Goo or even what we'd call Unfriendly AI.

    They have access to literally infinite amounts of energy, and thus resources from Gridfire, harvested from branes. Synthesizing entire superclusters worth of new matter and sophonts would be *easy* for any peer civilizations or even an offshoot of the Culture. It simply isn't even *entertained*.

    Perhaps this may stem from their objective knowledge that there's an "afterlife" or Sublime that they can access at the peak of technology, but even then there's no reason not to optimize the universe at large, especially since they could do it without directly interfering with other civilizations, there's all those giant extragalactic voids just *sitting there*. You either Sublime, a process that might irrevocably change your utility function as such entities rarely interfere with lower reality, or you make the Universe you know the best it can possibly be. 


    Other flaws they have include their pigheaded belief in the dignity of death even when all citizens enjoy an effectively unbounded lifespan, and commiting suicide after a mere few hundred years is commonplace.

    They also frown on baseline humans cognitively enhancing themselves to the levels of Minds, considering it perverse. Fuck me, if I knew I could enjoy Infinite Fun Space, I'd be asking to be uplifted right away!

    Keep in mind these are *frowned upon*, not *forbidden*, there have been extremely long lived humans, and you could probably get a Mind to uplift you if you asked nicely, but I consider the fact that those aren't simply the *default* options in the face of limitless resources to be jarring, since we already know that Minds experience an existence incomparably superior to a baseline or augmented human.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      The "dignity of death" point is interesting. Do we know why this is the way it is? 

      My kneejerk doylist reasoning is that storytelling without death is much more difficult or that a post-scarcity utopia already has fantastically low stakes that the author needs *something* to fear, although I'm not sure what the watsonian reasoning is (it might be the same though?)...
      ```

      - u/self_made_human:
        ```
        The in-universe explanation is that those humans simply get *bored* of it all.

        Not only is the Culture post-scarcity, they have VR indistinguishable from reality, and people willing to both indulge in it, and otherwise insanely risky activities IRL because their mind backups can make death nothing more than mild memory loss.

        Banks states that most citizens of the Culture exhaust novel activities within said time frame, and either commit suicide, or go on ice to only be woken up for eventual ascension into the Sublime or merely to await more interesting times.

        Personally? I would be utterly disgusted by people who lacked the imagination to find things to keep them happily occupied over that short a period , and they could trivially self-modify to *never* become bored, assuming that was a good idea. I would happily precommit to that before I had to find out the hard way, because I'm not overly attached to baseline human conceptions of boredom when I know for a fact that the space of possible experiences has barely been touched.

        Even said Minds succumb to boredom, but I would still at least try to enhance my cognition further before just giving up on the world. At the very least, they ought to Sublime instead of just dying, but sadly that's what the majority of people do. They don't even really explore the range of intelligences between what are roughly modern humans, and the godlike power of the Minds. 

        In addition, while they do have mind backups and the ability to clone them trivially, most people simply don't *do* the latter, outside instances where they're intentionally thrill-seeking. They consider it to be "uncivilized" and have distressingly parochial attitudes towards continuity of consciousness.

        Presumably you haven't read any of the novels, so I can assure you that Banks manages to write stories that still retain dramatic tension even if the characters were to actually exercise their abilities in a rational way. They either face threats capable of destroying backups, or belong to civilizations that don't have access to such tech, as while the Culture isn't stupid enough to have a Prime Directive, they still prefer not to meddle with civilizations that haven't debuted on the galactic stage, even if they could avert great tragedies that way.

        All in all, I'm frustrated by the Culture being 99% perfect, and yet being stuck there by choice, even if those changes wouldn't meaningfully harm the novels. If I had to rationalize it, when the creators of the aligned AGI that became Minds programmed them, they deliberately made them less than ideal optimizers, and thus locked their civilization into a mildly inadequate equilibrium. I won't go into further detail for fear of spoiling the works, but you can rest assured that the Culture aren't the biggest fish in the pond and face real threats regularly, but even that wouldn't prevent them from doing the activities I outlined without any others caring.
        ```

        - u/Izeinwinter:
          ```
          The culture is opposed to tiling the universe over in more culture. 

          This is, I think, simply politeness towards what-ever civilizations show up after they eventually sublime, or perhaps just not placing any value on duplication of experience in itself. Once you have a trillion humans on orbitals and in VR, any additional human born is just going to be a near exact duplicate of *someone* who is already a citizen.
          ```

          - u/self_made_human:
            ```
            There's nothing preventing the Culture from tiling over the universe *and* being considerate about newcomers.

            The universe is largely *empty*. If there's a way that building gigastructures out in extragalactic space, so far away that even *light* from them won't reach the galaxy in anything short of millions of years, as redshifted into the microwave; hampers the latter, I'm not seeing it. They have FTL, some of the fastest in any setting that isn't outright instant teleportation.

            >Once you have a trillion humans on orbitals and in VR, any additional human born is just going to be a near exact duplicate of someone who is already a citizen.

            I believe you are severely underestimating the sheer complexity of humans, to think that mere trillions would be sufficient to exhaust unique qualia. Not only are Culture humans actually entirely different species from us, that completely ignores the fact that they have other ways of asserting uniqueness, such as augmentation to experience more diverse qualia. There's Minds, Drones and humans who have intelligence comparable to baseline humans, and nothing in-between. That might well be a choice by Banks not to have to deal with writing characters that acted like geniuses without the crutch of them being inscrutable Minds, but it makes no sense on its own given that the Culture is otherwise perfectly happy with transhumanism in terms of biological and physical modification.

            As for their refusal to optimize the Universe at large? Well, that's entirely their prerogative, but I think I and the majority of people here would consider that to be failing at perfect Utopia by our standards. It's not what I would want Aligned AGI to do, especially ones as unbounded as Minds.

            Besides, their behavior is inconsistent even by their own standards. Assuming their cosmology works like ours (branes, Sublime and OCPs not withstanding), they have to be aware that extreme timespans (and access to limitless negentropy!) means that anything that can possibly happen will happen. Presumably Boltzmann brains and the like will occur after Heat Death, not to mention the duplication of the our chunk of the observable universe if you travel far enough. That makes concerns about unique experience rather moot no?

            I'd say they should just Sublime right away, but apparently Sublimed entities don't allow any copies of their mind states to persist in base reality, so either there *aren't* infinite copies of any given arrangement of atoms out there, or it's just something Banks never considered. I think that intelligences on the level of the Culture should notice the ingerent contradiction there.

    Dath ilan! It's very utopic- written by Eliezer himself to be- but it has a lot of problems, even so.

    [but hurting people is wrong](https://glowfic.com/posts/4508) shows just how easily ilani can break down when they misinterpret things, and how they are, in their own way, close-minded. 

    [mad investor chaos and the woman of asmodeus](https://glowfic.com/posts/4582) (and all of [planecrash](https://glowfic.com/board_sections/703), of which this is just the first part) is basically all about how gullible ilani are, and how their optimized  social interactions lead to problems when interacting with those that don't have their best interests at heart.

    [The Lies Told To Children](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uyBeAN5jPEATMqKkX/lies-told-to-children-1) is fairly utopic, but [this](https://pastebin.com/fjpS2ZDP) fanmade alternate ending/continuation is NOT, and is endorsed by Eliezer as not far from canon.

    There's other things about them too, but these are some of the most interesting to me.

  I've grudgingly read a fair bit of urban fantasy romance because I'm a big fan of the "packs of werewolves/vampires feud in secret" setting, but the characters and plotlines of these novels inevitably become tedious, bog-standard romance/mystery/police procedural/angst/hurt-comfort stories. I'm sick and tired of seeing this setting used to tell stories that just use the urban fantasy dressing as an aesthetic, and maybe to justify a meet-cute, while the actual underlying plot is identical to any number of non-fantasy stories. I want to see something closer to a hard-fantasy work, where the main conflict is agents using well understood details about the magical elements to achieve their goals.

  The [Mercy Thompson](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40932-mercy-thompson) series, the Twilight Saga, Supernatural, Teen Wolf, [The Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Order_(TV_series\)) etcetera, all have the kind of setting I'm looking for, but don't have plots or characters I find compelling.

  Alicorn's [Luminosity/Radiance](https://luminous.elcenia.com/) duology and [What We Do in the Shadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_We_Do_in_the_Shadows_(TV_series\)) are relatively close to what I want, though ideally I want to see something less romantic than Luminosity and more serious than What We Do in the Shadows

  edit: the [reformed vampire support group](https://www.amazon.com/Reformed-Vampire-Support-Group/dp/0152066098)/[the abused werewolf rescue group](https://www.amazon.com/Abused-Werewolf-Rescue-Group/dp/0152066152/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=0152066152&psc=1) are probably the stories that most closely fit the mold I want.

    > urban fantasy ... the characters and plotlines of these novels inevitably become tedious, bog-standard romance/mystery/police procedural/angst/hurt-comfort stories

    I have been complaining about the dearth of rational urban fantasy works for years. Back in 2014 I wrote:

    > My problem with modern UF ... is that I am mostly interested in SF as a "literature of difference". Or, as the saying goes, "tell me something that I do not know". To me, a vampire or a werewolf is first and foremost a character with unusual abilities and limitations. I like reading about the process of discovering these powers and limits, experimenting with them, maximizing the advantages and minimizing the disadvantages, watching characters change and adapt as they master their new skills or succumb to new temptations, learn to compete and cooperate with their kind, other supernaturals, old-school humans, etc.

    > I suppose that's why I like the [Unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_(magazine\))/"rationalized" school of fantasy. Not surprisingly, my favorite Vicky Nelson book was _Blood Debt_ (1997), in which the characters [trying to avoid spoilers] learn something new about vampires and draw appropriate conclusions. I guess it's not really all that different from any number of
    "superhero origins" stories or, on the science fiction side, books like Steven Gould's _Jumper_, James Blish's _Jack of Eagles_ or even Crawford Kilian's _Lifter_.

    Possible recommendations:

    * If you are not familiar with the *Unknown* school of fantasy mentioned above, Anthony Boucher's [The Compleat Werewolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Compleat_Werewolf) (1942) would be a good place to start. It's fairly short and introduces a number of themes that would become common in urban fantasy and rational fantasy later.
    * The first novel in Fred Saberhagen's [Dracula series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Fred_Saberhagen#The_Dracula_Series) (1975) is a retelling of the Dracula story from Dracula's perspective and "sets the record straight". Subsequent books follow Dracula's adventures in Sherlock Holmes' London and then in modern America/England. I liked the first 4 volumes back in the day, but thought that *Dominion* and the subsequent books were weaker. I am not sure how well the series has held up.
    * I enjoyed the [*Vicky Nelson* books ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Huff_bibliography#Blood_series) when they came out in the 1990s. The problem, as I wrote above, is that I thought that *Blood Debt*, the 5th book in the series, was the most rational one and you have to read books 1-4, which are less rational, to get there. Still, it may be worth a try.

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        I think the fundamental problem that complicates storytelling in *Paranoid Mage* is that the optimal strategy is clearly to hunker down in the backwoods somewhere for a couple years and gradually build skill while hoping that the fascist mind-controlling-übermench-world govt will forget you. 

        Furthermore, besides the human contact that's needed to maintain sanity, the protagonist is also clearly willing and able to do this but they can't do so because watching someone chill in a hideout doesn't make compelling storytelling. This is why they get interrupted by so much plot.

  If anyone here reads pokemon fic with any regularity, I'm interested in any reccs where the primary pov is pokemon and they are treated as xenofiction.

   *Preference for the main character being a pokemon or turned into a pokemon.*

  I feel like there's a LOT of opportunity in the pokemon space for discussing alien value systems coming into clash with human ones, or even just the horror of being a pokemon and having your family disappear as a human in a bush launches pokeballs at everyone around you. 

  Or just exploring the ethics of the human <-> pokemon power imbalance in general.

  So far, the only things I've seen come close are Envy of Eden over on Thousandroads and my own fic, Little Leavanny, as well as a few shortshots.

  I read and enjoyed [*Nowhere Stars*.](https://nowherestars.net/death-inverted-1-1/) It's a dark and quite scary magical girl serial. I think it's vividly written and the detail of the background characters creates an immersive setting and strong atmosphere. The dream-like elements of the plot are deeply mysterious and incredibly exciting.

  I've also read and enjoyed [*Unjust Depths.*](https://unjustdepths.com/) The variety in the worldviews and interests of the various factions makes me want to see them clash, and the novelty and variety in the fight scenes make them the highlight of the serial.

      Some of the torture is onscreen, though. Overall, I would say that the series starts medium-bright, then gets rather dark, then gets bright again (at least for the protagonist and her friends.)
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I would say that it’s dark when the objective seems hopeless, and there’s a ton of character deaths and losses. It’s dark when there isn’t much levity to the story at all. I would classify parts of HPMOR as dark and the full Rational animorphs, because they talk about how they are losing the entire time.
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        By that definition:

        FiO is not dark, 

        L/R has one dark part but not throughout, 

        EOL light, 

        TWC is short so probably not dark, but could be, as it's a depressing situation, 

        CT is light, but the protagonist is an unfriendly AI

        TFotDT, Blindsight, VFL, Unsong, TM, Primer, TMooM, Paperclips are all light

        (The caveats about unfriendly AI/etc all still apply)
        ```

    - u/thomas_m_k:
      ```
      I agree with your classifications. As an example for a darker story I would mention Worth the Candle.

      EDIT: scrolling through the wiki, I'm seeing these that I also think are somewhat dark:

      - Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation
      - Dungeon Keeper Ami
      - Worm (and other stories by Wildbow)
      ```

      - u/kraryal:
        ```
        Worm is so dark that the most frequent comment I see on it, and one I share myself, is "this is too depressing to finish". "It Gets Worse" might as well be the subtitle.

You are not trying to find an object to click in a room, neither you are waiting for the game to show you a plot-relevant dialogue to proceed. All you have is *your*, player's, knowledge, and you must use it to beat the game. Both are also emotional at times, though Outer Wilds much more so.

    [Understand](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299400/Understand/) (by u/dice_hates_me) has been recommended in this community before. It's difficult to describe beyond saying it is a puzzle game where you have to figure out how to understand the rules of how to play. It reminds me somewhat of [Zendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendo_(game)), but in a single player experience. If you want to try Understand, just buy it for $4 and play it without looking up any reviews. It's best experienced with no foreknowledge of what is going on.

    [Baba Is You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You) (by u/hempuli) has also been recommended in this community before. The creator has taken the [Giving What We Can pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/) in the rational-adjacent effective altruism community. Baba Is You is a puzzle game where the rules of how to play exist within the game itself, and you can modify the game rules by moving the description of them inside the playable area of the game. If you look up a review, be sure to only watch a reputable one that will only spoil one of the first few puzzles; a lot of the joy in this game comes from understanding the mid- and later levels.

    [Hacknet](https://hacknet-os.com/) (by u/_Matt) is not quite rational in terms of story elements, but it gets across a *feeling* of player competence that reminds me heavily of what I feel when I make successful predictions in reading rationalist stories. You play as a hacker, and the game interface appears like a traditional terminal interface. As you learn how to break into the fictional servers of the game, you really do get an immersive feeling that you're the one doing it. The closest analogue I can think of is VR gaming, where your character's hand goes where your real physical hand goes. That same feeling occurs in Hacknet despite not being VR: your character is typing into a terminal interface while the real you physically types into a terminal interface. It feels real in a way that most games cannot. I don't think this game has been recommended in this community before, and I hesitate to recommend it because the story elements are definitely not rational — but the *world-building* elements and the way the interface works nevertheless remind me heavily of actual rationalist works.

    Strategy:

    The Last Spell: turn based strategy with town/economy management and rogue lite elements.  A game where you have to defend a town from ever increasing waves of enemies using heroes  with unique abilities. 5/5 after 150 hours over the past 6 months.

     Terraformers: colony/resource management game with card mechanics, where the goal is to settle and terraform Mars. Even though it's still in early access and just came out it's already pretty great. 4.5/5 after a few dozen hours over the past week. 

    Diplomacy is not an option: RTS(with pause) where the goal is to build defenses that can withstand ever increasing waves of enemies throwing themselves at you. Not a lot of content up so far, so 4/5.

    Others:

    The Outer Wilds: time travel exploration archeology puzzle space sim. The most unique experience I've ever had playing a game. Highly recommended, as well as the expansion. 5/5 

    Disco Elysium: RPG. Hilarious and poignant. 5/5

    I'm a big fan of roguelikes. Turnbased and permadeath means you have time to think and the need to cerebrally learn from each death. Start with DCSS for ease of learning, or SIL-Q for a more traditional, better game with rougher controls.

        Its pretty bad though for a beginner, no? Its the paragon of insta-deaths and GOTCHA!s. SIL-Q is very fair, and DCSS tries to do that too (but really isn't that great at it).

          > Its the paragon of insta-deaths and GOTCHA!s. 

          So you know how modern roguelikes give you some sort of experience point equivalent to use between deaths, which grant your character more power in the next run, thus allowing you to slowly get further?

          NetHack does that with literal experience. Your next character will get further because _you_ know not to do that instant death thing any more. And as a bonus, you now know an incredibly risky thing you _could_ do, which might help in some desperate circumstance.

            These are called roguelite, I think.

            > NetHack does that with literal experience.

            [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita) fits that as well.

        - u/NTaya:
          ```
          While I agree, I think the insta-deaths and gotchas amplify the feeling of exploration, especially when you are a beginner and die ten minutes into the run and not, like, 10+ hrs in. 

          I haven't played Sil-Q, but it seems that the community for it is nonexistent (while you could easily get an answer for any of your Nethack/other big roguelikes questions on thriving wikis and perhaps even forums).

          DCSS is much better in that regard, but yeah, it can *feel* unfair sometimes the same as Nethack, even if much less often.
          ```

          - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
            ```
            Ok, fair enough. SIL-Q is pretty amazing btw, I highly recommend it. You can get questions answered on /r/roguelikes or you can read the manual(!), its very complete.

      I've played a lot of [Tales of Maj'Eyal 4](https://te4.org/). It's pretty fun and good, and also has a lot of beginner friendliness that a lot of roguelikes lack, such as a mode where you have a limited number of lives rather than permadeath (though full permadeath is also an option). There's sort of meta progression in that you can unlock new starting classes / races as you play, and it will take a fair bit of time and effort to unlock everything, but mostly it's pretty much a traditional roguelike.
      ```

  - u/Missing_Minus:
    ```
    Honestly, I don't think there really are any games I'd consider 'rational'. Puzzle games don't really fit most of the time.   
    The closest 'feeling' I've gotten is for some RPGs where you can play as a more rational character (ex: Fallout New Vegas), but even then it isn't notably rational.

    I have never had a videogame try and instil a general mental skill in me quite as much as The Witness did. The game is about a very specific mental motion, something core to cognition, about pattern recognition and learning and realization. It will then try and give you this experience to the degree that you learn to taste it on the tip on your mind. 

    It's not "make you think" in that you'll have philosophical puzzles afterward, it's more "make you think" as in "you will be trained in thoughtmaking". And every aspect of the game carries that gentle, desperate will to grow you bigger on the inside. Highly recommended. 

    /u/EricHerboso reccomended "Understand", which is what I'd reccomend if you run out of The Witness and want more of it's puzzles.

  I would like to recommend two different stories.
  First, my review for
  [Fox's tongue and Kirin's bone ](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42226/foxs-tongue-and-kirins-bone)

  There are many different ways worldbuilding can be done. Sometimes the different races are presented at the beginning, often the isekai'd protagonist has to learn everything they don't know about the world and paragraphs and paragraphs of exposition is there for the reader to "enjoy" (your mileage may vary). 

  This story does nothing like this.
  Our tale begins in media res, with an apparently faceless and backgroundless protagonist that raises from rags to riches in a very confusing (at the beginning) world. 
  Piece by piece, you will find out who is the protagonist and what the hell is going on with the world. What are all this concepts that people are using? I mean, I know what a fox, or a face is, but what is a Face? Or this terrible thing they call a Fox? I can imagine what a dopple is, what does it mean in this story?


  Fox's tongue and Kirin's bone is a very well written fantasy story that is filled with tension at the start, and shines due to how it handles knowledge, what everyone knows, what the protagonists knows, and what the reader knows, revealing things little by little in a way that makes you think "Oh, this is what x is". It also makes the story very re-readable.
  The way this book is told has made me rediscover my love of fantasy and why I started liking it in the first place.


  You will like this if you like a strong start, fascinating storytelling, convoluted intrigue plots of the "he thinks he knows I am pretending to be A, while I'm A pretending to be pretending to be A" variety and general bullshiting.  

  On the negatives, it can get a little confusing at the beginning, it is not for everyone, with four hundred pages written it has just recently finished what you could call it's first major arc, and I don't find the current arc as interesting as the start.




  The second one I would like to recommend is a quest on sufficient velocity, 
   [Esquestria: The House of the Sun - A pony cultist experience](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/esquestria-the-house-of-the-sun-a-pony-cultist-experience.71721/)

  First of all, yes, this is a My Little Pony crossover. The other part of the crossover is Cultist Simulator, a much less known card videogame where you manage a cult and try to Ascend.

  Knowledge of any part of the crossover is not required, but knowing at least a little of one is recommended. I haven't heard of Cultist Simulator before and had only read about My Little Pony in fanfics such as "Friendship is optimal". The rest I read on wikis because of my love of the story. By the way, I should probably start talking about it.

  You are Velvet Covers, a low noble that due to dissatisfaction with her life has joined a cult, whose Master is a spooky supernatural being that deals with the fundamental forces of the world. You will become one of the core member of the cult, specialized on Learning (think CK2 advisors), and begin a journey of trying to become more, and change the world in a ""positive"" way.

  Do not be deceived by the ponies and friendship, this story can get very, very dark. Some choices have very awful consequences, and the world is, unknown by many, on the verge of ruin. Everything is not grimdark though, and even though you will have to fight to remain true to what you are and to keep your loved ones alive you can find a path to happiness and safety for you, them, and the world. But for that, you will have to ascend the Mansus and be the first to Glory.

  To sum it up, a very interesting quest, though it allows for a lot of freedom for the voters, it is perfectly readable as a story instead of a quest. where . Fascinating prose, abundant amount of invisitext and very cool way of playing with the format of writing, with chapters written in very different ingenious ways.

    I decided to read the mlp one you recommended, and holy hell it's good. Maybe because I'm already innoculated to mlp fanfiction? If you can get over that fact, the story is very good, and unique as well. Apparently it plays sorta like a tabletop RPG, but instead of 4-5 players controlling their characters, while the DM controls the world, instead it's hundreds of people voting on the actions of one character, with the writer controlling the world. And it's not the stupid homestuck variety of "hurr durr, the character is named poopfart12 and he jumps out the window for no reason", instead the voted actions are much more broad, and apply to key moments as well as your overall approach to solving problems, and the writer makes effort to make sure your actions make sense in context.

    Have you ever heard of the [Prince of Nothing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301538.The_Darkness_That_Comes_Before) trilogy? It fits your request perfectly, and it's a great series.

    In the series a holy crusade has been called to take back their holy city from the infidels who conquered it centuries before. Of course, most of the major players are cynics rather than true believers and are trying to use the war to further their own ends. The protagonist is a hyperintelligent super-manipulator who's been sent by his reclusive order to kill his father, an exile who resides in said holy city, and to do so he must ensure that the crusade is successful.

        It only gets worse from here. The writing has gone from a slog to a death march by the third book. The second series of books in the setting was genuinely unreadable.

        R. Scott Bakker does some things really well. The magic system in The Prince of Nothing is just badass. The setting is absolutely amazing. It would have made an incredible series of sourcebooks for a tabletop RPG. 

        However, he's incapable of writing a likable character. He desperately wants everything he writes down to be profound and makes every paragraph feel like a dissertation on the grimdarkness of the human soul.
