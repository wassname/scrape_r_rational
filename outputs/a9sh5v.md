  Hey, this is my fic! Thanks for promoting it! I I didn't explicitly set out to write Hachiman as a rationalist for this fic, so I agree that it doesn't deserve the RF tag, but I'm happy that you thought enough of it to say something about it.

    "My Hero School adventure is LessWrong, as expected"  would make for a wonderful play on words.

    I found this perfectly readable and enjoyable without any knowledge of the canon - well done!

    Any My Hero Academia fanfic recommendations? I like this and Erased Potential, haven't found any other good ones.

      I quite like Lamarckian (also on SpaceBattles) which is a SI fic. A few others that I can't recall off the top of my head, I'll have to look them up when I get back home.

  Hah, I suppose it is appropriate for this one to be posted here. Hachiman's entire power revolves around taking advantage of the vast array of different quirks at his disposal, so there's definitely a munchkin aspect.

  ```
  Man that opening essay is fucking brutal. What a great callback to the opening monologues of each episode. Hachiman's voice really comes through here.

  It’d be a big stretch to call this rational, so while I son’t Neccesarily think highly of that in general tagging this story with the munchkinry tag and avoiding the RT tag was the right choicr ; certainly, it isn’t more rational than OreGairu proper, and both that work and this rely heavily on story elements - to say nothing of MHA. Still, considering Practical Guide is posted here despite not being remotely rational anymore, it fits well enough, and I can’t say I didn’t highly enjoy this fic. Even as the work isn’t rational, Hikigaya Hachiman is here believably, genuinely smart, and at the same time very much a real person. Whether it’s from personal experience or artistic skill letting them copy the voices of canon when appropriate, the people here act, like, well, people, not plot devices. I can’t say there’s no contrivances, but it’s done rather well and doesn’t detract from the story being told in any serious way.

  Seconding this rec, as it were, just with the added notice that the lack of RT in the title is for reason.

    Don't worry, people will still find it through this subreddit and defend it's rational bona fides until they're blue in the face.

      It's frankly amazing to me that PGtE still gets so much love here when it's neither rational nor well-written. I was interested in the premise at first, slogged through the first 25 or so chapters before giving it up. Seems like a mediocre high fantasy story that kind of got grandfathered into this sub.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        PGtE is rational mostly in the same way *Pact* is, in that it turns the genre-savviness of the average fantasy story up to eleven. It notably lacks scenes where the main characters make the *first or second* mistake that would be dramatic in any other stories, and instead has them plotting around plots. I think it also counts in the worldbuilding department (actual maps and consideration of terrain and travel time!) as well as the "creative application of their resources" criteria. There's a scene in the second book where the main character uses her ability to pilot the undead as a way to create undead goat suicide bombers, and that comes up as a Chekhov's gun at the very end of the third book, in a way I won't spoil.

        I won't call it mainstream rational fiction - its use of subjectiveness and tropes probably puts it closer to UNSONG than to HPMOR - but I do think it's deserving of being posted here, especially if people enjoy it.

          No? It started out promising that. "The story" these days is very much Black / Cat / Occasionally bard says x; literally the only exception to this is grey pilgrim vs black, as far as I'm aware. It's nto something you can predict ahead of time, or model, or shit; it's an as the plot demands power, only it's the actual plot.

          Honestly comparing this to unsong does unsong a serious disservice.

        Excluding the rationalist stories, what actual rational stories are on this sub besides MoL/WtC?
        ```

        - u/LazarusRises:
          ```
          I'd call Worm and Ward rational for their deconstruction of the superhero genre, the brilliant "source of powers" reveal, and Ward's excellent emotional dialogue.

          Crystal Society for sure.

  Hachiman makes every fic better, I loved that other crossover with the dungeon one (of which I sadly can't remember the name, oretachi maybe? ) and I'm glad that this author can make this one as entertaining for me

  Bad economics don't make rationalist fiction.
  ```

  - u/storybookknight:
    ```
    The bad economics are deliberately bad, Hachiman has a tendency towards facile and self-serving arguments where he twists words and meanings in order to support his pre-determined conclusions. But I agree, OreGaHero was never meant to be explicitly rationalist.
    ```

    - u/vimefer:
      ```
      Good, it's never easy to tell when it's character PoV or author bias, and I'm just not familiar with the source material.
      ```

      - u/mp3max:
        ```
        The protagonist is an incredibly unreliable narrator and can be highly hypocritical at times. That said, he's at his core a good person that tries to convince himself that he isnt.
        ```

- u/Pandoraboxhelp:
  ```
  I couldn’t get past the first few chapters because of the blatant signs of wish fulfillment coming in. This hachiman feels more like a self insert rather than a true representation of hachiman. I felt like this hachiman is rather too much in the limelight because my opinion of hachiman is that hes suppose to be the unimportant unassuming snarky side character that rational deconstructs everything around him. I am also a little biased because my favorite fic of all time is a danmachi/hachiman crossover called [My trans dimensional overpowered protaganist.](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi.367903/) and I am quite unfairly comparinng the both of them.
  ```

  - u/storybookknight:
    ```
    MTDOP is a great fic, and one of my favorites as well. I'm a little confused that you thought OreGaHero was more wish-fulfillmenty than TransDim, given that Sage's Hachiman literally becomes a polygamous harem protagonist, but I respect your right to your own opinions.
