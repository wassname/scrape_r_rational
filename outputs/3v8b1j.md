## [Biweekly Challenge] Deal with the Devil

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3td743/biweekly_challenge_cryonics/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Cryonics". /u/kishoto is the winner with their story ["Cryogenics with Claptrap!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3td743/biweekly_challenge_cryonics/cx6qp6a), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair.

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be "Deal with the Devil". You can, of course, substitute in a trickster god or megacorp of your choice, but the Faustian Bargain between a large, powerful entity and a desperate ~~sucker~~ counter party is a time-worn trope.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, December 16th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be "Dungeons & Dragons". Give us a rational story set in the world implied by D&D rules, a munchkin romp through rules-as-written, or the sort of insanity that comes from someone playing the game in a logical way.

    We should just call this the kishoto biweekly story thread. 

    SPOILERS ARE NOT HIDING

    [hope this hides shit](#s "since the souls don't respawn you could spend your time killing them until they run out. 
    Since they must be acknowledged by you you can go to Antarctica and they have to come to you or blind yourself or something.      
    Since the population of the world's dead is actually not that big and a very select few every got this sword presumably hasn't existed since before tools or swords have it shouldn't be too hard to kill them all.      
    Even before you needed to not lie about wanting to die the sword could have easily been placed in that of a psychopath who doesn't care about the destruction and will never care enough to do it. Indeed I have a hard time believing anyone can value someone else's life who isn't their children or partner more than their own. Almost no one in the West even values the cost of charity for example over the hundreds of lives saved.      
    Plus in the hands of someone like a sociopath where it's impossible to want to die they would live forever.      
    How impossible can it be if the curse even tells you what words to say.        
    Also the best way would be to have seven children and murder them when they believe in God. Since your own children are the ones you will most likely be a)  willing to die for or b)  not inflicting the curse on the rest of the world only those who exist only because of the curse ")

      Your spoilers aren't hiding because each paragraph needs it's own spoiler code, or alternatively, you could make it all one paragraph.

      Anyways, [](#s "They only don't respawn if you are actively working toward the goal. Blinding yourself likely wouldn't work. If the blade is telepathic, the risen spirits probably could be too. Agreed about psychopaths, that would be quite a problem. The 'impossibility,' to me seemed to imply that the task would be difficult, one way or another. The story concerned a mentally/morally difficult task.")

      The sword's ancient. No one's sure where it originated from, but the earliest records have it appearing as the center piece of a tribe that ruled what is now South America. This was over a thousand years ago, although there's no specific date available. More details for this are in one of my comment replies. Check that for more info for a response to your first and third comment.

      Acknowledged doesn't mean they need to be seen. They just need to know you're aware of them. Blinding yourself wouldn't help (plus the curse would probably heal you anyway) as they could easily track you down, and assault you. Or give you a message in brail. Their point is more to be sure the bearer is aware of them, as opposed to having anything specific to say, so getting "acknowledgement" would be pretty damn easy.

      The sword doesn't stop aging. It heals your wounds, and pretty much prevents you from getting any as well, but you still age. It's kind of dumb, in that it only heals things along the lines of direct physical trauma/pain, so bullet wounds, stab wounds, punches, etc. You can still get a cold, you just probably won't develop the headache that comes with it. Your nose would just run. So, anyway,  you'd die from something eventually. 

      The curse doesn't give you a script, word for word, more an insistent feeling towards what would be ideal. It has no control over the outside realm, after all, so it filters what input it gleans from the user and forms that into the "feeling" that it gives the bearer. It's sort of like the difference between being given a script and being given flash cards. And its "impossibility" is more in the moral implications, in this case anyway. The sword HAS given physically impossible quests before, but most of the time, the sword's requests are geared towards causing the host huge amounts of suffering. In this case, we have Isaac, who's going to become closer to God, so his guilt towards what he needs to do is going to grow exponentially. Plus, he's going to have a very interesting time being a gay priest, what with Christianity's general abhorrence of it.

      As far as valuing lives over your own, the charity thing isn't a great example, as you technically have nothing to do with them being in their situation. You didn't personally starve out any of those villages in Africa, so it's easier for you to justify not doing anything about it. You don't feel responsible. The trolley problem is real. Plus, outside of a few commercials and ads, you're not hearing too much about the situation anyway, so it's not really on your mind. As opposed to undead monsters rising up and killing people, and making it clear they are doing it solely because of your actions. Seeing something like that on 7 news would hit you a lot harder than seeing another red cross commercial. And also, while the sword makes you fairly tough, you are by no means unkillable.

        >More details for this are in one of my comment replies. Check that for more info for a response to your first and third comment.

        I saw that after my comments.

        Humans arrived in the Americas some 15,000 years ago. Even if we assume 10 years per sword holder and it was already in America immediately. That's still only 1,500 people. And 10 years sounds like almost nothing considering the power it grants you, plus however many gaps.

        >Blinding yourself wouldn't help (plus the curse would probably heal you anyway) as they could easily track you down, and assault you. 

        By that I meant sensory deprivation, like, jumping into a lava lake, or into the ocean, or going into Antarctica with a blindfold etc.

        >Or give you a message in brail. Their point is more to be sure the bearer is aware of them, as opposed to having anything specific to say, so getting "acknowledgement" would be pretty damn easy.

        The idea is that you can avoid their acknowledgement or, easily funnel them to their deaths by leaving only one avenue of acknowledgement. If I'm 1 km into the ice shelf inside a nuclear bunker then it's far easier to just kill them as they come for acknowledgement.

        >In this case, we have Isaac, who's going to become closer to God, so his guilt towards what he needs to do is going to grow exponentially. Plus, he's going to have a very interesting time being a gay priest, what with Christianity's general abhorrence of it.

        I did not realise he was gay but there are plenty of Christian sects that have gay priests so just don't join the Pope lol.

        >The curse doesn't give you a script, word for word, more an insistent feeling towards what would be ideal. It has no control over the outside realm, after all, so it filters what input it gleans from the user and forms that into the "feeling" that it gives the bearer. 

        That still seems like it knows better than him if it's able to take the same information and tell him how to use it, then it can do the same for moral problems too, ie, having 7 children (which still after thinking I can't see a better solution than that)

        >As far as valuing lives over your own, the charity thing isn't a great example, as you technically have nothing to do with them being in their situation. You didn't personally starve out any of those villages in Africa, so it's easier for you to justify not doing anything about it. You don't feel responsible.

        Hmm, ok, I still have my doubts about how outside moments of intense emotion you would actually want to die.

        >And also, while the sword makes you fairly tough, you are by no means unkillable.

        Getting yourself killed by attacking ISIS instead of doing anything is a much easier way to die than killing yourself, as long as you leave the sword in the mariana crater or the old radioactive storage sites.

          Don't assume 10 years per sword holder. The tribe would raise their little cult of prospective bearers by the dozens, if not more, and would often kill one off after a few months, depending on their needs. Of course, this was framed as "honoring the tribe" or some other such thing, so they were more than happy to do it. Plus, if you go too long without completing your request, the undead may just attack you and kill you, if the curse feels that you won't respond to any of its attempts to make you actually complete your quest. So 10 years is too generous. Especially considering that it may take them 3-4 tries to find a cursed bearer with an appropriately worded quest to facilitate their war mongering. 

          Killing off the souls won't buy you that much time, since they keep respawning if you're not completing your quest. Not to mention, even though it needs you to acknowledge them, they could easily kill tons of people before seeking you out, like the hoodied guy did. Sticking your head in the sand will probably only make things worse, as they'll just keep escalating or kill you.

    "‘A dark pronouncement indeed. You are tasked with seeking out seven virgins, born of fornication. Then you must convince them to follow this God you follow and then slay them with the blade. A gruesome task, to be certain.’"

    I'm putting a guess in now: it didn't say the virgins had to be human. What does it take to be considered Christian? If you can loophole into getting seven dogs accepted as Christians, you're home free.

    Oh. He just gave up and went for the "kill people" plan. Okay. Well, I guess that's an option, but I would have at least *tried* to weasel out.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Hah. I actually thought about having him do this thing where he tried to go about it with animals, instead of his "wait and see" plan, (edit: I wanted a cursed punishment for him, but originally, I was going to have it punish his attempts to munchkin, as opposed to his procrastination) but I decided I didn't want that for two reasons. Firstly, I didn't want Isaac to be a rationalist, at least not instantly. That sort of munchkinry is the type of thing I'd expect out of a storybook character, but I wouldn't expect a human to be apt to it right off the bat. Of course, I'm only one of billions, so my perspective on that could be totally off. 

      Secondly, the curse, when giving you the message, also comes with this big feeling of assertion. When Isaac spoke those lines, he knew exactly what they implied (also, the curse doesn't speak english, that's just a rhythmic approximation delivered through the filter of Isaac's brain). So that poem is more for the reader's benefit than Isaac's. The curse delivered upon him a feeling of knowing exactly what he was tasked with. It's why it took the voice no time at all to translate exactly what it meant into "layman's terms"

      Now, if that feeling of assertion is just that (a feeling) or is part of the curse's manipulation and attempt to cause suffering is up in the air. I never firmly decided on it. The curse is intended to be a nuanced thing, almost sentient, and I put a lot of realtime hours into behind-the-scenes thinking on its behavior, but I didn't decide whether its curse can be fulfilled in other ways that ran counter to the feeling of assertion it gives. I thought about it, but I couldn't come up with a firm decision, which is part of why I scrapped Isaac trying to munchkin it.

    This is great. Spoilers follow, for those on mobile.

    [](#s "Really liked the line 'The places he’d never see, the husband he’d never have.' Not overstated as those things can sometimes be.")

    [](#s "The 'impossible task' for Isaac seems totally achievable, though obviously it would be horrible. If that's indicative of the average difficulty for a task (requiring you to radically change your sense of morality), then it seems likely that the curse either (a) can resurrect even the ones who succeed, or (b) draws people to the sword (like Isaac in the beginning, falling down repeatedly).")

    [](#s "Otherwise the number of souls it can call on would have to be quite low, given that a not particularly well-hidden location kept it safe for hundreds of years (assuming '[My remains] are older than your country' means America). Alternatively, people were not very diligent in hiding the sword when they succeeded/died.")

    I found some errors, hope it's alright to post them here. These should be spoiler-free.

    The flashback section, between "He'd been caving," and "bruised to high hell." should probably use past perfect consistently.

    > It’s the only to ensure

    It’s the only **way** to ensure

    Should perhaps be adrenaline. Might be a regional spelling variant.

    Should be 'Until such time as', I think.

      Oh, I didn't read your spoilers, as I replied in my inbox. Here's my spoilerific reply then. Note that this contains details not present within the story, it's just some of the meat of the story's supposed background

      [](#s "As far as where it truly originated from, no one is completely certain, but, if the proper research was done, Isaac would find that the blade used to be the center piece of a tribe of people that inhabited what is now South America. They ruled over vast swathes of land, much more than a tribe of their numbers should've been able to control, by using the cursed blade to wage war and subjugate those around them. They would raise unattached children to be fanatically loyal tribal warriors, who are all prospective cursed blade bearers. Think Root, from Naruto, almost, if Danzo could've given the Kyuubi to any of his men at any time. One cursed bearer could defeat entire armies, and it was the threat of this, more than his/her presence, that kept the conquered people subservient. The tribesman who was cursed would pursue his quest, but ensured that the warmongering tasked to him by the elders was done as well. If the quest was too specific or specialized to allow for the needed fighting, the tribesman would kill himself, to pass the blade onto another. After a few centuries of this, a cursed bearer broke free of the tribe's brainwashing and absconded with the sword, leading to the tribe's destruction, as their neighbors realized that there was no more human superweapons to deal with. This traitorous cursed bearer traveled north, far north, crossing both land and sea, until he was so far, he could see naught but deserted wildlife around him. He then killed himself, and his remains are the ones Isaac stumbled across. He'd been buried for centuries, but recent seismic activity shifted enough of the land, that his resting place was accessible, via Isaac's method. Anyway, as a result of the tribe's usage, the sword has hundreds, if not thousands, of souls to call upon as it needs to. And yes, the country is indeed America. And the blade's weird. It has assigned quests that were physically impossible before. But it also assigned quests that were fairly easy, from an actuary standpoint. The one thing they all had in common, however, was that the bearer would be forced to suffer greatly during the completion. Not necessarily physically, but there would always be suffering. For Isaac, he's going to grow closer to God in pursuance of his priesthood, and, by the time he's ordained, he will be a full fledged pastor and believer in Jesus Christ. With the added caveat that he tortures himself constantly about his quest and his sexuality. Which will cue more suicide attempts. But he still won't be selfless enough to kill himself, meaning he's stuck courting his seven sacrifices, possibly more if he screws up on choosing them. So yea....lots of not-fun ahead for him.")

      Sweet, thanks for the typo corrections! It's a little longer than most of my work, and my stream-of-consciousness style of writing lends itself to many a typo. I usually miss a few in my post-reads.

      I went back and corrected most of them, although I left

      > Until such a time when the blade is found once again

      as it were, as it sounds more majestic that way, even if the grammar isn't perfect. Let's blame the voice for his archaic sentence structure! :P

      EDIT: Actually, that's a lie. I decided to change the line to

      > Until such time as when the blade is found once again
      ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      > A few minutes' exploration

      No apostrophe. It's "a few minutes [of] exploration" by Isaac. The apostrophe would make it possessive meaning "the exploration performed by the minutes."
