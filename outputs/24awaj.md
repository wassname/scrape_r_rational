  >What he can see is a castle full of bones, a girl whose breath is rotten with decay, a princess sleeping snug amongst the dead. He sees a girl with nails of thorns, and flesh all plump and rosy and well fed. What he sees is a cave with many footprints going in, and no prints coming out.

  *shudder*...is the implication here that the princess is *eating* them?

    My hypothesis is that she herself is part of the plants â€“ an elaborate Venus flytrap, if you will. Hibernating monsters works though.

    Keep thinking how she'd be a perfect quest boss for a game like Witcher..
