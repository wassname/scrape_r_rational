A fan translation of a story published in 1976 about a computer that starts to predict the text it's processing. Gave me strong GPT-2 vibes.

  An interesting, creepy story. Lem is a great author, one of my all-time favourites. The man had surprising insights.

  That was excellent, though I wish I hadn't known the summary going in.

  I got genuine chills from this beautiful turn of phrase:

  >A new type of a ghost starts with higher mathematics and so it is, to us, inaccessible.

  On the topic of Lem and natural language processing AIs... there's [this](https://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Art/tensor.html) hilarious poem that he has a computer compose in one of his stories when someone tries to trip it up by asking it write poetry on "love and tensor algebra".

    ```
    That is indeed hilarious.
