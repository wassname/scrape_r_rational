## [RST][RT][HF] The Tinker's Daughter - Chapter 7

### Post:

[Chapter 7](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/mage_world/chapter_007.html) of The Tinker's Daughter is available for browsing, and the '[full](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/mage_world/full.html)' file (the one-page compilation of the book to date) is up to date.

Quick recap and book blurb:

_The Tinker's Daughter_ is a rationalist hard fantasy story in which magic is powered by mana that you get when worldlines are cut off -- either by a decision, a death, etc.  There are multiple kinds of magic users, and one of them is the tinker, the mages who create magical machinery ("mechs"), including golems.  Peter Tinkersmith created the very first self-aware golem...and was then murdered for it.  His children (Jess, his biological daughter, and Rob, the self-aware golem) escaped.  Today, still wanted by his killers, they survive as professional gamblers, betting on Rob's success in robot pit-fighting. ~~If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...The Tinker's Children.~~  

Last chapter they were forced to out Rob's secret to two people.  They also made strides towards locating their father's killer, which they will follow up on in today's installment.

  Interesting chapter, but won't the fact that she left the driver mechs there be an issue? Both because they can be tracked to the company that manufactured them and then to the ones they were sold to, and because the company requesting the repairs will notice 2 of them missing when they put the factory line back together.

  Not only, but the work she did on the alarmed door, bypassing it like that, is something that probably very few people in the whole city are able to do, so that could be an issue as well.

  In addition, she scribbled down the 3 names she read, right? Where did she put the paper? Was it in the jacket that she left behind? Did she close and put away the document where she read the 3 names? If not, then that could be easily traced back to her.

  Did the jacket have other things in it that could be traced to her? 

  The notepad in her rucksack didn't have anything that could be traced to her? Was it a new one, bought specifically for this?

  Last but not least, could you please take a look at the tool you're using to make the .epub? THe issue of there being 2 copies of each chapter within it (1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7) has been going since the first one, and still hasn't been fixed.

  EDIT: it could be interesting if you also went the HPMOR way: put the character in a difficult situation, make a full list of everything (s)he has to work with then leave it open ended to allow for a challenge post, where you allow everyone to submit solutions to the character's situation.

  As was suggested before, I included a summary of the book and the previous chapter.  Let me know if this was useful.
