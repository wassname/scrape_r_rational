## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  There exists a vast multiverse of infinite possibilities. Your power allows you to change your body and parts of your mind for that of someone sufficiently like you in one of the other multiverses. When you make the change, your body completely changes, and you suddenly have all their memories and skills in addition to your own.

  You do not have access to the entire multiverse of possible yous. The first (hard) limit is that they must be sufficiently like you, which here will be defined as having the same name, the same mother, the same father, and having been born at approximately the same time as you. The second (soft) limit is that you need to spend significant time acquiring other yous to change into, and these get harder the further you get from the central example of you (the you that you started as). A week's time will let you acquire an alternate you that's genetically identical and has hardly diverged at all. A month will let you acquire an alternate you of the other gender. A year will let you acquire the upper bounds of alternate yous, including those wildly different worlds (that nevertheless contain versions of your genetic mother and father who met and had you at approximately the same time). Once you've acquired another you, you can change in two minutes. The only limit on how many other yous are in your repertoire is time. A large chunk of acquisition is winnowing down to a single candidate, which lets you get a sense of what's available, but can't give you direct information about the other yous.

  Changing into another you doesn't affect what's going on in the multiverse at all. The other yous are continuing to exist out there, and if you change into them twice in one day, you'll pick up on some of their new memories and experiences. You don't take on their injuries, nor do you get anything like e.g. filled cavities, replacement knees, or anything like that.

  Given this ability, how do you best make money? How do you best leverage this power to help your community? What "yous" do you acquire to keep on standby?

  How does the answer change if we assume you're not the only one with this power, and it's the domain of perhaps hundreds of thousands of others? (I think this would cut down on the rather obvious and somewhat boring 'take culture and information from other universes'.)

    If this is a common and new power, the world will be in *severe* future shock, as people are importing best practices in every field imaginable at a brutal pace. Lots of corporate titans falling and rising. 
    Lots of governments falling too, since inevitably, some of those worlds will be better run, and it likely gets really hard to justify the way things are, if people know of better ways. 

    So.. honestly, I think the first target is going to be a me with *way better social skills*. Im going to spend a few years being a very attractive lounge singer or bartender or something until things calm down.

    Speaking of "rather obvious and somewhat boring," find a version of yourself with the same power and more experience using it. Apply their memories and skills towards finding better choices of yous to merge with than you would think of yourself.

    Does genetically identical mean the alternate self is still human? Or does the multiverse contain creatures with the same genetic code as humans, but different ribosomes, so the genes mean something completely different? There might be useful aliens out there, if that exploit is allowed.

    It seems like acquiring a very athletic version of yourself would be a good thing to check off, for comfort, energy, and lifespan. Especially if shifting prevents you from having to put in the work to maintain it. If you can use your shifting to stay in a healthy, long-lived copy of yourself, then you'll gradually get access to copies of yourself with better and better information/technical skills, as multiversal yous get more time to accumulate experience.

    For money, all that comes to mind is acquiring rare, valuable skills. Very niche engineering expertise pays well. On the very niche end, you could also charge for the time it takes you to find a multiversal copy with the exact right skill set. But it might be more immediately profitable to copy a you with skills at acting or sports. Any of these can be multiplied with skill at investment.

    For the community, organizational skills are generically useful defaults. Hard to beat an effective mayor or union activist. But for any given community, there's probably some need pressing enough that it does beat the generics. So an important step would be getting involved and figuring out what sort of transit engineering or sanitation engineering or whatever is lacking, so you can copy that skillset from a copy of yourself.

    **Phase 1:** Do I have access to other mes that also have this power?  The first few weeks I will spend playing around to get other mes that are similar and only recently-diverged and also have had this power.  Then I will play around with exchanging memories with them and intentionally making our timelines diverge more (you mentioned in the 3rd paragraph that we can pick up new memories and experiences from each other).  Then I will set up a schedule of exchange based on committing to memory certain times to take divergent actions.  This sets the stage for phase two.

    **Phase 2:** myself and my cluster of relatively similar versions in nearly identical universes that have memory exchanging schemes based on my power start hunting around for useful moderately and highly divergent selves to leverage.  Each one takes year to find and then an additional year for my near alternative selves to get the divergent self.  Among interesting divergent selves to look for:

    * Engineer/hobbyist from more technology advanced realities who, as a hobby like to try to reconstruct advanced stuff from primitive stuff.
    * Mathematicians who knows the solution to millennia prize problems (each work a million dollars)
    * CEOs and Politically skilled versions of me
    * Worlds with access to anything out-of-context: gods, magics, sufficiently advanced aliens, strong AIs, etc.
    * Worlds that are mostly the same but off in timeline by at least a few years... this way I can get immortality by copying younger versions of myself, and predict the future by seeing how things played out in timelines similar to my own.
    * World with mes that have access to other forms of multiversal communication/interaction/travel.  After all, if this arbitrary power exists why not others?

    For other people munchkining this p... the engineers/mathematician/scientists selves might be hard/unlikely, but I think I have a head start in that regard.  At minimum though, people can look for timelines where the average IQ and thus by social pressure they ended up being a scientist/mathematician/engineer.  For myself, I could look for worlds where the average Charisma is lower to find a Politician/CEO version of myself... but this might have weird effects where their intuitions for people are wrong because they are used to their world.

    **Phase 3**, I start looking at hard problems and long term problems.  How are all the memories affecting my personality and values?  Does anyone have a set  of algorithms for strong value aligned AI or for weaker but still super-intelligent limited AI (like an Oracle AI).

    In the event Phase 1 fails because I am the only hardly diverged version with access to this power, my Phase 2 has different priorities, namely getting younger versions of myself, and perfecting this search process so I can know if I can effectively do so every few decades.  Next on my Phase 2 is finding any version of me with any form of multiverse interaction/communication/travel.  Finally, I would start looking for worlds with strong AI as a solved problem.  Without a cluster of mes to also search, I need to be faster and more decisive in what I search for.

    > How does the answer change if we assume you're not the only one with  this power, and it's the domain of perhaps hundreds of thousands of  others? (I think this would cut down on the rather obvious and somewhat  boring 'take culture and information from other universes'.) 

    Are we assuming strong AI is harder than Eliezer and related people seem to assume it is?  And do any other realities also have this power?  If a bunch of people in a bunch of realities have this power and strong AI is reasonably achievable,  it would be a race where various strong AI trying persuading people with good memory to bootstrap alternate version of them into existence in this reality.  It would be a matter of determining which ones are properly value-aligned, which one are only mostly value-aligned (think Celestia AI from Friendship is Optimal), and which ones are only trying to seem value aligned while people implement and bootstrap them into existence and are actually plotting to paperclip everything they possibly can.

    If we cut out the AI stuff, and assume that other smart people are already bootstrapping other realities technology and culture into our own... I think the finding younger versions of yourself hack is my priority.

    How specific is the search mechanism? Do you get feedback for if a version of you is within acquiring range?

    This doesn’t feel like the spirit of the question, but creating a bunch of Bitcoin wallets and checking if their public keys match specific existing wallets with a ton of Bitcoin and committing to memorizing the private keys of any that do match should work. Then I just have to search for a nearby version of me that’s really excited about having gotten a lot of Bitcoin recently. I assume that search parameter isn’t too specific.

    I’m also assuming the math works out for generating keys. Infinity is large though!

    Don’t even really need to steal money from people for this to work: [lots of Bitcoin is lost forever](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-dormant_5y-bitcoin-addresses.html).

    The obvious move in the "it's only me" situation is to grab the closest "me" variant who is an amazing, prolific writer and try to get some novels published. Once I've got some seed money, a me-variant with the exact subset of skills needed to figure out a good business or political project and then a me-variant with the skills to see it to fruition will allow me to be the best possible politician or entrepreneur.

    Money is power, and political influence is power; I'd put all of both behind whatever the me-variant with the best avoid-the-climate-apocalypse skillset thinks is the best way to proceed.

    Also, I would absolutely indulge myself in having a me-variant of the opposite gender, a me-variant who possesses a sense of smell (which I was born without), and a me-variant who can actually draw worth a damn, even though none of those contributes in any way towards my plan.

    I definitely want to keep a me-variant on standby who has top-notch emergency medicine skills, just in case.

    Having hundreds of thousands of people able to do this... I really don't know, but it would certainly be a tremendous boon to anyone suffering from dysmorphia/body dysphoria. If there are that many people with the power, I doubt I'd be in a position to somehow better leverage it than anyone else, but it could certainly make my personal life easier!

  Yet another DnD spells munchkinry... this time with a large scale **coordination problem**:

  An rare extra-dimensional traveler has brought the knowledge of [Spells](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/sorcererWizardSpells.htm) to this reality.  With several months or mental exercise and focus along with around a hundred dollars worth of ink and fine paper, the average person can learn and cast Level 0 cantrips.  With a few year practice, a reasonably smart person can learn level 1 spells,  A decade or two (depending on how smart a person is and how much they practice daily) will get them up to level 2 and 3 spells.  A lifetime of studying will get you up to level 4 spells.  Specializing in a single school (the schools are: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation), that is focusing on studying that school and ignoring at least two other schools will get the person studying it around 1 to 2 levels higher (1 level with the first few years of study, 2 levels with around a decade of study) in that school and one level higher in the schools they didn't ignore.  Only studying and practicing a single school, with occasional dips into other schools as they directly relate will get you 3-4 levels higher (2 levels in the first few years of study and practice, 3 levels with around a decade 4 levels with a life time of study).  Everyone can cast universalist school spells if they can cast any spells of that level.  Preparing and casting spells is a bit like memorizing and reciting poetry, a bit like visualizing geometry, and a bit like performing mental math and requires high intelligence, with level 1 spells requiring just above average, level 4 requiring people in the upper 10% of the population in terms of memorization and mathematical ability, and level 9 requiring extreme genius and lots of practice.  Limits on total amount of magic cast per day is a bit fuzzier than DnD 3.5e rules, by they are a good approximation.

  So a specially focused college education in magic might manage to produce wizards with 2nd or 3rd level spells depending on how focused the education is (and how well they filter for the raw memorization and mathematical ability).  Under these conditions, a pure specialist with a lifetime of dedicated study and practice might manage level 8 spells by the time they are old, while a partial specialist might only manage up to level 6 while the time they are old.

  **Furthermore**... it seems that there is an oddity to magic being introduced into our reality.  Spells of a single school being cast make spells in that school easier to cast and spells from other schools harder to cast.  Keeping at least three schools of magic rare to nonexistent within a several hundred miles radius (500 to be absolutely sure, 100 is reasonably distant, the limits are kind of fuzzy), makes spells of the other schools easier to cast by around 1 level.  Only allowing a single school of magic and frequently casting it (a small university focused on this magic would be enough) in a particular region and making all other schools nearly nonexistent makes it easier to cast by around 2-4 levels (depending on who strict the rules about casting other schools of magic are and how frequently that magic is used).

  So an area that successfully banned 3 schools of magic might see the specialists coming out of college with level 3-4 spells instead of level 2-3 spells and their eventual elderly master pure specialists might manage level 9 spells.  A region that only allowed a single school might see their specialists with level 4-7 spells and geniuses reaching level 9 with only a few decades of practice.

  So with these constraints, what schools of magic should be banned to get the most out of magic as a whole?  What clever gains from trade can be made by banning different magics in different geographical regions and specializing in particular types of magic?  For the sake of simplicity, lets say our dimensional traveler knows about all the general high level stuff so scientists and would be wizards and world leaders can plan around that. The schools of magic interfering with each other is unknown to start with, but is rapidly notice because magic is so rare to start with (our extra-dimensional traveler theorizes that this effect might be unknown in his original world since all magic is used roughly equally there so no one noticed what the lack of a few schools of magic meant).

  Personally... I think the mental boost available in transmutation make it the best to focus on for most regions of the world, but the unique mental effects of enchantment could rapidly advance cognitive psychology so a few regions should focus on them.  And of course, the greater teleportation (and eventually gating or teleportation circle) of conjuration has strong applications to space travel that make it worth it for a few regions to specialize in that as well.

    "Era of the Spell Rigs". The oceans are vast, and have not many people with strong opinions in them. Almost all magic universities are therefore floating installations that focus on a single school of magic, and the sale of associated magical services.
    ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    Another dynamic which might emerge is the use of deep-cover magical saboteurs, generalist mages sent into the specialised territories of rival powers to cast lots of spells from each school in secret and degrade the strength of their specialised territory

      That might be pretty easy to do with submarines to counter the sea-based spellcasting approach. On land, you'd probably see other countries just creating Facebook memes about how it's not the single magic type usage which makes those regions more useful for spellcasting; that's just BS from the liberal Ivy League college elite pedophile spindoctors who want to monopolize places of power for themselves. You should totally go there and cast spells of any type you like, something something, freedom, own the libs, etc.

      With the "crabs in a bucket" mentality weaponized, the only regions which would actually manage to remain isolated to just one type of magic would be in remote locations in authoritarian regimes, surrounded by barbed wire fences, where trespassers are spotted by helicopters with infrared cameras and executed on sight. Soon enough, Siberia and Tibet would become about the only places on Earth with colleges that could graduate spellcasters capable of 9th-level spells.
      ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    .. One important effect of this is that pretty much every school system in existence will now teach everyone the utility cantrips. Mage Hand, Mend, Message, Prestidigitation. Light. Prestidigitation, in particular is stupidly useful. 

    And I dont think, given this, that the combat cantrips stay out of circulation.
