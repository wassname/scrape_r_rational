  I love this fic. It did take a detour from Harry Potter for a while, but Milo's munchinery combined with the high joke density never ceases to entertain me.

  ```
  Looking forward to Milo vs Zombie Milo, when Voldemort realizes the only thing that can fight a Munchkin is another Munchkin.

  Excellent chapter. Nailed the character of Sirius. 
  And holy shit that last line. 

  Also, lol Milo casually dismissing fights with Dementors as 'sucking'.

  I think this just keeps getting better. So many plot elements left to resolve and I expect many more twists and turns along the way. (Like that closing line.)

  I wonder how many chapters before this fic ends. Does anyone know?

    I don't know if there is a hard chapter limit but from what I've read the author plans on doing his version of all 7 books.
    ```

      Still quite a bit to go then. That's great.
