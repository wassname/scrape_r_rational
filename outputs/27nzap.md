  'Interesting' and 'odd' are both definitely among what I've been aiming for. :)

  (And yes, I'm still working on Book Two; I'm not hitting 4k words a day like I was when I started, but I'm still adding some more every day.)

    Oh, the author himself appears. You should know that I was not expecting such a captivating story come out of nowhere like this. I'm really enjoying it so far.

    An interesting note: I think the story's format matches well with a serial comic. I keep imagining the cell layouts and dialogue boxes as I read. The character and setting descriptions are just *begging* to be drawn.

      It was a comment in this subreddit that I should "Just start writing" that prompted me to do just that; I've been keeping a close eye on this place since then.

      If I may ask, where did you learn of S.I.? SpaceBattles? LessWrong Discussion? Elsewhere?

      I'm certainly a fan of comics, including having learned some important lessons about story-telling from Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics" and sequels; and I try to keep the visuals firmly in mind as I write. I know a few artists who'd probably be happy to create some images, but the going rate is around $20+ for a full-body figure with no background, and while I've got time to think about plots and write things down, it's a bit harder for me to convert my time into spare cash. That said, I have noted down a few visual references that come reasonably close: https://sfw.sofurry.com/view/602824 , https://sfw.furaffinity.net/view/12351256/ , and on NeutronAlchemist on DeviantArt has some NSFW photomorphs that have reasonably representative anatomy.

    You aren't a furry by any chance, are you? Because a lot of what I am reading strongly suggests either that or strong ties of another type to the subculture. If it weren't already painfully evident by both my username and flair, I am one, if generally quietly. I approve.
