  Yay! Children who need help going to therapy! there's only one other fic I know of that did this, a realistic take on Power Rangers, it starts with Tommy, the leader, checking in to therapy.

    I don't suppose you've got a link to that fic? The concept.. intrigues me.

  Awesome, I've seen this around for a while and finally started to read it last night, then ended up reading the entire thing. It was very entertaining, I look forward to more updates!
