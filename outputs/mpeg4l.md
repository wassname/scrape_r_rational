## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Some days ago [Bloodline](https://www.amazon.com/Bloodline-Cradle-Book-Will-Wight-ebook/dp/B08ZS19WWY), the 9th book of the Cradle series was released. 

  Cradle is an excellent Xianxia story written by a western author in English, with actual characters and plot. It has already been recommended multiple times on this sub, I can only second those recommendations.

  [Just a Bystander](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32123/just-a-bystander) — This fiction made a pretty big splash last summer, but it feels like readership fell off due to a (relatively) slow upload schedule, and I haven't seen it come up here. Well, it's still going on and is one of a few web serials that I have consistently returned to and enjoyed.

  The premise: A student of magic/Arcana gets wrapped up in a mysterious prophecy that could either strengthen or unravel the world. A unique take on prophecies and Fate magic, as well as a hard magic system that is deeply explored and is important to the story. The world feels almost contemporary, except that everything runs on Arcana, a kind of magic that on the surface feels almost like computer code, but is eventually revealed to be incredibly strange and unsettling. It's a great fit for /r/rational, the story far more focused on discussion and logical thinking over hotheaded action (though there's a bit of that too).

  There's definitely a few issues, the main being some weak characterizations and world building, but both of these aspects improve the more we read. The story is also pretty slow-paced, but right now its sitting 200k+ words, so there's plenty to read and encompasses several narrative arcs.

  [Virtuous Sons: A Greco Roman Xianxia](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia) — A much newer story at only ~60k, but with daily updates. Someone suggested it last week and I thought to echo their recommendation. As the title suggests, it's a cultivation story transplanted to ancient Greece (technically it seems more like the Hellenistic period, it's not *that* clear). Sects become cults, Elders become Philosophers, the Dao becomes Virtue, Qi becomes Pneuma, etc. It's a clever premise executed with panache, with colorful worldbuilding and vibrant, dynamic characters.

  The premise: Our MC is a powerful Young ~~Master~~, ahem, *Aristocrat*, heir to the cult of the Rosy Dawn, yet he finds himself bored and failing to advance. This all changes when he meets a Roman slave, and he starts to question limits of his life. Not super-duper rational, but definitely well-written and intelligent.
  ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    Are they actually greeks and romans or just inspired on the period and setting? I thought it was inspired but then you said he meets a Roman slave, so I'm confused..

    &#x200B;

    I read bystander until chapter 21, it didn't hook me at all. Idk the magic is supposed to be hard, but the power differences between characters is too high and strangely done. The really powerful people can do whatever they feel like, at least it feels that way. It bothers me to have a grounded setting where a person can win a 1v20 match by only defending. 

    &#x200B;

    Also kind of strange how the world is grounded but I'm supposed to believe college kids are somehow better fighters and more capable than trained soldiers, sure in general fantasy that flies, because power levels appear different but there with the power differences displayed it's bothersome. These people are supposed to be generic humans that can use magic, kind of like harry potter wizards, but somehow they can do computer level calculations in combat, very strange.
    ```

    - u/Luonnoliehre:
      ```
      In Virtuous Sons it's some sort of AU where >!Rome has been razed by demonic forces!<.

      In Bystander, the magic system continues to expand to the point that we can start to understand how some people have almost unimaginable power and control, calculations giving way to more intuitive forms of knowledge. And I definitely don't think the students are better fighters than soldiers. Later on we see Empire agents who are way more capable at magic combat than any of the students. But if it didn't grab you after 20 chapters it's maybe not for you. It gets better but mostly it manages to keep the intrigue and interest at similar levels, which is a feat in itself imo.
      ```

      - u/ricree:
        ```
        If I understand correctly, it's an AU where >!Carthage won the final Punic War and razed Rome afterwards!<.
        ```

        - u/steelong:
          ```
          It looks more like >!Rome razed Carthage, but demons rose from the ashes and razed Rome.!<
          ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      It's been a whlie, so I don't remember exactly how far I got, but I remember that my primary complaint was that the restrictions on what the prophecy could/could not do seemed completely arbitrary and plot-requirement-y. Additionally, the main character seemed completely passive. The plot progressed on it's own and the MC was just reacting with no agency of his own. Maybe that changed later, but I couldn't make it that far.
      ```

      - u/WildFowl82:
        ```
        > Just a Bystander

        > the main character seemed completely passive ... no agency of his own

        Hmmm
        ```

        - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
          ```
          Yeah, the title really should have been a give away. But I'm very confused as to why anyone would think that this was a good thing. The idea of putting it in the title that your MC isn't going to do anything that matters at all...is a choice I guess.
          ```

          - u/Luonnoliehre:
            ```
            I feel like the title is more than a bit misleading, he is really not a bystander at all, the whole point being >!that the MC is not affected directly by the prophecy, meaning he can act against it!<.

            It is also true that for a good portion of the story, pretty much no one has any idea what is going on, so it's difficult for the MC to be particularly active. Things *do* sort themselves out eventually though.
            ```

  - u/grim_miss:
    ```
    Just a bystander was a reasonably fun read but I eventually quit because two things bothered me:

    1. The premise and title of "just a bystander" is that the main character isn't the chosen one. I love stories that are about the standard human with no special powers, the person who isn't chosen by fate and yet still works to make the world better, etc. This is not that. The main character is special because he is uniquely unaffected by the prophecy, which for narrative purposes just makes him the chosen one of a different sort. 

    2. Ok, we can agree that magic used to control people's minds is evil, right? This story theoretically agrees with that but it's evil in a way that just adds spice and melodramatic weight to main characters' decisions to control people's minds. This is probably just a me thing, but while I can enjoy characters angsting over killing people mind control apparently crosses the line for me. I eventually had to stop when it looked like the most sympathetic character thus far was going to start modifying people's memories so they would do what he wanted (much worse in my eyes than a temporary compulsion).

    The author is actually exploring reasonably interesting themes around free will with both the mind control and person outside prophecy bits, so if you share the author's opinions on free will and not mine you have a good chance of enjoying it.
    ```

    - u/Luonnoliehre:
      ```
      1. I definitely agree the title is not at all accurate. Caden is "just" a bystander for about 1 chapter. After that he quickly becomes deeply involved in events outside his control

      2. Having read all 100 chapters of this story, I'm honestly not quite sure what you're talking about. Are you talking about Caden? Ambrose? Jerric? >!Are you implying that the Fateweavers and the prophecy is a form of mind control?!<. I might've have just forgotten something important, but I just wanted to let you know that none of the main characters have yet to use mind control to get what they want, (but again, maybe I have forgotten it/didn't consider what happened mind control).
      ```

  Got around to trying out The Last Sovereign after seeing it recommended here and am extremely impressed. Just got through Chapter 3 (it's a very long game from what I can tell), and the amount of decisions you make that have long term impacts and consequences is really enjoyable. Certain sections reminded me of certain parts of PGtE in how clever and competent both the protagonist and his enemies act. Kiiiinda wish it didn't have such a strong porn element to it, but the world building is very strong and impressively well thought out (the currency in particular was very cool). Would definitely recommend with the warning of lots of NSFW content

  I started in on ["Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-4-the-gate-of-the-feral)" from a long-past Monday req thread, and it's now my #1 in terms of anticipation. Cannot \*wait\* for the next release, basically every release. I need to know what fresh insanity befalls our heroes next...  


  The premise is simple-ish. Every interior space on the Earth gets flattened, and everyone who's left gets invited to enter a "World Dungeon", which is a LITRPG reality show. One thing I particularly like is that although the characters are mostly concerned (out of necessity) with surviving the blood sport, you get peeks into the wider politics of the galaxy that are reflected (and valuable) within the game. Characters use their abilities in very creative ways, and abilities are very well-defined, with the safeties off (for example: a "hole" spell that cuts when it closes - you, your enemies, whatever!). It also doesn't shy from the insanity of it all; a driving character force in Carl is his rage at what's been done (and being done) to humanity.
  ```

  - u/generalamitt:
    ```
    I've also binged that series recently based on a past req thread. For me, it's started very strong, especially for a litrpg book, but by mid-point of book 2, I found myself skimming.

    The entire web novel-progression fantasy-litrpg 'market', or the typical story you would come across on RoyalRoad, is saturated with horrible, amateur writing. Dungeon crawler Carl is a rare exception. It fulfills the three basic requirements I personally demand, for the story to be considered readable:

    1. The prose is fine. Crisp, flows well, no obvious grammar mistakes. Descriptions are detailed just enough to paint a clear image of a scene.
    2. *Two* main characters have distinct voices in dialogue. Also. well-developed personality, I can see them clearly in my mind. (Notice 'two' is italicized, I'll get back to that later).
    3. Overall tone (and style) is consistent, and works very well for the story. This one is harder to define and probably the most subjective criterion, but If you've read the story,  you probably know what I mean. I'm referring to the weirdness, the dry humor, the casual dark violence, and the amusing narration. Somehow it all fits together very well.

    And for the first book, it's enough. The setting is well-thought-out, in particular, the mechanism behind the system is delved into instead of being thrown in as a plot device. The pacing is good. You really feel for the MC in his tribulation. The apocalypse itself, an event of such huge magnitude, is not simply brushed over to get to the 'stats', like in other stories of this sub-genre, its consequences are actually explored quite well.

    The book failed in what I believe is most important early in a long series, which is investing in its characters. Other than Carl and Donut, almost all characters speak in the same voice and lack enough distinct qualities to be painted in the readers' minds. Who is Brandon? Katia? Imani? hell, even Mordecai, which is arguably the third most important character. I don't *see* them in my mind. I don't know who they are, none of them has a distinct feature to make them unique as a character. Brandon is that black nice guy, Katia is a shy art teacher... we don't learn much about their past. Most of their interactions with Carl and Donut are business-like. No interpersonal drama, no breakdown, or showcase of intense emotions which you would expect in these extreme circumstances.

    This is such a shame because I know for a fact that the author is capable of more than that. Carl and Donut both are well developed and interesting. In a dialogue between those two, it's easy to tell who is speaking without being told, which is always a good sign for competent characterization.

    It didn't bother me in the first book because the setting was just being established. Carl and Donut were more than enough to carry the plot. But by the mid-point of the second book, I'd become clear that the author had no intention to invest in additional and much-needed, well-rounded characters. The story morphed into this boring mystery-type novel, which would have been fine had I been able to care about any of the side characters.  The third book had the same problem and by that point, I was just skipping huge chunks of info dumps regarding the third floor- because I simply stopped caring.

    It seems like the author is planning on writing a long series, maybe 18 books long if they keep with the current pace of one floor per book. Two good characters alone can't carry 18 books that rely on so many different actors.

    &#x200B;

    \-Also, regarding the magic system. This wouldn't break or make the story for me but it's important to mention:

    The system is a bit too random for any attempt of gaming it to be truly satisfying. Characters get random OP loot. There are no established limitations. The MC is a demolition expert, a martial artist, a semi-tank, and also has enough mana points to throw the occasional spell.  None of these skills has been earned by his strategic choices, rather thrust upon him by circumstances and he just went along with it. He throws points into stats arbitrarily- int because he needs a few more points to cast that new OP spell he's gotten, dex because he feels clumsy, str because he wants to punch harder. You get the gist.

    Classes are also random and quite nonsensical. The standard fighter-mage-archer types work because it allows for strategic teamwork and clear limitations for what each character can and cannot do. When you have 400 different classes and races, all with widely varied abilities, it all comes down to what random superpower the author will invent next.
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      I think that's fair criticism all around. I do feel like the side-characters have distinct voices, but you're right that they're faint and mostly silent to start with.

      I'd also say that I buy the randomness of the "magic" system as part of making a good reality show like this. Sane choices don't make for as good tri-vid. Similarly, you're right that it comes down to "what random superpower shows up next", but TBH I find that part of the appeal. The safeties are off on everything, so you can fuck up using your power (dis*arm*ingly so, hey-o!). I also find them to be really exotic forms of hammers, so it's really enjoyable to me to see how things get turned into nails; mostly Protective Shell and Hole.

      Edit: The train level ends with a fair amount more of inter-character stuff, but it's still very much a second fiddle. I don't remember which book that's in tho.

  [Dave Scum](http://rationalreads.com/#/works/238), comedic groundhog's day-style short story.

  From the page: "A man gains the mysterious ability to set save points and rewind time whenever he dies. Shortly afterwards, the planet explodes."

  Found this while browsing rational reads. I'm really annoyed because this is one of the funniest short stories I've ever read, but it seems to only exist as a google doc that just that exact page on rational reads links to (I did some quick searches of the author's frustratingly generic name but I only found two webpages mentioning him; no new info on either of them).

  Recommend me some stories with wise protagonists? Or a story that's about accruing wisdom and understanding. Something similar to [God of Eyes] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26818/god-of-eyes?sorting=newest), which is about an atheist that reincarnates as a local god in a world where gods exist. Most of the story is about him coming to an understanding with his godly power and responsibility. Not too rational, but I tend to prefer stories with more of an emotional bent than pure rationality. 

  Some other stories I've read that are like this:

  * [A Daring Synthesis](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/) - Worm Gamer story where Greg goes from a wisdom score of 2 to high double digits, with the requisite development of his thought process from something you'd see picked off from 4chan into r/sadcringe to a genuinely wise person. Loved it. 

  * Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy. Not really about accruing wisdom, but more like watching a character become wise in some ways while still falling down other mental rabbit holes, and slowly learning about his issues and solving them (sort of). Excellent study of a single character, loved it.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Your description of Farseer reminded me of a book, particularly this phrase. 

    > Excellent study of a single character, loved it.

    Have you read [Blood Song](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13569581-blood-song)? It's a spectacular debut indie novel that came out almost 10 years ago. It blew up on reddit, to the point it even got picked up by penguin. The story itself isn't that similar to farseer, except it's a single POV character study, with a great inner monologue and fresh, inventive worldbuilding.

    The only caveat is that the sequels are increasingly disappointing, but the first book is so good IMO it's worth it.
    ```

    - u/GlimmervoidG:
      ```
      The squeals got hit badly by the Bildungsroman curse. The first book was all about the main characters journey to adulthood. It was fantastic - interesting person does interesting things. But at the start of book 2, he is an adult. As a result, the entire narrative structure had to change and it grew a somewhat boring fantasy plot of compensate.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        It's weird. I've never seen such a stark difference in quality as in the first and third book of Raven's Shadow. I even read this author's new trilogy and as cool as the premise is(steampunk + cutthroat capitalism + dragons) it still feels generic somehow, to the point of being mostly forgettable. I read it a few years ago and couldn't tell you a single plot point or character name. 

        Meanwhile blood song was the opposite, generic premise(warrior school coming age story) and filled with cliches(chosen one | secret, unfathomable power | daddy issues) but the execution and little touches of originality made it great.

        So what the hell happened?

  **EDIT:** Another update today, author officially took the story back off its tenative hiatus designation. **EDIT**

  [I Became a [Biologist] in a Fantasy World!](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33378/i-became-a-biologist-in-a-fantasy-world) is a story about a guy getting dragged along with the standard Isekai Hero's summoning, and everyone kind of goes "that wasn't supposed to happen, I guess we'll send you off with some cash as an apology about the whole trans-dimensional kidnapping thing." And so the hero goes to do hero things while the protagonist, wielding the previously unknown LitRPG class of Biologist, goes and sets up a lab in the countryside to plumb the deoths of magic. Or more correctly, work out how magic actually does things on a greater level than people throwing up their hands to say "a wizard did it" since a society based on wielding fantastic powers with little obvious overlap with physiology, biology, and everything else science-y doesn't have much incentive to push past the barriers of understanding that seem like a really inefficient way to spend time.

  So the story is fairly munchkin-adjacent, in that its about pulling apart magic to see what happens, but less about abusing it for incredible power, and more about the drive to understand. The author is studying immunology and doesn't hold back on the science, but it all goes over my head too much to fully appreciate that aspect myself (or really know if he's actually using the right terminology at all).

  Anyway, major caveat of who knows what its update schedule will look like. I found it recommend here ~9 months ago, the author put out almost a dozen decent length chapters for an interesting premises with solid execution over a couple of weeks before suddenly vanishing. They came back a week ago and dropped three more chapters though, and kinda just said "whatever happens, happens" about updates, but the work is pretty interesting and unique as a whole, so in the rec thread it goes.

  ```
  Recommending [The Featherlight Transmission](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34670/); a detective story set in a cyberpunk fantasy land. Book one is complete. No announcement for two has yet been made (on royalroad at least) though the author expressed an interest.

  A world where humans have trumped over other races with the power of science and technology, which combined with their history has led to an extreme prejudice against magic & mages, serves as the backdrop to the murder mystery. Did I mention our MC, Baulric, is a mage? Yeah, there's that too. You get to know him and the city where the story takes place quite well from oodles of internal monologues and worldbuilding bones thrown your way. I've never read any detective stuff so I can't really judge the detective-ness but eagle-eyed readers should figure out the mystery. The writing is high quality and the pace is slower than standard RR stuff. Don't expect much action though. There are literally >!three!< combat encounters throughout the book.

  I personally find the ending to be unsatisfactory upon reflection. It did the bare bones -- wrapping its main plot point -- but left lots and lots more unresolved, which leaves the book begging for a sequel. Despite that, I do think it's a worthwhile story to read.

  Last week, the [Special Edition Version of Enderal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/976620/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories_Special_Edition/) released on Steam. I haven't gotten around to playing it yet (I played the game through when it was still installed on top of Skyrim), but I'm not actually here to discuss the game.  
  What I'd actually like to recommend is the spinoff story [**Dreams of the Dying**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/955650/Dreams_of_the_Dying_Enderal_Novels_Book_I/), a novel by Enderal's lead writer. 

  It's based off of, but doesn't require knowledge of, the setting of Enderal. It follows Jespar Dal'varek, a companion character from the books, if his life had taken a different direction. The main plot follows a brewing civil war in a society shaped by systematic inequality, the examination of which is one of the story's core themes. Next to the usual fantasy magic, this story features a take on "dream magic" that reminds me of Inception, which might be of interest to people here. The reason why I'm recommending the novel here, though, is its deep exploration and novel takes on mental illness. Jespar himself is suffering from PTSD-induced nightmares and hallucinations which drive him to drink and whore. He has a pretty cynical outlook on life, which is explored and challenged in many dialogues with his companions and even enemies. In the end, >!he is *not* cured of his illness by some magic or the correct combination of words, but he finds the resolve to keep trying to be better instead of just accepting life with his illness as "all right".!< Which is probably the most accurate, true-to-life representation of the issue I've seen in media outside of Ward.

  Additional points of potential interest:

  * The central plot mystery isn't *that* great of a twist, but it makes sense in retrospect.

  * Jespar is bisexual and has side-plot romances with both a woman and a man (at separate times, not all at once). I know someone has been asking for m/m romance in the recommendation threads for ages now.

  * The story is significantly darker than your average fantasy story, like Enderal itself was to Skyrim.

  * There's several worldbuilding mysteries, which, if you're interested, you can find the answers to in the main game.

  * An audiobook version, both in German and in English, is in the works.

  * The ebook is free if you have Enderal on Steam, which is free if you own Skyrim, but you can also buy it [on Amazon](https://smile.amazon.de/s?k=Dreams+of+the+Dying+%28Enderal+Book+1%29&rh=n%3A530484031&_encoding=UTF8&ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_8619867952) to support the writer.

  I finally got around to reading [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original-complete.5465/reader) (NSFW) (note: making and logging into an account on this website is required to view it).

  As far as I'm aware, it's the record holder for best and densest pileup of multiverses, metafiction, metaphysics, postmodernism, and that sort of thing. If you enjoy that, you'll probably have a great time here, as it's nearly 50% that by volume. The other 50% is smut. If you enjoy smut, it's well-written smut that I still enjoyed reading even when it was out of my particular lane. If you don't enjoy smut, you probably won't enjoy The Erogamer even if you're a huge fan of the metastuff half.

  The prose starts out great, though dips off a bit near the end. Characterization is solid enough, and the main characters have serviceable character arcs. It's often extremely funny (like shout out loud into an empty room funny). It also has some very amusing instances of existential horror. All of this fits into the roughly 50% meta, 50% smut figure I gave earlier. Like I'm pretty sure *all* the character growth happened simultaneously with at least one of sexual shenanigans or metaversal shenanigans.

    I loved it, but just a warning to everyone that it ended a bit abruptly. The author still took the time to bring it to a close, but not all story lines are seen through to the end and it feels abrupt.

    Still highly recommended, and not for the smut. Good writing.
    ```

  - u/jiffyjuff:
    ```
    I don't enjoy smut, and I rate The Erogamer as one of my favorite stories of all time. It's great for all of the reasons you mentioned, but I'll also add that meta aside, it's just generally good at being rational(ist). The protagonist systematically tests and examines the consequences of her inexplicable erotic powers, and tries to reconcile fundamental conflicts in her gamified experience of reality, the physical nature of reality as described by humanity's body of scientific knowledge, and other ordered frameworks of understanding adjacent to those systems. She plans for the far future even as she works towards mid-term goals. She *does science.* She seeks ways to leverage being an erogame protagonist into real good for the world.

    I also feel that Groon is also able to have his characters opine on modern political subjects without making them mouthpieces for the author's beliefs with incoherent strawmen on the other side. The characters react to events and make plans which are true to their unique values, and those values meaningfully relate to the characters' past experiences and identity.

  Two stories I feel are genuinely good, not just readable.

  [Vigor Mortis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis) has been recommended here before, but I've just now gotten around to reading it. It's just... really good. The qualities that might recommend it to this subreddit are:

  * It takes its premise seriously. The protagonist is a poor, starving street rat orphan. But rather than just being a convenient background to avoid family being in the way, it has major implications. Her growth is stunted due to malnourishment. The way she sees things is quite drastically different from other characters. The things she cares about are clearly influenced by her background. Overall it's just good writing, with a well done character.

  * *In addition* to that, the author has managed to create a character that appeals to what the RR audience typically likes - the power hungry True Neutral with occasional flashes of Chaotic Good. Quite often stories with "good characters" put me off because they forget about things like worldbuilding or consistently progressing the plot, failures which Vigor Mortis avoids.

  * The final point is that the implications of the elements that the author introduces are extrapolated logically, so you get that genuine weirdness where things make sense in context but also make you ask "How the fuck did we end up here?" once you step back.

  E: [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/mfq6cq/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gsov7ls/) the recommendation by /u/Dragongeek in a previous thread.

  ***

  The other story, with a slightly less strong recommendation is [The Last Physicist - Dominic Stal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57699481-the-last-physicist). I haven't read the whole thing, but it has a lot of elements that I think would appeal to people here. It's essentially the standard isekai litrpg (think Azarinth Healer, but, like, not terribly written and with a plot), but it's rationalised uncommonly well and is clearly written by someone who knows what they're talking about wrt science. Even if the actual events/world are complete fantasy (including the "real" world - aligned ASIs in widespread use by 2040 and the world looks basically the same but with more trillionaires? *Maybe* not technically impossible?) the elements that are included I think will appeal to the /r/rational audience.

  However, I've only read a few chapters, so I can't vouch that it remains decent. I'm hopeful though.

    Adding my voice to the Vigor Mortis recommendation. Its interesting how the story has some particularly bizarre plot progression points and world building, but it all slots together effortlessly.
    ```

    - u/123whyme:
      ```
      Alright im just gonna come along and give an anti-rec to balance it out, cause i dropped it. Its initial start is very good, with an interesting magic system as well intriguing world building.

      My dislike with it comes from how the author bludgeons you with their writing, as well as some things that explicitly don't slot together in the plot. The author loves mixing and matching personality traits in its main character, to the extent that one second she'll be a cutesy poor orphan who loves her teddy and the next she'll be some independent badass who takes no shit. As well as this almost every "consequence"  from her background, comes across as incredibly surface level and seems only to be there to gather sympathy points from both the reader and side characters. The main character just doesn't seem to have consistent or realistic characterisation at all, which is unfortunate as the other characters are pretty decent from what we've seen, other than a weirdly happy interpretation of what being a street rat is like - except for right at the start.

      The big ol plot hole that annoyed me is >!how the slimes that can take over anyone, regardless of level instantly and then can make them kill themselves or others, haven't taken over the world yet. Oh and they're also essentially completely invisible and can reproduce in a week.!<

      Anyway, rant over.

        I don't see the problem? These aren't mutually exclusive - people are large, they contain multitudes. If anything, "badass who's really sad and lonely on the inside" is a pretty standard trope.

        > spoiler

        >! The slimes are currently in the process of slowly taking over the world, but clearly there exist people like Gladra who can destroy huge swathes of them at a time, and, based on the effect her soul has on Vita, could likely defend herself from possession.

          Yeah true, people can be multifaceted. I didn't want to go into it too much but she's also quick to trust, easily upset and extremely caring. Which would be fine, but we're also meant to believe she spent 15 years of her life on the edge of starvation in extreme poverty. Its like the author is treating poverty and starvation as some kind of challenge to be overcome, that you come out the other side a better person.

          Essentially my problem with it, is that a hundred little things pinged on my 'thats not really how people or life works' radar and eventually my suspension of disbelief was suspended.

          >!I stopped reading before Gladra came about, but thats not a very persuasive argument. Still one person, she cant be every where at once, whereas the slimes can instantly mind control about 99% of the population and can spread exponentially. It would be like trying to stop an epidemic except no one can tell if you're infected and everyone infected try to undermine society and take over the world.!<

            All of those things have important qualifiers that you don't mention. Plus, again, none of those things are a problem with her personality or unrealistic. Where are you getting your ideas about what is realistic or not?

            To elaborate, she is "quick to trust" only in the way that she is keenly aware that people might betray her, but really wants to give them the benefit of the doubt because she's been alone for 15 years. "Easily upset" she's literally going through puberty. "Extremely caring" - I'm not sure where you get this; she gives food to the other orphans, but I got the feeling that it's just something she takes for granted that you do, if you can. Is it not reasonable that someone who had spent a long time starving would then act to prevent their own from starving when she gets the power to do so?

            And in most other ways she's pretty ruthless. It's a completely believable outlook - if you're one of her (extended) family, she's caring and generous. If not, she's fantasising about >!killing you and eating your soul!<.

            >is that a hundred little things pinged on my 'thats not really how people or life works' radar and eventually my suspension of disbelief was suspended.

You could theoretically use that poison to keep the heaviest hittest always checked for slimes, but spreading that knowledge out would also get rid of a tool against smaller slime outbreaks since the slimes get all of their host's knowledge. These tools do get less useful if they're widespread knowledge, and the main character being a street orphan is a good reason to not know these from the start.!<

                That said, these get explained much later once the authorities get involved, so seeing the situation as more doomed than it is is 100% understandable.

  - u/TridentTine:
    ```
    Alright, have now finished The Last Physicist. It's definitely pretty good. Although there is one part at the end that doesn't quite make sense, but it's overlookable. I would say it's on the better end of "junk food" reading. Very readable, every chapter was interesting and kept you wanting to read more. Char is OP but there is A LOT of scope for further improvement, and the enemies are comparable. I will be reading the sequel when it comes out, at any rate.

    Unfortunately where it fails a bit is on the rational side - the rules aren't clearly explained and the MC kinda just keeps pulling things out. However, the idea of discovery and experimentation is emphasised in the book (although little is actually shown; which is fine for a non-rational-focused book as actual experimentation is pretty boring), and that sort of precludes having clearly explained rules, since no one actually knows what the rules are.

    Uncommonly realistic elements are probably the protagonist's reaction to his situation - it shows the influence of emotions, including deeply negative ones, without getting too bogged down in ennui or angst and becoming a slog. I didn't love the character overall, but I think it works and some development happened.

    Overall it's a progression fantasy with LitRPG elements that is well written (though with a few grammatical/spelling errors), well paced, and decently plotted, which puts it near the top of its class. It's still essentially a popcorn thriller book, but at least it succeeds at it.

  To those who have read more than one, how would you rank Wildbow's works (Worm, Ward, Pact, Pale, Twig) against one another? Do any fall below a threshold where they aren't worth the generally large time investment involved with ridiculous word counts?

  I've read Worm and a bit of Ward, but haven't touched the others.
  ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    Unfortunately I'd personally recommend against subjecting yourself to Pact. An amazing premise and world that is ruined by illogical actions, bizarre pacing (essential no pause in nonstop actuion for hundreds of thousands of words), and a weird combination of misery attraction and plot armor for the main character. Anyone who has that much bad stuff happen to them in sequence, and behaves that stupidly, should just keel over. But yeah, amazing premise, well-designed magic system, and some good side characterizations, so a total waste.

    I'd also counter Ward. It's just really slow, repetitive, and boring, and I like slow and boring things, often. If you'd like to read about a superhero with boring powers (in a world of superheroes with interesting powers) who sits in therapy for tens of thousdands of words, go for it. Apparently it gets a bit better pretty far in before getting worse again, if I recall. (Dropped it a few arcs in.)

    Twig is supposed to be good, though I haven't read it. Holding off on Pale until it finishes.

        ManMagnificent's **[Familiar](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/familiar-pact-worm.629776/)** is a great little Pact/Worm crossover.

Stuff like Skidmark being a Goblin King, the Protectorate being a North American Practitioner organization, and Coil having Awakened Taylor to help him in his bid for Lordship of the city.

    ```
    A bit late, but here’s my take: 

    worm = pale* > twig? >> ward > pact

    Pale: 

    An important caveat is that while I think pale is worm’s equal so far, one of worm’s best strengths is how solidly it stuck the ending, and pale isn’t finished yet. Still, Pale was the first Wildbow work since worm where I’ve felt hooked with the *need* to continue reading. For the rest, I’ll refer to my comment [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/hz4e3o/pale_is_my_favorite_wb_story/fzhqgt4/). 

    Pact:

    As others have said, it has some bad pacing issues. Unlike others, I actually stuck with it until the middle of the last arc, where I realized I was just pushing myself through it without really enjoying it, and had been for the past few arcs. Mindful of the planning fallacy, I stopped. 

    Twig: 

    I only read about 5 arcs, but what was there was good. With Worm, I was bored and didn’t feel like reading on at the start of almost every interlude, but after pushing myself through that feeling, I never regretted it once. That earned Wildbow a certain level of trust, but that trust mostly went away with pact. So, when life got in the way and I stopped reading for a week, I didn’t pick it back up. Now, I’m waiting for the audiobook to finish, but they put out an arc every 5 months-ish, so I’ll be waiting for a while. 

    Ward:

    I agree with a lot of the things said here, but I’ll counter u/Amonwilde’s counter by saying I didn’t think it went far *enough* with the therapy part. After the first few arcs, Wildbow listened to the complaints that the story was moving too slowly, and quickly moved into the action parts, and at the end of the story he acknowledged and I agreed that that was mostly a mistake. After the start, the therapy aspect mostly faded into the background. After reading Cierra’s therapy-epilogue in worm, I thought “I would read an entire Wildbow story that is just this but longer,” and I think it’s a shame Ward wasn’t that. 

    After the beginning, it was: fight for an arc or two, a tension-releasing hangout at the start of the next arc, repeat until the book ends. And there’s the issue that Ward’s protagonist just had a more boring power than Taylor did. She used it creatively in parts, but I think there was an upper limit of how interesting you can make a >!flying brick!<. 

    I probably would have dropped Ward at some point if I wasn’t enjoying the [We’ve got Ward](https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-ward/) podcast alongside it. (and their close reading meant that I didn’t have to worry too much about skimming parts I found boring, which was probably a bad habit to pick up.) Still, with even the author acknowledging some major structural problems, and Scott and Matt almost never saying anything bad about the book, there was a disconnect between their experience and mine. 

    That said, it did do emotional moments better than worm, and the >!Victoria and Lisa form a buddy cop duo!< arc was *amazing*.
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      Honestly there were good parts in what I read as well, and as usual there were characters with interesting powers and some strong interludes. WB is really all over the place, unfortunately, and the newish habit of taking on board reader feedback is a serious problem. WB should take on some reader feedback to not read reader feedback, and especially those podcasts, which are fine, but create kind of a creepy closed circle which is more WB's fault.

      Thanks for the analysis, glad Pale is coming along well.

    Worm seems like the product of a lifetime, just amazing. Pact is the opposite, a classic sophomore slump. Twig is the renewed passion project.

      ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    Subjective rankings: *Pale* = *Twig* > *Worm* > *Pact*. Haven't read *Ward*.

    *Twig* has the best cast of characters, the *most* interesting cast of characters I've seen in all of fiction, combined with a fairly unique biopunk setting. *Pale* is just excellently done at every level (characters, plot, narrative structure, pacing...), and has the best urban fantasy setting and magic system I've ever seen. *Worm* is the best superhero story I've ever read, but that's not saying much, since I kind of hate superhero stories; it has fascinating worldbuilding and interesting characters, but some of the execution is clunky. *Pact*'s combination of fast pace and ultimate-underdog plot results in a very oppressing/stressful reading experience, and also it doesn't do a very good job showcasing its amazing setting.

    Popular rankings: *Worm* > *Pale* > *Twig* >> *Pact*.

    The primary differences between the popular and my opinions are 1) virtually no-one has read *Twig*, 2) of those who read *Twig*, not everyone is as enamoured with the Lambs as I am, 3) most superhero story fans actually like superhero stories.

    I recommend *Twig* and *Pale*, obviously. You might want to read *Pact* after *Pale* if you like the setting enough.

    I feel better off for having read every one of Wildbow's stories, even the short ones he occasionally contributes on /r/DoTheWriteThing or his unfinished Goblin romance story [Poke](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bPsZs1iPqHAcsJr4N7UgW-W7Ne4OCTtUjfvcxIoBmdI/edit). Ranking them is kinda difficult, because they each do something different very well. 

    Worm has probably the best fight scenes/"combat encounters". Ward is the one with the most engaging emotional scenes. Twig has the most fascinating main character and best interactions with their supporting cast. The Otherverse stories have the most creative magic system I've ever seen, and Pale especially has the best main characters.

    I really hate Wildbow because amazing premises are ruined by an obsession with misery. Maybe 15 years ago I would have been more into that stuff. I did like Worm a bit. Especially early on. I didn't read more than a few chapters of Pact because it was obvious early on what was gonna happen. I read all of Ward. I regret it. I really liked Twig. I think I would have liked the original story of that world more but Sylvester is an okay protagonist. Even Wildbow's potential prompts that people voted on would be amazing if he wasn't so obsessed with misery. I quit out of Pale for similar reasons. I also think Wildbow doesn't satisfactorily justify all the dumb decisions his characters make that help to push his obsession with suffering.

    So Worm is the best. Twig is second best. Probably go Pale/Pact/Ward after that although I might put them all on the same tier. I would maybe put Boil/Face/Peer above the last 3. Stories that Wildbow never actually wrote but the first couple chapters were good.

    Wildbow I would say is the Megan Lindholm of web serials. Only read it if you want to suffer.
    ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    One that hasn't been mentioned in the other comments here is Wildbow's **[PRT Quest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18xcEYRK0Ts-k6--ZOuDFh-ILK9hLzcgkDTIf6L_G90s/mobilebasic)**, where questers took the role of a new PRT director in Anchorage.

    I only bring it up for completeness' sake, as it definitely falls below the threshold of being worth the time investment unless you *really* like digging in for nuggets of worldbuilding.

    Other than that, I actually really like Ward. It's a much more hopeful story than Worm, in part because the reader's experience isn't filtered through the depressive socially-stunted lens that was Taylor Hebert's POV as primary protagonist. It's got its own issues, but none I feel that drag the work into being a slog.

    Pact I really like the world, but it's very claustrophobic as a story. I'm waiting on Pale to finish up and I'm looking forward to it as a second try on a good foundation.

    Some advised against Pact and Ward. I haven't finished Ward; I somewhat enjoyed the first few arcs, but it didn't captivate me enough for me to follow it. I have read Pact and Twig, and I liked both, but Twig more than pact. So I concur with the general ranking of

    >Worm > Twig > Pact

  I've been watching some space TV recently.

  **The Expanse**

  Most recently watched: *Season 4, Episode 1*

  A show set in the somewhat distant future, where humanity has become a space-faring civilization on Mars, the Moon, and the asteroid belts.

  The start of the first season built a very compelling and believable world. There were a lot of touches that showed the series cared a lot about the physics and setting of outer space, and embraced its quirks, albeit in the exaggerated, filmic, and slightly imperfect way that TV does. The character motivations, by and large, make a lot of sense; there are a lot of perspectives, and no cartoon villains.

  Unfortunately for me, though it seems to have worked for a lot of people, the end of the first season marked a transition away from the careful worldbuilding, and so the wonder of the setting took a backseat and the science started getting sloppy. The characters were mostly still well-motivated, though not without the occasional irrational ass-pull; here ‘irrational’ meaning ‘no real person would do that’, not just that it wasn't smart.

  Overall a really good series. The first season was my personal favourite so far, though most others seem to have liked the transition to a more on-boarded cast doing more action-adventure-y things in the later seasons.

  **For All Mankind**

  Most recently watched: *Season 1, Episode 10*

  Set in an alternate history where the space race never ended. As someone else put it, this is really a drama which lures you in with cool rockets. Most of the plot so far doesn't actually need the rockets. But yet, I'm still watching and enjoying.

  The show starts slightly diverged from real history and goes from there. Both are the human and technical history of NASA and the space race are respected quite well, and the introduced drama is impactful.

  Physics wise, there have been some great moments, and I'd say it's easily better than most shows and movies. OTOH, while it is fine for a TV show to have physics errors, and most of the errors are very small in the scheme of things, there is occasionally an issue that seems gratuitous, less ‘we made an error, or fudged in the name of drama’, but ‘we can't trust our audience to understand that *space is hard*, when the truth would have otherwise served just as well’. Normally this would be less bothersome, but the show is ‘hard science alternate history’, so small issues hurt much more than they would in a fantasy sci-fi show.

  A bigger issue than the technical stuff, which is mostly pretty good, is that this is fundamentally still a TV drama. As such, they are swimming in idiot balls. A lot of people in this show are painfully incompetent, despite their real life counterparts at the time being the literal best of the best. The bureaucratic idiocy I can buy, there is a lot of criticism to be levelled at modern-day NASA for that. However, the way that the organization is portrayed in missions feels almost insulting.

  Overall a very good series, especially if you like the history of spaceflight, and would like to see what might have been. The drama is cliché at times, but compelling.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Definitely seconding The Expanse. The quality drops a slight bit each season, but in my opinion it is still worth watching in the fourth season.

    For All Mankind is great, though mostly interpersonal drama focused. It also loses its tenuous touch woth reality quite a bit after the time skip.

  Can anybody recommend any rational (or very good) works about local governance and politics? After watching The Wire, The Thick of It, Yes Minister, House of Cards and Parks and Rec, and reading some spy novels, unable to find much more in the way of fiction that's good, I've tried reading a few biographies but the things I'm finding are a bit self-absorbed and written with hindsight.
  ```

  - u/smallcool:
    ```
    Off the top of my head, here's a few series/movies that I've seen and enjoyed that have a substantial political/bureaucratic element to them.
    I can't really comment on how rational they are (since it's been a while since I've seen some of them), but most of them have bureaucratic ineptitude but they're all pretty well critically reviewed.

    **Shin Godzilla**

    My favourite Godzilla movie. It's very different from any other Godzilla movie I've seen before, since it mainly focuses on the political/bureaucratic aspect of how the Japanese government handles Godzilla. The first half of the movie is just filled with civil servants talking in circles, trying not to risk their jobs on doing anything. It's heavily inspired by the Japanese's government response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster/earthquake/tsunami.

    The music/cinematography/comedy are all much better than most movies I've seen as well.

    Be aware that it's a Japanese movie, so you'll probably need to read subtitles, and this movie is mostly conversations and discussions, so you're going to read a lot of them. But it's my favourite work on this list.

    **Chernobyl (2019)**

    Chernobyl has an absolutely gruesome, horrifying, and nightmarish first episode, with the rest of it about the cleanup of the Chernobyl disaster, and it's semi-realistic with Soviet bureaucracy/politics. One of the best pieces of TV I've ever seen before, but I found it more terrifying than most horror movies (especially when you consider it's all mostly true).

    **Eye in the Sky**

    Essentially, British/American politicians/military officers/lawyers/intelligence agents argue for an entire movie on whether they can legally and ethically perform a drone strike. Pretty much just talking, but I found it extremely engrossing.

    **Bodyguard (2018)**

    This one isn't as bureaucratic as the other ones (it's more action-y/police-y), and I didn't like it as much as the other ones, but it's still pretty good.

    A police sergeant gets promoted to be the bodyguard of the home secretary (roughly equivalent to the US's secretary of homeland security). However, the home secretary is a very "Frank Underwood" character, willing to enact controversial legislation, and fan up the threat of terrorism to support her political career.

    **Other works that I haven't seen yet**

    I haven't had a chance to watch these yet, so I can't fully recommend them, but try looking at these:

    - Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
    - The West Wing
    - The Newsroom
    - Miss Sloane
    ```

    - u/ADotSapiens:
      ```
      Those are some good recs, if only I hadn't seen all of them already :(

      I personally would derec The West Wing, The Newsroom and Bodyguard as too unrealistic in character behavior, plot timelines and worldbuilding but many people consider them to be great political fiction.

      **Shin Godzilla, Chernobyl and Dr. Strangelove** get extra recs from me, if anybody here hasn't seen them they ought to.

  Hi! I've recently started writing a rather weird *yugioh/magic: the gathering* fanfic-ish thing. It's called *Card Games in the Bronze Age* and it's a fantasy adventure romance isekai heavily inspired by the 5th season of the Yugioh Duel monsters anime.

  **Summary:**  *A guy from our world finds himself transported to an alternate universe version of Ancient Egypt suspiciously similar to how it was depicted in the Yugioh anime, but also dramatically different. With the power of his trading cards, can he help save this strange world from magical WMDs, evil gods, an insanely OP and vengeful thief, and extreme poverty, then find his way back home?*

  [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13856275/1/Card-Games-in-the-Bronze-Age](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13856275/1/Card-Games-in-the-Bronze-Age)

  I've been putting a TON more research into this than Kazuki Takahashi put into Yugioh. It's as if I've been cramming for a history exam except that I get to choose my own study schedule and don't have to take an actual exam.

  The main pairing is between>! Pharaoh Thutmose V (never existed IRL) and an original male self insert character!<, if you're curious.

  I'm pretty sure this story meets many if not most of the criteria for counting as rational fiction in the sidebar, but I suspect it also breaks the spirit of that criteria. This reads very differently from what you'd ordinarily expect from a rational fic IMO.

  None of the characters are analytical geniuses like HJPEV, but there's a decent amount of character intelligence and a wide variety of different kinds of personalities with various strengths and weaknesses, as well as a significant effort to steelman those characters and their overall perspectives and cultures.

  I do my best to keep the setting fairly consistent, but sometimes I end up making oversights that can be compensated for with further world-building later. Like how I have the Ancient Egyptians calling their nation Egypt and not just Kemet.

  And while there are *some* author tracts, I try to not use too many of those and to not force them to fit where they don't write themselves in naturally. My main priority for writing this is just to have fun and express my thoughts and feelings and let my imagination run free. If people learn something interesting or insightful in the process that's just icing on the cake.

  I'm curious what you think of it. Enjoy!
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    I'm sad to say this because the premise seems pretty firmly in my strike zone, but the writing here seems... flippant, for a lack of a better term. It might just be a matter of personal taste, but seems like you're writing this with the tone of a comedic work, but without a comedic subject matter. A conversational tone can be useful for telling certain types of story, but in my estimation was not the right choice to tell this one.

    I'd also like to point out that long A/Ns, of which you have a few, are a bit of a faux pass. It may seem like you need to explain a lot of things to the readers, but ideally your story should stand on its own. If a reader is able to fully comprehend the story without reference to an explanation you put in the A/N, the explanation is wasted. If they *can't* understand the story without the A/N, then clarifications within the text must be made. A/Ns should be for supplementary information unecessary for the story (for example, if you want to give sources for historical facts, or explain bits of historical cultural minutiae), information about the writing schedule, and if necessary/applicable trigger warnings. consider that most published works will include only, at most, a foreword and an afterword.

    All that being said, don't take these as words of discouragement! I can tell you're enthusiastic about writing,  and the best way to get better at writing is practice. I'm giving this advice because I also made these errors myself, when I first tried my hand at writing fanfiction (and others besides.) Good luck!
    ```

    - u/thereisnojellyworld:
      ```
      The long author's notes are necessary not because the story can't be understood without them, but because either 1. important parts of the story would be so culturally stigmatized that it would harm my reputation for writing it if I didn't include a culturally sensitive disclaimer, 2. to make note of errors that I didn't catch when I first posted a chapter, and 3. to make small clarifying trivia/mechanical notes like why Meretseger, Thief of Sanity could destroy an Arboreal Grazer when a normal Thief of Sanity couldn't. That's not something the average reader needs to understand, but it is something that will help more dedicated magic: the gathering fans to not lose their immersion in the story.

      I will also say that you might be noticing that this story doesn't follow genre conventions for other genres and *also* doesn't follow genre conventions for rational fiction. That means you're probably going into this with expectations that don't match this style of story.

      Does that help?

    I wonder what something like that looks like, considering how high Joon munchkined when he found the right avenues. Are you looking for a more munchkinable setting, or just an op protagonist? Or just a character that is more actively looking for and thinking about rule lawyering?
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I agree that Joon isn't really a munchkin. He munchkins stuff(verb)  occasionally, but he's not *a munchkin*(noun). Being a munchkin isn't just finding exploits and synergies, it's more than that, an attitude, a state of mind. It's like the difference between Adderall and Meth, or Weekend at Bernie's and necromancy. 

      As an in story example, Reimer is definitely a munchkin.
      ```

      - u/yargotkd:
        ```
        That's exactly what I'm looking for, a WtC type of story but with a Reimer type of MC (WtC might do that later, I'm still on chapter 102).
        ```

        - u/GlueBoy:
          ```
          Spoiler alert: He doesn't. I love it, but it's just not that kind of story. 

          I've got some recs, I'll post it in reply to your top level post for more visibility.

            - u/GlueBoy:
              ```
              I'm not saying there's no munchkinning, just that Joon isn't one. Joon is a worldbuilder archetype. He thinks in terms of creating systems, not exploiting systems. 

              Amaryllis is more of a munchkin then he is, but her munchkinning tends to happen offscreen.
              ```

              - u/Tenoke:
                ```
                Yeah but Its pretty hard to look at the last 100 chapters and not consider what they as a group are doing as munchking though. Everything that can be abused is abused systematically, it's just that the setting doesn't allow you to go too crazy without risk and that it's not what Joon would do if he didn't have to.
                ```

                - u/GlueBoy:
                  ```
                  True.
                  ```

    - u/yargotkd:
      ```
      I'm only 102 chapters into WtC, so maybe Joon gets more into munchkin than what he is doing now for me. I feel like Amaryllis does it way more, I think that in the beginning Joon made an effort to not treat things too much like a game not to upset the DM. I'm not sure if I'm looking for an OP protagonist, just someone who tries to break the game more often even if that comes to bite them back, like in the first arc Joon decided not to farm the zombies because if he was a DM who made this game he would be upset if a player did that, I want a MC that wouldn't care much about what the DM would think and decided to farm the zombies instead. Like, what would have happened if Reimer had taken Joon's place, since he was known to try and break/munchkin everything Joon threw at him as a DM.
      ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    The first thing to come mind is **HPMOR**, but everyone here either already read it, hates it, or both. 

    After that its the rat!fic **Luminosity** and its sequel **Radiance**. Bella is definitely a munchkin trying to optimize the setting. 

    Another MC that has the munchkin mentality is Miles in the **Vorkosigan Saga**,  but it's a bit different as the setting is scifi space opera, so no game/magic system to munchkin. Still great, Miles is an MC who's always thinking and planning, all his victories are about outsmarting his opponents. Highly recommended. Start with *The Vor Game* if you do decide to dive in. 


    Some others that I've liked:

    * Lighting Up the Dark - Naruto rat!fic
    * Harry Potter and the Natural 20 - Another HP rat!fic
    * Daniel Black series - it has a bunch of caveats(it's erotica for men, for starters) but nevertheless some great munchkining. 
    * A Drop of Poison - I barely remember this naruto fanfic but it left a good impression
    * Apocalypse: Generic System
    * Wake of the Ravager - by the same author as ^
    * I Became a [Biologist] in a Fantasy World!
    * World of Prime series - borderline, but in the final book there's definitely  an Ur-munchkin and the journey there is worth it IMO. 


    Stuff that I would not normally recommend except the MC is a munchkin:

    * Completionist Chronicles series
    * Reality Benders series
    * Shadeslinger

  So I'm about 25% of the way through Lord of the Mysteries, and it's pretty decent, but it's a massive time investment that could be spent reading other content. Is it worth continuing if I'm feeling like this? Does it have a satisfying payoff?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I love that story so much; it's definitely in the top 5 fantasy stories for me.

    The final conclusion is sensible, so it at least doesn't ruin the previous chapters. I personally liked the ending. However I wouldn't recommend thinking of a 1000-chapter+ story like that. What's more important than the ending is the conclusion of each arc, consistent characterization, and good plot/worldbuilding. This story excels on all 3.

    I'm not sure where 25% falls, but if you read the first major climax and enjoyed it then it only gets better as I'd rate that among the weakest arcs.
    ```

  - u/meangreenking:
    ```
    By the time you get to the 25% mark you probably know if you are going to like it or not. So if it doesn't feel like a good enough read to continue reading it then just drop it.

    There are numerous satisfying payoffs during the whole thing, but just not really at the end. The ending is pretty weak, but it seems pretty questionable to be reading a multi-million word work just for the ending.

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    One thing I thought was weird with Lord of the Mysteries is that the magic initially is just esoteric mumbo jumbo from our world, only it works. Like astrology and tarot cards and so on. 

    I understand it gets more sophisticated later, but it's still not something I can stomach, especially because my parents are fully on board that shit and I grew up with it. I guess I need some level of abstraction between fantastical stuff and real life in order to suspend disbelief.

    Some of the best parts are still ahead. I say read on, and if you want a place to stop before the not-good ending, stop after the arc resoultion that ends in a dance and where the MC gets revenge for something that happened far earlier. The story could have ended there with a few wrap-ups, except in that genre the MC has to achieve the godhead or fans will get mad.

  Want movies for my boyfriend to watch. He's French but he speaks English fluently, but if people happen to know French films so much the better.

  He was watching The Dish and had this complaint: 
  " of course even for an engineering movie based on a true story they had to make up counter-productive lies and people hating each other :'( " and followed up saying he doesn't get to enjoy a movie "about sane people"

  So I made the "/r/rational greatest hits" recommendations:

  - The Martian (he'd seen it, loved it)
  - Apollo 13 (saw it a while ago, thinks he liked it)
  - Moon (he'd seen it, loved it)
  - Timecrimes (he watched the trailer and said time travel isn't his thing so he hasn't watched it)

  I was then struggling to come up with more reccos than that so I went to biopics:

  - The Imitation Game (he'd seen it, didn't say how he felt about it)
  - First Man (Neil Armstrong; he saw it on my recommendation and liked it)
  - A Beautiful Mind (John Nash; he saw it on my recommendation and loved it)

  He told me he liked (I haven't seen these so can't comment if they fit the sub):

  - The Dam Busters
  - The World's Fastest Indian

  Does anyone have more movie recommendations that fit the "characters acting sane" more than the "worldbuilding" part of /r/rational?

  EDIT: of the recommendations posted at the time of this edit, he has seen the following with these comments:

  - Catch me if you can (thinks he loved it)
  - Arrival (loved it)
  - Knives Out (said his brother made him watch it, gave no comment on his opinion)
  - Princess Mononoke (said it was good but too dark for him)
  - Pickpocket (nice that someone suggested it)
  - Blade runner (didn't like, haven't confirmed he's thinking of 2049 or OG)
  - Interstellar (didn't like)

That she succeeded is also according to expectations.

          My episodic memory is pretty bad so it's hard to give a complete answer today without rewatching the film, which I really don't want to do. My fundamental problem with the film is best said [in Yudkowsky's words](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent):

          > Hollywood’s concept of intelligence has nothing to do with cognitive work. Instead it’s a social stereotype. It’s about what ‘intelligent characters’ wear, how they talk, how many of them it takes to change a lightbulb.

          ...except then they put this in a film whose whole premise and plot and all the characters *are about intelligence and what it means*. You can do ‘intelligence is playing chess’ in a film about action and MacGyvering and gotchas because the intelligent guy with the glasses is just a plot device, and it doesn't really matter what the justification is. But it's the whole film in Ex Machina, so what are you left with? The social stereotype of >!an AI box experiment!<? There is no there there.

          Contentless films can be engaging if they're fun, or tense, or a good parody. This was none of those.

    The Man From Earth is just a bunch of intellectuals working through an unexpected premise. There's some strong emotional reactions, but they belong.

    Also, on the off chance he hasn't seen Princess Mononoke, I'd recommend that too. Kind of an odd choice I guess, but it is a movie where the main character handles a high fantasy conflict like an adult.

    With Apollo 13 and Neil Armstrong in the "liked" category, I'd recommend "The Right Stuff". It's a bit historically oriented, but it's pretty good and encapsulates the "feel" of the time period very well.

    *Interstellar* is the obvious recommendation. Really slow beginning and devolves into quantum weirdness at the end, but the middle was a superb mix of science, tragedy and leadership.

    *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy*. Feels like one of the great British classics (much like The Ipcress File, a slow burn until things just happen) for being so recently made, though of course the story its based on is older.

    Don't think I've seen much French films except classic ones, and mostly noir. If you think he won't find classic noirs too cynical and/or criminal, perhaps:

    *Le Samouraï*. Honourable assassin. Its a gun film, not actually about samurai.

    *Pickpocket*. Dostoyevsky-like protagonist.

    *Pépé le Moko*. One of the greatest films ever. A crime boss and jewel thief is cornered in a town which is impenetrable to the police.

      Interstellar has such bad science and bizarre decisions though. Bookshelf-based time travel, really??

        Yeah that was all pretty odd. By the edit above it seems said person didn't like it and I can imagine why. Still, that part when they wake the sleeper was something special.

    Some one-set movies are borderline rational and clever - Sleuth, Circle, Coherence (probably too close to time travel though), Man from Earth, 12 angry men, rope etc.

    The Big Short, maybe?

  Pact has a great premise and world, but (IMO) the story seems to have been executed fairly poorly. Are there any good fanfictions which do better on the story while keeping the best parts of the premise?

    Pale is set in the same world but I think executes a lot better on the story front. It's Wildbow's current work.
    ```

  - u/steelong:
    ```
    Pale is another work by the same author in the same universe.  It's not a sequel either, so knowledge of the plot of the first story isn't necessary. 

    The plot of this one is going to be very different from the last, so this might not be quite what you're looking for.
