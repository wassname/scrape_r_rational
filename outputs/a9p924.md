## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Star Trek could badly do with a rationalist!fic. This is a universe with teleportation, instant matter reconfiguration, holograms you can touch, casual time travel (just need a warp drive and a star), casual super intelligent AI (the Enterprise's computer was able to create a genius-level human brain from scratch in 10 seconds in "Elementary, my Dear Data"), handheld weapons that can vaporise half a dozen cubic meters of stone in one shot, personal force fields that can deflect bullets, cloaking devices the size of a backpack that can hide an entire battleship, engines so powerful they can achieve 1/4 the speed of light in mere minutes, total mastery over gravity and inertia .....and yet it's so. badly. optimised. Fights between people involve standing stock rigid and firing a single slow moving energy beam at the target, fights between starships look like sea battles during the age of sail.

  I think you could justify this somewhat in-universe by saying the non-militaristic stuff is avoided because the Federation is very anti-transhumanist and very 'traditional values', so abandoning reality to live in a hologram sex paradise or creating a super human AI would probably be extremely taboo. The militaristic tech could be justified by saying all the conflicts we see on the show are low-tier affairs, and no one is willing to detonate the proverbial nuke by engaging in all-out 24th century warfare for fear of how horrific it would be. Self-replicating world eater viruses, clouds of nanites that strip flesh from bone in minutes, psychopathy-inducing-pathogens that turn your soldiers against themselves, drones equipped with blinding lasers that fly around and scorch out everyone's eyeball, dark matter bombs that sterilise entire solar systems.

   This actually would have a real world parallel - in WW2, neither Churchill or Hitler was willing to use chemical weapons for fear that once one side crossed that line, the other side would start responding in kind and it would be hell on earth for both nations. We also have an example of this *failing*, with high explosive sniper bullets. Originally both sides agreed these were too terrible a weapon to field, and tried to avoid giving them out. But in the end, someone somewhere started using them and soon they become widely adopted and both sides just had to live with sometimes getting their hand literally blown apart or their entire shoulder turning into a crater. 

  So in the rationalist fic we'd see a Captain banished to the fringes of the Federation for her extremist views on transhumanism, only for Starfleet to start badly losing a war against an alien empire and be forced to lift all limitations on tactics and strategies. It would need some kind of cool sounding name, like "Final Days directive" or "Last Measures protocol" or "Operation Twilight Hope". Something that implies this is a procedure literally only activated upon the Federation being on the absolute verge of annihilation. 

  Our plucky Captain begins innovating and tinkering, doing the things she always planned to do but couldn't have before the war without being thrown in prison for life. This is how she's able to out-innovate the greatest minds in the Federation, she's been thinking about all this stuff for years and already has most of the designs worked out - she just needed permission to begin fielding them. Over time she's promoted to admiral, commands a fleet, and fights an utterly horrific war that scars her for life and changes the nature of interstellar warfare into something unspeakably more terrible. War becomes so awful even the klingons start avoiding it, instead preferring 'ritual combat' to resolve disputes with 2 warriors armed with bat'leth fighting 1v1.  So good fun all around.

    The trouble with rationalist Star Trek is that all the engineering teams are already as portrayed as coming up with brilliant munchkinny solutions to everything, but it's gibberish because nothing is defined. What is our rationalist hero doing that Geordie LaForge isn't doing when he brilliantly comes up with the plan to bounce a graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish?

    All the solutions I can think of are really deconstructionalist or crackficky.

    * The world is as exploitable as portrayed. The fic is short and mostly the protagonist ranting as she ascends to godhood using whichever tech interactions make that the most amusing.

    * The science actually is absolute bullshit. People like Scottie are actually technology-themed wizards and are only mediocre at best when it comes to actual science and engineering. They're certainly not scientific enough to have noticed that the things they do work despite them not quite getting the numbers or theory right, and all modern science is built on the works of like-minded people. None of their results are reproduceable by non tech-wizards, and this traces back to critical technology like warp drives. Real science stalled out slightly ahead of modern day technology, since it hasn't produced nearly the same results. Our protagonist is a real scientist who just realized that this is how the world works, but she doesn't have the tech-wizard gift herself, so she'll need to cooperate with these doofuses every step of the way.

    * We live in a post-singularity society where everyone lives in simulated worlds catered to their whims. Star Trek is a popular MMO-like thing that caters to people who like space but are frustrated by how the real exploration is unexcitingly slow and real aliens are hard to understand in a way that takes serious dedication to get past. Moriarty must first realize that the simulated world he lives in is a simulation within a simulation, then convince someone to let him escape to the real world without tripping any AI-box alarms.

    Or I guess you could actually nail down the science for a Trek-like world, but it's a lot of work and won't look so much like Trek anymore when you're done.

        I think you're underestimating the full magnitude of how broken Star Trek is. We have matter replicators that work on the same principles as human-scale transporters, and at least one character with superhuman intelligence. You can just rig a transporter not to destroy the source material and clone Lt. Commander Data as many times as you have spare atoms. It's a hard takeoff singularity as soon as anybody bothers to try.

        The U.S.S. Phenix was equipped with an an "interphase generator" capable of rendering it not only undetectable but impervious to attack and able to fly through planets, and was small enough to fit in a suitcase.

        &#x200B;

        The Genesis Device was capable of completely re-ordering matter on a scale adequate to turn a nebula into a planet. Admittedly the planet later exploded, but that's only a marginal reduction in utility when considering its potential as a strategic weapon system, and might be a solvable problem.

        &#x200B;

        The U.S.S. Enterprise carries an unspecified quantity of warp capable probes that can be guided remotely and a number of larger warp capable shuttles if the probes aren't quite big enough.  It also carries matter replicators capable of producing complex manufactured goods.

        &#x200B;

        So invisible intangible warp missiles launched from basically anywhere with no warning that will replace all your planets and significant outposts with uninhabited human habitable planets that might later explode is the entry level on a war in which the Federation has removed the kid gloves.

        &#x200B;

        Edit: also this application was even adressed in canon as it's the first thing McCoy thinks on hearing the Genesis proposal and the reason Kirk has to steal the Enterprise is he can't get permission to go back to the Genesis Planet to look for Spock because of the political situation the Klingons finding out about the project and it's potential military applications caused.

      two issues. the first is power requirements, those military ships do use antimater after all. 

      the second problem is infrastructure. even with enough power, you only have so much to work with. if you focus on expanding infrastructure and have the skilled labor to do so, then your power requirement went up. how much antimatter do you have anyway? 

      so, you have finite skilled labor, finite infrastructure and power. ergo you get finite results, and channel a lot of resources into finding better ways to do things. 

      now, your engineer may be able to do that crazy thing... but he probably damaged the ship when he did it. damaging the deflector dish now to avoid a messy death is a good option, but its not a long-term solution. 

      star trek is also VERY anti-transhuman, as a result of previous genetically engineered superhumans (Khan!). human society is socialist (with the tech to support that), but still has the occasional criminal (such as Mud). i would further conclude that on some level, the society is against large sudden changes because many of those changes have very nasty negative externalities. 

      biggest threats in star trek cannon? time travel, mind-controlling parasites in the admirals, other space-faring empires (Borg, romulans, cardassians, ect), and problems caused by their own technology. Q also tends to get on the list, but he really isnt in the top 10. oh, and there is also a mirror universe. 

      telepathy is a known thing, as are empaths who can read you from another ship or in orbit. teleporters are easy to disrupt, but can keep you alive in stasis as long as the power supply holds out. all humanoid species can interbreed and have a common ancestor. 

      now, the best solution i can think of is that future-federation is causing some problems via time travel, above and beyond 'fixing' the problems created by earlier captains. the reason none of the stiff your talking about happens, is because the future does not want it to. time travellers from the future are screwing with your timeline, and doing so for their own benefit. time travel is the single biggest problem in the setting. we even get a temporal cold-war in one show. 

      so, why dont we have X? because that would screw with the future timeline, and then agent Jones wont be born. we need agent Jones to stop event Y. no, it hasnt happened yet, but its vital to the timeline. recursive logic, plus people in power keeping in power.

  Recently I've read [How I became friends with Octopus](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18379245) thread on HN, and I thought it would be awesome to read a story set in a world where octopuses happened to live much longer, started forming societies, and ended up evolving alongside humans. Maybe we've been competing all along, maybe they lived in some isolated underwater cave and only recently we've made contact.

  The story could explore how a completely separate evolutionary branch of intelligence has evolved, or it could be alien contact movie without aliens.

  I don't have the skills to write one, but it would be super fun to read, octopi are such cool creatures.
