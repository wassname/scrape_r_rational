## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Does anyone here write poetry -- or better yet, teach the writing of poetry? I [posted] (https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/ecxyxh/i_write_quick_little_poems_in_holiday_cards_to_my/) for the first time yesterday in /r/OCPoetry requesting suggestions for improvement, if anyone would be willing to give it a glance :]

  Alternatively, do there exist any "rational" poems or songs? I've heard some Effective Altruism-y songs, e.g. [The Ballad of Smallpox Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32yPWJcq2AI), and then there's the Dungeons and Discourse [corpus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUHxPfaGvrkLs5KvBHBlIu2w), which brought us such hits as [The Devil and Blaise Pascal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rNkTtJ35Xw&list=UUHxPfaGvrkLs5KvBHBlIu2w) or [Hobbes' Song](https://soundcloud.com/buckmbs/hobbes-song), and potentially some "science-y / academic-y" songs could also qualify, e.g. from Monty Python like the [Galaxy Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvwH8Qij0JY) or [Bruce's Philosophy Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9SqQNgDrgg) or from elsewhere like [The Atom Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPbR30pWkqE) or the works of [acapellascience](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTev4RNBiu6lqtx8z1e87fQ) or [these Children's Songs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mH7ruIpmCEy8hqbXmrm4XBkd1WU8WjqYo).

  Some of these I feel might appeal to the aesthetic sensibilities of this sub, but I haven't seen anything that's more directly targeted.

    Bit of a reach, but Nightwish's album ["Endless Forms Most Beautiful"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mp-IlpTwT2w4AxGERJLsxfoC4RuK-5-sc) is an ode to Evolution, they got Richard Dawkins to do a few lines for it.

    >“We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. 

    >"Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia.

    >"Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.

    >"We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?”

      Pro-death atheism is so bizarre to me.

      What about you, Dawkins, how dare you whine at our rage against the dying of the light?

          Everything but the last sentence has that vibe, yeah, but

          \> We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how  dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which  the vast majority have never stirred

          To slightly rephrase: be grateful you exist,  HOW DARE you feel bad about someday not existing, (and, implied to guilt you a bit) how dare you pay those who never even got to exist that disservice?

          In context, this is part of an argument for why we should not fear death (quick summary: why fear death when you used to be dead?), and it is by far my least favorite line from Unweaving the Rainbow, which is overall a fairly well-intentioned book.

          Besides that, there's a lot of sour-grapes death-gives-meaning-to-life shit going around and I'm sick of it.

      Ooh, nice! Haven't heard these before. The album title's a reference to the last sentence of Chuckie D's Origin, too. Will give them a listen! :]

      I'm reminded also of the https://www.symphonyofscience.com/ works, which generally [autotune popsci book passages read aloud](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFC4EE4355ADEBDB1).

    [Lostboyevsky's album Existential Risk](https://lostboyevsky.bandcamp.com/album/existential-risk) covers some familiar themes, as the title might suggest, with lots of rationalist community namedropping.
    ```

    There's the songs from the [Secular Solstice](https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/releases) (more discography at the bottom of the page), a rationalist meetup. More info [here](http://secularsolstice.com/resources/). Also check out the Bayesian Choir. And some song lyrics from u/Sailor_Vulcan [here](http://sailorvulcansstarship.blogspot.com/2017/09/here-have-some-songs.html?m=1) and [here](http://sailorvulcansstarship.blogspot.com/2018/01/here-have-some-more-songs.html?m=1).

    Edit: And for transhumanism specifically, there's [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL6Iy2E-Y52vhSDjNyxYAR7-O01meV2sj) (your mileage may vary) and [this page](https://hpluspedia.org/wiki/Transhumanist_music).

  I posted this as a slightly sarcastic click-bait top-level post earlier, but it got removed and I realized I should have just posted about this in the Friday thread instead where it was more appropriate instead. My apologies to everyone.

  So, here's a link to [NeoRhythm](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/neorhythm-breakthrough-in-brain-science/x/8914984#/) for anyone who wants to discuss it's merits and how likely it is to be a scam or not.

    - u/xamueljones:

      I know right!?! It's like the final straw on a camel's back for proving that it's a scam.

      If it was at all remotely as effective as it claims to be, then I would assume that it would be way bigger than it really is and not need any crowd-funding to get started.

      Anyway, I was just curious to see if people wanted to talk about it and if they knew of any fiction that had a device similar to this.
      ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Can anyone link the two studies they mention about their product? 

    Also I didn't realize your earlier post was sarcastic and responded to it accordingly, sorry about that.
    ```

  - u/VapeKarlMarx:
    ```
    It is 💯 likely to be a scam.  

    The page is formated like every scam page.  Even if the product works and is based on good science I wouldn't trust them to do it 

    That all being said.  I still kinda wanna know just what they are saying their product does and how it is supposed to work.
    ```

- u/VapeKarlMarx:
  ```
  I know it is silly. I always wished rationality was more about instrumental rationality.  

  I like munchikin fanfic as much as the next guy but I feel like as a community the time and energy spend on that vs EA type stuff should probably be flipped
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    That's like saying "people spend so much time writing Dragon Ball fanfiction, when they could spend that time going to the gym and working out".

    One of these things happens to be way easier than the other.
    ```

    - u/VapeKarlMarx:
      ```
      Of those two things one is more fuffiling on the long run as well.

      Of course you are right, doesn't mean I have to like it.
      ```

  - u/eroticas:
    ```
    As in there should be more instrumental/EA like content in what this subreddit focuses on, within its preexisting domain of fiction? 

    Or do you mean as in the general sense where, we should all as human beings get off our asses and do what is actually important?
    ```

    - u/VapeKarlMarx:
      ```
      Yeah, in life.  

      I feel like developing a powerful rational toolkit and not then applying it to the real world is a waste.
      ```

      - u/eroticas:
        ```
        Come hang out on the ea forum then! A lot of us are doing high impact work (we hope, it's not always obvious whether something is high impact of course) in our respective areas.

    I feel like instrumental rationality is pretty popular too? It's just less emphasized in this subreddit's particular corner of rationalist discussionspace, since we're focused around fiction-reading. But finding and reading enjoyable fiction is a perfectly rational thing to do for many people, so it's not like we need to *trade off* between instrumental rationality and this subreddit's usual activities; /r/rational might not be a fully balanced breakfast on its own, but it's still a worthwhile piece to include in a larger breakfast.
    ```

    - u/VapeKarlMarx:
      ```
      Oh yeah. I like rat-fic.

      I feel like the few non-fic related rational spaces I know about don't have anything like the energy of fic based spaces
      ```
