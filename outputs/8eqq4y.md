  So, either we have a near-unstoppable scouting force consisting of comedic relief, or we have the comedy relief stomped on hard by the heroes to show that things have gotten serious.

  In the spirit of Robber I must now announce that I'm **taking all bets**!
  ```

  - u/HallowedThoughts:
    ```
    I gotta go with unstoppable force. Much like Hedge and the Champion, their bickering will make them far too amusing for the narrative to kill them just yet
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      Depends on the mentor hero, I think.  If he's supposed to be, like, a scary grim reaper-acting motherfucker, then him showing up and shutting down the funny could be a killing stroke.  But with Robber *and* Archer there, well, he would have to be pretty fucking scary.
      ```

      - u/HallowedThoughts:
        ```
        Arguably it could be the reverse with the mentor dude being weaker because he's so serious. When the Tyrant was sieging against the White Knight's band of heroes, he set the tone for being lighter, which make the more amusing of the heroes less prone to danger. If Robber and Archer take the initiative, I think they'll do well, but if the heroes catch them out, it could go badly
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Bobber just got a heavy death flag.
    ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      Well pairing up the comedic relief of Robber and Archer seems a bit narrative bumble for Cat, she's usually smarter at crafting her stories.
      ```

  "absolute positioning" has never been so terrifying a phrase.

      If that's what that is, then... wow. This book is going to get ridiculously bloody.

      ...as if it wasn't headed there already lol
      ```

      - u/Ibbot:
        ```
        I assumed it was more like magical GPS, the IRL version of which is used to guide missiles.
        ```

        - u/munkeegutz:
          ```
          I assumed it was some form of teleportation, which places an object at some specific position, despite any material which is already there.

          For instance, know the exact location of someone, and open a gate to arcadia which bisects them.  Or something which can teleport a crossbow bolt into their brain.
          ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  Okay, that settles it.

  I want a full-length Dread Emperor Irritant story.  He is simply too awesome a character to keep locked up within the first three lines of a chapter.
  ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    Yet another victory for Irritant!
    ```

  - u/Oaden:
    ```
    Wasn't it Dread Empress Irritant the oddly successful?

    I do agree though, i want more of those preposterous adventures.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      He was an [Emperor](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/04/12/chapter-7-elaboration/), but yes, he was called "The Oddly Successful" (which, in itself, suggests some great stories to tell).
      ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Mhh, I wonder who will betray Cat first, Baroness Ainsley von Honorable, or Baron Henry McTraitor? Place your bets now!

    How can we fathom this enigma?
    ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  So we're back to giving hilarious names to dangerous pets that die quick and nasty deaths, huh. If this isn't some kind of legion tradition it *should* be.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    or at least a 15th legion tradition.
    ```

- u/themousehunter:
  ```
  Cat's reveal about knowing the redheaded man was epic.
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    Bet's that it was a named hero? Maybe a pilgrim?
    ```

    - u/zero51423:
      ```
      Probably not a Named, just the very pointed description of an envoy from the principate that a certain  baron failed to mention.
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        Which gives a very nice impression to *both* nobles that this conversation was a test... and that she'd passed and he'd failed.
        ```

- u/Morghus:
  ```
  One of the reasons why I love this book so much is because it is so similar to Malazan. Robber and Hedge for example
  ```

- u/RynnisOne:
  ```
  Hmmm... absolute positioning, the ability to Scry on anyone, and the ability to open up portals?

  Is Cat about to introduce *Scry and Die* tactics to her world?  Spot a target, teleport/portal in, assassinate, escape.

  I'm wondering if it's possible to find the exact location of a Hero by having multiple people scan simultaneously at areas a set distance apart from each other.  If the "Scry block" is a set size and not some nebulous changing area, then it is possible to target them using a bit of simple geometry.  Find the radius of the sphere and the center is the Hero.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Warlock mentioned making an array for mapping out the zone where Bumbling Conjurer tried to block his scrying, so you don't need a few people for that. Though I wonder, whether Catherine has mages good enough for that, aside from Masego. Tracking a blocked area is how Warlock found the White Knight in Nicae, though the shapes and timing of the blokcing may well be irregular: scrying isn't exactly unknown, just not practiced widely.

    Scry and Die isn't instantaneous in the Guideverse, which means the target would have to stay immobile for days or weeks, not to mention heroes being more likely to find a way to get into Arcadia, or just happen to be on the other side of the portal in time.
    ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      What if Masego can open portals through something less "occupied" than Arcadia?  I wouldn't want to bet against his ability to perform a rods from god orbital strike or back of the head "bang" through a portal or (the only non warlock based guess)  as GeJO mentioned above just peeling some of the crust of the planet off with "absolute positioning" and extrapolating from things we've seen Warlock do.
      ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    As long as it's not the Locate City Bomb, the universe should be okay.
    ```
