## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I have a colleague who is antivax and creationist (with Ancient Aliens in Mesopotamia, based on ridiculously wild misinterpretation of their creation myths). I retaliate by feeding him all kinds of plausible conspiracies that are incompatible with and encroach on his beliefs (the bicameral mind, hybrid / stabilization theory of human evolution, anticholesterol drug conspiracism).

    I'll add another to your list: the high concentration of mattress firms in southern California is due to the Russian Malfia conducting money laundering schemes with mattress companies. Think about it, how often do you buy a mattress? Why are there so many in Southern California?

      Money laundering schemes are the phlogiston of microeconomics.
