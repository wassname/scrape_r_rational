  ```
  A short story, ~2000 words, about trying to deal with dark powers intelligently.

    Your stuff's cool! You should post it here when you write more or make a twitter/tumblr to follow.
    ```

      I'm glad you liked it.  I've been planning to add RSS to the site, would that work or is RSS sufficiently dead at this point that I should just make a twitter account?

        I use RSS quite heavily to follow fiction, on Royal Road and elsewhere.
        ```

      - u/callmesalticidae:
        ```
        I use RSS all the time, and Twitter hardly ever (I certainly never use it to track creative fiction). 

        Email alerts are also good.
        ```

      - u/PM_ME_CUTE_FOXES:
        ```
        I believe RSS is sufficiently dead.

      I had some free time at work today and got it set up.  Thanks for the suggestion.

    Oh, *lovely*. This could genuinely go either way...

    [c]?
    ```

      ```
      [c] in the sense it's fully self-contained, but I like the world and the MC so I might wright something related.

        Also enjoyed this. Tone-wise, it's very similar to Wildbow's *Pact*. Definitely worth a read, if you're someone who wants to/can read things in the same genre/idea space as the concept you're working with.
        ```

        - u/sprague-grundy:
          ```
          I read ~2/3 of Pact when it was being published.  I should probably go back and finish it.

          Pact's milieu is absolutely amazing, and Wildbow's writing is very addictive, but I eventually stopped reading because I was frustrated that even hundreds of thousands of words in I couldn't model the magic system very well.

          In Worm when something cool happened in a fight I would usually go "ooh, that's clever" or "ooh, I didn't realize this cape could do that, that has implications X and Y".  The exact mechanics of magic in Pact were never quite nailed down enough to produce that same feeling.  I would be reading a fight asking myself "I wonder if this time magic will turn out to work in such a way that things are OK" rather than "How is this set of tools I understand going to be used to get out of this one?".
          ```

          - u/kleind305:
            ```
            Definitely that problem, and imo it's barely ameliorated in the same-universe sequel *Pale*, despite extensive efforts to do so.

            The basic issue, I think, is that the magic is fundamentally shaped by people's desires, and since the world/spirits are conceptual in nature, their limits are more in line with "what are you willing to pay". Which is cool but definitely not as Rational as Worm.

  The stories on your site are all quite good. Thank you for writing them!
  ```

  - u/sprague-grundy:

    I'm glad you liked them :)

  Hey, just so you know, whatever "Crescat" is, the link to it is broken.
  ```

  - u/sprague-grundy:
    ```
    Thanks!  It's a longer story I've been working on, but I've been lazy about formatting it properly for Jekyll.  I'll hopefully get around to fixing that soon.
    ```

- u/TrebarTilonai:
  ```
  Oh wow, nice premise! An interesting twist on the basic concept, plus a subversion of the expected ending, and all within 2000-ish words. Very well done indeed :)
  ```

- u/SpecialMeasuresLore:
  ```
  Perhaps it's déjà vu, but I swear I've seen the basic premise of *Asteroid Monetization* in another piece of fiction. Can you recall where you got the idea?
  ```

  - u/sprague-grundy:
    ```
    I'm not sure.  I suspect someone else just had the same idea.  At least for me, I've been so primed by movies that when I read news stories involving asteroids the narrative part of my brain autocompletes to them crashing into the earth for some reason.
    ```

    - u/The_Wadapan:
      ```
      late reply, but u/SpecialMeasuresLore, I know exactly what you're thinking of, because I had the exact same thought—it's probably [Sisyphus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DdiSNDXT-ZL5gMEZ7C7ikcZixX4X7ZkcC1K39F3siQI/edit), a 2015 Alexander Wales short story released via Google Docs. To be wholly honest, I think I prefer your take, it was just hurt by the fact I'd seen it before!

      I checked out the other shorts on the site; "Two Games" was my favourite, really great concept told well, but the other two both had some compelling ideas going on too. Looking forward to seeing *Crescat* when it's ready!
