  Enjoy, and please feedback! This is my most complex story yet, and I feel like I might be missing a lot of things. Any reasoning errors, logical errors, where the theme could be pushed more, or where the story seems to contradict its own themes etc. would be great.

    How did you model the combination of Coil and Dinah's powers? It seems like Coil could ask Dinah questions all day to figure out all of his enemies. Eg. "Chance the person who will pose the largest threat to me is in North America / will attack today", etc. Coil seems like he should be in the same position that young Coil mentions of taking down all enemies. I know Wildbow restricted it somehaw but that seemed hand-wavy to me. 

    Worm is a universe where people who try to work together or to make things better are inhibited by the powers that be.

    * Shards influence parahumans towards conflict and reward those who participate. (Eg. Rewards of shards budding and stronger powers.) Shards also influence parahumans to not look too much into shards themselves. (Panacea avoids brains likely for this reason)
    * Contessa is focused on keeping Cauldron a secret at almost any cost. This means anyone who would reveal Cauldron and their wrongdoings gets taken out or scared off.
    * Endbringers destroy anyone who looks to improve the world. Eg. Sphere's family was attacked by the Simurgh, turning him away from helping the world and making him into Mannequin.

    Etcetera. If you don't have these, it might be nice to know why things don't just snowball into massive factions that can beat the Endbringers, ala Weaver 9 or Amelia. Also how Contessa's goals are different (if she's being rational) and why you can't just produce a bunch of Eidolon / Kherpi-level parahumans to take down Scion. In canon, the dilute the vials with Human shard, but if Contessa knows how it'll turn out, she could Path or dilute less to produce a proper parahuman.

      Contessa is acting against Scion, but Scion and the Endbringers are her only blindspot. She does not have prior knowledge how Scion is going to react to her actions, so she cannot go too far too fast. Anti-Endbringer defenses are much stronger in this story, but the Endbringers are also much stronger. On balance, for industrialised countries, it is as if the Endbringers are more destructive natural disasters. Simurgh is still free to sabotage humans. Factions don't necessarily unite against Endbringers due to co-ordination problems (e.g. if one faction loses most of their parahumans to Endbringers, they cannot defend themselves.) 

      As for Dinah, I forgot to consider her in-story. But my first impression is that it still depends a lot on Coil asking the right questions, and  thinking of the right interpretations (e.g. largest threat can be political or military, ten years from now as opposed to now, if he takes out the largest threat that might cause an even greater threat to emerge that the previous largest threat had been suppressing, etc.). Coil might also not bother to spend one or two hours every day checking for every threat. Five minutes asking questions like 'am I going to die today?' I can imagine, but it's probably not productive to check for every contingency.

        Yeah, maybe he just didn't ask chance of dying a week from now. (Pulling a Panacea) If you have that power combo, it should your main strength if you are using it at all intelligently.

        Eg. When planning your next move, you'd find anyone who's likely to be a threat to you in the next month, 6 months, and year through questions. Then you work to take them down or turn them away. Then, Tattletale wouldn't have been able to target him because then he'd see that the Protectorate has X% chance of capturing him in the next month -> determine that a main player is a new parahuman or someone who isn't on their roster -> someone born in north america, etc. And he can also use this asking how his recruitment actions pan-out long term for Tattletale.

          You're right, it's a huge flaw. Dinah had not initially been in the chapter, and I added her at the last minute, so I failed to consider her, in the midst of all the other variables. Coil can probably spend five minutes checking the probability of his death in the near and middle term, since his death or lack thereof is fairly straightforward. One slightly cheat-y way Sarah might have around it is to just have Dinah lie. But I suspect Sarah can probably find another way around it, I just haven't thought of how.

          I'll have to fix it, but that'll take some time, and will probably have to be done after the next chapter.

  Pretty good so far, good writing and the story is interesting.

  My only nitpick is that [spoiler](#s " he didn't ask Dinah for the numbers on recruiting TT? If she had subverted his org that far in advance, I'm guessing the result would be a hard 0%.")
