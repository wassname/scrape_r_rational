  The story follows a guy who aims to become a QA (Quality Assurance) tester. This includes how he deals with job interviews, exams and his new job: QA testing a humanoid. 

  The protagonist  rationally deals with all these challenges, without any special power that allows him to magically succeed. The story combines elements from real hi-tech workflow, and the hypothetical scenario of QA testing robots who act like real humans. 

  This idea was originally inspired by Eve no Jikan, an anime which dealt with the subject of "How human can an android get". I felt that some aspects of the anime weren't rational, since a complex product like an android will surely have to undergo serious QA before release. Hence, my story deals with this exact aspect.

    Does it hit all of the characteristics of rational(ist) fiction bullet points on the sidebar?
    ```

      I think it only covers Rational, not Rationalist. I believe it satisfies all the characteristics, though explaining them one-by-one in detail seems pretty awkward.

      For example: "Do plot events happen for a reason?". Well, sure. The protagonist just tries to get a job that interests him, has good affinity with his skills and fits his academic degree. Feels too straightforward to even be mentioned IMO.

        For what reason does the plot event "gets a job *without knowing what it's about*" happen?  I don't find that to be particularly realistic.
        ```

          ```
          This happens a lot in the army, but it's something that can happen with any big company which tries to be confidential to some degree. Though, I admit that there was a small sacrifice of  "rationality" here, as I didn't want to info-dump about the job before he even got there. 

          Early on, explaining the exact job would require the company to arrange a special meeting between the protagonist and a knowledgeable worker. In my experience, nobody got time for that in the hi-tech industry. Especially, not when a new version of an important product is about to be released. 

          I'm sure it would have looked more "realistic" on the surface if he met such a worker earlier. But, in practice, I think that's actually less likely. 

          Granted, it's all a consequence of circumstances and the company doesn't fail to surprise with incompetence afterwards too. This is partially my indirect rant about the incompetent organizations and companies I happened to be part of ;)

  Having finished reading this story; it says it's complete, but it really doesn't feel like it, so if that's the kind of thing that would irritate you, you might be better served looking elsewhere.  It felt like the author was working up to a reasonably obvious conclusion, and then... didn't.  To draw a parallel, it'd be like watching the Lion King, and have the movie end after Simba meets Timon and Pumba.  

  Having said that, what is there is kind of light and fluffy, very much in the style of a Japanese light novel; if you like that sort of thing, the cadence and tone will be very familiar to you, and in that respect I felt it was well done.

    That make me curious. May I ask what you felt was the "conclusion" I was building for? 

    Truth to be told: I didn't continue the story precisely because I no longer had any clear "conclusion" to reach, at least not as far as I could see. The original story was outlined to reach this specific ending and that's why I ended it there.

    I admit that I had further plans for the story when I brainstormed. But, I doubt these "future ideas" would be things that the readers really expect/predict...

      I'm actually kind of surprised to hear you say that.  I'm going to use a giant spoiler block here, so as not to ruin it for anyone else who wants to read:

      [Spoilers](#s "It seemed to me like you were drawing intentional parallels between the protagonist's relationship with the android and his relationship with his own sister.  Considering how tsundere Amy seem to act, eager to spend time with her big brother at the mall or playing Jenga, immediately going cool when Nick rebuffs her, it felt like you were working towards having Nick learn to use his interactions with Lily to improve his own relationship with Amy.")

      [Spoilers](#s "Instead, Nick blows Amy off a few times, goes back to work, Lily's memory has been wiped, and... ...that's it.  It's over.  It really felt like it ended at the end of the first act, instead of at the conclusion.")
      ```

      - u/DarkClaymore:
        ```
        [Spoilers](#s "True, his relationship with Amy was really parallel to some of his interactions with Lily. However, I never really saw it as a major conflict in the story which must reach a specific conclusion. My future ideas actually involved Rika and a whole new share of topics to deal with.")
        ```

  When people suggest stories here, they usually post a comment explaining why they are recommending them and how close they come to being ideally rational(ist).
  ```

  - u/DarkClaymore:
    ```
    Oh, sure. Sorry, I didn't really see that in the example I checked. I'll do it right away! ;)
