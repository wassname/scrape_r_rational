## fictionhub.io - an awesome place for writers to host and discuss fiction/fanfiction. Looking for your feedback.

### Post:

Hi! Recently I've created a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/37bzof/what_features_should_a_perfect_platform_for/) asking for your ideas on developing a great platform for hosting fiction/fanfiction.

Now I want to give you an update on my progress - I've created and deployed the first version! =)

You can check it out here: http://fictionhub.io/

It is still an early version, and there's a lot to improve, but I would really like to know what you think about it. I want it to be the best place for people from this subreddit to post their stories, so any ideas/suggestions/questions/feedback would be very welcome!

  I would suggest a very strong line between fanfiction and original fiction, if your site is specifically designed with writers in mind.  Some writers won't touch a fanfiction site with a ten-foot-pole.  Separate domain names would probably be best.

    Why is this?

  Also, the top level of the site being devoted to actual content is a bit irritating.  I want to choose what I look at.  IMHO, the top level, the entry page, should be news, search options, and utility options.

  I would say to take a look at Archive of Our Own as you continue to develop this. There are little flaws (usually relating to particular functions, like the inability to send PMs) but the basic layout is great and it's easy to navigate. 

  Whereas this... Well, as it stands it looks like a clunky Wordpress-styled site. Sorry. 

  EDIT: Some Googling for "sites based on Archive of Our Own" just let me know that it made TIme's 50 Best Websites of 2013. Interesting to see that it was on their radar.

    To be explicit: Ao3 is open source.

    Somewhere there's a note about a major developer who was burning out on device compatibility.  I.e. getting demands for perfection across too many devices.  I suspect you'll see very clean frontend code (html etc).

  And one last comment.

  FIRST.  Understand that the content of the following site is heavily non-rational.   I actually post Set In Stone there as well as in Wordpress.

  Take a look at [Royal Road](http://www.royalroadl.com/)

  IMHO, The navigation in some parts is painful, and the editing features are painful (I no longer edit anything there, once it's posted, it's done), but the basic structure of the site is just about ideal for fiction writing and reading.
