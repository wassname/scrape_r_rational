  ```
  Man if Praes is a pit of vipers then the Dominion is at least a bunch of fighting roosters. If nothing else the failure of most of the Good nations to liberate Callow is if not excused than at least understandable in the light of each of their national failings, even before the increased espionage of Praes focused on sabotaging other nations rather than it's own or Callow.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    At least Praes is honest in its villainy. Procer and the Dominion have the gall to call themselves good while fighting in their crab bucket.
    ```

    - u/NZPIEFACE:
      ```
      The free cities are pretty honest too. Which is nice.
      ```

      - u/ATRDCI:
        ```
        Well, the Evil ones (and Mercantis) are anyway.  The Atalante priests supporting Kairos' ritual should at least call them into question a little (especially given the potiential motivation of wanting to strike back at Procer for their priesthood declaring the Atalantean priests to be lapsing in faith.
        ```

    - u/anenymouse:
      ```
      I wonder if Grey Pilgrim's now lost influence over the Dominion was keeping some of the extremes at bay, like he was the unofficial leader people were looking to him for guidance previously is that included in their metaphorical crown? Like Saint was only kept under some kind of uh leash to be blunt by Grey Pilgrim's you know authority did that influence the situation? Rogue Sorcerer also started being more vocal in his protests post crown sacrifice but at the same time the situation was rapidly snowballing downhill.
      ```

      - u/ATRDCI:
        ```
        No, Tariq specified when giving up his crown that it was a crown given to him by his familial inheritance, rather than the unofficial kingmaker he eventually became via his actions and reputation.  

        &nbsp;

        >“It will be mine,” the Grey Pilgrim said. “Though the Dominion of Levant has no kings, I was born to the bloodline that has ruled it since its founding.”

        &nbsp;

        And right after, Kairos suggest killing Tariq's descendant to make him wear that crown.

        &nbsp;

        >“Oh, please do have him elected Holy Seljun,” the Tyrant grinned. “That would be delightful. We’ll have to have his… great-great-nephew? Close enough, I think. We’ll need to have the current Seljun assassinated first, that is my implication, but worry not. Mercantis offers very fair prices on poison these days.”
        ```

        - u/anenymouse:
          ```
          But does it work like that? the passage that i was thinking of was in chapter 34 " But what you will be surrendering, in truth, is rather more abstract: it is you ‘right to rule’."  and then later clarified to be  

          "Though the earthly crown will not be taken from your brow, save if you yourself do so, you will have lost the authority of a ruler in the eyes of the Heavens,” the Grey Pilgrim said. “Lingering in that role after discarding it before Gods and men can only bring calamity.”

          “I figure it’d be subtle at first,” I said. “Small nudges. Crops get a little worse, people listen a little less. If you keep holding, though, then it’s a different story.”

          “Disease and strife,” the Peregrine said, “and they will only grow, so long as authority is kept.”

          &#x200B;

          And to me it's not super clear that you can necessarily separate the right to rule or the general leadership out from the more Kingly authority. Like he can certainly say that it's his inherent position based on his birth but does him saying that it is so define the situation? Like the way that i interpreted the assassinating of the Seljun was that Grey Pilgrim has a claim to the position but because he doesn't have it yet and so can't give up a crown that he didn't have, but Grey Pilgrim doesn't explicitly have the position that he's arguing that he's giving up in anything but the unofficial capacity in the first place. If that makes sense.
          ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        I think that should only apply if Saint or Rogue were part of his sovereign people, but it's a good observation so I'm unsure.
        ```

- u/TideofKhatanga:
  ```
  Boy, you seem to have a good head on your shoulders, so maybe just stay away from that girl. She's a solid 11 on the Ranger scale of death by snu-snu.
  ```

  - u/MisterCommonMarket:
    ```
    But what snu-snu it would be...
    ```

    - u/TideofKhatanga:
      ```
      The stabby kind, it seems.
      ```

      - u/ATRDCI:
        ```
        They are both of the Blood after all. This sort of play is all but inevitable
        ```

      - u/AntiChri5:
        ```
        It's all pointless without penetration.
        ```

- u/earnestadmission:
  ```
  The part that gets me about the 10th crusade is that Cat offers to give them safe passage through Callow. She literally offered to join up and fight the Tower with them.

  They had every opportunity but value-rigidity blinded the Crusaders to alternative plans. Dammit, they went to the work of cutting a stairway through the mountains so that’s the route they’re gonna use !!1
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    True, but we saw what happened from Tariq's POV a few dozen chapters back, and it wasn't unreasonable to avoid accidentally making a second Dead King, even if Callow suffered.
    ```

    - u/earnestadmission:
      ```
      So then declare the crusade on Callow. 

      Trouble is, GP passed by the chance to convert Cat into a Good Queen; the Queen in Callow hadn’t done that much Evil, other than following Below’s religion.
      ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        The Queen in Callow had a godlike power that turned her more unstable every time she used it, and not only would she be forced to use it a lot to take Praes but it would fuck up the grand alliance, which would otherwise end the wars between the 3 western powers and eventually let them take a swing at the dead king.

        To quote Cat herself, it was a difficult choice only through sentimentality
        ```

        - u/earnestadmission:
          ```
          That’s kind of my point. The crusaders (everybody but Gray Pilgrim) were uninterested in diplomacy with Cat. The dilemma you’ve described from GP’s point of view is at least partially constrained by the so-called Good guys.
          ```

          - u/Ardvarkeating101:
            ```
            The dilemma that they can’t afford to let Cat stay in power?
            ```

            - u/anenymouse:
              ```
              The dilemma that Cat is Cordelia's best and only real ally against the Dead King at the moment, also that Cordelia's standing and arguably the whole Grand Alliance is built on extremely uneven ground. Cat at this point could force the whole thing to come down just by being defended by troops from Procer against any Good nation. That every nation in the Grand Alliance has been ground down by either fighting Praes or fighting Callow, and that the casualties that they know are going to come from fighting the Dead King are going to leave them vulnerable. The kind of vulnerabilities that other ostensibly Good nations are quite willing to take advantage of if they have the advantage.
              ```

              - u/Ardvarkeating101:
                ```
                ...what does that have to do with the conditions at the beginning of the crusade, when they were invading callow?
                ```

                - u/anenymouse:
                  ```
                  it uh doesn't my bad, I'm just not sympathetic to the Good nations being screwed over by the results of their own inaction in all honesty.
                  ```

            - u/earnestadmission:
              ```
              the crusade didn't name Callow as the target

              that was the strategic mistake imo
              ```

- u/RRTCorner:
  ```
  Man for a moment I thought Razin talked himself into a Name. Maybe he will still get his Bestowal, but that would have been a good opportunity.
  ```

  - u/Mountebank:
    ```
    Same here, but considering how it's Catherine's words that triggered the change in him, I half expected him to awaken to a Villainous name instead.
    ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    He may be a claimant already, given how he ignored being stabbed in the gut for the sake of Plot.
    ```

- u/bubby_cat2:
  ```
  Was that 'the great monster of their age' used to refer to CATHERINE? Have we seen that phrasing previously when we aren't talking about the Black Knight?
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    The only other time the phrase 'great monster' appears in the text is in [Interlude: Stairway](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/interlude-stairway/):

    > Well, there was one in every generation. Klaus’ had borne the Black Knight that awaited him in the Vales, and the great monster of Cordelia’s own looked to be the murderous orphan who’d set her throne atop a sea of corpses.

    Which describes both Black and Cat as great monsters.
    ```

    - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
      ```
      Cat had been rocketing up the rankings recently. Being compared to Triumphant.
      ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    The Black Knight is dead, even if Amadeus isn't just yet. And Catherine is the Arch-Heretic of the East, dreaded more than the Dread Empress herself. So yes, there's no one else to take that title.
    ```

    - u/ATRDCI:
      ```
      It should be noted that while we, with our somewhat omniscient PoV, are aware of Malicia's role in destroying Procer in all but name via civil war (and how close.she came to succeeding), outside of Cordelia/Klaus/Augur basically no one but the Princes are aware and they showed themselves to be too shortsighted to be aware of the consequences and/or to care about them.

      &nbsp;

      In comparison, Cat is already infamous in Procer even before the Prince's Graveyard
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  The avoiding of zero sum conflicts seems to be a recurring theme. Just like with the drow the levant must choose to do better
  ```
