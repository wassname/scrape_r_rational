  I read this from start to end, and I my one problem is that it is not finished yet. It has a lot of stuff to like. There is this theme that heroes should change the whole world, but they cannot fix all the problems. They don't know how. They need to get smarter, better. Figure out the answer. But while they are busy getting smarter, there is actual suffering in the world that they need help with. So, what do you do? Do you use your power to make enough food to save 100 people from starvation every day, or do you spend years and years to finally end world hunger completely. How do you justify that to the 100 people who die that day because you are thinking long-term?

  It doens't have answers yet, but I am really curious what it will come up with.

  I think this is a great example of rationalist fiction so far. I'm quite enjoying it.

  I've been reading this ~~since before it was cool~~ for a while now.  About two weeks ago, it suddenly stopped rendering in Firefox -- the image just doesn't appear.  I can read it fine in Chrome or Safari, though.  I've emailed the author about the issue with no response.

  Does anyone else have this issue?

  Wow this series is really good, I'm enjoying it a lot. I think rationalist types would totally enjoy it's take on the superhero genre.

  Wow. A superhero who fights the deeper issues? Awwsssssuuummmm.

  P.S. Just discovered the subreddit. Think I'm gonna be spending a lot of time on here.

  I'm not very experienced in superhero genre, but this webcomic is on the level of Metropolitan Man while being pretty long (and ongoing, but it may not be advantageous for some).
