  Flicker shows why you don't want to get into a arbitrage or high-speed trading fight with someone who can find 0-second vulnerabilities in your trading program faster than you can type 'Wait, stop!'. Plus, a bit of history, and why Doc Future needing to tell you more than 'It's complicated' about time loops is a bad sign.

    > "Talk to her and Dr. Reinhart about setting up a non-destructive way to compartmentalize no-longer-relevant memories.  You don’t want to get rid of them, because they may correspond to high speed mind logs that you have no direct way of accessing, and you don’t want to introduce any new inconsistencies if you can help it."

    Doesn't this set up a couple small continuity glitches with Fall? First, that if she already has that mechanism set up, why not use it on Skybreaker's memories? Second and more subtle, isn't setting that up augmenting, or at least close to it? To a smaller degree than the memory techniques she semi-licitly acquires and uses (and is warned are poorly-structured and put her on an inevitable road to augmentation) in Fall, but if she's literally already learned the basic version from Stella, it seems implausible that she wouldn't notice that it was similar in a way that incited a conversation about augmentation.

      There will eventually be some expository clean-up in Fall, but this isn't really an issue:  The techniques Flicker gets partial access to in Fall are incomplete and cognitive ones, not memory, and the memory techniques she does end up using only work on her biological brain. She does not have access to the non-volatile memory debris in her high-speed mind in the same way (Doc just warned her that creates a potential consistency problem.) Flicker does have later  issues with *overusing* memory compartmentalization--it becomes her go-to technique for handling psychological problems, where it introduces new issues.

      (Spoiler)
      Stella worries about Flicker using her papers from Fall because the published ones have Belle Tinker level or better misdirection and many of the unpublished ones were intended only for herself and Doc, and include important assumptions about what the reader must already know or they wouldn't still be alive and functional 8-)

      Edit: One note about the 'Skybreaker' viewpoint character in Fall: it gets a lot of things wrong because of assumptions made to fill holes where memories are missing or inaccessible after Donner's song disrupts things. So it goes off into overinterpreting-the-Voynich-manuscript level craziness because it assumes that Flicker's human body and brain must have been planned by Explorer, when they weren't.

  This is one of the few stories I keep an eye out for these days. I love the way you explore the physical implications of super speed and other superhero tropes. 

  That said, this was the first chapter I found myself skipping through. The first part is wrong -- high speed trading is not something that Flicker's speed would help with, since it's limited by speed of light delays and not human action. Check the book "Flash Boys" for more, but suffice to say that there's no room for super speed to help if you're building single-purpose fiber optic lines for your trading and specifying which cage your servers should be in at the data center so that you can be as close as possible to the exchange's servers.

  The conversation in the high speed vault had me skipping ahead. I'm sure you've done a ton of work on your model of temporal mechanics and how retrocausal attacks work -- I can tell, because it's got "author's jewel" all over it. Unfortunately, it's too complicated for the reader (well, this reader) and, frankly, boring. Characters in the Flicker-verse have a habit of sitting down and having Serious Conversations which can slow things down a lot, but when the conversation is purely about the temporal model it's too much for me. 

  Again, I want to repeat that I love this story and your writing. This is the only chapter in three (4?) books where I've had these issues.

    Speed of light in long distance fiber optic cable is about 0.69 c. Flicker is faster than that. That's how people thought (prior to this chapter) that she was making her money.  It's also why arbitragers going over any distance prefer to use chains of LOS microwave relay towers, though those didn't go up until a few years before 2015 in our world. For an interesting discussion, see here: http://oklo.org/2015/02/22/electra/  But you can't do that over the ocean very easily. Now, if Flicker travels at 0.8 c between her exchange relays, it's very loud, obvious, and destructive.  So she doesn't do that.  That's why her microsat network being complete is important, they are in LEO, and specifically designed for low latency. Their main purpose is to reduce her com time to the Database as much as possible, but they work for trading, too. No one else (in 2012 in my world) has a similar network, and she makes her pure speed trades between exchanges that are far apart and the great circle route goes over water, where you can't use towers. (NY/Tokyo/London/Singapore for ex) So her microsat network is faster than both sea floor cables and regular satellites in Geosynchronous orbit.

    Where she makes her money on shorter trade distance is by exploiting trading programs.  The other speed traders do not have human level intelligence at a speed that can keep up with Flicker (or the Database), and she now has a model based on individual charcterization of every trader and data propagation and reaction delays (Vizier is running some Black Swan 0.9 software)

    The conversation in the vault isn't about my model--it's about Doc giving his best judgement when he's still working on something, because there is a threat to Flicker (messing herself up because she's wrong about the cause of a memory inconsistency) and she has a character trait of not accepting "do this" without an explanation.  I could write a better explanation--but that's not what Doc has.

    I'm glad you're enjoying the rest of the stories 8-)

      Hm. I'm still not convinced that the trading thing works. In addition to speed of light issues, HFTs have access to special trade types that allow them to jump the queue on orders and so other sorts of shenanigans that frankly sounded like cheating to me when I read about them. Still, it's your works and the SoL issue was my main objection. Presumably Flicker can get access to whatever trade options the other HFTs use and then beat them on time. Okay, cool.

      Thanks for the explanation.

        Exactly! The 'special trade types' and other shenanigans were exactly the sorts of things that Flicker looked at, said 'A lot of this should be illegal but isn't, and the parts that are illegal aren't enforced.'  She warned the SEC, they didn't do anything, so she went 'Fine, I'll own your markets, everything they can do I can do better'

        Also she can do fun things like add turbulence and ionization to microwave transmission paths very quickly (as in after she knows an order will be placed in the next few seconds because she has the code for the automatic trading program that's using it) to slightly delay commands due to automatic retries, etc 8-)
