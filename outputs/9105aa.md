  I would be very, very surprised, if juice or milk didn't contain water. Not to mention that the human body also contains a lot of water, so she would be allergic to herself.

  1/10 realism

      What would make diet coke unique? Surely it'd be a chemical or composition of chemicals? Unless you're saying it's the complete recipe of Diet Coke that does it?

        Probably the acidity. None of those other beverages hold a candle to Diet Coke's PH, so something something OH ions something something reactions gone wrong something something hives.

    She'd also probably be allergic to the amniotic fluid so she'd probably be a miscarriage.

  Good ol' aquagenic diseases. Rare, brutal, and likely frustrating to live with.

  First of all, I would highly recommend not using the word 'allergy' to describe it unless somebody's dumbing down the condition in-story. It's not a true allergy. The first problem with your writing is anaphylaxis isn't really a symptom that can occur from known aquagenic conditions. The two main variants are aquagenic urticaria, which causes rashes and aquagenic pruritus, which causes hives. Both are a common symptom of an allergy, but are not strictly related to allergic reactions.

  Re-do your entire plot after studying that, because your story as-is wouldn't work, for a number of reasons.

  First up, your solutions to the problem of a water-less human are a bit ridiculous. A full hazard suit just to keep away water sounds somewhat reasonable if the condition is unbearable, but at that point I would have expected her to die in the womb. Next up, if she's allergic to water, an IV drip isn't going to contain water. Sure, an honest mistake *might* happen, but any nurse that is that ignorant of a patient's needs should be fired and possibly sent to prison. Your choices of beverages are downright ridiculous, because milk and orange juice are both upwards of 80% water.

  Next up, a human *cannot* create an entirely new species in one evolutionary step. This girl could not be human, because her entire biochemistry would have to be re-done to compensate for a lack of a certain liquid. New digestive system, something to replace blood (which is 92% water), and something other than extracellular fluid. You're basically replacing the majority of the human body with *something else* and expecting it to work without redoing all the rest of her biochemistry. That would require a complete re-write of her genetic code to the point where I hesitate to describe this organism as terrestrial, let alone human.

  Finally, nobody's going to break into a house to shred the hazard suit that a little girl needs to live. If such an event were to occur, it would likely be just one person. Even a group of the biggest idiots imaginable would have one person be smart enough to say "Hey, maybe we shouldn't break into a little girl's house to ruin her life by destroying the one thing keeping her safe?". Really, your story flips from her being loved and pitied to being a pariah so fast it's ridiculous. Why does this event need to occur?

  Having briefly skimmed over your account, it looks like you're dedicated to writing this idea, and working hard to get the story to be 'realistic'. I can respect that, but as it stands, it's *not* realistic. It can work as a piece of fiction, but it's not going to be rational fiction, and there's **nothing wrong with that.** A story doesn't have to be 'realistic' to be taken seriously or not lose value as a dramatic piece. If you want to write a story about a girl who has to avoid water, you can do that, but don't think of your work as lesser because it's not anything like real-life.

      There's also a HeidiFalconer user on reddit that is *also* incessantly making posts on this topic, and the writing style feels similar. Not sure what the point is, but whatevs.

      I figured maybe they were trying one of those "social experiment" things where a true but unlikely story trips our bullshit filters and then after we finish dissecting how overwrought and unlikely it all is, they go AHA! and draw the curtain back, thus exposing our own biases and blind spots.

      Maybe they're just a troll though.

        It's rather silly really. "Here is a story with a lot of unlikely elements. How plausible is it?" 

        "Its really implausible. I'm like 95% sure this couldn't happen given the description."

        "Hah! Got you! I was describing a real thing. Guess you're not so smart."

        "Perish the thought that I rated a condition that has a single known case of the described severity is unlikely to occur."
        ```

          ```
          Also in OP's version the girl is allergic to water, rather than having a condition which is incorrectly called a water allergy. This reduces the plausibility a lot, because its also necessary to explain why her immune system is only reacting to external water and not the water in her body.

    Earlier this year it was stolen when thieves broke into Wendy and Dave's two-bedroom home in Tividale, West Midlands.       

    >After Heidi appealed for its return, the callous thugs left it in a carrier bag on their doorstep - cut to bits. 

    I don't even believe the news article. This sounds like something someone would for attention, I can't genuinely imagine someone doing this.

    >https://www.independent.co.uk/news/thieves-shatter-allergy-girls-life-1317690.html

    This story makes it seem like they were just normal thieves who stole everything and makes no mention of it being returning in pieces, in fact I can't find any other mention of that. Do you have another source that includes that?

    Edit: Also I am actually curious about the science behind milk and orange juice being ok even though they're mostly water.

    Edit 2: Ok I looked into it and she would be totally fine drinking water if it doesn't touch her skin. It's just an issue with her skin touching water, so I have absolutely no idea what on earth the whole drinking stuff is about.

      I don’t, and frankly I’m suspicious of the whole thing. There’s another article from The Independent that says that she just has ordinary AU and not this more extreme version, so I’m rather doubtful.

        It says her mother published a book called "It's Only Water" but I can find it nowhere. Nothing on google scholar either which I'm surprised about, figure if she's the only living person with the disease she's get a mention there.

        Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if all these articles and stuff are also fake and it's a triple level thing. I find it very believable that her parents would stage a theft and have her coat returned in shreds so they go to the papers and get money from being famous. I don't find thieves smart enough to break in when people are on holiday returning to the doorstep with her coat however many days later believable in the slightest.

        This is from when she was 12.

        >
        Now her mother, Wendy Falconer, 38, is looking for a publisher for 'It's Only Water' which chronicles Heidi's fragile life.       

        9 years later when she's 21 (in 2012)

        >A long-awaited book about her lifelong struggles, called It's Only Water, is finally set to be published.     

        >Proud mum Wendy, aged 47, said: "We have always been very protective towards Heidi, since the day she was born.

        Guess it's not published

        Edit 2: Also beginning to doubt the whole "of national fame" from how few newspapers wrote anything about her. No TV appearance or anything.

  You can get suspension-of-disbelief for basically anything, so long as you make it part of your premise.

  Chapter 1 can have some really unlikely or impossible things ("Jane was an ordinary girl, until she won the lottery 3 times in 3 weeks." / "Naruto was born in the hidden valley of Ninjas") and I'd accept them as price-of-admission to your story.

  The problem is that everything else needs to flow realistically.  That includes explanations for the premise, if you give them.

  One solution is to not explain stuff.  This happened in *Wicked*. The main character was alergic to water.  Tea was fine.  The reason was "Literal Magic."

  But, if you're going to make the water allergy a major part of your story (and not say 'magic!') then you need to give enough details that I, as a reader, can anticipate how your character would react to different things.

  In this case, "Water Based" is probably not the descriptor you want.  Orange juice, and IV fluids are water based.  So is blood.

  If you're making up a fake condition, I'd go with something like, "Heidi's cell boundaries are especialy vulnerable to reverse-osmosis.  Contact with ph-neutral water will sap minerals right out of her skin."

  That would be enough to give me intuition (rain=bad, OJ=fine, coke=fine, blood=fine) to follow the story.

  But, once that's established, you have "[sick kid] needs a space-suit and special treatment." 

  From there, the things that jump out at me are:

  1.  Why does everyone know about this person?  There are the occasional "sick kid" human interest stories, but they last for 6-months, tops.

  Are the kid's parents doing something to keep her in the news?  Because "munchausen-by-proxy, except the kid is actually sick" could be legitimately interesting. 

  What would it be like to be a kid who's on the lecture circuit as "brave child teaches you to appreciate life"?  Maybe your lectures -- which you've been giving since you were 8 -- lifted your family out of poverty, but mean that youv'e got to maintain this always-hopeful persona that you're coming to hate.

  2.  What kind of parent doesn't have a backup plan?

  Stuff breaks.  So, I'd expect the parents to have some kind of backup plan.  And, at a minimum, I'd expect the house to have a room with a dehumidifer.  Otherwise, how could the character scratch an itch or change her underwear?

  3.  Why would thieves break into this house?  There's no black-market for kid-sized space-suits.  And attempted murder of a kid would actually annoy the cops

  For posterity here is the post OP made:

  ---


  I'm writing a drama story, and one of the main characters (a human girl of 8 years old named Heidi Falconer - if the name sounds too 'fake' do tell) has an unusual weakness - she's allergic to H2O. She has to avoid water at all costs - for example in the story, one time she accidentally drunk a mouthful of water, and went into anaphylaxis, requiring adrenaline shots to reverse. She has to wear a special spacesuit like apparatus in case it rains as a single drop of rain will kill her, for example if she gets a single drop of rain in her mouth by accident, she will go into shock.

  She also has to avoid things like surgeries, her parents told the surgeons not to use any water on her as she's allergic and the surgeons took them seriously (in a world first - beforehand the surgeons always used water while operating on a patient), but after the surgery she had to be put on a medical drip (having water injected into her veins), and then went into anaphylaxis because the drip was water based.

  She hydrates herself by drinking 4 small glasses of milk or orange juice a day, which because of their chemical composition bring her no harm. She's 100% healthy as long as she avoids H2O as her immune system sees H2O molecules as foreign. She becomes famous in her country because of her allergy, stealing the hearts of residents near her.

  Another aspect to the story is she becomes a tragic hermit after a gang of cruel thieves break into her house and steal her 'spacesuit' and tear it up. She was born allergic, and while in her mother's womb she was kicking around a lot in pain.

  Does this story sound medically accurate? What would you rate it out of 10? The tone of the story is very serious and is meant to be taken seriously.

  Where is this set where a famous child has their house broken into by thieves who are motivated out of sadism?
