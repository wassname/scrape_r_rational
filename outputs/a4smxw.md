  Daaamn, so she's a priestess of night now, and it's increasingly looking like she will have to complete the Drow sidequest before being able to return to Callow.

  I like that the sisters didn't immediately take her at her word and *thoroughly* vetted her history before making the deal.

  Cat without the Queen position is gonna take some getting used to, but I love that she is becoming the snarky sidekick again, looking forward to shenanigans and Banter.

  I see now. Practical GUIDE to Evil is her Name.

    Ehs guides Evil and doesnâ€™t afraid of heights.

  Let me say, didn't expect this at all.

  Priestess of Night. Isn't that what Sve Noc was called at first?
  ```

    ```
    >"First among the priest hood of Night" 

    It seems her gamble paid off, she has an Ally, here's to hoping they don't treat her as crap as all her previous allies, she is mortal again, which means she doesn't have a Villain name, Priestess of night would definitely be that, and if anyone can tell the difference between being mortal or not it's Cat.
    ```

    - u/NZPIEFACE:
      ```
      I have a feeling it's less of an Ally and more of a Boss.
      ```

      - u/18scsc:
        ```
        Not so much a Boss, perhaps more a patron . Across multiple fantasy series, including Malazan Book of the Fallen which erraticerrata drew inspiration from for (at least) the goblin munitions, it's not uncommon for a mortal being gifted with such an investiture of power from a god has a certain ability to influence the god.
        ```

        - u/signspace13:
          ```
          Matron? Patron is distinctly masculine (though that's a tad pedantic). 

          Yeah, I agree with this the most, it would be interesting if she has her own unaligned capital G god, powering her new name, though honestly I don't think Priestess of Night suits her as a Name. Names are supposed to say something about the person, they *are* the Name as much as they are themselves, Warlord of Night or Herald of Night would probably fit her better, and it would be cool if she was being called Herald by everyone.
          ```

          - u/Zayits:
            ```
            Considered her approach to combat, she's really more of a paladin. A shame Ranker is gone, the joke about an Order of Black Hand isn't that funny with symmetry alone.
            ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        not sure, Cat wouldn't take well to being made a Peon, and they have been rifling through her memories like there's no tomorrow, so I Can't imagine they would find it a good Idea to force her into anything, she is their guide for now, but I feel like they will relieve her of that duty eventually.
        ```

        - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
          ```
          To be honest they probably saw the crazy shit that happened at the Fourfold Crossing in Liesse, and have realized that trying to subjugate Cat is how they both get brutally murdered.
          ```

          - u/Locoleos:
            ```
            Fourfold Crossing is first Liesse, right?
            ```

            - u/LordGoldenroot:
              ```
              No second. First is end of book 2 with William and contrition and second is Akua's Folly.
              ```

    - u/BlackKnightG93M:
      ```
      Difference is in what can be considered "mortal". Villains, as a rule, are immortal but they can still very much be killed. Heroes, as a rule, are not immortal but have longer life expectancy (assuming they can make it out of the starting area before Black has his way with them). 

      The ambiguity between what is a Name and what is a title make it difficult to see whether Cat is a mortal pleb or a mortal Named (EE, is it really too much trouble to simply italicise and bold new Names when they are introduced?). 

      But I digress. Priestess of Night was Sve Noc's Name and she could bestow it upon Cat on account of her being god now. We'll see what Wednesday brings.
      ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        This makes me wonder if Black reduced the average life expectancy of heroes in the area.

        Sure, heroes die all the time, but Black caught them super early and was really systematic about it.
        ```

- u/argentumArbiter:
  ```
  So is Cat now a lady of the Night?
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Was she ever not?
    ```

    - u/Banarok:
      ```
      formely she was night in the shape of a lady.
      ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  So the Dwarves are stronger than the King of the Dead? Sve Noc said that they can't handle the Dwarves at all, but they're willing to go up against the Dead King? Are they counting on support from the Dwarves and Procer as well, or is the Dead King that much easier to handle? Or is it a matter of type advantage, that Night can interact with the necromancy somehow?

  As a side note, it's been mentioned before that all of the powers shown so far save the Dwarves are just backwater countries that can't compare at all to the global stage, which really makes you wonder how strong the global powers are. If something like Sve Noc is second tier, then what's first tier? I wonder if the story will ever expand its scope. So far, all the mentions of the global powers, like the Gnomes, have just been for flavor. Is another, bigger antagonist going to show up after the current conflict is resolved?
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Ivah mentioned that killing the undead can indeed add to the Night, and that's without the fact that they would stand alone against the dwarves.

    First tier probably have actual pantheons instead of gods walling off their separate seats of power. My guess is that the series either ends on a conflict with a world power establishing Calernia on the global stage (but the introductions for that need to start soon, because EE initially had this point be halfway through the second to last book, and all the opponents that came without foreshadowing were pretty questionable), or the epilogue to the seventh book will be Cat's more optimistic version of "Tremble, for I am not yet content".
