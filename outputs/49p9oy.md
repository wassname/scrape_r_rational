  Making the hiatus more bearable. A bit of a slow chapter, but it certainly set up a lot for the next one. It also reminded me a bit of a feast from a Brian Jacques novel, which is both a good and bad thing (good more than bad, I think). 

  My only real worry is that you haven't really had a villain yet. There's been some emotional conflict, and that's all well and good, but I think the lack of any real antagonist is starting to make the story feel like it isn't headed anywhere. 

  Still, I'm enjoying this a great deal. You write the characters well using the rational style, and manage to capture their canon counterparts well enough that it feels like the show.

    Well, 'Slice-of-life' is right there in the tags.

    I know that there are some pacing problems, but I can't really skip over the nine or so important developments that I have planned before they capture Peridot.

      No worries dude! I'm still totally enjoying myself when I'm reading it. I've enjoyed the slice of life bits so far.

    This is one of the very few stories I've read where I feel like, even though it seems to have stalled, plot-wise, I don't care because it's just *that interesting!!!*
