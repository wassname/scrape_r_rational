This is my blog! You will like it. Or so help me, you will like it!

Do you like the name? I'm not sure if this is the name I want to stick with but it seems like it sounds kinda cool.

  Can you give us a pitch for your blog? You say that we'll like it. *Why*? What is it going to be about?

    Actually, I was just kidding. You won't like it. You definitely won't. There's nothing remotely interesting for you to see here. Just a bunch of boring, obscure and excessively complicated nerdy stuff, like literature, science, philosophy, rationality, customizable strategy gaming and anything else I feel like writing about. No, seriously, it's very dry and boring and only very dry and boring people read it. Don't click the link, you will regret it if you do.

      Sounds torturous. You sure it won't be violating the Geneva Conventions?

        Of course not! That would make it interesting.

          See, when you nest sarcastic tones like that, I get confused and assume either it *really is* boring, **or** it *really does* violate the Geneva Conventions.
