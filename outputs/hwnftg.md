Pyrebound is a dark, original world fantasy serial with a setting loosely patterned after the Ancient Near East (Sumer/Babylon).  Life is hard--they base their calendar around regularly occurring cosmic calamities--and virtually every part of human life is tainted with brutal power politics.  If you want to start from the beginning, [here's the link](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thanks as ever to all who read, like, comment, or what-have-you.
