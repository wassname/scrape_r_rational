  It's finally happening! All aboard the hype train!

  Also, I like how Zorian threw together a working replica of cerebro in a single day.
  ```

  - u/SnowGN:
    ```
    Just imagine what Zorian would have been capable of if he'd managed to physically escape the time loop with his notes and research and artifacts...
    ```

    - u/ksarnek:
      ```
      That was a tragedy! I initially thought that the time loop was a powerful bloodline magic used to train the heir of the family, so it had to have some way of taking all the acquired knowledge out of it, but I'm happy with the workaround Zorian found.
      ```

      - u/SnowGN:
        ```
        Is there a workaround Zorian found? As far as I know he's done it all the hard way.
        ```

        - u/exceptioncause:
          ```
          he saved many notebooks in memory
          ```

        - u/ksarnek:
          ```
          The time loop wants to prevent you from taking anything too substantial out of it, becoming a mind mage competent enough to store a few bookshelves worth of research in your own head is a workaround that solves that.

          It's definitely solving the problem the hard way, I agree. I just meant that it wasn't a mechanism there by design.
          ```

- u/None:
  ```
  >"I'm sorry. I couldn't find a solution no matter where I looked," Zorian said with a wooden voice, not a trace of emotion on his face.

  Probably doesn't need to be said, but Zorian is obviously lying here because the plan won't work if Zach believes there *is* a plan.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Yep, won't be surprised if the plan involves attacking Zach and forcefully memory-wiping him.
    ```

    - u/Slinkinator:
      ```
      I'm hoping that it requires Zorian liching himself and then let's himself die in front of Zach, in combination with his mind magic stuff.
      ```

      - u/ksarnek:
        ```
        Now I want a spin off with lich Zorian and QI forming the most badass and relentlessly competent duo
        ```

      - u/Brobroburgers:
        ```
        That would actually make sense
        ```

      - u/Lightwavers:
        ```
        Use Red Robe as the lich sacrifice.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          I'm not aware of any particular sacrifice requirement to become a lich. Dying is an inherent part of the process because your soul is being bound to something else.
          ```

          - u/Nepene:
            ```
            Normally you need to sacrifice people to get soul sight, but Zorian bypassed that issue.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              OK, yes, there is that sacrifice angle. (Although going that route actually tends to mean *lots* of sacrifices, since the procedure has a low success rate; aspiring necromancers just keep trying again.)
              ```

            - u/KamikazeHamster:
              ```
              Does his soul still have that marker? Can he use it now in some way?
              ```

              - u/-Fender-:
                ```
                Yes, Zorian still has the marker. He used it to contact Zach at the beginning of RL loop.
                ```

              >it's a good source of fuel

              Since when? Using other people's life force is generally considered to be impractically hard, and so the typical usage is simply to pay off a demon with it. Not helpful in this case.

              There's been no indication anywhere that becoming a lich can or should or usually does involve human sacrifice.
              ```

              - u/Lightwavers:
                ```
                Exactly! Pay a demon to help the ritual go off successfully. It may not been be needed with how powerful Z&Z are now, but it would be satisfying to see them feed Red Robe to a demon.
                ```

            - u/archpawn:
              ```
              They could just use one of those wraith bombs. Those have tons of fuel.
              ```

              - u/Lightwavers:
                ```
                Too many wards on them.
                ```

      - u/Sonderjye:
        ```
        I don't think that is really enough. Zach needs to think that everyone who knew about the timeloop died, not just Zorian.
        ```

    - u/MagicwaffIez:
      ```
      nah, i think the plan involves trapping zach in an illusion where the aranea, zorian, alanic, and xvim die. probably a wraith bomb going off or panaxeth being released (they made sure to mention that people are based on zach's perception, but the contingencies being triggered are *not*. so zach thinking panaxeth was released and killed everyone would work)

      zorian specifically worked on getting around mind blank, and zach doesn't know about that. zorian was also practicing making an illusion of cyoria with the aranea a few chs ago....
      ```

      - u/NZPIEFACE:
        ```
        > panaxeth being released 

        This would straight up kill him, would it not?

        If *he* thinks the primordial escaped, well...
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          It would not, because the contract has its own detection mechanism for that, *but* it would tip him off that his mind is being affected.
          ```

          - u/NZPIEFACE:
            ```
            I thought there were multiple detection methods in the contract for the same thing?

            Angels are dicks like that, from what I read.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              Nope. See chapter 98:

              >If the safeguards activated before the month was done, regardless of the reason why, Zach was considered to have failed in his mission. **Zach's perception did not matter here** – the contract could detect the activation of the safeguards innately, and was apparently tied to them on some intangible level. Zorian could not detect this connection on Zach, but the contract claimed it existed, so it probably did.

              Emphasis added.
              ```

        - u/MagicwaffIez:
          ```
          ah sorry i meant, 'an illusion of panaxeth being released'
          ```

          - u/NZPIEFACE:
            ```
            Wouldn't the contract trigger anyways if Zach sees Panax out and about?

            If he thinks any of the conditions are met, he dies. That's how the contract works.
            ```

            - u/MagicwaffIez:
              ```
              nope~ 
              ch 98
              >One was that the release of the primordial was tied to the activation of the divine safeguards on its prison. If the safeguards activated before the month was done, regardless of the reason why, Zach was considered to have failed in his mission. Zach’s perception did not matter here – the contract could detect the activation of the safeguards innately, and was apparently tied to them on some intangible level....


              > the good news was that the enforcement of that particular clause of the contract depended entirely on Zach’s own perception, just like Zorian suspected. Zach was the one who determined whether a violation of the contract had occurred or not. If someone knew about the time loop but Zach never found out about it, the contract would never know either. It pulled information straight from Zach’s senses, thoughts, and memories


              it says 'that particular clause' refering to people knowing about the time loop. so if zach didn't know ppl knew, then it won't activate. but the panaxeth part is based in the safe guards triggering, zach's perception be damned
              ```

              - u/NZPIEFACE:
                ```
                I had a feeling that Zach's perception was also another safeguard.
                ```

      - u/ksarnek:
        ```
        This makes a lot of sense, it would be a reasonable solution
        ```

      - u/nipplelightpride:
        ```
        If zach thinks he sees panaxeth get released, but doesn't perceive himself die, I think he's smart enough to know something's up.
        ```

        - u/MagicwaffIez:
          ```
          hm~ fair. 
          then it's probably an illusion if a wraith bomb going off
          ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      I'm fairly confident his plan is to combine his research into getting around mind blank, his practice with Spear of Resolve on editing perceptions of reality, and the magic graffiti he secretly spread around town.

      Specifically, he's going to alter Zach's perceptions while he's under mind blank to show Zorian dying.  Since Zach has every reason to think Mind Blank is inviolate he'd believe fully honestly that Zorian's dead, and thus the secret of the time loop is left to only him (after some much less harmful memory shenanigans with Xvim, Alanic, etc.), and the contract is fulfilled.

      And then, once Zach is freed from the contract, Zorian reveals that he's alive after all, and both of them get to live.
      ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      >forcefully memory-wiping him

      More likely an illusion of everyone's death IMO.
      ```

      - u/Slinkinator:
        ```
        I concur, I just really want Zorian to go full lich, and I can imagine there being a convoluted reason for him to go full lich to convince Zach beyond a doubt that he's dead.  


        But, you're right, it's probably just a fully immersive delusion/illusion.

    >I worried this Staff might be in RRJornak possession.

    Dubious. There's no teleport transit between Altazia and Blantyrre. Silverlake would tell RRJornak even Zach/Zorian require an airship to cross the distance initially, relying on Bakora gate afterward. We can safely assume the scepter is still in Violet Eye's possession.

    But hey, let's entertain the idea, what's use of 12 charge of teleport staff for battle that happen in a single city? Sure, it'll immensely help the Church contain the wraith bombs, especially if priests capable in containing them is rare among their rank. But what use of it for Zach/Zorian? *Gasp*, we unintentionally found a topic for Saturday Munchkinry Thread!
    ```

    - u/KingofAcedia:
      ```
      You have to remember, RR has the Dragons on his side, I don't know the importance of the term 'Dragon Mage', if that means they are related to dragons or if it's an empty title, but RR could order a Dragon to retrieve the staff.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Dragons have inherent magical abilities like flight and fire-breathing, but some of them do practise more generalised structured magic. It's on the high-power/low-control end of things, because dragons, but it's still a magic system. Documented on [the worldbuilding blog](https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/07/02/sapient-species-of-the-world/) (with lots of clarifications in the comment section).
        ```

        I'd like to think alliance between Oganj group and RedRobe as something of convenience. That means, neither side will go out of limb to accommodate the other, ie: Oganj won't help RedRobe steal Imperial Scepter from Violet Eye.

        Unfortunately not possible. Even disregarding all of the defences that he would surely have (because if you can get close enough to touch him, there are lots of simpler ways to kill him, so he's bound to have ways to stop that from happening), the staff only works to take you to markers that you've previously set. You would have to travel out to the middle of the ocean manually first, and if that's practical, then it would also be practical for Jornak to travel back.
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    >When Zach ask about shifter thing I thought it will be Zorian Grey Hunter shifter

    No, he's unlikely to do that. The author has explained before that the grey hunter's omnicidal personality would first influence him and then more dramatically influence any children he might have.
    ```

    - u/Komier_:
      ```
      I doubt any of the main characters will make themselves shifters; it seems a thing that requires a community to maintain. Zorian already has his psychic bloodline eating into hit total mana, but knows enough blood magic to give himself another bloodline on the cheap. Since he's already mastered his psychic one, and would be the progenitor of the other/s, he would be able to train or make a training regimen for his family. 

      He could found his own noble house on the back of this if he were so inclined. Dimensionalism from tunneler toad and psychic would be useful headstarts into difficult and secretive fields for his family.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        >if he were so inclined

        I rather doubt this. He's not really interested in politics, and even if he hasn't succeeded in keeping a low profile, he's not going to be enthused by the prospect of gathering even more attention. Not unless he decides that founding a noble House is essential for some reason, maybe crown protection or some such.
        ```

        - u/namnaminumsen:
          ```
          He can make a discrete/secret family with hidden powers, that keeps out of formal politics.

              They'd probably be the most emotionally stable Noble House in existence :).

      Isn't it supposed to be the villains who are told to release the princess?

      It's too late, anyway; Zorian and Princess are already married. Muhahaha!
      ```

- u/megami-hime:
  ```
  We've finally reached the final battle! And so much for Zorian's plans to stay quiet and hidden after it's all over, eh?

  It's pretty neat just how many parallels there are between Zorian and Jornak. Both are resentful young men who are incredibly meticulous and crazy-prepared, with their strenghts lying in said plans rather than pure strength. They're both like Batman; When versus someone, it's just a matter of how much time they have to prepare.

  Jornak has Zorian's pragmatism and pettiness turned up to eleven, and unlike Zorian whose resentfulness and anger toned down as he progressed, Jornak's just got more and more intense.

  I think it's rather brilliant to use Rea's smelling sense to deduce Zorian's involvement. Keeping cat as pet myself, I think cats are awful sniffer. But repeated exposure from unexpected source will indeed strengthen the suspicion. Bravo. Anyway, including mine, I counted at least three comment questioning how Rea's able to ambush Zorian last chapter. Did the discussion help you refine the logic behind today's chapter, author? Rea knowledge of Zorian's absence from class is what solidify the plot, because smell is rather feeble in its lonesome.

  \-- Onto the praise for the chapter:

  > “Look, what do you even expect of me?” Zorian asked Rea, frowning at her slightly. “I don’t know where any kidnapped children are being kept. Do you think I would just sit on that information if I knew?” 

  For Rea, this basically confirmed Zorian's rather high position in the conspiracy. Zorian's at least the chief among the group's scouts. Brilliant subtlety! We can expect Zorian will have some measure of fame among the cat shifters.

  > “Success,” simulacrum number one mumbled.

  It's rather dubious for Haslush to catch on previous quote. He's not portrayed as sharp as Rea after all. But this quote, if Haslush heard it, he will start to think Zorian is a great diviner. He might even think Zorian is Mr Kesir's apprentice! How could Haslush not when Zorian can tell the spell is successful when he is virtually separated from the ritual. We can expect, at least, Haslush consulting Zorian in solving cases in the future, if not zealously trying to recruit him to the force. Cool stuff!

  \-- Criticism

  None really. Typo is rather worse than usual, and double delay is painful. But the end product is as excellent as always.

  \-- Personal note

  Aw, Zorian failed at playing down his involvement. While it will net him positive reputation from Rea and Haslush, the ship for Raynie could be threatened. Romance rarely blossom from asymmetric relationship. In today's chapter, Zorian could be seen as savior for Raynie's woe. If I'm Raynie, I would see Zorian with great measure of gratitude and respect. But for romance? She might be reluctant for it. More reluctant than when both of them are virtual stranger.
  ```

  - u/distrofijus:
    ```
    There's a kinda pretty large shortcoming/issue author overlooked. if you think about simulacra, it is just an ectoplasma or some golem. How would that think smell? 

    It should stand out very easily for Rea or Rayne. Two simulacra beside her or the one near Rea should have no own smell. So they should have noticed that. Any shifter with improved sense of smell (canine/feline based) should be able to identify simulacra.

    So what are the chances all those people interacted with original before visiting Rea and carried his smell. (and not the original odorless simulacra). 

    u/nobody103 - the body odor comes from physical sweat glands. Is it oversight? While it would be possible do strap some add-on which would spread some smell, but any shifter should be able to sniff it out.
    ```

    - u/nobody103:
      ```
      The smell should be there, since Zorian has to create all the simulacrums and they weak clothes and use tools that he made for them... but it would be way fainter than that of the original Zorian, as one of the other comments noted. I think Rea and other scent-capable shifters would know the simulacrums were very weird, but wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that they're fake copies. They mostly behave like real Zorian and know everything he does, they're tangible, and Rea probably never encountered that type of magic before. She'd probably think Zorian was doing something weird to himself, which would add to the mystery but not exactly tell her *what*.
      ```

      - u/distrofijus:
        ```
        you are the author here, but I would argue that shifters and their heightened senses should be very effective against simulacra. 

        It is not just the sweat/smell. Every living person breathes and shifters should be able to spot breathing patterns very easily, especially if they are making. Also this is supposed to be end-of-summer and usually this is the hottest season - so no sweating should be very noticeable. 

        Besides smells, the other senses would work very well identifying living body. Polygraphs work by monitoring reactions on very tiny detailed levels. Did the heartbeat accelerated? Maybe some extra sweat/whatever. The shifters with their senses would keep very high attention on the person (to check if they are lying) - the matter is related to the very close relatives. Any shifter worth their cost would try to monitor heart beat and most likely fail to detect it.   With large focus with super powerful senses from shifter side the simulacra would trip a LOT of alarms. 

        I would argue that golem frame helps with mana usage and durability, but there should be a negative impact on stealth. At least at some stages solution to moving golem was pre-record some actions (like move a hand) instead of low level management - but those records, also no need for muscles/whatever of golem to spend energy while being frozen should push simulacra into "uncanny valley" area. Some perfect-still-freezes, repetitive/exactly the same motions - if anyone is paying close attention, there should be some stiff movements to give it out. 


        It is not that hard to fix too. Zorian would kick himself for not spotting this earlier and he needs to make a mental note to not sent simulacra to interact with shifters. Also he might ask via his simulacra Alanic - is there a way to fool shifters and their senses and have simulacra present at the meeting instead of real body. 


        At the ritual site he is being in person and the simulacra doing the ritual are less important. 


        There's alse one random scene previously where simulacra invites Rayne to the date to spike original off. She could have noticed the difference about Zorian, especially since the invitation - she would pay a close attention. 


        In general, this would undermine usability of simulacra spell by allowing some easy detection on a lot of scenarios. It is too OP, needs nerf :)
        ```

        - u/AKAAkira:
          ```
          If I can butt into the conversation, I don't think a simulacrum ever asked Raynie out. Zorian's interactions with her ended before he learned the simulacrum spell. I think you're confusing the event with when a simulacrum invited Akoja out.

          You bring up some good points though, with how Rea was mentioned to have superior hearing before she probably is at a level where she should be able to hear a simulacrum's lack of heartbeat. That said, I can think of two arguments against her noticing it (at this point in time). One is that she only encountered the simulacrum Zorian this chapter, when she was a little freaked out about how highly Zorian was connected, so she might just not have noticed it yet. Two, if she ever worked as some kind of agent against mages, as some cat shifters probably would, it's not unreasonable to think she encountered mages behind silencing wards before, which would prevent any sound from leaking out from their area, and she could simply be assuming simulacrum-Zorian was using something similar for some reason.

          I don't think simulacra are controlled purely by magic though, in the way you're describing, to the level of having to puppeteer its body. Both ectoplasmic and golem simulacra has its castor's mind copy attached (as well as being able to share the castor's soul), so whatever body movement tics original-Zorian had should still be reflected in his simulacrum, except maybe for chest movement from breathing. And I would be surprised if the ectoplasmic shell failed to replicate approximately the muscles just under the skin, since the skin is one thing that's duplicated in its entirety, in contrast to the copy's innards.
          ```

          - u/distrofijus:
            ```
            It is not just heartbeat though. Breathing would also stand out a lot.

            It is said that dogs can sniff out lung cancer. Is person high (on some drugs or alcohol)? Maybe he ate something wrong - a lot of information could be picked up from the breath and if someone is evaluating the other party, I don't think they would omit such important thing (o lack of it) in principle.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              Cats aren't quite the same as dogs, though. Better senses than humans, but not dog-level sense of smell.

              Maybe Raynie could tell that more is wrong, but she's much less experienced than Rea, especially in espionage-related skills, and she's in a very stressful situation where she probably has a hard time focusing on anything.
              ```

              - u/distrofijus:
                ```
                I'm pretty sure the cats not being  used as cat-sniffers is more related to the fact that they are much more harder to train than dogs and not to physical ability.

                Cats clean themselves up (lick?) so they would have as little smell as possible. 

                anyway random google suggests:
                Scent

                Our canine friends have an amazing sense of smell, and we use their scenting ability in many ways. However, cats have an even better sense of smell and can identify differences between a larger variety of scents

                Dogs and cats are crepuscular rather than nocturnal animals. Their eyesight is designed to pick up on the slightest movement in the low light of the twilight hours of dusk and dawn. They can also see ultraviolet light which is invisible to us.

                Dogs and cats use their ears to express emotions, and both have remarkable hearing. Even in the wee hours of the night the world is a noisy place for our pets. Dogs have 18 muscles in their ears allowing them to move each ear independently to better detect where a sound is coming from. They can hear frequencies up to around 45,000 hertz.

                Cats have an even greater range of movement with 32 muscles that allow them to rotate their ears 180 degrees, and they can hear at higher frequencies than dogs – up to 100,000 hertz.

                Bottom line – both dogs and cats have amazing senses!
                ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          I think you're confusing regular golems with simulacrum golems. Regular golems might have an uncanny valley, but these ones have complete copies of Zorian's mind in them; they'll move like he does. And since they can talk, I assume they have some kind of breathing.
          ```

          - u/distrofijus:
            ```
            They talk via magic/sound illusion (like spear of resolve spoke to the alchemist when they visited the underground at the start of the story).

            Yes, I am aware of simulacra attached to golem frame - simulacra controls golem directly, not remote control. I don't think the design is that much more different from combat golems Zorian was creating, just on different scale  (the base at least). 

            Anyways, even if it is directly attached, is it really a exact copy of human skeleton? It should have too much freedom or too little - there are some limitation human body has - like muscles and tendons. Golem is being moved via animation spells, AFAIK, so the freedom range is much large. Also, when a regular human is idle, (like the command to body is - be still), we are still using/balancing muscles, alternating them. shifting from one leg to another, etc. - all those micro movements. The golem can be perfectly still - there's no need to compensate/balance the body for it constantly. Even if some of the stuff can be animated, since it is being by spell, it should be exactly the same and humans are very very good at spotting patterns. 

            IIRC, the design goals for simulacra golems were survival and upkeep concerns. There might have been some other goals strapped on - but I'm sure the stealth/mimicry of the real human body is not the top priority.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:

              >IIRC, the design goals for simulacra golems were survival and upkeep concerns. There might have been some other goals strapped on - but I'm sure the stealth/mimicry of the real human body is not the top priority.

              Ah, but that changed in chapter 74; the simulacrums all went on strike until Zorian assigned two of them the full time job of improving their frames. In chapter 79, simulacrum #2 noted that the golem frames now felt indistinguishable from a normal body.
              ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        With Zorian's smell being so faint, wouldn't Rea notice the smell of the metals and other materials that the golems are made from? Unless the golems are wearing visible armor, there would be no apparent reason for a strong metallic smell.
        ```

        - u/nobody103:
          ```
          I'm not really that well versed in scent-based abilities of cats to know an answer to that. My opinion is that she would notice the simulacrum is very weird but that she would still assume it was Zorian because he behaves and talks like him, and does have his scent on it. As for the foreign smells (metallic or otherwise), that would arouse her curiosity but wouldn't tell her enough to guess what was *really* going on.

          But that's just my opinion. As I said, I actually knows very little about cat's sense of smell, other than it being a lot keener than that of a human.
          ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      If the simulacrum is golem based, Zorian's smell should linger there. They're stored in his personal workshop after all (I can smell my own smell in the house if I left long enough). But indeed, it should be faint. Magnitudes fainter than flesh and blood Zorian. Great one spotting the problem!
      ```

  - u/bumbiedumb:
    ```
    I got a feeling that cat shifters can smell emotions the same way an open could sense emotion. Like at the start of this loop she could sense that zorian is feeling very impatient/melancholic.

  I'm pretty sure whatever illusion Zorian cooks up is not going to target Zach exclusively. We will probably see Zorian die at the end of the next chapter or the chapter after that (at the end of the final fight). 

  The thing is if only Zach saw it even if he was under mind blank at the moment it might not be enough to convince him. But with all the telepathic relays around the city Zorian can convince Zach that he and some other key figures who have knowledge of the time loop died (some of them will actually die though).  

  Once some of the contingencies trigger after his death along with the massive illusion which happens during/after the fight, Zach will no longer need to die. This is all necessary because Zach already knows Zorian was trying to find a way to bypass the rules of his contract so he will already be suspicious that shenanigans might be at play so he will need overwhelming evidence in order to actually believe that they all conveniently died even after they won the war.  

  This is also why Zorian might actually go to lich route if it is necessary to sell the lie. He doesn't drink/get laid anyway :D and any other pleasure I'm pretty sure he can use self illusions :) not getting laid though because he doesn't know what that feels like...
  ```

  - u/hallo_friendos:
    ```
    What? How would targeting more people than just Zach with the illusion make a difference? Why would anyone have to actually die? And aren't the telepathic relays just so that Zorian can affect Zach's mind when he's supposed to be out of range? Did I miss something?
    ```

    - u/mrasiteren:
      ```
      There was a passage where it said - and I might be misremembering - that Zach had a compulsion to hunt down those who knew the details of his contract with angels. But that compulsion ceased after a while. And if I'm not wrong, quite a few people like Alanic are also at least aware that there is a contract in place. So those people need to die or at least appear to die. There is also a similar rule regarding knowledge about the time loop.

      I think Zach might not believe what he sees and might investigate afterwards as to what really happened including asking questions to other people and their answers might convince him further. Like Taiven crying about it and Hashlush bringing a letter to Zach (or sth similar) as per the will of Zorian. So I believe a mass illusion including multiple people might sell the lie better.

      And I think people will actually die because they are about to engage in the final battle and it would be unbelievable if no body important really died...
      ```

      - u/hallo_friendos:
        ```
        No guarantees about my memory either, but I think the compulsion was only if his mind was read, and the thing about him having to kill everyone who knew was just Silverlake interpreting "otherwise he'll die" as "must". But yeah, we do still need for Zach to think they're all dead.

        I'd been assuming there wouldn't *be* an afterwards. I'd also been assuming the final battle would happen on the night of the summer festival, and I forgot to take into account the change. Now that you mention it, Zorian might not be able to keep up a convincing illusion for 24 hours straight, in which case there's complications like you say. Wait, can he just trade off with simulacrums? They need to sleep, but it doesn't have to be at the same time, right? (Also, I have no idea how tricky it is to fake everyone's reactions like that. The matriarch did see some flaws in his illusion when he was testing, so it might be worth making it last as short as possible.)

  Why do they think there are more bombs in Cyoria? I understand more than one like Zorian said, but the plan is to destroy the town via invasion and Primordial, and the wraiths should only trigger upon Jornak's death (Or tampering, but I find that unlikely to happen during the invasion), and they should take alot of time to make, so shouldn't they just plant the bombs meant for Cyoria in the Capital? The fact that there's one they've found one in the city does prove there is a reason for them to be there, but I feel like it's a waste of resources when you not only plan to win, but also have 2 ways to devastate the city. Plus Wraiths take time to make more Wraiths, so seems like they would be less help than the mercenaries they hired.

    The wraith bombs are a combination of leverage throughout the month - "Make a truce with me or expect mass deaths" - and revenge on the world if RR loses.

              I'm not sure of that. Sure she would prefer keep her body and she succesed to gain physical longevity, but she would not want die either. Just see her reaction when Alanic mock the fact that becoming a lich is not true immortality (reference to his belief in afterlife). Also she can't create simulacrum...

  I get that it wouldn't really be a "zorian" thing to do, but I was really hoping that other people would realize just how powerful zorian is/he would tell them. Im a sucker for those kind of things. 

  ps. Zorian is too powerful. Kinda makes no sense. You can't master that many forms of magic only within 8 years. It is literally impossible.  

  double ps. Zorian is too powerful to let live after the invasion. The angels or someone else will kill him when they realize exactly how powerful he is.

  Edit: I dont want to reply to everyone, but consider like the royal family. They have unlimited money. Access to all the illegal magic. Access to the best tutors, best mages in the country. Are any them near zorian level?

  - u/eSPiaLx:
    ```
    honestly, its a combination of things. One big thing is that a lot of this knowledge is forbidden. Gates might be difficult to learn, but I think a bigger reason why most people don't use gates is because they don't know how. 

    Zorian not only gets to steal knowledge from people with impunity due to being mind mage/time loop wiping out consequences, he also partnered with several extremely powerful/intelligent mages towards the end of the time loop to do intense research. Other than the extreme expertise of Xvim, Alanic, Silverlake, etc, theres also the government scientists he coopted, and all the aranea he worked with. Zorian learns through his simulacrums, as well as giving himself mind modifications to be smarter, as well as natural higher-processing abilities as a natural mind mage.

    All those things plus being able to spend those years studying under intense pressure (end of the world), with nigh-unlimited resources and no physical risks no matter how crazy his experiments, it makes sense that if anyone were to become that skilled in 8 years, itd be zorian.

    Zorian died dozens of times, spent far more money than he would have seen in his entire normal life, and engaged in a lot of morally/legally dubious behavior in those 8 years, not to mention all the time spent in Time Chambers. He was also powerfully motivated the whole time he was in the loop.

    He was also born with a rare and powerful innate ability. I don’t think it is that far fetched.

    Although I also entertain the thought that Zorian's growth speed is improbably fast, you are mistaken. He had far more than 8 years after all - his time in Black Rooms alone is more than 2 years. But most importantly, he's one of the very few people, possibly even the only one in existence, that can use simulacrums for training like he's Naruto - normal people, even if they can cast the spell, don't get the simulacrums' memories back when those dispel. That could have multiplied his effective training time by several degrees!

    My theory is that it's because Zorian and Zach are, physically, teenagers. It's much easier to learn e.g. an instrument when you're young. Perhaps there's an optimal age for magic-learning, and Zorian and Zach have been stuck at that age for 8 years

    If you focus on shaping which very few people do it actually seems very doable to become a multimage quickly. Also don't simulacrums do research on their own making it a lot more than 8 years in the loop?
    ```

    - u/SpeculativeFiction:
      ```
      Shaping is tedious and difficult, and shows results slowly, so it makes sense that a lot of people don't bother with it--I'd compare it to math or science in real life.

      What hasn't made sense to me is that the noble families, who have tons of money and desire for strong/useful heirs, don't force their kids to practice shaping before they send them to college.

      A few years of practice would give them a huge edge. Xvim sort of explains that shaping is viewed as mostly useless, but that doesn't make a lot of sense to me, given that any advanced mage should know you need shaping skills for more complex magic (and it lets you stretch your mana reserves, effectively increasing your mana pool.)

      The government should have a similar incentive to have this done (especially as most of them are probably expecting a war.), but instead they just have four years of schooling, starting at 14 or so.

      Maybe magic isn't usable until you're older? Zorian did mention that Kirielle likely couldn't do much, when she asked him to teach her, but I ascribed that to him basically blowing her off, as he thought she would get to learn in a few years.

      If that's the case, then the current situation makes a lot of sense. Shaping takes a lot of effort and time which you aren't spending learning theory and spells, which are more immediately useful.

        I'm a math and physics major. Most people I meet outside of these majors either think these types of subjects are too boring, difficult, or even useless. Surprising though it may be, "when am I ever going to use this?" is the canonical response to struggling with math or science. And yet STEM degrees are very powerful tools for success, meanwhile they don't require genius. All that's needed is a lot of hard work. And I'd say the work is likely way more interesting than shaping exercises.

        For these reasons, it's entirely believable to me that hardly anyone invests the time to learn shaping when in the real world, math departments are among the most underpopulated on most campus. And even then, most students who pass though math departments do so just to meet one or two graduation requirements for statistics or are engineers who only take through differential equations or linear algebra, which is hardly anything; stopping before real analysis means they don't really have any sense of what math beyond calculation feels like.

          To stretch your analogy further, Zorians' situation would be like you going up to the greatest professors in the world. Hand them a million you got from a lottery ticket and ask them to tutor you for a month for 8 hours a day. 

          Add in a massive mental capacity that comes with having simulacrums, and the ability record memories and memorize books... Give it a few loops and you'd probably have a somewhat narrow, but exceptionally strong foundation to theory education in the subject. 

          Don't forget to add in the pressure that if you don't learn it perfectly. You die.

    > Zorian is too powerful. Kinda makes no sense. You can't master that many forms of magic only within 8 years. It is literally impossible. 

    I kinda sad people point to shaping exercise as the main cause for Zorian awesomeness. It contributes, but it's not that. It's the loop. Receiving feedback for whatever you do is immense boon and Sovereign Gate gives more than ample amount of that. Without immediate feedback provided, the cutting edge mage can only do guesswork to advance their skill. Guesswork costs resources that can't be recouped, opportunity that might only happen once in a lifetime, and above all, time. Both time that spent on deliberate consideration on where your resources should be allocated, and time that was sunk for failed enterprise. Outside time loop, the skill advancement is several magnitude slower!

    There's also a bonus of existential threat to keep him motivated.

    \---

    > Is there anyone in the entire world, save for the lich who can match zorian's incredible breadth and depth? 

    There must be. We haven't seen Hsan at all. And Quatach Ichl is still a better archmage than Zorian. I think he's vastly superior!

    \---

    > Zorian is too powerful to let live after the invasion. The angels or someone else will kill him when they realize exactly how powerful he is.

    I really don't like this train of thought. It's silly and forced. This is one reason why I dislike Metropolitan Man (fanfic by Alexander Wales). If Zorian is a menace, sure. But if he isn't, letting a sleeping dragon sleep is more rational course of action. And why angels want to kill him for his exceptional skills? Your thought process must be an esoteric one if not outright flawed to think the angel wish the world deprived of slightly skilled human.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I don't think that the angels would worry too much about Zorian's skills, which are above average for mortals, but hardly a threat on the divine radar.

      However, they might be concerned about his knowledge of the Sovereign Gate. Zach's contract was quite insistent about keeping that secret. If he couldn't find a way to beat the invasion without sharing it, he was never supposed to return to the real world. And it makes sense to stop people from using the Gate, since we know that Panaxeth has partially subverted it. Having the knowledge become widespread, with all the governments in the world fighting for the next 400 years to collect the Key and mark a Controller of their choice...yeah, there's no way that that could end well.

      - u/sambelulek:

    But, the angels are not coming down to kill Quatach-Ichl, are they? They seem to be only concerned with the Primordials. Besides if they would not have allowed someone that powerful to live, then why do the whole business with pseudo-time-travel-training? Their contract was basically 'we give you an incredible opportunity to learn and be powerful, you just have to prevent the primordial summoning'.

    So if we leave out the angels, there are not a lot of people that can kill him aside from his fellow time traveler and Quatach-Ichl. Maybe concentrated effort of government and archmages will do.

    But the Sovereign Gate is *not* a connection to Panaxeth any more. See chapter 90: Panaxeth was attached to the Gate in order to make the loop work. With the loop now over, Panaxeth no longer has any special connection to the Gate.

    I mean, it's not the first time that the author specified that it only worked within the time loop. I interpreted it more as him noticing that he may not have been explicit enough in the past for some readers and deciding to completely remove any ambiguity for them.
    ```

  - u/AKAAkira:
    ```
    What the others said. And considering the Sovereign Gate is some kind of "attachment" that could work its magic with any primordial, there's no need for it to continue to keep a connection to Panaxeth after the loops were done, since there's a possibility it'll have been moved closer to a different primordial by the time (and if) it activates again.
