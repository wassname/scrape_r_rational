  FUCK

  nauk was one of my favourite side characters
  ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    He died one book and a half ago, against Summer. What's left was barely a character, even in-story.
    ```

      i was hoping she was going to con a priest or something to revive the rest of him.
      ```

    - u/thunder_crane:
      ```
      Can someone give me a rundown of what happened to him? I think I've totally forgotten about it. In my mind he was still just a normal orc dude like in the beginning of the story.
      ```

      - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
        ```
        as far as I remember his command got hit with a full blast of summer during an assault against those golden summer warriors, and warlock sort-of-but-not-really revived him. summer burnt most of his body and most of who he was as a person.
        ```

- u/Rice_22:
  ```
  Abigail will probably end up Queen after Catherine steps down at this rate.
  ```

  - u/razorfloss:
    ```
    And she will cursing the entire way. I can see it now queen Abigail the relactant she hated her job.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I've thought it was heading that way for a while.  Why else would it keep switching to the view of some random Callowan who's a foil for Catherine?  I'm not quite sure why Erratic keeps offscreen killing fairly major non-Named, and then gives a relatively unimportant character like Captain a bazillion funerary chapters.

    &#x200B;

    I really hope it doesn't end with Queen Abigail though.  Giving tons of power to the military is never a great idea for any civic society.

      Death happens. It comes and goes unanounced. I, for one, like the realism of named characters dying offscreen. That's what happens all the time in the real world.
      ```

    - u/Allian42:
      ```
      I think it's more of a literary tool. Having the death occur off screen invokes in the reader a similar feeling than the protagonist has upon learning of the death without a chance for farewells.
      ```

    - u/Rice_22:
      ```
      Nauk has, as mentioned elsewhere ITT, ceased to become an important character after his first death. He's no longer a major character in the plot unlike Akua or Black or even newer characters like the Tyrant or the Sisters (and thus semi-invulnerable to sudden death).

      I'm not sure what EE was going with this by killing him off a second time, and I understand people are kind of miffed on why. Seems like a dropped plot line. What was the point of his revival?
      ```

      - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
        ```
        It seems like theres a bunch of characters that are important to the plot but not important to the Plot getting killed off-screen.

        Maybe unimportant is the wrong word though. they dont have the kind of Plot weight that Akua/Black/all the other Named have, and so them living or dying happens at the mercy of the Plot momentum swirling around the other characters. My guess is that Cats friends dying off is Below putting their fingers on the scales in order to try and shape Cat to their liking.
        ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      Captain was the first of the Cataclysms to die, which is a pretty big thing for most of the major characters.
      ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  > General Abigail

  YES!

  All shall hail Dread Empress Callowan, The Inexplicably Successful!
  ```

- u/vimefer:
  ```
  I'm puzzled by the granite / marble / limestone tidbit. Marble and limestone are worse materials to make weather-exposed sculptures out of, because they get dissolved by most acids (including ordinary rain) as they're mostly calcite ; while granite, being mostly quartz, doesn't dissolve. It's harder to carve too. It's usually uglier though, I'll grant you that. I'd expect granite and marble to be comparably rare and expensive to extract ; whereas limestone, which is just sedimentary, is typically the cheaper plentiful kind of rock, being common and very easy to carve.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Limestone is plentiful on planets which have billions of years of oceans, like ours. We have no idea what the history of Creation implies about its crust, however.
    ```

    - u/vimefer:
      ```
      Good point.
      ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    I imagine that cat doesnt know any of that and was just looking for a reason to rag on Procer
    ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  "Relief" my ass, Nauk got off-screened :(
  ```
