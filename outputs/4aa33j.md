  Try asking tomorrow, in the Monday General Rationality thread.  

  The mods want to keep the main part of this sub focused explicitly on *fiction*, and I support them in their decision.

  You can't train your brain to be smarter with brain games. Your speed of thinking and clarity are mostly limited by your genetics.

  You can do a little by living healthier- eat well, exercise, sleep decent hours and that will improve your mind a bit, but your intelligence is mostly fixed.

  Some drugs can do a bit. You can improve your attention span with various cocaine like drugs, painkillers can let you work while in pain. If you have a notable deficiency in these areas that can help. If you're tired caffeine can help you be less limited. Ethanol can fix some social intellect issues.

  If you spend a huge amount of time learning various memory tricks you can learn to fix short term memories in your long term memory faster, although it's a lot of effort.

  Personally I use a notepad to record stuff, so I don't really need to remember much more. I have a smart phone which remembers a lot of my calendar details, which I keep on silent most of the time to avoid distractions. 

  There are lots of ways to improve specific skills, which is much more productive. If you want a protagonist to be improving themselves I'd recommend more having them be smart in their choice of what to learn and research how to best learn that skill.
