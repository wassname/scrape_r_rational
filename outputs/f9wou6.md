  That played out a little different than I expected. As soon as the croaking started I knew they were gonna be players (since wandering mobs haven’t been a thing this stage) but I was thinking they would slaughter them all and Nathan would only figure it out afterwards from the Analyze Enemy profile. 

  It’s too bad he had to use Snare, I’m guessing he didn’t use analyze on the downed enemy (before realizing they were players) to save up for a possible First Aid. 

  For a first encounter they did pretty damn well given the range of possible outcomes. The frogs seemed to be better leveled for combat given almost all their members had either a defensive or concealment skill. Trying for a diplomatic route could have gotten them all killed by invisible ambush. 

  Now, if I had to guess I would think that the Languages skill will actually be pretty important in future stages if it’s upgrade allows the player to speak all the *other species’* most common language, not just their own. Every group will have a designated diplomat or something. 

  It’ll be interesting if Nathan tries to rally the group and hunt down the runner. It’s probably the best possible option that would even keep diplomacy in the future open, if none of the frogs know their first contact ended in a slaughter. Just one more hunting party overwhelmed by the wave...

    That was what I thought the upgrade would be as well. Like the 5 most common language of each player species.

    You know, it occurs to me that only Iliya's enemy died without Nathan's direct involvement. Nathan dealt the killing blow to the frogs who killed Alexander, and downed two others himself early in the ambush. The runner is Lilly's first opponent.

    If Nathan kills the runner, *he'll have five PvP kills*. That may well give him a heck of a reward.

  Intense battle, was genuinely worried for Iliya

  I'm glad the characters are starting to die off. Too many were introduced too fast and I'm not invested.

    I figure that a lot were introduced so there would be some to kill off

  Another new game facet unlocked, but one we all knew was coming.

  Obviously, chasing down and ending their last enemy is a huge priority. Once this is done, Iliya needs to be helped.

  Instant death seems to have a mechanism involving a connection between the brain and the heart. When this is broken, either by severing the head, or else by sufficient damage to the neck, heart, or brain, the creature immediately pixelates.

  Depending on the award for PvP, healing Iliya by gaining a Physical stat will probably be possible, but will cause horrible scarring. *First Aid I* could help with this, but would take some time and EPs that Nathan currently lacks.

  Nathan is very close to being able to pick up *First Aid II*. NP awards for PvP have got to be substantial, and they've just defeated five, maybe six (the runner should count) enemy players.

  * It's likely the game will give them 5+ NPs and a random reward for their first PvP encounter on top of this.

  * On top of this, there is almost certainly a per-player NP award.

  * *Wood Mastery I* skill should grant Nathan 2+ additional NPs and bump his Mental stat to 124.

  * *Camouflage I* (pretty theoretical) skill will hopefully do the same, raising Mental to 125.

  * Nathan would then be able to obtain *First Aid II* skill, reducing the cost. If it scales down like *Attack Up II*, the cost would drop from 20 down to 16 EPs.

  * Alternatively, Lilly could apply analgesic mush to Iliya's face, gain *First Aid I* skill, and activate that on Iliya. She probably lacks the EPs as well, though, since she created the outhouse and used her defensive skills in the fight.

  * Maybe both could activate *First Aid I* together, allowing them to pool EPs?

    Possible but unlikely to gain a reward for first PvP victory as well.

    Wonder if player gear pixelates if it's taken from the downed players before they're killed?
    ```

    - u/Brell4Evar:
      ```
      I'd expect it to stick around. They're not in possession of the player at death, and we've already seen gear such as weapons, leather gloves, and a dress being passed around.

      There are eight long borders between species, so I'd also be surprised if this is the region's first PvP encounter.
      ```

      - u/Murska1FIN:
        ```
        Surprised, yes. Shocked, no.
        ```

        - u/sparr:
          ```
          It wouldn't shock me because I've already accepted the HFY-ness of the story and plot bias, but it would make me sad in further confirming that :(
          ```

  - u/russxbox:
    ```
    I thought he was at 39 EPs before the ambush and used Attack Up once at the start for a cost of 13 EPs, leaving him with 26 and enough to use First Aid?

    Edit: Oh, whoops I forgot he used Snare, so he's only at 10 EP, meaning it will be ~15 minutes until he can use First Aid, unless the rewards were enough for him to level it up like you said.
    ```

    - u/Brell4Evar:
      ```
      Iliya herself may be able to learn and use *First Aid I*, but it would be incredibly traumatic, and she'd have to somehow avoid picking up a new physical skill (which the game may simply reward for winning a PvP encounter).

      *<Element> Mastery I* is looking like a big priority for pretty much everyone.

      * In particular, *Equipment Fusion I* skill will probably produce even higher quality weapons while reducing the skill's cost.

      * *Buildings I* may well see a reduction in EP cost for collapsing structures for movement as well as initial activation.

      * *Advanced Healing I* may see an increase in the healing rate acceleration.

  The chapter got an edit, adding in some background for Lilly and Iliya.

  In Iliya's case, a Stephen Jay Gould quote comes to mind:

  > "I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops."

  Small wonder she kind of likes the Arena.

  Alright!  I've been waiting for the next chapter.
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    Heh. I'm already waiting for chapter 21, now. It's a shame the schedule is going semi-weekly, but I'll take what I can get!
    ```
