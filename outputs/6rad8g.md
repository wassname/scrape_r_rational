## [Challenge Companion] Eschaton

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the [weekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6r8w0o/biweekly_challenge_eschaton/), talk about ideas, recommendations, or whatever else below.**

The eschaton is, basically, the final stage of the world.

To "immanentize the eschaton" is to bring the divine into the material world. William F. Buckley had a slogan, "don't immanentize the eschaton", which he used as a way to criticize "utopians", a group which included people like communists, transhumanists, and Nazis. The Discordians adapted that to "don't let THEM immanentize the eschaton" as a way of poking fun at him, or maybe just being droll.

The point of this prompt is more a matter of showing a "final fate" of the world; most people, especially on this subreddit, would recognize the modern era is a transitional one in the context of human history, meaning that the world ten thousand years from now will not resemble this one.

(If you think that the heat death of the universe is the ultimate end, I think you're probably right, but would suggest you pick something a bit easier that's still within the spirit of the prompt.)

  Hey, I have a question about the biweekly challenge in general, and thought I'd ask here. Is it allowed to enter multiple stories separately for a single challenge? Metafiction is kind of my jam, and I've already got two separate ideas which I'd both like to enter.

  Pedantic note: It's immanentize, not immanetize. You made me re-check my already uploaded story :)

    Yes, you can enter two (or more) stories, it's just that people usually don't. (Also, typo corrected, thanks.)
