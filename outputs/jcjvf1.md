## [FF][DC][C] What if Harry and Quirrell in HPMOR had the personalities of Rick and Morty from "Rick & Morty"?

### Post:

In this short fanfiction, I answer this question that very few have asked before.

[FFN (if you prefer that for some reason)](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13721086/1/HPRick-and-MoRty)

Strictly speaking, the fic deviates from the rational backdrop of HPMOR by slightly altering the motivations of the characters in the context of certain events.

  If I had a nickel for every crackfic HPMOR/Rick and Morty crossover, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't much, but it's weird that it's happened twice.

    ```
    What do you mean, crackfic? This is completely serious.

    Dude. That Peter Pan pastiche in part 2 was truly epic.

  I lol’ed.  I overlooked this gem when it was initially posted here (I feared it would be the very thing it made fun of), but it got reposted on sneerclub I decided to take a look.  Well worth it.

  The sad part is Morty!HJPEV will probably wise up to Rick!Quirrelmort’s shit and snap (seriously Rick’s bs has developed a brutal and angry streak in Morty) before canon HJPEV did.
  ```

    The premise is sneer bait, I don't think I can deny that.

    But in all seriousness, if I were to continue this, unfortunately I would probably stick to the HPMOR tradition of characters taking a charitable stance, and thus not realizing the true agenda of other characters, and thus follow the stations of 'canon', so the snapping wouldn't happen until the graveyard battle, so I would have enough material to work with. Though I'd be obligated to make it more impactful. I might, perhaps, turn the Ender's Game homage parts into a Bonzo and Stilson homage.

  This is deep you really have some smart jokes in there, especially the really subtle jokes requiring a solid grasp of theoretical physics and Narodnaya Volya literature. These aren't just jokes, they say something about LIFE.

  Thank you for this. Needed the laugh today.

    ```
    I'm glad that you liked it, and I hope things go well for you.

  Choked on tea.  Really should have seen that coming.

    Must have been Comed-tea.
