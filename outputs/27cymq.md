### Post:

And I though that a fair few people here might be interested.  It's limited, but what it does it does well.

  If you happen to be using [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) for reading or organizing ebooks on Windows (and syncing with devices, etc) there is a [fanfic downloader plugin](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=163261) which creates .epubs that can then be converted to any number of other different software. 

  Pros:

  - Supports lists of fanfics to do batches of them.
  - Supports a ton of sites (almost all major repositories of fanfic that aren't absurdly terrible*). Includes: fanfiction.net, fimfiction.net, twisting the hellmouth, archiveofourown.org, etc. (list is huge). 
  - Can check for updates and download them and replace epubs etc. automatically.
  - Output is very readable with TOC based on the fic's internal chaptering and formatting etc. preserved.

  Cons:

  - Program runs very slowly (not optimized well) so if you're doing a batch of lots and lots of fics be prepared to leave it running in background for several hours

  Usage Notes:

  - Good for long lists of stories, but takes a long time (set up and let go overnight if doing hundreds of stories at once). 
  - The checking and updating of hundreds of fics also takes a longish time.
  - Never seems to have any significant processor or memory load.



  *Absurdly terrible ways of storing fanfics that are widely used is mostly forum threads, e.g. stories posted only on Beast's Lair or Spacebattles etc. I haven't found a good way to get a story from a thread to .epub that doesn't involve passing through the step "copy and paste into a word processor or something similar, by hand" yet - if anyone finds something like that let me know!

    I also endorse Calibre.  A minor correction, however: it's not Windows-only.  I use it on Debian to manage my Nook Touch. There's also a plugin for downloading news websites on a schedule and formatting them as ebooks.  I get the latest issues of LWN.net, Phoronix, Anandtech, and Al Jazeera every time I plug in my ereader.
