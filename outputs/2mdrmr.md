## [D] Is anyone considering setting up an organisation to make cryonics simpler a la *The Amazing Peter Parker*?

### Post:

If I wasn't planning (currently at uni) to research gerontology and try to find life extension treatments, this would be pretty high up on my To Do list.

  If I knew there was a significant market I might. 

  Picking a number completely out of thin air, would you pay $1,000 USD to have someone make cryonics trivial for you?

    It is actually fairly trivial. It's like doing your taxes. Sounds intimidating, but after you do them the first time you realize it's not a big deal. Getting paid $1000 to do that level of work for someone else would be an *amazing* deal. Enough so that I'd feel bad taking the money.

    I think I would.

    Yeah, although I don't know enough to say whether that's really a good deal or not.

    ... And that's why it IS a good deal.

  Have you considered setting up an organization to make cryonics *work*, with rigorous trials and all that?  And I don't mean "probabilistically work", where an ideal Bayesian assigns a nontrivial, much-larger-than-Solomonoff-prior objective-informational probability to the concept that the partial animal trials done so far imply a human *could* be reanimated or, God help him/her, brain-uploaded, provided the assistance of a Friendly superintelligence...

  I just mean rigorous trials showing that after killing a bunch of rats and putting them through the cryonics treatment, successful resuscitations can actually be performed.

    Full body cryopreservation that would even hypothetically allow full resuscitation is really rare, really expensive, and mostly just impractical.  Most cryopreservation is just done on the head, with the eventual goal of copying the brain structure into a new brain, or uploading it.

    Frankly, I think even if you _do_ go whole-body preservation, you're prolly gonna get good brain scanning tech before you get the kinda full-body-reconstruction tech that it'd take to undo all the damage anyway

      Well, I guess someone had better get on fixing that, hadn't they?

      In which case, why are people being advised to sign up for existing preservation?  It doesn't actually sound like a very good idea.

        What exactly is wrong with getting your brain's structure copied to a fresh substrate?  You still wake up as you, all the memories and personality intact.  Hell, might even have a bitchin' built-to-order bionic body to go with it.

  It's actually a very smooth and strait forward process. Basically just print off an application and send it in. 

  If you live in the US, contact Rudi Hoffman (a life insurance agent operating out of Florida) and he'll do all the work for you, except sign your signature. 

  I think the main focus for Crionics right now ought to be marketing. In my experience, so few people know about Crionics and the rest think it's science fiction.
