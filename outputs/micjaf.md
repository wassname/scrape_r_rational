## Gender Essentialism (and other harmful social biases) in Rat Fic?

### Post:

I started on Pith and was bothered by how irregular the pronoun usage is. As characters in Pith swap bodies, sometimes pronouns appear to change as they swap bodies, and other times they appear consistent despite body swaps. It’s unclear to me if the author is making this choice deliberately, because of their own beliefs regarding gender and identity, or has crafted a society that uses pronouns differently than our own. If anyone can tell me if either is the case I’d appreciate it.

Within the context of Pith, I feel like it would make most sense for language to develop signifiers (and maybe even expression) that stay consistent across bodies (pronouns or other signifiers, perhaps based on the Pith color or Vocation), since you’d think that what really matters in a society with body swapping magic psychics is what stays consistent between bodies. Maybe I’m reading too deep into this and the author has chosen for Pith’s views on sex and gender to mirror regressive western society much like it’s nobility, architecture, and fashion. 

I’m reminded, however, of With This Ring, which got pretty heavily into gender essentialism in one chapter to the point that the author was banned from a forum and had to rehost on QQ. 

You’d think that a tendency towards trans humanism and ultimate freedom in bodily expression (and a focus on confronting preconceptions, bad science that gets copied forward culturally, and scientific dishonesty) in this community would cause a trend against gender essentialism. 

Has anyone else seen this? Or trends towards similar harmful social biases (racism, sexism, ect.) which don’t logically have a place in rat fic but end up there anyway? Of course I’m willing to evaluate my priors here.

  I read Piths use of pronouns as 100% intentional

  Can you give an example of a time the pronouns swapped which is throwing you off?

   I think Anna pretty consistently doesn’t swap, unless it is people referring to her undercover/ don’t know. Hira has two bodies, and seems to consistently have right Hira be called he and left be she. Wes has pronouns that swaps throughout depending on people talking about them, but Wes’s gender identity is also in flux through the story, which is resolved/ reflected on in his final chapter in volume 1, where he wants to identify as Wes, and doesn’t like the fem body he is in. 

  Given that homophobia was a major plot/ worldbuilding point in one of the interludes (admiral Ebbridge and Florence) I think the gender and sexual norms in pith’s recent past are supposed to mirror those in our own recent past.

    The pronoun usage in the beginning made perfect sense given the situation, it was this sequence that confused me:

    Spoilers for 2-C:

    >!I smiled at the thought of my team missing me.  Even if they were practicing without me, it was nice to know I hadn’t just disappeared without a trace.  “And your newest member?”!<

    >!Samuel closed his eyes.  “There is so much to think about.  So much to talk about. Are you sure it’s the best idea to – “!<

    >!“No.  But I don’t much care.  What is he like? Is he shy, loud, cruel?  Does he prance around in my dresses like a ballerina?  Did he tell you his strategy for filleting me last week?”!<

     And

    >!Stop hedging. What is he like?”!<

    >!Samuel took in a deep breath.  “She’s…enthusiastic. Excited about getting a free ride to Paragon and all your family’s resources, but awkward.  Me and the rest of the squad refused to speak to her at all, but she took it all in stride. Very demure, very apologetic.  It’s still too fresh and too personal for us to acknowledge her, and…she kind of gets that.”!<

    Both refer to the same person in the same body, but maybe there’s a social difference as a result of the >!usurping process where taking someone’s position includes taking their pronouns when talking about group dynamics?!< 

    Like I said above not sure if this was a result of the society’s approach to gender, this particular situation, or these characters in the moment.
    ```

    - u/rngoddesst:
      ```
      Oh yeah, I remember that scene.

      I read it as >!Weston being rude and misgendering Tasia, while Samuel uses her correct pronouns. I don't think we are supposed to like Weston in this scene. I think the societal expectation is that the person who ousts is supposed to take their name and pronouns /Tasia wants to be gendered with she/her and Samuel respects that.!<

      I'll repeat what some other commentators said that >!Epistocrats are regressive, and artificial bodies are relatively new. !< /u/NoYouTryAnother expresses this, and a general perspective on the world and author better than I could, and I'm glad you'll continue to give the story a shot!

  Without providing examples, it's kinda hard to know what specifically you're referring to. You seem to be saying all characters should act a certain way, without considering that there are a ton of divisions going on with the characters in terms of age, gender, politics, class, ethnicity, parenting, and education that differentiate how they think/act.

  >you’d think that what really matters in a society with body swapping magic psychics is what stays consistent between bodies.

  The character in Queen Sulphur, for instance, come from all across the world, from societies that teach body-swapping is a sin to ones that view it as putting on a new pair of shoes. The story doesn't have a single, monolithic society/culture, but multiple ones crammed together, pushing up against another.

  As someone mentioned in another comment that the body-swapping is still relatively new in society, so it could just be that society has not caught up with technology and people don't know how to react to it.

  It could also be because some characters can afford to choose which sex they body-swap into and some can't, and this affects how they, and others, treat gender.

    I got the feeling that it's a matter of respect, as well.  Right at the start, when the female MC is working in the bar/tavern, all the guests refer to her as him because the discount body she's in is male.  If I'm a wealthy guy of higher social class, what do I care what gender the mind in that body over there thinks it is/originally was?  I'm not going to spend mental effort to remember such things or take them into account; it would denigrate my social standing among my equally cruel and vindictive peers, same as taking the effort to remember this random servant's name would.  You're here to serve me, maggot, not vice-versa.  What do I pay you for?  You want me to call you 'she', get a body with some feminine wiles.  Remember your place, and don't bother your betters with this whining again.  Get back to work.

      I think this is probably where I run up against my own lines and veils when engaging with fiction/fantasy: I’m comfortable engaging with fiction where there is bigotry and injustice directed towards fantasy minority groups, which allows authors to explore the concept (and response by injured parties and allies), but fiction which depicts bigotry or socially motivated disrespect that’s  focused on underrepresented group aspects (treating women badly if they’re of a lower social class, sexual violence against disadvantaged populations or the vulnerable, ect.) of real underrepresented populations gets uncomfortable for me, in part because I worry about what the author is saying/normalizing (again, like With This Ring, or Joss Whedon depicting sexual violence on DollHouse while crossing lines behind the scenes with coworkers).

      I’m explicitly not making on judgment on Pith regarding this, this is my own comfort.
      ```

      - u/echemon:
        ```
        That's your deal.  Briefly on Pith- do you consider Pith to be a case of showing bigotry towards underrepresented populations?  Because I don't- we don't have body-swappers in real life, so from my point of view, mistreatment shown in Pith is the same as mistreatment shown in, I don't know, X-men.  It's allegorical, not 'fictional black people getting whipped'.  Again, this is just where our personal intuitions differ, I suppose.

    This makes sense to me, and I appreciate the insight. 

    It still bothers me a little that projectors from families of projectors which explicitly were apart (until recently) from general society would have the same attitudes towards gender as someone who was part of the Humdrum society (despite having had untold amounts of time to develop their own insular culture and approach to gender fluidity). 

    But this recommendation is enough for me to keep with it and give the author the benefit that they’re exploring the topic and not attempting to voice their views through the character (like the WTR author explicitly was).
    ```

    - u/sunshine_cata:
      ```
      Their society is old, but artificial bodies are still fairly new. Maybe they did less swapping in the past when it would require replacing a real person.
      ```

  What you're seeing is probably the collision of:

  2. an author who did not grow up in a society with body swapping magic psychics,
  1. keeping clear in their own mind exactly which characters they're describing in any given scene,
  3. trying to describe those events in a way their audience will find comprehensible,
  4. trying to write in a literarily satisfying way, ie, not repeating the characters' names too many times in a paragraph or (God forbit) twice in the same sentence,
  5. and all while using words to simulate a specific timeframe in a specific culture on a specific planet.

  Each author has to deal with these issues in their own way. Some are skillful and top-notch, and hit all five points during the entire story. Some are kind-hearted but clumsy at hitting each of the five points at different parts of the story because they haven't had the practice you've come to expect from the top-notch fiction-writers. Some are deliberate trolls, transphobes, or haters. Some disagree with gender identity ideas without any animus, and refuse to change how they write. Some find the easiest way (or the "funniest") to solve that Gordian knot is to just cut it and say "Character F *is really* a man, even if he's turned by magic into a physical female [every day but Wednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5gvnfkOF9U)." (That example is species-essentialist too.)

  Also consider how *fast* society has had to shift to accommodate gender identity as a civil right instead of a pathology. Even just six years ago, in real-world 2015, it was considered a whimsical and farfetched idea that [Marty and Jennifer's daughter in Back to the Future II's 2015, Marlene McFly, might have been Marty Jr.'s transgender identical twin](https://np.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3wegtd/back_to_the_future_part_ii_marlene_mcfly_is_marty/). For youngsters in high school, that was *two schools ago,* but for workaday people in their 30's and 40's, they might still be at the same job with the same co-workers and doing the same hobbies on the weekend as six years prior. Heck, there are TV shows on my DVR recorded that long ago!

  There's a lot of people in the ratfic community who really don't want any GLBT themes in their power fantasy fiction, is my take. Why? Somehow to them GLBT themes are *political*, whereas erasing any queerness from fiction isn't? I don't get it, but it's a thing!

  Like, if you can reshape your body, you can bet that a whole lotta people are gonna be in bodies that aren't gendered with the gender they were assigned at birth. And that's just one of the most obvious things.

    >There's a lot of people in the ratfic community who really don't want any GLBT themes in their power fantasy fiction, is my take. Why?

    Personally, it often calls on experiences that are foreign to me without providing a framework to understand it.  I can get *something* from reading works written from different baseline experiences and for a different audience, but not as much as other people do.  

    > Somehow to them GLBT themes are political, whereas erasing any queerness from fiction isn't?

    For me, the difference isn't political vs. nonpolitical, or even political-I-agree-with vs. political-I-disagree-with, it's focus vs. background.  Any work with LGBT themes *by definition* has some focus on the topics of romance, sex, gender identity, etc. (specifically, it has a focus on the subset of those topics where the experiences of LGBT people differ from others'), and...I'm just not that interested or engaged by it.  Including a gay romance in a story isn't any worse than a straight one, but that's not a very high bar.  

    Combine the added difficulty relating to the characters with the necessary focus on topics I don't care about, and you've pretty got my stance.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Okay, but the specific criticism that I most often see levied in this specific community isn't "I don't like romance subplots", it's "why did you make this so political". Including when it's just background; people complain about PGTE's General Basilia, and she's literally the most low-key trans-but-it's-not-relevant character possible.
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        I guess I'm not representative and don't have a good understanding of the "mainstream" criticisms.

        (I'm at Book 5 of PGTE)

        I'm surprised that the LGBT/feminist-esque criticisms aren't levied against Cat's bisexuality, or Hakram's promiscuity, or the love triangle in Rat army, or standards of interspecies attraction/flirting, or Cordelia being the First *Prince*, or an entire society/species that is non-gendered.  I'd also expect critics to point out the differences in strength between (Earth, human) men and women to complain about female officers/soldiers as well.

        Maybe it comes up later, but I don't even remember General Basilia.
        ```

        - u/PastafarianGames:
          ```
          I don't see why you're surprised that the criticisms aren't levied against Cat's thirst. *Everyone* loves thirsty bisexual-woman protags, at least so long as there's at most one penis involved.

          (This may seem snarky, but I'm being completely serious.)

    As others have said, it's a matter of focus, as well as representation.  Why do gay people want to read stories with gay people in them?  Why do people of x race say they want to read more stories with people in them that look like them?  Humans like to read stories featuring characters they can identify with, characters similar to themselves.  Trying to identify with a character significantly different from yourself has a particular 'taste', which is acquired; it's interesting and nice, but you wouldn't have it for every meal unless you're some kind of fancy connoisseur, and readers of sci-fi/fantasy trash are generally not connoisseurs.

    Basically- all people are the same, they want to read stories with main characters that look/are like them unless they're specifically looking for a change or a mind-bender.

    For personal anecdata, I remember that when I first looked at *Ra*, I was mildly turned off by all the focal characters being women, but Laura Ferno's mindset was familiar enough in an endearing sort of way I kept with it.  You could say that's a stupid reaction to have, that it's sexist to be less inclined to continue reading a story because the main character has a different sex to myself, and maybe it is!  Just like it is when gay people or people of x race judge stories based on the identities of the main characters ;)

      So "does not cater to straight white right-of-center cismen" is a political statement to those men in question because the act of writing something that doesn't cater to them is an inherently political act?

      That checks out, actually.
      ```

      - u/echemon:
        ```
        I'm don't think it's political, or that it has to be political.  "The personal is political" is a left-wing saying, after all.  We can have fiction for straights, and fiction for gays, and all the other variations; there's no need for it to be combative.  I guess it might become 'political' as soon as any side starts to treat it that way, if people see it as a zero-sum game.  Again, this is why we need the fill-in-the-blanks bot, so people aren't in competition with each other for the identifying characteristics of their characters.  I'm not joking about this.
        ```

        - u/PastafarianGames:
          ```
          I realize that you are not joking about this, but I think that's a very silly thing to believe. There's no using a fill-in-the-blanks bot to make Katalepsis a story that bigots will be comfortable with.

          (And that's the least silly thing in your post; the rest is even sillier.)

          - u/echemon:

            Ah, but anti-gay bigots aren't getting books cancelled and unpublished.  The fill-in-the-blanks is more of a protective ward versus twitter than anything else.

    I think you might be pointing to the divide this community has kind of had since the start: some people see rat fic as well constructed or thoughtful worlds, some see it as power fantasy or Munchkinning, some people are looking for evidence of a larger philosophy that emphasizes reasoning and thoughtfulness (and even real world action upon that).

    EDIT: To your point about people seeing their or the harmful social biases of others as political rather than real measurable problems, I think that provably comes from the luxury of being in a privileged social group that can afford to be detached from the issues. For people who experience them daily, they are real issues that need to be confronted and addressed as a matter of survival.
