## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  /u/bambamramfan, whom you may know from his [film analysis blog](http://prequelsredeemed.blogspot.com/) which I believe has been linked in this sub before, has recently started a new blog project: [Exploring Egregores](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/who-worships-an-evil-god-2/).

  >Sometimes people in the rationalist community write about egregores. Scott has written about Moloch. Sarah Constantin wrote a great one about Ra. That’s more about the results of processes than something individuals would worship (like the Invisible Hand), but the feeling of them seemed very right. They were terrible and inhuman, a drive given form that we could never really comprehend.

  >Moloch and Ra sound a lot like what happens when you read too much of a book, and are wholly given over to some greater Thing, that has no concern for normal, boring, human life. So: what if the whole suite of gods in the Mythos were egregores like that?

  So far he's covered [Cthugha](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/cthugha-the-living-flame/), [Yog-Sothoth](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/01/yog-sothoth-the-lurker-at-the-threshold/), [Hastur](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/02/hastur-the-unspeakable/), [Ithaqua](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/ithaqua-the-wind-walker/), and [Cthulhu](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/04/cthulhu-lies-dreaming/).

  Disclaimer for transparency: The author is a personal friend of mine and I have seen drafts of these in advance of publication. In fact, reading the draft for Cthugha is why I changed my flair on this sub to Cultist of Cthugha two months ago.

    Actually, a request for /u/bambamramfan: could you do one of [the Emperor](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Emperor_of_Mankind), the god of Humanity, of normality, causality, and banality, who Protects and yet unmakes, for to serve Him is to have your soul stripped away day by day as you shed everything irrational, unreal, and immaterial in you, becoming a being only of reason and service.

      I'll do some reading. But read up on [the egregore Ra](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2016/10/20/ra/), which was part of the inspiration for this project, and at first glance sounds similar.
      ```

      - u/Aretii:

        I said it to you in chat and I'll say it to /u/eaturbrainz directly: the God-Emperor is Ra, but in a universe constructed such that space-fascism is the only morally reasonable option.

        He was even near-toppled in something called the Horus Heresy, for crying out loud, echoing Ra's displacement as sun god by the almagamation with Horus as Re-Horakhty*.

        \*by complete accident, sure, they weren't writing it with Sarah Constantin in mind, but it's hilarious to *me*.

  Alright, buckle in, folks, we’ve hit a major milestone.


  I’ve been working on the engine framework for the game for...probably a couple months now.  I hemmed and hawed about the design, and after discovering Roslyn I claimed that what I thought would take months would instead take weeks. In spite of my track record with such predictions, I would like to announce in no uncertain terms *mission fucking accomplished*.  


  XGEF, or the eXtensible Game Engine Framework, now officially works.  Like, I had code that worked before, but it was all organizational stuff and reading files from directories.  Kid stuff.  As of right now I have a framework that, if followed, forces any game written using it to be trivially moddable.  


  It works like this:  XGEF is built around the concept of a System as the most fundamental class of code.  A System is intended to represent a cluster of related functions that could conceivably run on its own thread (but is not forced to).  For example, you would have a WorldGenerationSystem, an AudioSystem, a WorldSocietySystem, or a CombatSystem.  Systems are built in two halves, a CoreSystem and a ModdedSystem.  The CoreSystem is built by the game developer, and enshrines code that is not meant to be messed with, things without which the System (and thus the game) could not function.  Any extra logic that has to do more with the game’s design and balance is thus offloaded into the ModdedSystem, which is just a text code file that sits on the hard drive and is distributed with the game.


  XGEF knows how to find these ModdedSystem code files, consolidate them, compile them, and integrate them with the original game, with the code itself none the wiser.  *It’s so cool*. 

  Exactly how much of the system’s code is divided between the Core and Modded halves of a System is up to the developer. A developer might decide to make a System mostly Core, and only put, say, some settings that can be changed in the Modded half (such as with a rendering system).  Or perhaps it’s the opposite, such as an AI module: the Core basically only exists to run whatever is in the Mod, where all the various play logic can be offloaded.  All told I think most Systems will sit between these two extremes, such as a terrain generator that has all the different world generation steps contained inviolate within the Core, but what actually happens in each step is (mostly) the domain of the Modded half.  


  This setup would be sufficient (if tedious) to support modding in a bare-bones fashion on its own: anything the player wants to change, they simply open up the ModdedSystem code files in the game folder and alter the code to their heart’s content.  However, this does not allow for collaboration between modders the way that moddable titles are traditionally expected to do, so XGEF has to take it a bit further and also handle individual mod prioritization and consolidation.


  A mod from the perspective of XGEF is basically a separate folder that contains a mirror image of the game’s folder structure. Anything that is contained within these folders is considered to be a new version of the file, and when the game starts up, XGEF will go through the mod folders and copy those files over, overwriting the originals (virtually).  In the case of code files, it will actually be powerful enough (due to Roslyn) to do some analysis and perform *selective* copying.  This means that adding functionality to an existing System, or overwriting only one function within it, is perfectly doable.


  In the future, XGEF will actually take it one step further again and will be capable of performing code transformation.  By tagging code with certain attributes, XGEF will know to insert blocks of code that are otherwise tedious to type, in particular with relation to event handling.  


  But enough talk!  [Here is a link to the current XGEF build](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0LYycfi-K18aXkySmJkMnRLYXc/view?usp=sharing), which includes a very simple sample game structure.  Simply extract the contents of the zip file to a location of your choice.  If you run the *.exe (after extraction), the XGEF mod loader runs, loads the compiled CoreTestSystem that I the developer wrote, finds its other half the ModTestSystem on your hard drive, compiles it, and hooks everything up.  My CoreTestSystem then calls the TestMessage function within your ModTestSystem, and you can see the result in your console window. 


  There is a core folder where the ModdedSystems would go, and a mods folder where any mod overwrites would go.  The two are set up the way they would be for a real game--you’ll note that the code in core/engine/test/ModTestSystem.cs is different from and has been overwritten by the code in mods/testmod/engine/test/ModTestSystem.cs.  


  This is written using C#, but it should also work using Mono, and has been tested to run on both  MacOS and Linux (simply run it with “mono xgef_test.exe”).  

  EDIT: due to the gracious bug report from an anonymous PM, I've found an upper bound to the mono version that this will work with.  4.2.1 will NOT work, and I suspect it has something to do with the .NET version that it supported.  The oldest build that I was able to get my hands on was 4.6.2, which ran as well as 5.0.1 (most recent release). So as of right now, 4.6.2 is the "officially" oldest supported mono release.  (I suspect that 4.4.0 with the .NET 4.5 -> 4.6.1 jump is actually the crucial barrier, but until I am able to confirm that, 4.6.2 is as far back as I will support.)

  If you have code experience, please give modding the code file a shot and try to break it.  The whole thing *works* but it is not yet *robust*, and getting some usage info from how people *expect* it to work is almost more important than even seeing if/how it works on various systems.  


  ----

  This marks a major turning point in development.  With XGEF tentatively in place and the design of Renegade having been working on for almost exactly a year, it’s time to give both a trial by fire and start work on the game proper.  

  But!  I’m moving to a new apartment, so it won’t start this week. I probably won’t update next Friday, but you can expect a new update on the 18th, which will be the first update cataloguing the *development* and not just *design* of Pokemon: Renegade.

      Thanks! I'm really quite proud that I've somehow managed to stick with the same project mostly interrupted for an entire *year*, which is unprecedented for me. I think the accountability of posting here is really a big part of that, so thanks for being a part of that, if nothing else!

  - u/gbear605:

    How do you handle multiple mods altering the same file? Partially include the mod? Cut out mods that modify the same file (keeping whichever one is first in order)? Something else entirely?
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      So one of XGEF's functions is to prioritize mods, which is to say it decides the pecking order and then applies their changes one after the other accordingly. For the moment I'll assume we're just talking about image files (code has more nuance to it). 

      So each mod has within it a mod_info file that lists some things: mods that this mod is incompatible with, mods that this mod needs to load before, mods that this mod needs to load after, and mods that this mod needs as prerequisite. Using this info, XGEF can make a preliminary ordering of mods based on absolute need (and if there's contradictory info, abort and call out the mods in question). Once the "needs" are dealt with, XGEF then looks in mod_info again and looks for the requested priority, which is a scale from 1 to 5. Mods are divided into the five different priority groups, preserving the needs hierarchy from earlier, and then at this point if there are any ties it's simply resolved alphabetically. XGEF now has all the mods in a numbered priority list. 

      XGEF can then start loading all mods into the file structure one at a time from lowest priority to highest. We start with the lowest to ensure that if a higher priority mod changes the same file, then its changes will be the ones that win out. A readout is saved of these steps, so if mod makers are trying to figure out why files aren't being overwritten, they can find out what higher priority mod is pushing them aside. 

      This is sufficient for binary files (such as images), but code can actually stand to be a bit more flexible. If two or more mods change the same system-defining file, XGEF can boot up Roslyn and perform a similar process with finer-grained tools. Lower-priority mods make their additions and modifications, and higher-priority mods then have their additions and modifications incorporated, with their changes having the final say. This can still lead to interesting failure states, but so long as modders keep to their own namespaces the issues should be minimal. 

      In reality, being able to mod systems directly should only truly be needed as a last resort. There is an event system planned that will allow nearly any code event to be registered to, and once that is in place the only big system mods should be for overhauls and adding event generation to functions that we neglected to add it to. 

      A good amount of this only works because we've decided that most mods will be incorporated during world generation, not on an ad-hoc basis. I'm still toying with the idea of permitting ad-hoc mods so long as they restrict themselves to certain classes of changes (such as UI), but by and large this should only be a process that needs to be done once per world, and then it's done for the duration of that world.

  I got a [DXA scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry) a few days ago after hearing that my gym offered them for $24 a pop ($12 if you have their insurance). Had one done a while back and was a bit underwhelmed that my results came back almost identical to 1.5y before (15% BF @ 25y/6'1"/190lbs), but not too disappointed given how little effort I've devoted to lifting the past 1.5y. I've seen people ask about fitness-y body recomposition type stuff on here before, so I'd recommend exploring the possibility of having a scan done as one way to quantifiably benchmark your current status, see how much fat you can potentially lose, ballpark rmr more reliably, track changes in muscle and fat mass at a finer grain than just through weight, etc.

  On a tangentially related note, I'm watching [a show about cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Wars!:_Shokugeki_no_Soma) right now and it's got me thinking -- why don't foodies/gourmets/gourmands/epicures/etc. do more to explore enhancing the pleasures provided by food through means other than modifying the composition of the food itself, but rather through fasting and exercise? I've eaten at a wide range of places and do a lot of cooking myself, and yet the tastiest meals I've had have overwhelmingly been during or after long hikes. A metric buttload of gas station candy and two Subway footlongs consumed after a few dozen mi of empty belly's trudge were more delicious than any fine dining I've ever had, and seems to me an experience much more accessible than ponying up $$ for fancy restaurants with long waitlists and rare ingredients. To a lesser extent, eating relatively homogenous and bland foods (e.g. Pasta Sides and Snickers) for a week+ straight can turn otherwise decent novelty into an amazing flavor explosion, if fasting is too demanding.


  Likewise, it's well accepted that the esthetic elements of a dish independent of its taste and smell influence our enjoyment of it, so a lot of care is taken to ensure that a meal's presentation and a restaurant's ambiance both serve to complement any direct consumption. But if one lives in a pretty place with decent weather, it's not hard with a short hike to beat for beauty even the most luxurious building interiors. There's some cost in time and effort (though the latter may be paid back, as mentioned above), and food from a thermal won't intrinsically taste better than fresh off the skillet, but I think the benefits here clearly outweigh the costs.


  So I guess I wonder why there's not more attention paid to stuff like this when discussing how to improve meals -- e.g. something like "hummus with pita reaches peak enjoyment after having wakefully fasted for 10-12h [Sturgeon 2015] and accompanied by the melodic gurgle of a 110 ft, 2,000 cfs waterfall". Or maybe there's already some subfield of gastronomy that covers these considerations (beyond ofc determining that the effect exists, e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10594666, https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/…/10.11…/1471-2202-5-5, etc.)? This isn't really anything I'm formally familiar with. And naturally people picnic and haul their cast iron pans and w/e with them on camping trips all the time.

  I've been reading a Justice League comic called [JL8](http://limbero.org/jl8/1) that's probably the best version of the "characters aged down to children" comics I've ever read, on par with a Dragonball Z one I randomly found online like 15 years ago that I haven't been able to find since.

  Figured others might be entertained by it, but [this comic in particular](http://limbero.org/jl8/104) tickled me, since the idea of Batman and Superman having developed a way to talk to each other secretly as kids is both rational and adorable.
  ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    I absolutely love JL8. At a time when I didn't understand the concept of finding things "cute", this came along and shocked me not only with how *adorable* it was but also how emotionally mature it was. This story is the definition of wholesome, these kids actually learn important life lessons that are just as applicable to me as an adult as to children. 

    What's especially impressive is how this was all done while keeping every member of the cast in-character with their canon counterparts and making thematically appropriate references to the original stories. I totally believe that these kids will grow up to be the icons of DC comics, and that shows the author has a deep understanding of the characters.

    The scene that sums up everything I love about this comic is when Bruce comes home after a rough day at school and *talks to a plush robin about his troubles*. Not only is that the most adorable things I've ever seen and advances his character arc beautifully through introspection, it makes perfect sense for where Batman got the name from and what it had meaning to him.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Absolutely to all that. Not only is the central cast perfect, it also brings in many non-central DC characters very well, when they show up (and even characters from Sandman, which I keep forgetting is DC). 

      Also it's just downright hilarious: it's rare for me to find a comic that makes me actually laugh out loud rather than just exhale air from my nose in occasional amusement.

  So I'm up to the 130s chapters in *Forty Milleniums of Cultivation*, and this is fast turning into one of my all-time favorites, right alongside *Gurren Lagann*.  Some nice quotes:

  >*Naturally, man struggles upwards as water flows downwards.*

  That is... that is... *that is what it means to be human, holy shit, this author fucking nailed it.*  I am quoting that the next time I have to write a dedication for literally anything.  "Man struggles upwards as water flows downwards."

  >Prior to the Mystic Skeleton Battlesuit, the cheapest crystal suit [power armor] was worth over 500 million [credits], and that was just a training model.  It wasn't equipped with any noticeable offensive magical equipment.
  >
  >Before, spending an amount of 500 million could only arm a single cultivator, but now, it could arm at least five cultivators!

  Holy shit.  There's the /r/rational content, right there.  It's an explicit discussion of the economics and engineering principles behind arming and armoring a Space Marine Legion, complete with notes that in the ~~Great Crusade~~Star Ocean Imperium era, the ~~Man-~~Emperor ~~of Mankind~~ knew how to mass produce power-armor but the technology was lost during the ~~Horus Heresy~~Armageddon Rebellion by his ~~Chaos~~demonically corrupted son.

  The main character and his university department make it their explicit goal: change the strategies and economics of humanity's war against demon-beasts by *engineering* an industrial-grade power armor.

  >The Soviet-style weapons that had a common structure, low manufacturing costs, were easy to operate, and were constantly produced in a steady stream from simple factories, forming an overwhelming steel army.  A sea of boorish and uncivilized soldiers, who had only the courage but not the battle experience, after equipping these simple weapons, forcibly suppressed the German-style weapons and the elite among the elite soldiers, and in the end, had even pushed them back.  Those extremely exquisite German weapons that wer called a work of art were all completely smashed into bits.

    I'd like to thank you for getting me to finally watch Gurren Lagaan after all this time because it ended up having the desired effect of fueling my optimistic outlook on life. The show isn't going in my all-time favorites, but I almost feel like that's a good thing since the story is so illogical and the themes so rooted in aggressive masculine archetypes that someone in my situation should probably only take it as a reminder of my personal philosophy rather than a direct inspiration for it.

    Considering that I've spent the past few years going through depressive episodes due to my inability to live up to my own standards, which caused me to fall even further further from aspirations for self-improvement, that was a reminder I sorely needed. I'm actually thankful the irrational elements of the series annoys me because that acts as another reminder to remain idealistic without following those ideals blindly.

    As for the story itself, the second arc is my favorite because Simon's struggle against depression resonates with me and Nia's unrelenting compassion was inspiring. The rest of the show consisted of ideas I really liked with execution I had mixed feelings for, but I was still satisfied in the end and the mythic scope of the themes kept me from judging it by the standards of a kid's show.

    So now that I finally have the context to understand all the praise you've been giving to [Forty Milleniums of Cultivation](https://www.webnovel.com/book/6838665402001705/6850172302001300) all this time, I'm damn excited to start reading. Ever since you first pitched it on this sub it has sounded like the exact kind of story I want to have in my life, hits all the marks I've been demanding from stories lately, and even has some tropes that subjectively appeal to me like [Martial Arts and Crafts](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts).

      It was /u/Drazelic who originally posted FMoC to this sub, but *yeah*.

      >the themes so rooted in aggressive masculine archetypes

      You know, that's the funny thing.  I've never been anything other than male, but until *Gurren Lagann*, I never really felt *good* about being male.  It wasn't something that was working well for me, and it wasn't something society told me had any particular virtues that didn't come with over-balancing downsides in the modern world.

      TTGL made me finally feel proud about the category I fall into, as if my maleness really has something to give the world.  Sure, it *is* illogical.  It says so: "go beyond the impossible, and kick logic to the curb!"  But being illogical is genuinely important, because the map is *not* the territory.  The "logic" in your head is often not the logic of the real world, and until you [*kick it to the curb and go beyond the impossible*](http://lesswrong.com/lw/up/shut_up_and_do_the_impossible/), you can't even know how limited you're letting yourself be.

      (See?  Everything Kamina said was actually profound!)

      The one thing I seriously disliked was having Li Yao granted First Class Federation Disabled Serviceman status for overloading his qi and passing out during a pre-exam competition.  That just seems like a Gary Stu-ism: having a demon beast get superpowered and cause trouble during the contest was kinda predictable, but actually fighting it and surviving shouldn't be given an extra, lifelong reward.  It should just be, "You fought the accidental, interloping supercharged demon beast before reinforcements could arrive, and you survived.  Congrats on surviving.  You should be dead."

      Especially because he restored his Spirit Actualization Quotient and even expanded it in, what, a month?  Did we need an extra one-month training arc after the whole several previous training arcs, followed by Li Yao getting free money and train tickets the rest of his life?

        That's the 'slow' part of the beginning of the story, yes. Conventional run-of-the-mill xianxia novels tend to do nothing but heap benefits upon benefits upon the character in an effort to deliver the most distilled power-fantasy possible, to the point where the behavior has become sort of ingrained as a trope, the same way that, idk, falling-into-waifu-boobs and panty-shots have become deplorable but commonplace conventions in anime.

        There's almost a feeling that if you don't write an absurdly op mary sue, then your work wont even have the baseline audience of 'people who read xianxia specifically as an escapist power fantasy', which will lead to the work failing- similar to how for a while the visual novel industry was afraid to back projects without sexually explicit content, because of how even the shittiest story could apparently be guaranteed to make a certain baseline popularity just by coasting off the lowest common denominator audience alone.

        Basically, this sort of thing is... the author's concession to 'genre tropes'. You have to realize that, for the first hundred chapters, the author of FMoC wasnt sure if he was going to write a generic-but-financially-predictable shonen xianxia mary-sue power fantasy, or the much more risky but interesting Tengen Toppa Gurren Rationality 40k we actually got. Choosing to *not* write the metaphorical equivalent of a fanservice-moebait-pantyshot-waifubait-haremromcom in this context was a massive risk for the author, and it paid off massively, but the first few chapters still show a lot of early-installment weirdness!

        (This is also part of why original fantasy IPs in china are regarded with lower status than they might otherwise be- there's a similar sort of stigma going on with the genre as a whole. )

        Anyways, back on topic- this sort of 'overload your limiter to unlock greater true potential' thing is just, generally speaking, how a lot of xianxia novels explain powerups for the protagonist. Just try to think of it as, like, how saiyans in dbz get more powerful everytime they approach near-death. It's a whole *trope*. It doesn't monopolize the story too much from here on out, as the story's focus goes more towards societal worldbuilding over Li Yao's personal powergrinding, but it is still a thing, on occasion. Just a heads-up.

  Is anyone interested in a writing group?

  I've have a partial idea for a novel that I want to turn into a completed project.  I bet a lot of people are in the same boat, and think a group could be helpful and motivating.

  My goal for the group would be to get projects to a full first draft in less than a year. 
   The timeline would be something like:

  * Week 1: Story ideas & premise
  * Week 2: Refine story summary
  * Weeks 3 & 4: Create Structured Outline
  * Weeks 5+: Work on draft, with > 2k new words / week

  For outlines, I plan is to go through KM Welland's [Structuring Your Novel](https://www.amazon.com/Structuring-Your-Novel-Workbook-Hands-ebook/dp/B00P72KYWA) workbook.  It seems to ask reasonable questions and produces the 'Hollywood story structure' that a lot of authors seem to like, with some extra notes no character and conflict.

  From there, 2k words / week would get the project to novel length by the end of the first year.

  To keep motivation up, I'd want to exchange weekly updates.  There'd be an expectation that people would read each other's work and comment.

  Actual group discussions would be online, probably every week or two, as needed.

  What do people think?  Does the plan sound reasonable?  Are people interested in participating in something like this.

  I hurt my back two weeks ago. No permanent damage, but I've spent the majority of the last 14 days in bed. Which gets very boring indeed. But on the upside, I did finally get around to watching Fate Stay Night, Unlimited Blade Works and Fate Zero. I, um. I recommend them. Kind of a lot. They were really good. I also watched Akame ga Kill, A Certain Magical Index 1&2, and A Certain Scientific Railgun. These were all pretty good too, but Fate Stay Night wins, hands down. Now I'm playing through the visual novel because there is apparently a good third of the game that has not yet been adapted into anime.
  ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    I heard the original Fate/Stay Night anime wasn't very good and Unlimited Blade Works left a lot out from the visual novel, but I've had Fate/Zero on my list for a while now since I heard it was the best Fate anime.

    I watched the first episode of both Index and Railgun, but am only considering watching more of the latter. Index didn't make me want to see more of the characters, Railgun somehow did even though one of them is a serial molester.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      I enjoyed railgun more than Index. However, they overlap and some of the episodes are about the same thing from a different perspective. Index also goes on longer. There are some cute characters from Railgun I wished would get more screen time, which they do in later Index episodes. Won't say who, because spoiler, but they are interesting. Unfortunately, that's mixed in with a lot of quite boring episodes that do not involve them. Starting with Railgun is probably the way to go. Says Rhamni says Rhamni, confidently explaining the situation.

      Out of the three Fate shows, I think I enjoyed Unlimited Blade Works the most. It felt complete, but if there is more left to uncover in the VN, that pleases me greatly. I am currently playing through it to unlock the route that doesn't have an adaption yet, but it seems to do that I must complete the two other routes that do have adaptions.

      Here's the thing. All three series spoil important things about the other two. Unlimited Blade Works definitely was made for people who have already seen Fate Stay Night, so don't start with that. Fate Zero... You'd think watching the prequel first would be the way to go, but I actually recommend starting with the original FSN. You'll probably like both regardless of viewing order, and of the three I think FSN was the least awesome (But still miles better than Railgun). But there are things in FSN that build up slowly and resolve with very satisfying twists, that Fate Zero assumes you know and spoils very unceremoniously. Of course, watching FSN first gives you a very good idea of who will survive the prequel, but in the end I think the plot twists and character secrets in FSN are more precious unspoiled than the suspense of who survives FZ. There are characters in FSN who seem to be one way part way or all the way through, but turn out to have enormous secrets, good bad and neutral. For me, one of the best parts of Fate Zero was having gone through FSN with one impression of a character and then have that shattered completely by the prequel. Now that I'm playing through the VN, I'm noticing things that would have completely passed me by if I hadn't seen all three series before playing. They are all great, and they all add a lot to the full picture.

      Ultimately, it's up to you. The first episode of FSN will tell you most of the people who die in FZ, and the first episode of FZ will casually spoil half the hidden connections and tragic back stories of FSN.

      Fate/stay night has its origin as a visual novel with three distinct routes, each with their own claim to fame*, and trying to collapse a branching plot tree into a linear narrative is going to be a lossy conversion any way you do it. Fate/Zero works very well as an anime because it was adapted from a light novel written by one of the best writers in the game, Gen Urobuchi, as a prequel.

      *Fate is the simplest plot-and-character-wise, but a lot of people love the shit out of Saber. Unlimited Blade Works introduces the character of Heroic Spirit EMIYA, who gets memed to hell and back. Heaven's Feel is incredibly dark and fucked-up, and also contains the "true ending" because it's the route that explains the metaplot.

  Ok, we have had plenty of important questions on this reddit so far, now for something incredibly mundane: public washrooms.

  As a germophobe, I try to avoid using any washroom outside my home, but sometimes it is unavoidable. During these times, what bothers me the most can be "how do I get out of this washroom?" If it's an open door, I can just walk out. If it's a pushable door, I can push it open with my feet, which are nicely protected by my shoes. But if it's a pullable-only door? Now I'm stumped. 

  Unfortunately, the washrooms at my workplace are all closed by pullable-only doors (pullable from the inside). But what's interesting is that the handle is vertical, kind of like a horseshoe or a shopping bag handle, but made of metal and vertical. In it's intended usage, one should grasp the entire handle with a hand, and simply pull it towards oneself. But being a germaphobe, I realize I can minimize surface contact by using a single finger, which is important because the sink is inside the washroom, so I can't wash my hands again after exiting.

  This then presents an interesting problem: where should I grasp the vertical handle? The top? The bottom? The middle? There seem to be pros and cons for various positions.

  For example, small children are usually short and have poor hygiene, and may frequently grasp the handle without washing their hands, so the lower parts of the handle may be dirtier than the higher parts.

  On the other hand, you would expect taller people to grasp the door by the top, and taller people probably produce more excretions than shorter people since they have more body mass. So taller people might leave more germs on the area that they grasp, meaning the top part of the handle may actually have more germs than the lower parts.

  Then again, the gunk and grime on people's hands may include liquids, which can slide down the handle, so it might be that the lower parts are instead the dirtier portion of the handle. 

  And so I seek the knowledge (and opinions) of /r/rational, where would you grasp a vertical handle to minimize germ transfer?
  ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    Take a paper towel or bit of toilet paper with you, and use that instead of direct skin contact.

    Failing that, use two fingers to grip the upper horizontal part near the door itself, where people are least likely to have direct contact.
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:

      Seconding the use of a paper towel. That's what I was told to do from the time I was young.

  Yea or nay?

  In my experience, this proverb invariably has been true. Before I'd even heard of HPMoR, I was very conscious of needing to revise downward my expected (["prior"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hk/priors_as_mathematical_objects/)) opinions toward other people.

    I'm not sure if it's "increase contempt" so much as "decrease awe and mystery."

    The first time I encountered programming, it seemed like some kind of wizardry.  But, then I started to understand the discipline piece-by-piece.  And, once I learned enough pieces, the whole thing looks mundane.

    I bet it's similar with people.  They seem incomprehensibly competent when we meet them.  Then we learn what they're doing.

    And we lose our sense of awe.

      What? Even at my most optimistic, I never assumed that the average personal acquaintance of mine was "awesome and mysterious". Rather, I assumed that such a person was approximately equivalent to *me*. (I am, not "awesome and mysterious", but rather "cool and open to questions".) However, I soon found myself forced to lower my expectations below even that seemingly-reasonable level.

    Why?

    - The paper was *unintentionally* published in English with just male pronouns, because of an oversight while translating from Polish (in which, according to the article, pronouns are gender-nonspecific).

    - Looking at twitter, it doesn’t seem like there was an "uproar"; some female surgeons just spoke up because they already work in a field that used to be a boys club and is still male-dominated, and publishing an article titled *Modern Surgeon: Still a Master of his Trade...* only furthers that perception.

    - The editor retracted the article, because this is an issue he and the journal care about, and they didn’t want to alienate part of their target audience of surgeons.

    - The article has already been corrected, and the journal says they’ll republish a fixed version

    - The original female surgeon “instigator” on twitter has already thanked the author, and no longer has any issues with the article.

    To me, it sounds like this was a reasonable complaint that was handled fine on both sides. While PC culture can definitely get out of hand (especially in regards to language and/or gender), this situation isn't anything to get exasperated over.

        Ah, it's just a grammatical complaint? I guess that's more understandable. Although the editor never said how he would correct the issue...how would /u/ToaKraka feel about the pronouns being replaced with "his/her" or "his or her"? Or "one's"?

        Also, apologies to /u/ToaKraka for projecting the "anti-SJW" narrative onto that sigh. Many of my feeds are inundated with those types of PC stories and their subsequent vitriolic anti-PC reactions, so that was the first place my mind went.

          In many cases, `one` is not a feasible option.

    This is why I support the use of "they" as a third person singular pronoun. For third person plural, there are plenty of other constructions that can take the slack (for example "those people/those guys" or if you're feeling southern, "them").
