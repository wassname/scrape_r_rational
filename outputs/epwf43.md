  ```
  Another Black Queen reveal to a 3rd party, set-up as an excuse for us to fan wank over Cat. It’s so self indulgent but I can’t help enjoying it nonetheless.
  ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    Well it's not *just* fan wank.  It lets Cat establish, in addition to all the other little nods to her first encounters with Black, that she is just as much a Drama Queen as Amadeus.  ~~But totally not an excuse to reassure this little boy that she is the Queen of the Lost and Found.  Dammit, stop smirking Indrani!~~
    ```

    One of the things that I like about PGTE is that the internal rules of the universe allow for big cheesy moments to be entirely justified. Eg making an anguished declaration of love mid battle is a viable strategy for getting a power up and turning the tide. So from a readers perspective you can have these kind of indulgent moments without violating suspension of disbelief
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      If Cat and Hanno *aren't* involved, I sort of expect that they're holding it in reserve for exactly this scenario.  It's functionally a single use Get Out of Doom card.
      ```

      - u/narfanator:
        ```
        On an actual level, I don't see it, but I can imaging them pulling this with a pile of snark, like how Kairos through the hero off of a short balcony.
        ```

    ```
    I always love those moments in books (in any media, really). Yes, we already know the MC became a badass in whatever regard is relevant, but that 3rd party acknowledgement gives it weight, makes it real.
    ```

  ```
  I hadn't put it together previously but Ranger leaving Refuge and it collapsing makes a lot of sense.
  ```

    ```
    Also Names leaving to join the crusade and later the fight against the DK

  Any takers on akua becoming a a tutor for the newest villain in the series?
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Cat would be foolish to trust her with it. Given that Akua is definitely planning to betray her and all.
    ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    Not if she doesn’t want Tancred to think Akua’s Cat’s lover instead.

    I mean, it’ll make Akua happy...
    ```

  - u/NestorDempster:
    ```
    Are you offering odds?
    ```

    - u/Daddy_Kernal_Sanders:
      ```
      In true PGtE fashion I will offer you diamonds to piglets
      ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      I would have bet 2:1 that Akua would trap an angel, by heroism or larceny to become a heroine, but Tyrant and Hierach already used that trick so I'd need a few chapters to see the tone of akua and angelic interactions to be willing to make a projection this book, but it does still seem likely.

      Anybodies guess if it's comes out as loyalty or Cat riding her new traitorous lieutenant though.
      ```

  - u/d3nzil:
    ```
    I doubt Akua, with her skills, would have time for tutoring. I'm pretty sure Cat is working her to the bone.
    ```
