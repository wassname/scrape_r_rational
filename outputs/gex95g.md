  Hello r/rational

  This is Cinnamon Bun, a comedic take on the typical LitRPG, where every trope is played backwards. The main character is happy and doesn’t know the first thing about angst, she gets exactly no overpowered skills, and her luck isn’t all that incredible.

  The idea was to take every staple trope and cliche and do the opposite while still keeping to the core of what makes a story a LitRPG.

  It’s currently available on Royal Road, where it will be updating every weekday (Mon to Fri) until it drops off the front page, where it will continue to update three times a week for a long time (I hope!)

    Does playing tropes backwerds make this rational? I would think not.

      No, but playing them *backwards* does make it a deconstruction.

        A deconstruction does not make it a ratfic.

          Deconstruction is one of the tagged categories for the sub on the sidebar, so I think it's pretty reasonable to post one here, personally. LitRPGs tend to be hard magic, too, which is another valid tag for the sub. I haven't actually read this one, but I don't mind seeing things that aren't full rational here as long as they're properly tagged (and this one seems to be).

            Read the opening chapter.  This feels like pretty much like the oppiste of rational.  The deconstruction makes it go future into the oppise diaretion of what rational fiction is.  Unless the story changes in other chapters it is based around an airhead mc who the skill box littearly describes as niave and too pure.  All the signs point to this being a deconstruction of a the niave mc whos super luck and friendship powers lead them to defeating the bad guys, which is anthore way of saying the oppist of this sub.

              Fair enough, I can understand your reasoning there. I can't comment in any depth without actually having read it myself, but I appreciate your clarification and reply.

              Thanks for the brief; sounds like fluff more than rational fic (thinking of Threadbare).

              Out of curiosity, did you turn off autocorrect or something? Your post looks like a deconstruction of spelling.

  I like it; it's not very rational but it is very cute. Basically a sugary snack in story form.

  Fun, and I'll probably read the whole thing, but Cinnamon Bun is really not a human. They don't give their classmate a message for their parents? Or feel angst, or starvation (concerns about poison should decrease after getting Identify)? They practice cleaning rather than trying to grind for Stealth or other plausibly-useful skills? They don't notice the weird domesticity of their assigned class and immediately try cooking, sewing, etc.? They don't even think about signalling the airship?

  The story would be a lot different if these sorts of things were fleshed out - and not necessarily better at being what it is. But the protagonist would definitely be more of a person, and less of a doll animated by the needs of the plot.

  My hot take:

  I have been reading Cinnamon Bun and I like it a lot. It is very good and I will gladly recommend it to everyone. I am just not sure its rational fiction. This is not a negative thing either, I dont think the fic would be nearly as good if Broccoli was a very rational protagonist. Now, this might of course change later if Broccoli for example starts to think more critically about some of her priorities and wondering how these classes might be effecting her mental state. So depending on how meta you are going to take this (the Erogamer is good nsfw example of taking all the implications of being a protagonist of an erogame to its logical and terrifying conclusions, with out making the protagonist some avatar of rationality), the fic might eventually fit in here, but I just dont know if it fits right now.

  Generally if its good and people upvote it, that seems to be okay with everyone though so I hope some people see this thread and find something they like.

    Yeah same - I like it and it's fun, but I don't think it belongs to any of the specific definitions of "rational" in this subreddit.

    However, I do think this story falls into a lot of the themes that people who like rational fiction also like. In my head I think of it as the "sensibility porn" genre; classically, it's exemplified by things like the way Ankh-Morpork deals with invaders: by welcoming them in and selling them things.

    It's not rational, but it is reasonable and sensible in extreme situations - just because you got Isekai'd to another dimension doesn't mean you should automatically assume everything wants to kill you. Why not talk to the monsters before resorting to violence?

  RavensDagger is writing a ratfic? This has my interest, actually!

    I dont think its a ratfic.
