## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  What are your top 10 favorite works of fiction?

  &nbsp;

  I'm talking about the best of the best that you've seen/read/experienced across any medium whether it's books, movies, tv, anime, video games, web fiction etc anything really. Doesn't have to be rational either. I would like to see what people here like in general and maybe find something new to experience.

    1. **The Mysterious Island** by Jules Verne. During the time American Civil War, little group of people end up on crashing on a tropical island, where they survive using mostly their bare skills. When I've read it for a first time at 6, it was astonished. But whats more important, when I re-read it to my son when I was 30, I still found the book enjoying, which is a very rare thing for fiction books I've read through my life - most of them you just overgrow in due time.
    2. **HPMOR**. It was really a life-changing book. No less, no more.
    3. **Mother of Learning**, by [Domagoj Kurmaic](https://www.patreon.com/nobody103) aka nobody103. Lots of info about it here on Reddit, so I presume, no additional comments needed.
    4. **The Arithmancer** trilogy by [White Squirrel](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel). Harry Potter fanfic, but centered around Hermione, who, opposed to original books, is really smart, and not kinda-smart-by-plot. Also, with a very strong dramatic part. 
    5. **Worth the Candle** \- its still in progress, but there are huge amounts of text already, and it is really good. It has its weak spots, but overall - its great.
    6. **Age of the dead** trilogy by Andrey Kruz, russian writer and ex-military officer. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2018, and there are no translations and the moment. However, this is a wonderful zombie-apocalypse-themed books with a protagonists that make rational decisions. I mean, not *always smart*, but *rational.* So, they are mostly ordinary people, but without plot armor or plot-induced-stupidity. Also, the zombies are slightly more complex than usual dumb and slow walking targets, which win only because of protagonists' plot-induced stupidity.

    These a books, that I *will* eventualy re-read. Of course, there are lots of books, that I've already read more than once, but most of them I will not read again - the life is not  infinite, and there's so much more to read.
    ```

  - u/meterion:
    ```
    **Hyper Light Drifter** - absolutely gorgeous and immersive. Conveys itself perfectly to the player without the use of written language, which perfectly fits into the "drifter among aliens" concept of the game.

    **Hadestown** - never actually seen the musical, just listened to the album, but it remains a favorite to listen to while relaxing.

    **My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected.** - absolute guilty pleasure, the most light novel-ish light novel to exist. Still great.

    **The Gnoll Credo** - short and packed full of content, really appeals to a minimalistic mindset. Good kick in the pants to read every now and again.

    **Helck** - the genre shift to end all genre shifts, all perfectly foreshadowed in a way that makes perfect sense after the fact. Tears and laughter for days.

    **Witch Hat Atelier** - medieval-era harry potter in a world of nuanced morality and a bitchin' magic system, and absolutely gorgeous art on every page.

    **Dennou Coil** - deceptively slow-paced, absolute gem of a world (google glass + internet wild west = pseudo-supernatural AR shenanigans). Really tries to lull you into boredom then smacks you in the face with the last 6 episodes or so of pure hype.

    **Worth the Candle** - gets shilled all the time in here so just read that not this.

    **Permutation City** - great on its own merits but also one of the first books that really got me into scifi/fantasy and thus holds extra sentimental value.

    **Calgary's Gideon Keys** - not a straightforward recommendation. While the execution is not overly great, the *aesthetic* of urban supernatural found tales is exactly what I was looking for when I first stumbled across it. Similar to The Holders Series before that community got infested by terminal edge syndrome.

    In no particular order:

    1. [Book] **Master and Margarita**, I really feel like this is a book which is *perfect* at what it does. I couldn't think of a single thing that could be improved.

    2. [Book] **HPMoR**. I kinda see why people might dislike it, but for me, this was a life-changing book.

    3. [Series] **BoJack Horseman**, which has *by far* the best representation of mental illnesses in all of television. Watching it is probably my most painfully relatable experience with media.

    4. [Webcomic] **Romantically Apocalyptic**. It's a pleasure for eyes, and I really enjoy deciphering the highly cryptic plot, much more so than in Homestuck, for comparison.

    5. [Videogame] **Factorio**. More like Cracktorio, amiright?

    6. [Manga] **Made In Abyss**. Haunting and engaging, and damn if it's not the most beautiful manga I've ever seen.

    7. [Book] **Atlas Shrugged**. Before you skin me alive for having the worst taste in reading ever, I'd like to note that I recognize all its flaws and like it because it's something *I could've written* when I was 16. Down to the mistakes, to the characterization, to the plot points, to the ideas, to the style... I read it and was amazed at how *young me* this book was. It's the nostalgia of the highest caliber, and nothing has ever come close.

    8. [Web Original] **CORDYCEPS: Too clever for their own good**. I like it for reasons that can't be disclosed, and if you aren't familiar with this story, please don't try to learn more—just go ahead and read it. Literally once-in-a-lifetime experience.

    9. [Videogame] **Baba Is You**, the best puzzle game I've ever played.

    10. Several well-written shipping fics that provided amazing emotional feedback loop. Guilty pleasure, so I really see no reason to list them by names.

    - u/Ontosomatics:
      ```
      Out of all of those, one punch man is the only one you'd identify as a guilty pleasure? For me, the wandering inn and homestuck are guiltier than OPM (and I like each of them).
      ```

      - u/jiffyjuff:
        ```
        I feel like The Wandering Inn is underrated. It's got solid character development, distinct character voices, quite consistent worldbuilding—I was rereading the first volume recently and was actually impressed at how much foreshadowing I'd originally dismissed as throwaway fluff—and is just all-round my favorite ongoing text serial right now. I will admit that there's something about that feels guilty pleasurish, but I can't quite pin it and I don't think it fits in that category for me personally.

        Homestuck, on the other hand, has plenty of guilt-inducing elements that I'm not going to bother listing, but I also admire it *as a literary work* for its originality, themes and the raw creativity of the whole work. Its takes on predestination, identity, etc. are interesting and engaging without being preachy. It's something I could see being brought up in a literature class, for its clever use of medium and the sheer ambition of the project if for nothing else.

        OPM... it's a good work of fiction. I enjoy reading and watching it, but not as much as some of the others on the list. There are some interesting themes and characters in it, there's an original premise, but that's really the most I can say about it. ONE doesn't impress me as much as Andrew Hussie, and One Punch Man doesn't entertain me as much as the Wandering Inn. It's a guilty pleasure not because of anything wrong with it, but because I can't name anything special about it beyond "I like reading it"—which is perfectly fine, that's the ultimate goal of entertainment media, after all! But if it hadn't been specified "top ten", it wouldn't be on the list at all.
        ```

          > I will admit that there's something about that feels guilty pleasurish

          I think this is part of the author really making an effort to add humor and 'slice of life' elements that create atmosphere. A lot of authors just skim by that to keep everything tight and related to the plot, but pirateaba isn't afraid to let characters breath for a bit. 

          There's something really special about their style, and a great understanding over writing.

    That’s a question I ask myself all the time. I think right now they are probably, in no particular order: 

    Worm by Wildbow (aka. John McCrae), 

    Sufficiently Advanced Magic, 

    The First 15 Lives of Harry August, 

    Ra, 

    14 by Peter Clines, 

    Delve by SenescentSoul, 

    My Hero Academia (more for the FF Iv’e imagined. I think you could pack all the anime I’ve ever watched together into one recommendation. It’s fun to watch but generally doesn’t leave you with much afterwords. So you could add Sailor Moon, R+V (the manga) and such like Doctor Stone and Naruto. Nothing particularly amazing but, still.), 

    The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, 

    Harry Potter (I loved it when I was a small child, not so much now but it’s certainly become a part of who I am), 

    And perhaps a bottle of all the ‘rational’ fiction I’ve read. Even though a lot of it is self aggrandizing it has a tendency to get you thinking about your own behaviors. I know I act irrationally more often then not and examining the motivation, or lack of, behind my choices is fairy fascinating. That’s not a work of fiction though so, perhaps

    Doctor Who (though it’s dragged on, as it tends too, and I’ve neglected to watch the recent episodes. Much like HP, it has become a remnant of my youth.) 

    And there is a dossier on my interests. I wonder how much I’ve revealed about myself on reddit... 


    tl;dr - Read ‘The First 15 Lives of Harry August by Claire North’. It’s a fairly high quality piece of fiction revolving around what reality might be like if certain individuals lived their lives over and over again.

    Fair warning Time Braid is... not a work of classic literature. It goes to a lot of strange places. It’s overarching story, once the convoluted romance is removed, is fairly interesting. Though this... pains me.

    If you're looking for time travel stories, I can highly recommend [All Night Laundry](http://www.all-night-laundry.com/), a recently-completed webcomic. Time loops are present but the mechanics are different from the kind that you see in most other fiction.

    ```
    [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) is a Naruto fanfiction centered around time loops. It's fairly popular around here.

    [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) features a protagonist who gradually grows in power, somewhat like Zorian does in Mother of Learning. There's a magic academy arc, but it's not a major part of the story. You may have heard of this one already - it's one of the best works of rational fiction out there - but in case you haven't, I'd highly recommend that you check it out.

    [Harry Potter and the Natural 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20) resembles HPMOR more than MoL since it's, you know, a Harry Potter fanfiction, but it fits the criteria of being rational and set in a magic academy. It's also hilarious and full of munchkinry. Note that while the first and second "books" are complete, the third one is unfinished and hasn't been updated in over a year.

        Not really - I read Time Braid and have never read Naruto. It mostly explains what you need to know, and there's a good Naruto wiki if you need more background info than it provides. But I didn't enjoy Time Braid as much as many other readers, and unfamiliarity with Naruto probably played a part in that.

      - u/nohat:
        ```
        A bit late, but I also read Time Braid before knowing anything about Naruto (or Oh my Goddess) and enjoyed it. However it was very confusing to read Naruto fanfiction later because Time Braid is a rather unique reinterpretation. Generally it really does assume Naruto knowledge, though you can fill in the gaps for most of it. Probably worst of all the climax is a massive Deus Ex Machina without knowing something about Naruto (I was seriously annoyed by it). However you can probably skim the wiki and get the idea.

  [Sumire 16-Sai!!](https://myanimelist.net/manga/5820/Sumire%E2%99%A116-sai) is a story about a kind, upbeat, and outgoing high school girl, who withstands the bullying and derision of her classmates with a cheery smile. She's also a ventriloquist puppet controlled by a middle age man who never, ever, breaks character. This is obvious to all the students and staff at the school, except for the headmaster, who is evidently the only person to believe in Sumire.

  This manga was surreal, hilarious, and oddly touching. 8/10

  Just finished Unsong. Somehow it had been in my to-read pile for ages and I'd completely missed any mention that it's funny. Unsong is very funny. Also it's pretty good overall, and the first book of it is great. Though later on I feel like it's weighed down by under-using some of its best characters and relationships. Overall, best summary is this quote by /u/NotACauldronAgent in one of the comment threads: “That is both really clever and the stupidest thing I ever heard.”

  Sports recommendation: bouldering has a lot more puzzle-solving elements than I expected, and is actually pretty videogamey. Would recommend if you're looking for physical activity and it's available in your area.

  Rec request: Looking for a short, archetypical xianxia story. Good writing would be a plus, but being short is a substitute. Doesn't have to be rational or deconstructionist at all. I'd like to know more about what this genre is and whether I like it before starting to read something with 40,000 chapters.
  ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    I'm not sure there are *any* short Xianxia stories. They're essentially almost entirely about rising from the bottom rung of the cosmic power ladder to the very top, and whilst that often happens unreasonably fast by the standards of the other characters, it takes a very large wordcount.

    I can only recommend on the basis of quality.

    * Reverend Insanity's been pretty good (with an amoral protagonist, mind.) 
    * The first time I tried to read Forty Milleniums of Cultivation I couldn't get past chapter two. The second time I picked it up and read the whole 1700 chapters - it's easily my favourite Xianxia novel. It subverts several Xianxia tropes but II don't think you have to be familiar with them to appreciate them.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      I'm willing to tentatively believe that something about Xianxia stories forces them to be long, but I'm sure I've read short stories where the protagonist ascends to godhood, so that doesn't seem sufficient.

      Thanks for the recs; I think I'm going to hold out for someone trying to boil the genre down, but the upvotes say some other readers got use out of them.

        I think the core mechanism of all Xianxia, Cultivation, is intrinsicly a long and painstaking process. I suspect you'll come up empty-handed, but if you do succeed I'd be really interested in seeing a "short Xianxia" story!

  Can anyone recommend to me some interesting works of ‘rational fiction’? Assume I’ve read all the popular ones (Ra, 14, Sufficiently Advanced Magic Series, Into the Labyrinth, Metropolitan Man, MoL, HPMoR, N20, the Martian, Wildbow’s Stuff, Delve, He Who Fights Monsters, Life Reset (was terrible, don’t read it) etc. etc.). 

  LitRPGs, gamelit, etc. are also a genre I’m trying to find more of. Most of what I’ve read has either been translated so badly it results in immediate unimmersion, someone patting themself on the back for being special in a world specifically created for them, has uncomfortable and unnecessary religious undertones, frankly ridiculous or contrived premises, HaReMs, polygamy, wanton violence, terrible writing, cOnTriVeD premises, etc. 

  I’m despairing of finding any more vaguely quality content to feed my boredom. 

  Help me. Please.

    [The Gods are Bastards](https://tiraas.net/) can maybe be described as [an anti-Worm](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ekv9s8/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fdhjx2r/) in terms of tone. It's a pretty straightforward Fantasy, but mixes things up by questioning *why* a fantasy world might exist, and what might happen if it started to go through an industrial revolution. The biggest draw here is the characters, who are excellent, and there's a lot of them. This is currently ongoing, with a mostly consistent update schedule. It doesn't come at things from a rational angle, but the characters act consistently and generally rationally, the world is internally consistent, and it hits enough of the same themes to be relevant to the same audience, I think. I also think it deserves more support and viewership, so try it out.

    [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/) is an excellent LitRPG - but instead of becoming the hero, the main character instead decides to run an inn. Starts off a bit slow, but is currently one of the most engaging web serials I follow, with an extremely well thought-out setting and a wonderful cast of characters, along with very good writing. This is currently ongoing, in its sixth book with a consistent (and extremely robust) update schedule.

    [Lord of the Mysteries](https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/chapter-1). English TL just finished up to Vol 4, which is my personal favourite.

    The MC woke up as a forced suicide victim in a Lovecraft-inspired world (among other things like SCP, Bloodborne, steampunk fantasy Victorian England) and realised within the first 10 chapters that he's not the first to be kidnapped to that world due to some anachronistic things all invented 100+ years ago by an "amazing inventor" Emperor.

    Be warned that it's a translated from Chinese work and the word choices by the translator is a bit weird. Still a high 7/10 work with excellent plot and atmosphere.

  So after reading all 7 Cradle novels Ive discovered there's a huge world of XianXia fics. Could you all recommend your favorites to me?

  I have read sufficiently advanced magic and shadows of what was lost. 

  Also is there anywhere I can go to discuss cradle with people? Now that I know book 8 is coming out in March there is so much I want to discuss and theorize before it comes out.

  I guess for recommendations Id like to recommend two pieces which have probably been recommended in this sub before but want to mention them in case it slipped by anyone.

   [Chrysalis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis). It is an isekai similar to Im a Spider, So What? In that the protag is transported to another world as a monster. Unlike Im a Spider, it keeps that lighthearted tone from the beginning throughout, up to its latest chapter. It is not finished but has a huge chunk of chapters and updates almost daily, but in short bits. It's fun to see a protagonist be lighthearted but also consider the ramifications of their actions. It is not rational, I wouldnt even call it rational adjacent, but the character isnt dumb. Any dumb mistakes made by people are in-character for them, rather than forcing the plot to progress.  The only downside is that the updates are often rather short and leave you watching more, so when you catch up Id leave it for a week or two at a time and then read the updates in one burst. 

  [Cordyceps](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868). I just love this story.

    Does [Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4) count? I'm not *that* familiar with the Chinese genres but I like this one. I think it's worth a look even if you normally aren't much into LitRPG and related genres.
    ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    Lazily copying from another comment of mine:

    * Reverend Insanity's been pretty good (with an amoral protagonist, mind.)

    * The first time I tried to read Forty Milleniums of Cultivation I couldn't get past chapter two. The second time I picked it up and read the whole 1700 chapters - it's easily my favourite Xianxia novel. It subverts several Xianxia tropes but I don't think you have to be familiar with them to appreciate them.
    ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    The only other xanxia I have found that I liked almost as much as Cradle was Street Cultivation. Someone else on this sub described it as xanxia + capitalism, and it's set in a much more "modern" world than most xanxia. Book 1 is available on Amazon, and book II is currently updating on Royal Road. 

    The only criticism I have of it is that the main character looks at everything a bit too...coldly? Maybe? Not sure how to describe it, but it results in him not really seeming entirely like a real person. This is partially due to his absolute laser focus on cultivation/advancement/etc. which is sort of a staple of the genre, but there is just something that very subtly yet consistently triggers my "would a real person really react like that/think that?" reflex. But even with that criticism, I still thing that overall the characters are well written and the dialogue is mostly pretty good, including the MC. If you liked Cradle, I'm pretty sure you will like Street Cultivation.

  So I recently read [Tres](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tres-worm-twig-pact.629296/), which is a short but surprisingly good Worm/Pact/Twig crossover and it reminded me of how much I like the Pact magic system. Y'all got any good Pact fanfiction or stories with a similar magic system?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Mostly crossovers with Worm:

    [Familiar](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/familiar-pact-worm.629776/) has Taylor die during the Cell arc, and be summoned from the Abyss by Molly Walker. Not dead according to the author's beta reader.

    [The Barber](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mans-one-shots-and-snippets-worm.624913/#post-51845468) by the same author - three chapters of Taylor triggering with the Barber's powerset.

    [Aspects](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au.724264/#post-54733534), still the same guy: Four-way fusion of Worm, Pact, Twig, and Harry Potter, with the post-canon protagonists of each work being inserted at the start of Hogwarts in a slightly different HP-world which seems to slowly be merging with the Pact universe.

    More recommendations in [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/d6zx5g/fireborn_pact_destiny_crossover/) thread, but the only really good one which had an actual story was [Knights of Broken Swords](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10888845/1/Knights-of-Broken-Swords), which has Blake from during the Lordship Contest of Jacob's Bell end up in Dresden Files to assist Butters with a side mission.

  Lately I've had an itch for what I'm going to call "overwhelming odds isekai". A protagonist ends up in a world or siituation where the bottom rung of the food chain is still about ten rungs higher than them and only survives^(\*) through luck, time loop shenanigans or being amazingly careful.

  [The Snake Report](https://thesnekreport.com/) is my favourite (and also only) example of this (made up) genre. Person gets reincarnated as a tiny snake in an everything-eat-snake world and survives mostly due to luck and resourcefulness. >!And the mercy of the tiny snake god.!<

  I'd appreciate any recommendations or nudges towards the real name of this genre, if there is one!

  ^(\*Survival of the protagonist is not necessarily a requirement, but I imagine a story where the protagonist permanently dies in the first two lines would be rather short. (And very funny))

  What creators have y'all started supporting on Patreon or a Patreon-like system? (Though ofc if you list too many people might be able to figure out your account, so be careful)

   [Macronomicon's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Macronomicon/) is one I particularly like - Wake of the Ravager is being run in a way that's almost like an inverse quest, with the author asking people for ability suggestions and then the character picking them.

    Did you try [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/)? Urban Fantasy, definitely fits the "big scary world" aspect, but the magic powers system is much more loosely defined. Basically, if you can convince the Spirits that make up the universe that you should be able to do something, you are able to do it.

  Can someone recommend me a fast paced story? I love rational fic, but most of the time it takes like 20 chapters for something interesting to actually happen. I want a story where the protagonist actually achieve something with his/her efforts rather than just talk endlessly about it.

    [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/) starts with action, and basically never stops. The main character does rarely ever have time to stop and think for even a moment. Reading it all at once actually felt like a slog because of that, but reading along at two chapters or three per week, like the [Deep in Pact](https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/) podcast, actually made it really nicely paced.

    How necessary is the -hobo part? [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/)'s protagonist Sylvester is more readily classified as a state-sponsored terrorist in a biopunk 1920ies, where the Frankenstein experiments enabled the British Crown to conquer the world with zombie armies. Him and his group of friends are kid experiments, used as spies and assassins to hunt down dissenters and rebels. The webserial is their coming-of-age story.

    Sylvester in particular is infamous for his convoluted plots and plans, which usually end with him hurt and his opponent dead or worse.
