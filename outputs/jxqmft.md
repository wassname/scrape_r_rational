## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I have a story I'm still writing, and I got to the point in the story where the self insert for me and the summoner I'm working with purges the depression from my soul.

  I have to say, as someone with depression, putting your depression inside a story and then arranging for it to have the crap beaten out with teamwork of it feels good. Even if the method, out of context, is utterly ridiculous.

  Actually, it feels EVEN better that it is ridiculous. I told depression to take a nap, and then had a pile of nearly helpless babies all punch it for one damage while it was sleeping, and that's the kind of undignified end it deserves.

  HPMOR [Chapter 119](https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/119) is happening right now, and noone is paying it much attention,

  >[Harry had given himself until noon tomorrow to figure out how to begin using the Stone without it being grabbed by someone else, trying not to think about what was still happening, what had always been happening, in the meanwhile.](https://i.redd.it/vur1ujg50j811.png)

  With analogy to the fact that the coronavirus vaccine has just been [forwarded to the FDA for emergency approval, but instead of giving themselves as short a time as possible, they're waiting until December to hold their first meeting. ](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/11/the-fdas-vaccine-advisory-committee-will-meet-dec-8-10.html) It's a shame we don't feel the urgency the same way HJPEV did.

  To add to this, I think the expected utility of a covid vaccine is comparable to the stone over the course of a year, 

  >Once you know how it works, the Stone can do one complete restoration to full health and youth every two hundred and thirty-four seconds. Three hundred sixty people per day. One hundred and thirty-four thousand healings per year. That should be enough to stop, all the wizards everywhere, and all the goblins and house-elves and whoever, from dying. Of old age, or anything else.

  134,000 deaths per year is about 3 months of US covid deaths at current rates, with an [average of 10 years of life lost each](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200923124557.htm). Now each philosophers stone healing probably gives you a lot more life years, say 100 since we're talking about wizards (how long do goblins and house-elves live?), so 13.4 million life years saved per year.

  The covid epidemic is expected to most likely kill [2.7 to 7.4 million people by next March ](https://goodjudgment.io/superforecasts/), I.e. 27 to 74 million life years lost. So if a vaccine prevents a decent fraction of that it could be more effective than a year of stone use (assuming the qualities of life in each scenario are equal).

  Have any of y'all played around with https://artbreeder.com/create to make fan-art of popular fics on here? I was quite impressed with [these realizations](https://i.imgur.com/3eNkOqC.jpg) (from >!Avatar: The Legend of Korra!<; see if you can guess who they are! credit to [riverfollower712](https://www.reddit.com/user/riverfollower712/submitted/)) and it seems like a pretty low barrier-to-entry way for authors and fans alike to generate imagery to accompany their stories, specifically wrt to "landscapes", "portraits", and "characters".

    Artbreeder is incredible. Super fun to play around with. Found out about it from the author of a book on RR (A Courting of Life and Death) who had made an artbreeder realization for each character in the book. It looked amazing so I wanted to know how they did it haha.

  I have discovered what I think may be the arithmetic inverse of the unfalsifiable statement. I call them hyperfalsifying statements.

  An unfalsifiable statement is one which could still be true no matter what plausible evidence you could hypothetically collect. There is no test you could do to determine whether you live in the universe where it is true, or false. Souls are unfalsifiable, as is the invisible pink dragon in my garage. 

  A hyperfalsifying statement, however, is one which allows you to reject all other philosophical or epistemological positions with equal efficacy, if you take it as a given. For instance, it is true that human reason is a flawed tool for determining truth. It is also true that we must necessarily involve reason in the process of doing literally anything other than being a vegetable with our sensory inputs. Therefore, if you take the true statement, "Human reason is flawed" as an axiom, it is impossible to hold any other axioms, because literally all of them must go through this flawed, untrustworthy tool. Therefore, "Human reason is flawed" is a hyperfalsifying statement in the context of epistemological debate UNLESS you burden it with a bunch of caveats that effectively draw out an epistemology anyway.

  I realize hyperfalsifying statements are as useless in constructing our view of the world as unfalsifiable ones. But they're useless in *new and exciting ways* which I, for one, hadn't considered before. So I decided I'd write it up here.

  So I've read a few time loop stories here.  Mother of Learning of course, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past, RE: Trailer Trash, and such.

  What all would you do if the present you was inserted into past-you's body at some earlier point in time?  What starting point would you pick, and why?  What would you change about your own past and relationships, and what might you change about the world?

  I'd likely pick the end of 5th grade for myself.  I don't think I'd go for band class (with the clarinet), and probably just study guitar on my own.  I'd have also done more to help my parents, and such. I would have tried to get in shape earlier, back when it was easier.

  I've had ideas for at least 3 (original!) SF novels rattling around in my head, so having plenty of free time to work on those would be good. Even if I published them now, I don't think they'd have much of an impact, but back then (when the market was much, much smaller), I'd have a much greater chance of success.  That in turn would provide an infusion of cash to invest in various stocks (tech companies of course).  For example, I'd be able to ride Microsoft to its 1999 peak, and then shift that over to Apple, along with investing in the usual suspects (Google, etc.).

  I'd also likely try to influence politics a bit, and try to get climate change and pollution more widely accepted.  The Koch brothers would be a problem there. 

  Preventing the Sept 11th, 2001 attack seems like a good idea, and would be an "easy" way to prevent a lot of unnecessary suffering.  I don't know that the Iraq invasion could have been prevented without also keeping GWB out of the president's office, so I'd have to interfere there as well, most likely.

  I'd also likely try to push for greater energy independence.  I like the present work with small modular fission reactors, and I don't see any reason why that couldn't have been pushed forward a couple decades.  I'd also push Thorium MSR technology, but we have yet to see that pay off, so I'd want to hedge bets there. Ditto for Fusion.

  There's some other social things I'd push.  I would be good to find at least one major city that would be on-board with decriminalizing drugs, and pushing for treatment instead of jail.  If that alleviates poverty and promotes growth (and the entire process is well documented), that could also move things forward by a couple decades.

  I'd probably move to New Zealand or South Korea before 2020, for obvious reasons.

    The one problem I have with these ideas is that its a lot harder to bring change then people thing.  Just because I know stuff is gonna go down does not mean I can convince people to do something about it.  And for all you know your earlier history makes things that  slightly different (so maybe instead of 9/11 its 9/12 for example).  The best thing you can do is self improvement.

    If a couple hundred million dollars could swing an election, the world would look pretty different. But given that you know which area was in dispute, you could really concentrate your effort there, and so the 2000 election seems particularly swingable. Funny that you think the pandemic would still happen in 2020, you really must think the butterfly effect is not a thing or something.

      > Funny that you think the pandemic would still happen in 2020, you really must think the butterfly effect is not a thing or something.

      Since you mention that, maybe move to NZ by 2010.

      The exact circumstances of Covid-19 are certainly subject to the butterfly effect.  The reactions by the various world governments and their constituents is a lot more stable.  Some kind of pandemic was bound to hit us.  Maybe SARS v2.0, who knows?

      Even without 45 in the White House, undermining the hard work of the public health officials (and yes, there are a variety of paths I would pursue to ensure that never happens), you'd still have the right-wing media calling it a hoax, and "freedom-loving patriots" not wanting to wear a mask or exercise some common sense.

      Steering the entire country in a better direction (less bigoted, etc) would be too much for anyone, even with a lot of valuable foreknowledge.

        Broadly agree. You'd at least know it was in the cards, though you might see other long tail events instead.

        > Some kind of pandemic was bound to hit us. Maybe SARS v2.0, who knows?

        FYI, COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and its mechanism is a “better” way of killing people, so it’s SARS 2.0 literally in two ways, structure and function:

        > Benhur Lee, MD, a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says the difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 likely stems from an extra protein each of the viruses requires to activate and spread. Although both viruses dock onto cells through ACE2 receptors, another protein is needed to crack open the virus so its genetic material can get into the infected cell. The additional protein the original SARS virus requires is only present in lung tissue, but the protein for SARS-CoV-2 to activate is present in all cells, especially endothelial cells.

        The result is that SARS 1 was a respiratory disease, but SARS 2 is a circulatory disease that also attacks lungs. Apropos to the sub, this conceptually shows a good way to do a sequel: amp up and modify the original threat in a surprising way.

    If I went back to my childhood with arbitrary levels of future knowledge I could swing the 2000 election, probably? If for no other reason than I could become fantastically wealthy pretty fast in the stock market and then throw that money into moving the race.

    That's pretty much the single biggest inflexion point for the world in my lifetime and it's hard to see myself making any other choice.

    Also I would do and say so many fewer cringy things. I would be so much kinder than I was as a kid, so much better a friend. Because honestly, I can put in the work right now to get into better shape (and I am) but I can't unsay the hurtful things I did or said when I was a child.

  I posted this on the last Friday Open Thread, but a few days late to the party.  Trying again today!

  I thought it might be worthwhile to create a document summarizing a bunch of knowledge that could be useful for writing a character with the power of Aerokinesis. Here is the outline that I've thought up so far:

  * Gases – State of Matter
      * Ideal gas law, vacuum, etc.
  * Atmosphere
      * Composition
      * Pressure & Temperature
      * Layers
  * Wind 
      * Wind Speed (definitions and measurement)
      * Wind Power.
  * Weather – Other aspects of.
  * Biology – Respiration
  * Geomorphology – Aeolian processes and features.
  * Mythology – Sky, Wind, & Weather Gods.

  What do you humans think? Any constructive thoughts and feedback?  Or emotionally-withering criticism?

  ~~P.S.: Is there a way to do sub-bullets in Reddit? I don't see anything about it in the formatting help.~~
  ```

  - u/mainaki:
    ```
    Brainstorming fairly widely:

    * You mention Biology-Respiration, but that is a special case of chemical reactions involving air.
    * Concepts of flow, like laminar versus turbulent
    * Helicopters do some weird things: autorotation, vortex ring state. General principles of flight, including lift, thrust, stability, and control surfaces. Ground-effect. (The physics of sailing ship sails are also a bit non-obvious if I recall? Tacking to sail into the wind, if nothing else.)
    * How aerokinesis and force/thrust interact (momentum-conserving or not)
    * Net thrust generation by only pushing air away from front of craft. If a vacuum can be tolerated, that alone is 14.7 pounds of force per square inch of cross-section. A DBZ one-man space-capsule thing would get, what, at 6ft diameter, 239 thousand pounds of force, is that right? In excessive of 250 g's initial acceleration (drag notwithstanding)? (*"The NHTSA standard for a sudden impact acceleration on a human that would cause severe injury or death is 75 g's for a "50th percentile male", 65 g's for a "50th percentile female", and 50 g's for a "50th percentile child"*).
    * Air-hockey or hovercraft effect: using air-flow or a bubble of air to reduce or avoid friction
    * Cushioning a fall (or the reverse: launching)
    * Buoyancy in air, air buoyancy in water, adding bubbles to water to reduce boyancy
    * Transmission of sound
    * Sound barrier, sonic boom, pressure waves, overpressure/blast waves/explosions
    * Scattering of light, lensing, schlieren photography, rainbow effect
    * Re-entry-style 'burn up' (apparently from compression of the air rather than friction with object? TIL)
    * Convection
    * Plasma and ions; liquids
    * Moving ions are affected by and generate magnetic fields
    * Particulates
    * Air/fuel ratios, stoking
    * Dust explosions, relighting candles by igniting the 'smoke', gasoline fumes
    * Backdraft, firestorms
    * Tornadoes, water spouts, dust devils, hurricanes/typhoons
    * Lightning, volcanic lightning, thundersnow
    * Hail formation
    * Impact winter, volcanic winter
    * Pressurized air can be deadly dangerous
    * Bubbles in blood stream is dangerous
    * Vacuum-sealed, air-tight
    * Whistling
    * Superfluidity
    * Solar wind, cosmic wind, northern lights
    * Accretion disks, Van Allen belt
    * Transitions between phases (wild difference between liquid volume and gas volume, or density; latent energy; triple point; pressurizing to the point of condensing; refrigeration using both pressure change and phase change; sublimation)
    * Mole (the unit)
    * The exoskeleton with artificial muscles powered by the pressure created by hydrolysis; other reactions that consume or produce pressure
    * Partial pressure
    * Dissolving gasses in liquids
    * Zero gravity
    * Relationship between temperature, molecular weight, and velocity
    * Uranium enrichment via mass-based separation via centrifuging gas
    * Something something Jupiter's red spot and blue poles
    * Viscosity, and its increasing relevance at small scales like for bugs
    * Scent, scent-tracking, 'down-wind'
    * Ballistics windage (and, not really related to wind, but I mean I guess air is not exactly anchored to the ground, so sort of?: Coriolis/Eotvos effects cause 'curving' of ballistic paths and thus I assume of the paths of air particles as well (between particle-particle interactions))
    * Windmills, turbines
    * Sand-blasting, power-washing

    That- That's about it.

      Heat transfer and fluid mechanics would be useful at different levels depending on the hardness of the system. I would suggest starting the wiki rabbit hole at the [Reynolds number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number). Certainly, knowing at what speeds air flows smoothly vs when it become turbulent would be useful at the very least.

      Yes!  I actually starting trying to wrap my mind around wind drag over a year ago... and then found other concerns to distract myself with.  But part of my difficulty was in trying to track down coefficients of drag for the human body (from a source other than Wikipedia).  I found one really old scientific report that *looked* like it was going to provide coefficients for several different positions, but then just didn't, as far as I could understand it.
