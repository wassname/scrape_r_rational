## Effects of blood wards?

### Post:

Assume a magic ward that repels blood, and nothing else. What would happen if someone put their finger through it? Tried to force their way in? Was slammed into it?

Edit: thanks for all the responses!

  Well, let's think about it physically. If ONLY blood can't pass through it, then any body part that does would have the blood forced out of it.

  If this happens slowly, things are probably OK for a minute or two, but without oxygenated blood tissues will start dying off fairly quickly.

  If it happens fast, then you've got a problem. Because the circulatory system is one-way, you're going to have some backflow problems. Because you're pushing all the blood out along a plane, the blood can't move from the arterial side to the venous side. You'd be drastically increasing pressure back along the arterial system, which would affect the heart and lungs. The venous side would be a little less affected, being lower pressure anyway. However, if you were moving the body part backwards through the ward, you could blow out your venous system, since there are one-way valves that block blood from backflowing.

  And this would only get worse the faster/harder you passed the plane of the ward. If someone slammed you into it, imagine all the blood in your body just bursting out of you on whichever side of your body passed the ward last.

  Almost same as regular barrier/solid wall, your finger stops.
  Blood is fairly evenly distributed in your body and instead of you skin being stopped by wall and then it in turn stopping flesh which stops bones which etc etc etc, this time its just blood which still has EM presence (unless blood ward interferes with tangibility of blood) that stops flesh that stops bones and so on and so forth.

    Won't it just empty your veins in the finger? Since, as liquid, being pushed, can move it along veins

    Not that that's a good thing to happen.

    Even worse if the wards destroys blood going through, in which case, you'll be getting massive blood loss symptoms if you pass through unknowingly.

      If it repels blood, then blood is pushed like on a wall, but blood is liquid so it pushes against itself in your body, it can leave small empty space in your veins if they bypass barrier and blood is left behind.
      But I don't think blood is compressible so all you would be doing is raising your blood pressure much like squeezing your finger with strong rubber band makes it pop.

      If you try to *run* or drive through it, you might be in trouble.

  Something to consider though is that a blood ward that can act upon the blood inside of a person's body implies that the body has no (effective) inherent/passive magic resistance. If that's the case, this universe makes it *extremely easy* to kill people with magicâ€”to the point that without constantly-maintained active magic defenses, anyone can just go around popping blood vessels in brains and killing people. 

  That's why in MoL for example, there's passive magic defenses on each person. So I'd assume in a case like a blood ward, the ward would either not be able to sense the presence of blood below the skin and would be ineffective or the body's passive magic defenses would distribute the repulsive force across the body to make it no different from a wall or force field.

  Don't forget about the implications of your magic on the practicality of the setting when designing it.

  It depends on whether it's a field or a wall.  

  If it's a wall, then nothing much happens.  Your blood hits the side of your capillaries and effectively transmits the force to the nearest part of your body.

  If it's a field that applies a 10g horizontal acceleration inside of its volume, then you can push your hand (or entire body) into the field.  (I'm assuming 5 l of blood in a 50 kg person (10.567 pints in 110 lb)). While in the field, the total force on your body would be like climbing a 45 degree slope at 1.41g, which is totally possible.  The difference in pressure between your furthest-forward and furthest-back points is 1.3mmHg/mm, or enough to drop your blood pressure to zero (or double it) in four inches.  This would almost certainly cause you to pass out, or cause death if you went in head/feet first.

  The only really interesting part I feel would be the injuries.

  if you walked up and tried gently pushing through, pretty much nothing would happen, except maybe a few bruises.

  If you tried consistently going through it, or laying on it, it would slowly deprive small parts of your body of blood. It doesn't seem like it would be dramatic, but it would cause some weird illnesses/injuries.

  Slammed into it? Vessels pop all over the place. Quick death. Maybe even painless.

  Munchkin time: such a ward can be used to stop bleeding as if it were a band-aid.  It could even stop otherwise deadly injuries if you can contour its shape around where the skin would normally be.

   Military application - a blood-ward body suit makes for an unusually resillient soldier because most minor injuries are simply cosmetic. A career soldier might end up being more concerned about the mana reaerves than the injuries (1 ward left unspent, so still as good as uninjured)

  You can clean surgical tools quickly, though maybe germs get left behind.

  Actually, you could clean up all sorts of blood illnesses by using a blood ward to direct blood one way and everything else another. Imagine an implant that slows the spread of certain cancers by diverting blood out of your body and back in through such a ward while it captures everything else.

  On another track, preparing meat for consumption gets easier (cheaper) since you can use the ward to drain the blood instead of having to wait for it


  Actually what counts as blood? Plasma? Platelets? A specific mix with just the right set of ratios normally seen in human blood?
