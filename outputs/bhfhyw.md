  One of the few halfway decent stories posted on the wasteland that is /r/HFY.

  I second the recommendation.

    What are some other decent stories on there? Every time I try something I'm disappointed.

      Not a whole lot of rational fic. Some of it is pretty cliche. But there are some gems if you can find them. 

      Two of my favorites are:

      - [The Deathworlders Saga](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/chronological_reading_order) - One of the first stories exploring the trope of "Oh what if humans are overpowered compared to all alien life". It inspired several offshoot series set in the same universe, which ended up being canonized and brought back into the central storyline. 

      - [Memories of Creature 88](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/creature_88) - The protagonist ends up on a space station, and joins the police force due to his consciousness being tied to a chip + cloning machine thing. His consciousness is backed up regularly, and whenever he dies the last copy is put into a new clone. Ends up coming in handy

      I follow one specific author on r/HFY because I love pretty much everything that they write. Here's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/bdwblx/the_oxygen_apocalypse_part_5_of_5/el16cwd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) to all of the stories written by u/crumjd. Nearly all of them are one-shots.

      The C1764 stories written by Weerdo5255 are decent. I wouldn't call them rational, but they are enjoyable. There was one whose title I can no longer find, but it was a one shot basically about a human space red cross organization. That one was a big enough deal for long enough that if you ask for the title on hfy, someone will provide it for you. I think the ~~Archangel~~ (edit) *Last Angel* series (which I believe has been posted to this sub before) and which is currently ongoing on the spacebattles site was started on hfy. Again, not exactly rational, but pretty good, and manages to avoid a lot of the "humans are great mostly because every other species is an idiot" stuff. It's VERY long and drags on in some places, but overall pretty interesting and, especially in the more recent stuff, is giving a much more nuanced, balanced view of the "bad" guys.

  I've read up to chapter 14 so far, and my opinion is mixed.

  On the one hand, characterization/plot/worldbuilding aren't objectionable per se, barring one major exception. It's not the hardest of hard sci-fies, but there are interesting ideas here and there — I especially appreciated >!the reason behind the aliens' depopulation of Earth: perverse internal incentives made it economically beneficial for the fleet which discovered the planet!< — and it's always nice to read about exponential replicators pwning alien empires.

  On the other hand, the aforementioned objection *is* pretty major: the aliens. They're very clearly just reskinned humans. They have different bodies, different societies, different biology, sure, but they still think like humans, possess human emotional makeup, and even have humanoid bodies. Given that the premise of the story is the righteous crusade of the last surviving human upload against alien exterminators, that's pretty bad for engagement.

  And hence, how comes >!the protagonist doesn't realize it's being the villain much sooner? I get it, it's consumed by revenge and willfully denies reality, but, like, there are *degrees* of reality-denial. It's one thing to believe that this nation you're waging a war on is made up of exclusively evil people; it's quite another to believe that a civilization of bipedal sentient beings which builds "cities" and forms "republics" is so alien to humanity as to have negative moral worth. It's the difference between looking at a stranger and suspecting they're an asshole, and seeing an inhuman tentacular horror in his place.!<

  If I was rewriting this story as a more-rational one, I would have made the protagonist more self-aware, driven by revenge but not altogether *possessed* by it — and, in keeping with the rule of "If you give Frodo a lightsaber, give Sauron a Death Star", I would have made the aliens *actually alien* — barely comprehensible starfishes akin to [Watts' Scramblers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel\)). That would have been fun.

  Original story from the perspective of an AI who used to be human. Aliens destroyed Earth, and the AI is the only 'living' human left, and goes after the aliens in revenge. The original post contains an ePub for easier reading.
