## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  Does anyone have any stories that focus on, or at least heavily emphasize, the collision between two distinct magic systems? They can be fanfic, as I imagine the easiest source of these type of stories would be crossovers.

  As an example of what I'm looking for, [Harry Potter and the Nat 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20) is a HP / D&D 3.5 crossover that really lets both of the settings shine, while showing just how confusing each one is to people from the other.

  [Making Magick](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7667766/1/Making-Magick) is a FoZ / Magicka crossover that wonderfully highlights just how absurd the Magicka setting is, and somehow manages to make FoZ palatable.

  [The Essence of Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34710/the-essence-of-cultivation) is an original fiction where a more traditional wizard gets teleporter-accidented into a xianxia cultivation setting. 

  I'm also open to culture clashes that aren't explicitly magical, such as [Psi Effect's](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psi-effect-me-xcom-thread-2-rise-of-the-party-boat.307972/) collision between XCOM psionics and the wider Mass Effect setting.

Worms metaphysics is somehow compatible with DnD physics. Impressive story and in-depth exploration.


    [A Young Woman's Marvelous Adventure \(Youjo Senki/MCU\)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-marvelous-adventure-youjo-senki-mcu.944975/): MCU magic and Science seen through the lenses of Youjo Senki's industrialized magic. Tanya is not an academic so don't expect Doors to the Unknown levels of exploration. It's more interested in comedy than anything else.

    [The Dark Shard: Enemy of the Light](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-dark-shard-enemy-of-the-light-young-justice-si-d-d-fic-cross-hellblazer-worm-from-chapter-3-onwards.544252/) and [Argent \(D&D / Young Justice SI\)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/argent-d-d-young-justice-si.909335/). Both DnD/young justice crossovers. Neither has the same quality of writing as the two above but has some exploration of how DC magic works from a DnD perspective.

    [Thaumaturgic Awakening](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11820074/23/Thaumaturgic-Awakening): Worm crossover with fate. Good writing and plot though It chages a bit about how Worm Entities work to make it compatable with Fate.

    [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/) is a crossover of the [Dungeon Keeper](https://www.gog.com/en/game/dungeon_keeper) 1997 videogame and Sailor Moon. No overt knowledge of either is required, though is ofc helpful (did you know, the canon final boss for the Sailor Moon manga series is the entropic heat death of the universe? The manga author was a chemist, iirc).

    Anyway, as title suggests, it is Sailor Mercury (Ami) who is transported to the Dungeon Keeper world and its magical system; what makes it special is that she's the "nerdy" of one of the original sailors, and tries to understand and break its magical rules and system. Admittedly the story is more about her trying to break the other magical system with her own than the clash of the two, but still. Story has some rough spots, but also some bits that are absolutely glorious; Ami isn't a rationalist, but a fair bit closer to one than many standard protagonists. It's been around a while, discussed here before ([comment by EY on it here](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c0ovem/dungeon_keeper_ami_ch_moving_in)), some like it, some don't. Worth a shot for sure, at least.

    [Postnuptial Disagreements](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements) (**Sekirei x Fate/Stay**). \[**Complete**\]. {**Medium**}. The story is primarily about the culture clash between the contestants of one setting's magical death game, and a hapless magician from another setting, trained for an entirely separate death game.The writing is very solid, values and magic are contrasted and collide in interesting ways. I'd encourage having an awareness of both settings/source material but that isn't absolutely necessary.

    [Maybe I'm a Lion](https://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29) (**Tsukihime x Prototype**). \[**Abandoned**\]. {**Very Long**}. One of my top 10 fanfics. Grimdark magic meets superpowered bioweapons. A long and contemplative crossover with excellent integration, great writing and wonderful hype buildup. A basic understanding of both settings is strongly recommended.

    [Man off the Moon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904733/1/Man-off-the-Moon) (**Mass Effect x Fate/Stay**). \[**Hiatus**\]. {**Very Very Long**}. [Quoting Myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/uqwmzg/comment/i926ayp/):

    >Shirou ends up in the Mass Effect universe and lands himself in Space Boot Campâ„¢ with a young Shepherd. A great look into how our favorite Magus would fare in a world of biotics and futuristic tech. A **V**ery **L**ong **R**ead with surprisingly consistent quality.

    [In the Shadow of Gods](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1099236/chapters/2211681) (**Mass Effect x Halo**). \[**Abandoned**\]. {**Short**}. Shepherd and The Gang come across Master Chief. Debated adding because this only barely counts as magic crossover (thanks to Biotics). Added anyways because it's high tension first contact done right, and first contact is all about culture clash.

    > collision between two distinct magic systems

    [Aspects](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au-dead.724264/) is a four-way crossover between Worm, Pact, Twig, and Harry Potter. All four protagonists from post-canon are sent back in time to Harry's first school year. There's quite a big side thread of the Abyss from Pact starting to encroach upon Hogwarts. Abandoned.

    By the same author, there's [Peer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/peer-twig-parahumans-otherverse.887263/). It's a *five-way crossover*, where the protagonists of Worm, Pact, Twig, Ward, and Pale all can astrally project into each other's worlds. Its greatest strenght is the many strong characters, however that's also its biggest weakness, because the story moves rather slowly.

    Also from the same author comes [Familiar](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/familiar-pact-worm.629776/), where Taylor dies during the interrogation arc and finds herself in the Abyss from Pact. Molly Walker, the first Thorburn heir, summons her from the Abyss. This one moves a lot faster and focuses about the interactions between Shards and Pactverse magic more.

    [Life Ore Death](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/life-ore-death-young-justice-crossover.489535/) *eventually* gets to the magic system, but it has non-magical culture clashes as its central theme.  It focuses on Renka (an OC [feruchemist](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Feruchemy) from slightly-post-canon Mistborn), who is dropped into the Young Justice DC-verse and joins the team.  

    There's a fair bit of blue-and-orange morality at play, and one offshoot from that is how she treats magic: The world she left has gained a rigorous (if incomplete) understanding of their magic over the past thousand+ years.  As a result, most things are a) known, and b) systematized.  This contrasts with the superpowers, magic, and clarketech in the DC verse that are: a) usually newly discovered, and b) follow distinct rulesets.  This leads to *completely logical and consistent* things her like believing that nanobots are magic and coding a computer virus for them is a type of spellcraft, and that androids are just people with unusual (but not morally relevant) non-biology.

  I've quite enjoyed reading *[To the Stars](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984)* and its associated fanfiction, and my favorite parts were the relationships between powered and unpowered characters. (*[The One-Hundredth Floor](https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424293?view_full_work=true)* depicting magical girls deciding to work with humanity did this the best.)

  What are some works about the relationship between people with powers and the general public? Whether it's about "first contact" or how people with and without powers work for/with each other. (If this results in something like an "interclass friendship", even better")

        Like you, I've stopped keeping up with the community, but based on what you've listed I'd recommend:

        * [The Need to Become Stronger](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12213213/1/The-Need-to-Become-Stronger) (My favorite rational Naruto fic alongside the already recommended "The Waves Arisen")
        * [Vainglory](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8641542/1/Vainglory) (My favorite depiction of Minato)
        * [Devil's Advocate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8864982/1/Devil-s-Advocate) (Scratches the same itch as Scorpion's Disciple)
        * [Ghost](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8116183/1/Ghost) (I found it much more enjoyable than Life in Konoha's Anbu)
        * [The Ghost and The Darkness](https://fanfiction.net/s/3883902/1/The-Ghost-and-the-Darkness) (Very disturbing, has stuck with me)
        * [Kaleidoscope](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12539731/1/Kaleidoscope) (Specifically Vol. 1, the rest is nice but imo Vol 1 is excellent)
        * [Welcome to Tomorrow](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11486407/1/Welcome-To-Tomorrow) (Gratuitous self insert done well. Not crack.)
        * [Kill Your Heroes](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11418526/1/Kill-Your-Heroes) (I vaguely remember reading this because of Loyalty and enjoying the approach both took)

        As for top ten lists, It's been too long for me to remember what the best aggregations/listings were. My personal top ten list would contain some of the above, sanitize, team 8/team anko, plus:

        * [108 Earthly Temptations](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12572149/1/108-Earthly-Temptations) (pre-Konoha SI, interesting "alt-history")
        * [Marked for Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/) (Story-only thread of a hidden village Quest)
        * [The Empty Cage](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305950/1/The-Empty-Cage) (Malicious Kurama in control, pretty old)
        * [The Bloody Oracle of Kiri](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13788408/) (Kiri SI)
        * [Troublesome Timing](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9756373/1/Troublesome-Timing) (Peggy Sue Shikamaru as an Uchiha)
        * [Chiarascuro](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11267384/1/Chiaroscuro) (Motivated Shikamaru)

  I'm looking for Harry Potter fanfics with a lot of worldbuilding.

  Canon Harry has a lamentable lack of curiosity about the world around him.  He sees a mirror that shows your deepest desire, but doesn't think to wonder how such a thing might be created or what else might be out there. He sees a ship from continental Europe appear from the depths of a lake in Scotland, which implies things about methods of long-distance magical transportation, but just writes it off as some more weird magic stuff. He sees a flaming goblet that can compel people to obey arbitrarily complicated rules when their names are put into it, and doesn't even notice how terrifyingly game-breaking it is. This is very normal of him -- most people here in the muggle world act the same way -- but I'd like to see some stories that show the broader world, beyond the bare minimum that Harry has to learn about as part of the Hogwarts curriculum. Any recommendations?

    It doesn't do the "trillions of people and realms" thing, but the world is big and large regions are currently unexplored.

    The protagonist is smart, unfortunately not in the "the reader can solve the problems along with the protagonist" kind of way.  Still, it's nice to have a story where the challenges are generally solved by doing more than Punching Very Hard.

Main points of difference are that FMoC goes for a smart/witty MC rather than the typical beat-em-up OP protag (though a lot of that still happens) and a lot more focus on setting (and some politics) than power levels.

        If you ever want any more xianxia recs, or if this isn't what you're looking for, let me know because I've read a bunch.

  I'm on chapter 27 of TUTBAD now and now I'm not sure if I want to keep on reading. My desire to do so depends on a few things: is it worthwhile? Is there gonna be more or less plot? How much will the slice of life portion take up - I know it's billed as such, but will the balance stay the same? Will dungeoneering fade into the background? Does the party unveil new secrets about the inner workings of the world?

  To give you some ideas of my inclinations: Loved WOTC up until the last quarter. Horrible, horrible ending. Mother of Learning was very enjoyable 'fast food' with a nice plot, comfy setup and worldbuilding - bad writing, though. 
  HPMOR was pretty good but badly needs an editor and less moralizing propaganda.

    > is it worthwhile?

    I'm still enjoying it, but I read it update to update from the start. Never had 100 chapters of backlog. I recommend pacing yourself.

    >Is there gonna be more or less plot?

    Chapter 27 is when the conflict with >!Lola!< starts, actually.

    >How much will the slice of life portion take up - I know it's billed as such, but will the balance stay the same?

    It fluctuates. Generally speaking, the story never fails to set up motivation for the characters, but it's mostly about how they live and not about them reaching some particular goal or dealing with a particular problem, except when something like that forces itself into their lives.

    >Will dungeoneering fade into the background?

    At 119 chapters, they're still doing dungeons periodically.

    >Does the party unveil new secrets about the inner workings of the world?

    Sort of.

    Dungeoneering arguably fades pretty hard. And when it exists it is heavily anchored in the situation during the slice of life parts. Trying to answer but not spoil. Also lots of relationship drama. I'm probably gonna drop it soon.

  Any decent 40k inspired stories? I particularly like the far future setting with tech but without the knowledge to build and maintain it. Where priests pray and light incense to tanks..

  I've been reading some books from there, where the MC is an inquisitor and it's fun as a detective story with an interesting setting, but it doesn't really scratch the itch I have for it. I want a techpriest perspective.

  Looking for animal/monster fiction. I've already read Shade Touched, Everybody Loves Large Chests, Kitty Cat Kill Sat, The Patchwork Realms, and Threadbare.

  I'm specifically interested in stories where the MC is an animal or monster, and MAINTAINS a fitting mindset throughout the story- or at least throughout most of it. It's a big gripe of mine when the MC just raises their intelligence or whatever, and immediately becomes basically a human in a weird body. (Of the stories mentioned above, the only ones I really *liked* were Threadbare and ELLC...)

  Mind you, they don't need to be *totally* feral or inhuman. Warrior Cats is a good example of the bare minimum. The characters in that act basically like humans, but they can't use tools, and have such a different culture, that it at least kind of scratches this itch for me.

  Speaking of, if anyone has any rational Warriors fanfiction, other than "your stare was holdin'", I'd appreciate that as well.

    I'd recommend [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion), which is about a bioweapon with a system in a world of capes. I think it strikes a good balance between blending in and remaining ruthless.

    [The Iron Teeth](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale) is a little more borderline (from memory) recommending anyways because it might be to your taste.

    Short story from the perspective of the alien from [The Thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(1982_film\)). You may enjoy it more if you've watched the movie but, I went in blind and had fun piecing together what the fuck was going on.

    - [MECHROMANCER](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52923)

    Robots from another planet make contact with LitRPG medieval society and get absolutely wreaked. One gets resurrected by a necromancer as a minion and shenanigans ensue. 

    Not much to say about this one: serviceable writing, and the MC works well as a non-human lead.

    ---

    - [Outlands](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/12557/)

    Read the first book when it was being updated. The writing style worked well along with the MC and the dark world the author created. Been a long time but, I recall my impressions being that I enjoyed it, even though I found it to be a bit of a slog to get through at times, along with it having some deus ex machina going on.

    Highly de-rec _Salvos_ as a monster story. MC reads like a weird, quirky human and has a human form to boot, in which she spends the majority of the time.

    Have you read [War Queen](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46850/war-queen)? It's told from the perspective of an alien race of insectoids. I recommend skipping the prologue; it takes place chronologically between chapters 23 and 24, and in my opinion it should be read once you get there because it completely shatters the tone that the start otherwise creates so well.

      I won't read MelasD ever since they banned everyone who gave constructive critique from commenting on their stories on Royal Road.  I'm not talking trolling, I mean stuff like 'hey this was a plot hole and this was a spelling error'.  (This includes me by the way; I was banned for letting them know their MC shouldn't have items she left elsewhere a few chapters back.)

        Hey, I'm MelasD, I can't say I recall me ever banning anyone from commenting for telling me about a spelling error or about my protagonist leaving loot behind, but perhaps I'm misremembering.

        However, coincidentally, like six hours ago, I unbanned every commenter I ever banned or blocked and [removed all commenting restrictions](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37438/salvos-a-monster-evolution-litrpg/chapter/947959/not-a-chapter-deleting-commenting-rules-quick).

    The One Who Eats Monsters is not a web serial, but I think it might be available via KU, not sure.
