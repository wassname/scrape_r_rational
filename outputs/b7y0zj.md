  The stand against the Dead King is really showing another side to Procer. I'd love to see another chapter from the First Prince's viewpoint to see how the defense is going from a larger perspective.

  I'm also wondering if there is a diplomatic solution here where Cat agrees to confront Kairos with a coalition force in exchange for free passage out of Procer with Black's soul. This would free up Proceran forces to confront their true enemy without worrying about their heartland.

  It would also set up a potential alliance or peace in the post-war period between Callow and Procer.

  I could also see the Procerans fail to make peace, leading to the fracturing of the Principalities and great loss of life to the Dead.

    Some of the top quotes above the chapters from Cat's officers suggest that this probably won't happen.

  Did anyone comment on how lately Cat seems to be following all the hero tropes?

  Biggest one was: 
  Things are looking really bad for the army of callow, they're minutes away from their doom when suddenly a vanished hero comes in out of no where and saves the day. (Cat even mentioned this trope as then reason why she didn't try to trap heroes inside her portals)

  I was expecting a April 1 joke all the way through. Turns out it's just badassery and feel all around.
