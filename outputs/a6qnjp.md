  Fun, clear, and educational. Just the way I like it!

  i wonder how this can be extended to non-binary interactions.  like, multiple possible options that lead to different levels of reward for both people.
  ```

    ```
    You can go even further, and allow each person to have infinitely many options. This is called a continuous game. This kind of thing is very important in the field of Industrial Organization, which studies the interactions between powerful firms.

      know if there's some kinda video series on that?  i might go try n watch that over winter break

  I send this to everyone who wants to know me better. This, along with papers like "War, Space, and the Evolution of Old World Complex Societies" are how I view the world's interactions. Mixed with some Slatestarcodex stuff, a lot of things begin to make sense.

    /u/Marthinwurer: I send links to my friends of things that I'm interested in, which happen to be educational but also interactive and entertaining.

    Reddit: What a jerk. Downvote.

      I show affection by sending people links to stuff that I think *they'd* be interested in. So if they're a math person and I find a good math thing, sent. If they're a meme person and I find an extraordinary meme, sent. If they're a cybersecurity person and I find a decent cybersecurity blog, sent. You get the idea - I may not be enthusiastic about music theory or geography or photography, but I have friends who are. 

      In reciprocation, I've had stuff sent to me that other people thought I'd be interested in. But in order for that to happen, they first need to know what kind of stuff I'm interested in. This comes up in conversations naturally sometimes, but at other times I just bring it up abruptly to spontaneously start or change the subject of a discussion when it's getting a little dull. For example, I might share a quote from something I recently read, along with a reference in case it piqued their interest enough to warrant a deeper look:

      >One reason people may share stories, news, and information
      is because they contain useful information. Coupons or
      articles about good restaurants help people save money and
      eat better. Consumers may share such practically useful
      content for altruistic reasons (e.g., to help others) or for self enhancement
      purposes (e.g., to appear knowledgeable, see
      Wojnicki and Godes 2008). Practically useful content also has
      social exchange value (Homans 1958), and people may share
      it to generate reciprocity (Fehr, Kirchsteiger, and Riedl 1998).

      If he'd written it like that, I'd have agreed with ya 100%. But he didn't and it reads like a humble brag with the subtlety of an elephant sneaking on a tightrope.

      Hopefully he puts some more points into charisma like you did for the next time ;)

  - u/MarkArrows:
    ```
    I too give people assigned reading material when they want to be friends with me, and of course a written multiple choice examination + 5 page essay to be completed with a minimum grade of B or higher for qualification.
    ```

      ```
      Maybe they send it to already good friends who want to get to know each other this seems needlessly antagonistic
      ```

    - u/Zephyr1011:
      ```
      This seems unnecessarily aggressive. I can see scenarios where what /u/Marthinwurer said is a totally reasonable thing to do. Obviously, telling somebody "before you can be my friend you need to read this" is being a dick. But if, eg, somebody expresses interest in how you think and your life philosophy, and wants to learn more about you, it seems perfectly reasonable to give an actual answer? I can definitely think of friends where I'd be interested in this kind of thing from them (and at least 2 who've done something vaguely like that, in a way that felt perfectly socially appropriate)

      ```
      Don't forget the big 5 personality and IQ tests. Very important that I don't end up friends with someone with a /low/ conscientiousness score...
      ```

    - u/zombieking26:
      ```
      A "B" or higher?


      I only allowed "A" or higher tp be my friends
      ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Not to be a jerk, but how many people did you send these links to; and among them, how many got back to you?

    Personally, I find it awkward to break a conversation with "read this 20min article and get back to me", and I don't think it's ever lead to me having more interesting conversations with someone afterwards.

    I think people just aren't interested in long articles they didn't find themselves.

  ```
  Oh, I didn't know Ncase had a website. I've seen some of their earliest work on Newgrounds years back, and was intrigued by the direction they were going in. Glad that they're still around.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Every game on that site is awesome
