  Man, you'd have to be pretty dumb to seek salvation in this world by getting on a craft named after a pagan sun god and the number thirteen.

  ```
  For the dumb people like me who need it pointed out: Compare "Watergate scandal" and "Outer Gate scandal"
  ```

    And we were just saw the meaning of water discussed in the previous chapter... still figuring out possible meanings of the change...

      A firmament that separates the waters above from the waters below.

  >John Young, commander. 
  >Kenneth Mattingly, pilot. 
  >Fred Haise, lunar module pilot.

  So,apparently in this world, Mattingly didn't get sick and replaced by his backup, but Lovell did. I wonder what the kabbalistic implication of that is.
  ```

  - u/Evan_Th:
    ```
    Lovell was on the Apollo 8 mission which crashed into the celestial sphere and never returned to Earth.  He's dead.
    ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    Position|Reality|UNSONG
    :--|:--|:--
    Commander|Jim Lovell|John Young
    Command Module Pilot|Jack Swigert|Kenneth Mattingly
    Lunar Module Pilot|Fred Haise|Fred Haise

    It may be that the name "Young" is significant, or that somebody whose surname starts with "love" wasn't on UNSONG's Apollo 13. Maybe Lovell gave away all his possessions and Charlie Duke never contracted Rubella from one of his kids, or something like that.

    I can't come up with any Kabbalistic explanation for favouring Mattingly over Swigert. Apparently Mattingly comes from Mattingley, which means "woodland clearing of the family or followers of a man called Matta". May be transformed UNSONG-wise into followers of Matthew, I guess.

    Matting is also the process, and material used in the process, of forming mats. I, uh, don't have any real ideas there either.

    It may be explained in a future interlude, one of those things (like "KNEEL" = "Neil") where a clever bit of lateral thinking can reveal the answer ahead of time. It's highly unlikely that I'll ever be that thinker.

      ```
      John Young+Kenneth Mattingly+Fred Haise+Richard Nixon is the only possible combination of crew members that includes Richard Nixon where the syllables in their names add up to the number 13.

      Edit: removed some unnecessary qualifiers.

      Edit 2: Kenneth is actually his middle name. His real name is Thomas Mattingly. Doesn't change the syllable math, but it does mean there's someone on the flight who was faking something. A kabbalist would at least point out this, even if it would be trivial, so I have as well.
      ```

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  Of the three Names given to Ana: 

  >The second the Airwalker Name, which granted the power to tread on air as if it were solid ground. And the third the Mistral Name, which according to the document’s somewhat ominous description “called the winds”.

  If you got two people bound together, one to use the Airwalker name and the other to use the Mistral name, could they together stand on air forced upwards by the Mistral name to ultimately reach a sufficient height to rise to the Celestial Spheres and the putative location of Heaven? 

  Riding a moving cloud would fit nicely with the Dragon Ball theme established in recent chapters with the collection of 7 dragon-themed items (plus of course Journey To The West), and finally of course we have Revelations 1:7 

  >"Look, he is coming with the clouds," and "every eye will see him, even those who pierced him"; and all peoples on earth "will mourn because of him." So shall it be! Amen. 

  Everyone mourning because of Aaron (who we are informed will end the world in the beginning of Unsong) does not seem unlikely.

  Typo thread:

  > I believe that just **as** there is a gate to Hell inside the Earth, so the edge of space may be an outer gate which leads to Heaven.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    "as" works there.  It's grammatically correct.  "Like" is also correct, and more colloquial, but afaik there's nothing wrong with **as.**
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      You and /u/redstonerodent are using different conventions for describing typos. Currently, the chapter contains this sentence:

      >I believe that just there is a gate to Hell inside the Earth, so the edge of space may be an outer gate which leads to Heaven.

      when it should be this:

      >I believe that just as there is a gate to Hell inside the Earth, so the edge of space may be an outer gate which leads to Heaven.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        TK17: Jumps back from the Island of Conclusions.  Thanks.
        ```

        - u/PeridexisErrant:
          ```
          "Phantom Tollbooth" is 17 characters, and TK17 has the number 17.  The Apollo 17 carried rocks back from the moon.  "Rocks in your head" is an insult to someone's intelligence or stubbornness.  I can't be bothered writing 17 sentences of kabbalah.

          Not a coincidence, etc.

  Can't say I blame Nixon for trying...

  This is definitely making me want to read more. This is a really odd situation to read. Invading heaven and hell sounds fun.

  >Outer Gate scandal

  HAHAHA! That caught me off guard.
  ```

  - u/Arancaytar:
    ```
    There was a brief foreshadowing of it in the War and Peace interlude:

    > Thus the saying that sprang up in the wake of the trip: “Only Nixon can go to Hell.”

    > (later, after the Outer Gate scandal, the word “only” was removed from the saying.)
