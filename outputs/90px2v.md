## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Setting: Earth ~10000 BC. Pre agricultural society. River valley. Magic suddenly has started to permeate the world with mostly relatively small effects.

  Power to be munchkined/reverse munchkined: One man reincarnates through his direct descendants. He maintains memories and skills. His personality is half determined by who he reincarnates into, and half determined by all past personalities. He can only have male descendants.

    The first couple reincarnations would probably catch me by surprise.

    By the 3rd or 4th round, I expect that I'd have enough experience to be notable within my tribe.

    The next step would be creating some tradition or ritual to make it easier for me to transition back into power when I reincarnated. 

    I might carve some 'totems' that let the chosen bearer talk to the spirits.  

    When I start getting uncomfortably old, I'd go into the woods and hide a totem.  Then, call my family and allies over, explain that the spirits say its close to my time, and ask them for a secret of some kind so they'll know that my successor is legitimate.

    Then, arrange a suitably impressive ritual death.  Reincarnate.  Then new body can claim to "have visions" from the ancestors.

    Being able to immediately find the totems & know secrets from the old chief should be enough to retake my old office.

    And, at that point, my tribe is being lead by a wise, eternal king who provably has the backing of the heavens.

    Memory exercises are key. Your greatest advantage is in knowing things from thousands of years ago, but you will eventually run out of memory space or parsing your memories will become untenable. Therefore, finding some system which allows you to either manually reconstruct your memories with a mathematical file storage mechanism of some kind, or more likely developing a cult of scribes which dutifully copy your memories into scrolls, keeping them hidden and updated to prevent rot, will be necessary. The cult of scribes is probably the best bet, along with you keeping a daily journal. Every week or so, you send them your journal and they copy it and take the copies into multiple secure locations, with only you knowing where all of them are. Scribes at those locations would keep copying the journals as they aged to prevent them from falling apart. As budget allows, you should also keep spreading new locations around the globe, making sure that every location keeps multiple copies of everything to ensure new locations can be filled immediately.

    Your limitless lifespan means you will probably be the most powerful person in the world, so keeping up a steady line of descendents should be easy. You probably want to have at least ten descendents born at twenty-ish year intervals, but not much more than that. Too many, and you risk getting lost when you reincarnate into a bunch of random old people. You also need to avoid having your direct descendents comprise a significant fraction of the world's population, as getting reincarnated too far from your centers of power could get you lost as well. You will need to keep some means of killing yourself on hand at all times as a means of evading capture. Ideally, you can make it so all of your descendents also keep a suicide button around so they can kill themselves as new descendents are born. Keeping exactly ten descendents, spread over a large area, who are forbidden from reproducing and are bound to kill themselves upon orders from you in return for a lavish lifestyle should prevent the Genghis Khan problem.

    If you get really good at this, you could become a sort of djinni-like figure in the world's mythos; capable of granting any boon in return for useful secrets. You would become a sort of equalizing force for the other powers in the world, as anyone who gets angry enough could simply sell their secrets to you in return for the obliteration of their foes.

    This isn't very well specified. Does reincarnation work via cousin relationships? E.g he has two children, A&B, reincarnates into B, who has child C, who he reincarnates into. Can he then reincarnate back into A's descendants, if C has no children?
    ```

      If you are a descendant of the original, you are a candidate for reincarnation. I have the story starting out that he can only descend into his oldest relative. Later I think I'll give him the ability to descend into younger ones, but doing so will lock him out of any older descendants he bypassed.

        I would say that he needs a warrior-cult of descendants, with a strict rule that if you become more than 10% permanently injured or too old, they will be killed by their fellows. This prevents him from reincarnating into an incapable body- if he just let himself reincarnate into the oldest, after about 80 years he'd spend a lot of time moving from old man to old man.

  You have been abducted by an alien race. You have no way of communicating with them, no way to inform the outside world, and no way you can see to escape. The aliens appear to be a highly advanced spacefaring civilization, and during your captivity, you realize that 1) they frequently capture living creatures from various worlds and keep them as pets and 2) they do not realize you are sapient. You are kept in an enclosure with food, water, and various things to amuse yourself with, much like the sorts of toys we give to rodents we keep as pets. The aliens observe you every day, but their interest in you will peter off as you become less novel to them. From what you have observed of their vessels, the aliens appear to be intelligent and benevolent.  How do you convince the aliens you are a sapient being that does not mean them harm?

    Taking another animal as a pet would be a decent bet.
    If they didn't determine humans were intelligent from all the industry, radio communication, billboards, signs, etc. when they abducted you from Earth they probably won't find anything you write or say sufficient proof of intelligence. So demonstrating that you understand the concept of captivity and practice domestication of animals is a good bet as it's a behavior you recognized in them, so they'll probably recognise it in you as well. If they are benevolent they won't want to hold a species that understands capitvity captive. 

    Otherwise it would be best to observe the aliens when the observe you. Try to identify how they communicate and mimic that behavior as that gives you the best chance of them noticing your attempts.

    Writing would be an obvious way. Even if the meaning isn't clear, the likelihood of a pattern of repeating symbols being intelligent communication is fairly high. To keep things simple for them, it would be better to write in all-caps so there's only 26 letters plus a few punctuation symbols.

    Tracking time would be another way. If there's any manner of day/night cycle, making a single mark for each day would indicate that you are likely capable of counting and potentially other forms of math.

      > If I'm alone, I converse at the aliens and attempt to communicate by writing and reshaping whatever they give me. If I'm with other humans, I converse with my fellow captives as well. Being conversant seems like a sapient behavior, as does creative work. If with others, I try to coordinate our actions--cooperation is sapient.

      I've seen monkeys look conversant and coordinate their actions in what appears to be an intelligent manner.

    In an episode of Stargate Universe, this happened, and the humans built a fire which prompted the aliens to let them go, recognising their sapience. 

    I'd probably do something with prime numbers, fibonacci with my food or with my toys. I'd try to give everything in my enclosure consistent names and name the aliens if I can tell them apart: human biologists are very interested that prairie voles seem to have consistent alarm calls for eagles vs snakes vs people, and that crows can recognise individual humans. 

    There's a chance they can't hear the wavelengths I communicate on, so I'll try and also assign people "names" with the objects in my enclosure or foods I'm given. So the guy with the blue tentacles I might always put my ball near, and the guy with the orange tentacles I might always put a weird green alien carrot near. Maybe instead invent a hand sign language for the same, since they can probably see my body somehow.

    Another thing: try and categorise the things they give me. Arrange my food by colour/shape/size assuming it's not just a mush of oatmeal.

    This was a plot of a sci-fi short story I read once; a group of human spacefarers crash-lands on some planet in a way that leaves their landing ship unretrievable, manages to survive (living off the local land whose biochemistry is fortunately compatible) but doesn't have any more-than-primitive tech, and then get picked up by an alien ship (which has never met humanity before and is looking for exotic zoo animals).

    The dilemma facing the crew, then, is exactly as you describe.

    They try writing numbers in the ground with a stick. The aliens introduce grubs to the soil that can be dug for.

    They try to indicate their intelligence by making something fairly complex (given the materials at hand, they elect to weave baskets). The aliens assume that this is some sort of nest-building behaviour to attract a mate and remove the wall separating the male and female humans.

    Eventually, in that particular story at least, they succeed by trapping a little shrew-like creature in one of the baskets and feeding it grubs - because the aliens agree that only intelligent life keeps pets.

    Without a doubt, I would do whatever I could to write (up to and including drawing my own blood), and I'd use math. I'd use a simple system of tally marks or dots as my numbers, and by slowly defining symbols for different mathematical concepts (starting with counting, moving on to addition, subtraction, etc), I would begin to display more and more advanced mathematical knowledge until I can define the Pythagorean Theorem or a similarly complex idea.

  Assuming that you had an implacable urge to cause the maximum possible amount of deaths, and your time preference function was a step-function- continously 1 before stepping down to zero at time X- and you were entirely prevented making any plans, that stretched further than than X, or considering any events after X, even though you intellectually know you may still be alive after time X

  What would you do to fulfill your urges if X was (Example approach)

  * 1 second (Just attack, walking randomly- though you cannot even open doors)
  * 1 minute (Walking towards enemies you hear, attacking directly. If you're captured, you have no patience to pick locks, etc)
  * 1 hour (Attacking via ambush, perhaps stealing weapons if you can see them)
  * 1 day (Stealing weapons capable of killing more effectively)
  * 1 week (Poisoning food supplies)
  * 1 month (Gathering gangs of thugs)
  * 1 year (Joining armies)
  * 10 years (Formenting wars)

  (Yes, this is for a story with AI-analogue demons)
  ```

  - u/hh26:
    ```
    Note that if X is sufficiently large, like thousands or millions of years, some interesting effects can happen, depeninding on specifics.  If you are a human (or demon with a finite lifespan), and X is significantly larger than your own life (I want to maximize the number of deaths that I think will happen after X even if I'm not around to see it), then you actually want to maximize the prosperity of the human race, in so far as that increases birthrates and thus people dying of old age later on.  You would look sort of like a benevolent force, and could actually play yourself off as one in order to avoid resistence, but you might need to surpress things like a cure for aging if technology gets too advanced, so it's not quite benevolent.

    If you can get powerful enough to take over everything, you would want to capture all of the humans and use them as breeding stock so that you could slaughter the children repeatedly (depending on what you consider to be a live human in your death count, abortions might be faster and more efficient).  Actually, even smaller timeframes like 50 years might suggest this, depending on what kind of world you live in and how much control you get.  If you can conquer nations or the whole world and have enough control to slaughter them at will, you might as well breed them for as long as you can and then slaughter them all right before the time limit ends.

      Yeah, I suspect that this is the sort of edge case that would be very attractive to an AI with the right definitions in place. It might just put all its resources into human cloning. The cloning doesn't even have to be all that good if you only need the embryos to live long enough to be incinerated to add to your score.

      Heat death of the universe means that immortality is not that bad. Just opportunity cost really. 

      Depends on your X

    The longer away X is, the more you'd want to expand human population. If x for instance was a thousand years, killing everyone tomorrow is not going to cause the most deaths. A thousand years ago, human population was estimated at 250-350mil. Now it is at around 7,500mil. If the population increase can be maintained by the AI-analogue demons, the population could be at 150 billion at the end of the thousand years. and now imagine that you harvest anyone that is above child bearing age, and most males because you don't need that many, and now you have a proper cattle farm going.

    What you have, is a problem that has already been solved by humans. Instead of simply killing for killings sake, we kill for food. The further along our civilization went, the more efficient our farming became. Instead of hunting everything, we only hunt a few so the population remains. Instead of allowing the population to remain in the wild, we keep them so we get a more consistent source of food. We take more and more care of cattle, so that they can give birth to more young. We add selective breeding, so that the young that are born are stronger and better and can survive better, so we can kill them when we need food. You probably get the point.

    The longer X is, the more you are simply farming. The neat twist you have with AI-analogue demons, is the lack of "ethical human farming" activists, leaving you to boost population to massive levels.
