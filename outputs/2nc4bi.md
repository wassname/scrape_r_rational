## [D] /r/writeresearch (a sub assisting in the creation of more realistic charachters). I think it could turn into something really useful.

  Subbed, and will ~~probably~~ almost definitely make use of it at some point.  I mean, honestly, you can't always just leave fictional characters with your own skillsets.

  Offtopic.  Reddit's voting algorithms really befuddle me sometimes.  A moment ago this was at "11: 88% upvoted".  I upvoted it and reloaded, now it says "14: 100% upvoted"  Assuming that two more upvotes came in at the same time as mine, how do you go from 88% upvoted to 100%?

  (I know, vote fuzzing.  I just wish they'd be consistent about their numbers.)
