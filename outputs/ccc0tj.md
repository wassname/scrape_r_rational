## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I'm almost halfway through Neal Stephenson's newest book Fall; Or, Dodge in Hell. (Marked spoilers are minor to medium.)

  This book is reminding me of how much I enjoy Stephenson's tangents. The main storyline is about >!the main character being virtually simulated after his death!<, but I've been much more interested in the parts of the story about current and future social tech.

  Early on in the book, >!a small town in Ohio gets nuked. Everyone freaks out until it comes out that it didn't actually happen. The town was DDOS'd and the supporting evidence was all faked. It uses that initial event to get into the idea of how it's hard to discern truth and lies on the Internet, and how in the near future it's going to get much harder than it already is.!<

  He offers technical solutions to the above, as well as other related problems like privacy and Internet dogpiling. I don't necessarily think that some of them would actually work (if I can prove that this women wrote this code, the people calling her a fake will surely leave her alone). I think he does understand that though, there are sections on extreme conspiracy theorists and how no amount of evidence will change their minds.  

  But regardless of how effective his proposed tech would actually be, I still like reading about it, and I'm hoping it continues to show up in the story. I'm not sure if any of this will end up being relevant to the main plot or not, but I'm liking the book as a whole either way.

    I'm only about a sixth of the way through.  It's fun, and I'm cautiously optimistic that he's got the magic back after the disappointment I felt with DODO and the last third of Seveneves.  And yes, much of the fun in Stephenson is in the bizarre, insightful, are-you-shitting-me tangents.

      ehhh... i play podcasts on 2.5x speed and i admit i probably only get 80% of the value out of them, but I get to consume more than twice the content, so really I'm getting ~200% the value per minute. I don't think there's anything wrong with making a quality/quantity trade off in whichever direction you want, and I assume that's what the boasters are doing whether it's conscious or not. 

      I do agree that boasting about reading speeds is weird, though, in light of this. In fact it makes about as much sense as boasting how much you dial up your podcast listening dial, so I should probably scuttle off in shame right now :)

        I feel like 2.5x is a bit much. I used to watch anime and tv show at 2x speed. Even though I could keep up with the pace, I found myself enjoying them much less compared to the ones I watched at normal speed.

          I started on x1.5, have progressed to x2.5, and am experimenting with x3.0. I would not have been able to comprehend anything at 3.0 when I started, but I also know that I'll never comprehend anything at "infinitely fast," so I wonder when I'll hit that wall and what my maximum speed will turn out to be.
          ```

            haha, I don't think I can do 3.0 without subtitles.

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          Yeah I wouldn't do it with TV shows, I think they depend more on pacing. I worked my way up to 2.5x over years and some I listen to much slower!

          > I'm easing myself back into it with one a day, but after I finish this, like, I guess this course then I'm going to start watching 3 videos a day, one each from three different courses, sort of like school.

          This is a good idea and I'm going to do it soon-ish, as soon as this next semester (final semester, at least before phd work, if those applications get accepted) is finished.

      > Reading should be done mindfully, every word heard in the mind's ear, and skimming only employed with text that describes a subject you're already familiar with.

      That's not really true though - human language was developed for use while speaking, which is a lossy medium. Most colloquial speech is quite redundant. For instance, only the first sentence of this paragraph was necessary; the rest of it only exists to provide for a smoother segue into the next point. 

      If you're not reading something particularly dense with meaning (like, say, the majority of fanfic, which is what the people in /r/fanfiction are probably reading), you're fine only reading every other word.

  The strange nonhumans lower their longbows. One of them walks forward to greet the broomstick riders where it appears they mean to land.

  They land.

  &nbsp;

  "Um!!!" says Minor.

  "Yes, I noticed," says Finis. "If they're nonhuman then it wouldn't make sense for them to be nearly human either, maybe their real shapes are very strange and they're inhabiting ones close to ours for some reason - or maybe there's some kind of time travel involved, or maybe the mysterious spell works by reaching into parallel worlds, or -"

  "It's uncanny. He doesn't look quite real."

  &nbsp;

  "Uh, hi," Minor says to the uncanny him.

  *{You'll have to give me a few minutes for the language,}* Curufin sends, and says aloud in Quenya as well. Finis lights up with delight. *{I am Curufinwë Atarinkë of the Noldor.}*

  "*I am Finis Eleazar Way,*" Finis says immediately in Quenya.

  "*I am Minor Finis Way,*" Minor says. "*Of the -* British." And switching to English - "where are we -"

  "*Where are we?*" Curufin repeats in Quenya. "*This is Lake Mistaringë - Mithrim in the local language - in Beleriand, which our tongue has no word for, not knowing the place until we met its people. I have never heard of the* British."

  &nbsp;

  "*Mistaringë,*" says Finis thoughtfully, "*Mithrim.*" And then he guesses four more Thindarin words off the Quenya ones. He gets three right; Curufin corrects one.

  (Curufin is staring at him a bit fixedly.)

  &nbsp;

  And then, switching to English, "I think we are very far from Britain - and we shouldn't have miscalculated the size of the world so grossly that there were large landmasses we missed - we've circumnavigated it - not us personally, but I follow the march of progress -"

  "Circumnavigated."

  Finis conjures a globe, demonstrates. "Circumnavigate. Circumference. Circumstance, circumvent - from the Latin -"

  "Latin?"

  Finis repeats what has been said so far in Latin.

  &nbsp;

  *{Please do not be too distracted to ask why he's got a sphere for the world,}* Maitimo sends.

  *{I'm getting to it,}* Curufin sends back.

  He's not; he's carefully repeating back the Latin.

  &nbsp;

  "British, Latin - we have Thindarin, Quenya -"

  "Oh, I also speak Swedish and Danish and Italian and French and Greek and Igbo and Mandarin -"

  "We have - not as many -"

  "In the whole world? How far have you explored -"

  "Haven't - circumnavigated - can't circumnavigated, no circum -"

  "Primitive people think that before they learn math."

  "We learn math. Can't circumnavigated, no circum."

  "Can't circumnavigate, it's not round," Minor offers him.

  "It's not round."

  "Can show you with the angles off the sun."

  "By all means."

  &nbsp;

  And a flurry of conversation later - "okay, yours isn't round. And your sun is close and dim -"

  "Not that dim -"

  "Ours is very very far, and very very bright, if it were closer everything would boil and die -"

  "Ours is drawn on a chariot by a Maia."

  "Primitive people think that before they learn math, too."

  "Does your kind of math make you wrong."

  &nbsp;

  "Our world works on math! Yours might not."

  "Our world works on fate."

  Finis and Minor look at each other and make a face.

  "- my father felt that way about it too. He's dead."

  " - is he me," Finis says.

  "Yes. I think so. Yes. Only - moreso -"

  "Well. I don't have resurrection yet."

    "Yellow hair Mama," diagnoses Kat.

    "Hi, Kat," says Rebecca. "This is Catherine."

    "You're me but ugly!" declares Catherine.

    "Well you're me but stupid!" retorts Kat.

    "Let's have a yelling contest!" says Catherine.

    "AAAAAAAAH!" replies Kat.

    "AAAAAAAAH!" exclaims Catherine.

  OK, I'm going to start booking flights for the Weasel European Tour, so who wants to recommend cities in Europe that are good to spend a weekend? 

  I'm not a drinking/night-life person; I'm all about getting good (vegan) food, wandering around on foot, museums, animal sancturaries (not zoos unless they have a heavy conservation focus), that sort of thing. 

  I speak English and my French isn't too bad, and I have "decent for a tourist" Italian. I'm a woman traveling alone so no recommendations that are too dodgy please!

  My wishlist so far: 

  - Amsterdam (i saw pictures of a ridiculous milkshake on /r/vegan the other day so even though i am not a "coffee shop" person, i'm definitely going to go there)
  - Berlin (as promised: the people who live there please reply so we can start talking dates)
  - My hairdresser recommended Prague, how's Prague?
  - I want to go somewhere in Eastern Europe: Slovakia or Moldova or IDK, somewhere like that, searching suggestions
  - Italy: I've heard Pompeii is stunning; I've heard Turin has a lot of vegetarian food. 
  - I want to see the northern lights: I'm here 'til the middle of November. Are they are a reliable "every night" thing or would it be silly to plan a weekend trip to Finland or something because it's not a guarantee?
  ```

    The probability of northern rights grows the further north you go. (Until it doesn't.) Just hopping over in Helsinki is probably not gonna give you anything. You'd have to go all the way to Lapland. There, in November, I think your chances are above flipping a coin + not having cloud cover. And you need to get away from light pollution.

      Thanks so much for looking that up for me... so, basically, it's luck dependent enough that it's better planning to do it as part of a longer trip to the arctic circle. My BFF is Icelandic and we're going to go together one year, so I think I'll plan to see the aurora borealis (at this time of year... at this time of day... in this part of the country... located entirely within your kitchen) on that trip and strike it off the itinerary for this year.
