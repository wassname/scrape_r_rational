  Can't WAIT to see the Callowan Knights in action. Cat mentions them in the same breath as the Watch, and they've been talked up the entire series.
  ```

  ```
  Is it just me or does the intro quotation seem to imply that Juniper outsurvives Cat's Name empowered lifespan.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Not necessarily maybe it's from juniper 's biography of cat
    ```

    - u/Ibbot:
      ```
      Read that as Juniper's biography of *a* cat.  Anyways, it does seem that it's written after Cat's death.
      ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Having just reread it, I think the implication is there.

    And now I can't wait to read about The Battle of the Camps and the Prince's Graveyard.
    ```

  - u/Rheklr:
    ```
    That sounds somewhat fatalistic. While that wouldn't be out of keeping with the series, it's possible Cat simply retires at some (far off) point.
    ```

- u/melmonella:

  Awesome! Ranger is here!

  On a slightly more serious note, how do you think powerlevels compare? Cat has 30k forces, Summer is at 60k-ish. Call it 80-90k effective force due to fey being stronger than mortals, and add 5k to Cat's force due to Watch. Knights are another 3k, doubled for awesomeness for 6k effective. Cat is probably 3-4k in her own right especially if she uses her Naming advantages properly, same with Deadhand. Winter is another 20k (more powerful than mortals, but have inherent we-lose-to-summer-in-direct-battle malus, so I think effective number is the same). Ranger is probably another 10k by herself based on the hype. Robber is god knows where, but probably prepares another trap-call it another 2k in power. If Apprentice and Archer join the field (and they are supposed to be reasonably close, I think), that's another 8k.  87k-ish total lead by a marshal of the legions of terror and a Named with the Junior Calamity bonus vs 90-ish total Summer, lead by two people with blatant reasoning biases, before you account for whatever traps Summer might have.

  To be quite honest, I think Catherine wins this one easy.
  ```

  - u/18scsc:

    I pretty much agree with your assessment. Nauk estimated that the allied armies could beat 30k fae with difficulty. The winter fae drew off 20k. Leaving Cat to deal with 40k summer fae. 

    3k elite heavy calvary mounting a surprise attack on an unguarded flank is a horror to any commander in the other side. In their initial surprise charge I'd bet they could reduce summer's effective cohesive fighting force by as many as 15k. I doubt they'll be able to actually kill more than 6k in the long term, especially as the summer commanders react and account for their presence. Reducing the amount of soldiers summer is capable of using against Cat too 34k, and perhaps 25-30k for a few crucial minutes. 

    That's enough to make this a tossup by Nauk's standards. 

    I'm assuming Ranger's main, and perhaps ONLY role in this battle will be to neutralize the summer princess. Who's an army unto herself. I'm not sure how that'd factor into Nauk's read of the battle, but it's a big deal. 

    Cat and her allied commanders doubtless have a few other cards up their sleeves, and the force of narrative. Pretty much assuring victory.
    ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    There's also the narrative causality at play, since this is Arcadia. Cat's flipped the story from a brave retreat under fire to the Battle of Minas Tirith, where disparate allies join together to beat a previously overwhelming unified force. 

    We've got the besieged defenders. We've got the surprise arrival of a supernatural army of death (Winter/Dunharrow) flooding onto one flank. We've got a force of formerly-exiled cavalry (Callow/Rohirrim) smashing into the other. We'll soon have the equivalent of Legolas swinging under their unbeatable monsters. All we need now is for one of the royals to have an ambiguous prophecy about their invulnerability.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      ...well Cat is destined to fight The White Knight, so she can't die here.
      ```

      - u/GeeJo:
        ```
        Sure, but there are innumerable stories where she would survive, while her forces would not. Even Summers' own plan allowed for that, with the last through the breach fighting a desperate but doomed defence to save their commander. Even without Cat doing anything she'd survive. She'd just lose someone dear to her (say...Adjutant). 

        The point is less that Cat's using narrative to save her own skin, than that she's twisting it to *destroy her enemies*.
        ```

        - u/melmonella:
          ```
          I meant in response to this:

          >All we need now is for one of the royals to have an ambiguous prophecy about their invulnerability.

          Cat sorta *does* have that.
          ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    Well utilised heavy cavalry are definitely worth more than 2x, especially in an open field battle. I'd start with 5x and consider 8-10.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      I really doubt it's that severe. If we were talking against a mortal army, I might have agreed, but this is *fey*. For one, their whole army can just decide to fly up to avoid the charge entirely. That'd still cost them something (otherwise, I don't see why they wouldn't be flying all the time), but it's a possibility. Morale damage is likewise basically nonexistant against them. I think charge will be effective, but not *five times multiplier* effective.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Yeah

    Time to see what ranger is capable in a full out war
    ```

- u/beardedrabbit:
  ```
  Given Cat's third aspect is very closely tied to her ice heart from the Winter King, after she dispatches Summer and fulfills her side of the bargain, what happens when she gets her real heart back? Will that free up her third aspect slot? As badass as Fall is, it has troubling narrative implications, which matter in a very concrete way in this universe.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I actually expect her to change names when or before she comes back to the ice king after beating Akua and summer.
    ```

    - u/beardedrabbit:
      ```
      That wouldn't be too surprising, defeating Summer / Diabolist is pretty climactic in terms of the story. It would be fitting for Cat to transfer to a newer, more powerful Name afterwards (or even during). 

      I don't like the fact that the Winter King has some control over her, so hopefully she's able to void that connection in some way sooner rather than later (and in such a way that she gets a baller powerup!).
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  "Princes' Graveyard" Sounds like a battle against Procer. Battle of the Camps is pretty nebulous. I speculate that this is Afolabi turning on her camp in an attempted Red Wedding minus the wedding.  

  Edit: Fixed apostrophe
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    A victorious battle against Procer at that.
    ```

  - u/Oaden:
    ```
    "Prince's Graveyard" might be the one were they shot the exiled prince in the throat, which would make the battle of the 4 armies and one the 5 sided training game

    For that interpretation the battle of the camps would already have been fought, and i'm not sure which one it would be. Defending marchford or the assault of Liese don't really match.

    Alternatively, the current battle is the battle of 4 armies and one.  But we have Winter, Alfobi's army, Rankers army, Kegan's army, the knights and summer.  That's 6, not 5. Unless we count Kegan, ranker and alfobi's army as one, and there's another ambush upcoming
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      > When historians try to pin down Foundling’s methods they point to the Battle of the Camps or the Princes’ Graveyard, but those came later.  

      It's pretty clear we haven't seen "Princes' Graveyard" yet. Also the placement of the apostrophe is relevant here(which I messed up in transcribing the quote); "Prince's Graveyard" implies a singular prince while "Princes' Graveyard" implies a graveyard belonging to multiple princes.

      > 4 armies and one  

      The definition that I'm following is the four armies are:  
      * Legions of Terror (Alfobi, Cat, and Ranker)  
      * Winter  
      * Summer  
      * "Callowan" (Deoraithe, Knights of the Broken Bell)  

      And the "One" is Ranger in the hills.

      Edit: Alternatively, the Knights are part of the Legions of Terror (that what their official status is anyway) and the Deoraithe are their own Army. I lean towards the previous interpretation myself. However, you're right there is room in the story for another army if you have all armies under Cat's direct chain command(Alfobi, Cat, and Ranker, Knights) or embedded (Deoraithe) as one Army and only have Winter, Summer, and Ranger left. It'll be interesting to see what happens next.

  ```
  Hmm. Now that I think about it, do we know of anything preventing a person with a Villain Name from taking a Heroic Role?
  ```

  - u/everything-narrative:
    ```
    Squire is a neutral name. Were Cat so inclined (i.e. not the kind of girl to give Taylor Hebert pause) she could probably call upon the white light instead of shadow.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I agree, I'm one of the supporters that Cat will transcend into another neutral name or even a hero name but keep kicking both sides ass
      ```

      - u/everything-narrative:
        ```
        Seems to me there's actually grounds for several categories of names: clackling maniac villain (Diabolist, most Dread Emps), neutrally benevolent (Ranger, Archer),  antihero (Lone Star, Thief), hero mcheropants (Whity &co.), and last but most prominent: the pragmacists (Calamities, Cat)
        ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      Wasn't talking about Cat in particular. Calamities have a very heavy resemblance to a Heroic party, for example-can their sucess be explained by them taking up Heroic Roles as Villains?
      ```

      - u/everything-narrative:
        ```
        Very possibly.

        Amadeus and Alaya want for the cycle of violence to end. Wekesa wants nothing more than to further magic. Sabah wants to protect her friends. Ranger wants to become the strongest there is. Eudokia wants(?) to establish a working bureaucracy.

        All in all, a fairly heroic bunch!
        ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      Ranger also appears to be a neutral name.
      ```

  ```
  Is Warlock using his husband to spy on Daoine?
  ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  I love the way that initial quote from Juniper gives away the names of some of Cats coming battles. 

  Something to look forward to.

  > We are going to die, Kegan realized with crystal-clear clarity. We are going to die because whatever the Carrion Lord did to teach this child broke her mind.

  I know this came out a month ago but Jesus Christ this almost made me laugh out loud in a climate change seminar
