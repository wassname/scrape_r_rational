  No Hermione, 0/10

  In all seriousness, it's good to be back in Harry's skull. I'll never fathom why EY thinks it's a good idea to hide the hero's most significant thoughts from the audience; that causes anxiety, not interest.

  Well, it looks like the truth has out afterall.

  Edit: On a related note, [Called Harry being master of the Elder Wand](http://my.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2yd1ye/chapter_harry_potter_and_the_methods_of/cp9carc), but in retrospect that was pretty obviously going to factor in. Hoping he finds the Resurrection Stone and figures out what was up with the Peverell's graves somehow in the next three chapters, but without a timeskip, I'm not hopeful.

    Not really. Only part of the truth and only to a selected few.

      He killed Voldemort. It's not a huge step to assume that Harry killed the rest of the death eaters in much the same fashion. Telling Bones to exorcise the ghost probably confirmed that to her.

        Well, they still think that Monroe is a hero, and this one is not an obvious deduction. And then there's the end of the world prophecies (this one is much more reasonable to keep quiet, I'll grant him that). 

        But really, my main issue is not with the extent of this revelation, but with the coverage. The general populace still has nothing, but fairy tales and fake heroes to worship (but Harry still gets all the material prizes from the victory). Especially objectionable with Hermione, whose true achievement of killing off the Dementors (if she really does that) would be totally overshadowed by Harry's fake.

          What makes this somewhat annoying is that EY quotes P.C. Hodgell in his [Twelve Virtues of Rationality](http://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues):“That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.”

          Granted, Harry isn't perfect and to a large extent the fic is about ideals and reality conflicting, but this seems like a big one.

      I bet the rest will come, to those few. They know they are being partially misled, just not the details.

  Next up: Leadership. Harry Potter figures out that the world not having blown up was due to total incompetence in teaching Muggle Studies. Muggle science is ruthlessly suppressed to keep anyone from transfiguring anything that would end the world or everyone capable of magic is forced to take the "I must not destroy the world" unbreakable vow in a sweep of well meaning totalitarianism.

  Also Harry now has the tool to cripple or even destroy modern capitalism. The gold standard can be made worthless at any given moment. It's still handy to keep around to have access to carrots and sticks, but the end of money is within sight. When you can transfigure anything physical objects no longer can serve as money. Adoption of the reputation economy to follow.

  Death from old age is pretty much over now as a thing for wizards and as has been demonstrated on Hermione, death from anything save for avada kedavra or fiend fyre is now impossible. Death is no longer permanent as long as you have an in-tact brain. The whole needing an in-tact brain thing will probably be solved at some point too.

  Other advancements will rapidly follow as Harry gets his PHD's or their equivalent. This will probably happen rather rapidly as he magically bootstraps himself into godhood. It'll just take some sort of tipping point that will cause him to learn things faster. We'll save that for year two.

  Welcome to the magical singularity.

    No *modern* capitalist economy after 1969 ever even followed any kind of gold standard.  Not if they weren't blatantly on crazy-stupid pills.

    Besides which, any kind of economy based on being able to conjure or copy *all mere commodities* (as Transfiguration is explicitly noted to be able to do: multiplying food and such) is already an economy where marginal cost = marginal labor input, which is *radically* different from recognizable capitalism.

        Possibly.  I bet you drop moons on people who wish for more wishes, too.

    Of course, the use of the Philosopher's Stone for trivial purposes like wiping out the world's economy or flying to Jupiter comes at a price.

    It can be used 369 times per day, which is way below the world death rate. If we disregard Muggles, then given standard fanon estimates of the world population and death rates of wizards, house-elves, centaurs, and goblins, it could *barely* keep up. Adding the families of Muggleborns and half-bloods pushes it over the limit.

    Every use of the Stone of Permanency comes at the opportunity cost of one sentient life. Plan accordingly.

      Well, sort of. 

      It actually should be plenty for wizards, after the first few months.

      Think about it for a minute - it restores you to perfect health and youth. So, even with the risk of violent or accidental death, a single person should not need to go through the process more than once every 30 years at least on average.

      So, if it can be used 369 times a day, it can be used 134,685 times a year. 

      That's more than 40 million times in 30 years, which should be plenty to deal with the entire wizarding population even taking into account accidents and violence (which can be reduced by having as an added punishment for violent crime the denial of Stone treatment). 

      The only real problem is the triage at the beginning, in deciding who gets the first set of treatments. After all wizards have gone through at least once, there will be plenty of usages left not needed for upkeep.

    You do realize Bretton Woods ended in, like, the early 70's, right?

    Nah, they'll just move to the goblin standard - each coin will henceforth be stamped with goblin magic (if they're not already), Gringotts will stop accepting gold for currency (except at market rates, which the Philosopher's Stone will destroy), and everything will continue on mostly as it was before. Because the Stone shouldn't let you counterfeit the magic attached to the coins, the economy is safe to keep on running.

  I wonder why they assumed immediately that wand going to Harry because Harry beat Voldemort that beat Dumbledore.

  Simpler (and more probable) explanation would be Harry beat Dumbledore, and it would be consistent with Harry lying.
