## [Biweekly Challenge] Monster Mash

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/657rkh/biweekly_challenge_20_minutes_in_the_future/) the prompt was "20 Minutes in the Future", and our winner was /u/TheUtilitaria, with [their story](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/657rkh/biweekly_challenge_20_minutes_in_the_future/dgb4ldt/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=rational), "The Facilitator". Go read it now!

##### This Time

This time the challenge will be **Monster Mash**. Your choice of mummies, vampires, werewolves, or Frankenstein('s monster). For extra credit, use them all together. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, [see this TVTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterMash), though you don't have to use all of them at once if you don't want to. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, May 10th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time we're going to be doing something a little bit different. There are only two rules: it must be fanfic, and it must be of something recent (within the last year or two). The more popular, the better, since more people will be able to read it with the original in mind. Ongoing series still count as recent, even if they started decades ago (and I won't patrol that line too hard). We'll call it **Fanfic Grab-bag**. If you want hard mode, write fan fic of the last thing you watched, whatever it is.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 5/10.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat will go up later tonight.

  A little flash fiction I wrote recently, ~250 words. 

  That means it doesn't qualify due to the word limit, but I'd like to share it anyway if I may be so bold. 

  Since it doesn't meet the word limit I won't bother posting it on google docs, since if I'm breaking one rule I may as well break them all, eh?

  The photos were incriminating to say the least. The man - in his 50s - was in a rather compromising position with a large she-wolf.

  “Like I was saying, we, uh, made a little home movie.” His face was bright red and dotted with beads of sweat.

  His lawyer nodded, silently urging him to continue as she took her careful notes.

  “Yeah, so, uh, after she found out that I slept with her sister…” He trailed off nervously.

  “Please continue, Mr Callahan. I am not here to judge.”

  “Yeah, so after she saw the texts, I got home and all my stuff was in a box. That’s fine. I deserved that. So I went to my brother’s place, slept on the couch, and the next week I got a letter with these print outs. So I gave her what she asked for, she wanted five hundred bucks.”

  “And when was this?” She looked up from her notebook.

  “Oh, um, about three months ago. So yeah, she phoned me a couple of days ago and now she wants a thousand dollars. I’m not an idiot. I know how this ends up. Is there any way to… force her to destroy the footage? I mean, I don’t think my ex-wife would ever let me see the kids again if this got out.”

  “Don’t worry, Mr Callahan. We should be able to get this sorted out in mediation. These photos will never see the light of day.”

  My actual entry. I wrote it awhile ago but it fits. 

  It's set in the modern day but in the same universe that my supernatural romance novel is a prequel for. Only the love interest in the novel is the antagonist here.

  Title: *Addiction*; 1250 words
