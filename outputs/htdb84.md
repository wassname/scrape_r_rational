  ```
  This started out with an interesting premise, posing interesting questions about the nature of human-like AI and its integration into society, and getting me invested in the character and her problems.

  The second half... was a long lecture on a myriad of philosophical ideas mainly about... the potential for human progress, I think. It didn't really engage with the premise posed in the first half and left me feeling disappointed.

    Yeah, the second half didn’t feel like someone on a journey of self discovery, it felt like...well, like a teenage girl being lectured to by someone who has taken *two* sociology courses.

    I mean, it fits the theme.  It just didn’t connect with me.
