## Need a book reccomendation.

### Post:

Some one over at r/suggestmeabook said i should ask this question here. If this isnt the right sub, tell me and ill delete this post.

So far my absolute favourite books/web series/book series are:
- Harry Potter And The Methods Of Rationality
- Mother Of Learning
- Skullduggery Pleasant
- Sufficiently Advanced Magic
- The Gam3 (less so than the others)

Can anyone reccommend me a book based of these. I know they're quite obscure, so if you've only read 1 or 2 of them, thats fine.

  This is so on topic here you can basically just look at our Wiki:

  https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works

  https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_where_to_find_more_rational_works

  We also had [book suggestion threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6zr43u/monthly_book_club_perpetual_book_suggestion/) for our "Monthly" Book Club.

  Though mind the sidebar:

      To save you some time: [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) fits pretty well with the books you mentioned and is highly regarded by this sub.

  Wow, first time I've ever seen Skullduggery Pleasant outside my bookshelf! 

  /u/Veedrac is right, you'll like most anything that this sub likes. I feel obligated to recommend Worm, as it's one of my favorite books of all time, even though it's not thematically related to the other ones you posted. www.parahumans.net

  Also, if you don't know about China Mieville, check him out. He writes excellent urban fantasy. Kraken specifically is really really good.

    I'm about 1k pages into Worm and the lack of rationality is a bit grating at times. It's not so much that I dislike non-rational fiction, but that Worm kind of has the veneer of it, but with obvious glaring holes.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Worm isn't at all trying to be rational/ist fiction, though. The closest it gets is "people are pretty good at using their powers creatively". Can't really go into detail/depth because, well, spoilers.

      What do you mean by a veneer? It never seemed to me like it was trying to be rational and failing or trying to decieve the reader into thinking that it was rational, which are the definitions I would use. Though given my username I suppose I'm biased.

      After i read hpmor, it kind of ruined other books for me, there are so many ways the protagonist can easily win, that are just ignored by the author. All the characters seem so much more unrealistic.
      ```

        ```
        Alexander Wales is the most comparable author, imo, when it comes to having in-character, reasoned decisions that are made within a world that is thought through well enough that there are no obvious paths to victory that are ignored. His Worth the Candle series has already been recommended to you before and I think youâ€™d get a lot of enjoyment out of it.

  ```
  The Player of Games by Iain M. Banks. (Maybe the whole culture series)

  Ender's Game (mentioned in HPMOR)

  Prophet's for the End of Time by Marcos Donnelly (conflict between faith and rationality)

  Armor by John Steakley (Ender's game adjacent)

  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead by Tom Stoppard (also a movie starring Gary Oldman and Tim Roth)

  Those are all the books that have stopped my life for a moment and made me never want to read again. The one on your list that made the cut is HPMOR. Read it once then listened to the Audi version twice all in the span of a year.

  Enchanter by Robin W. Bailey has a similar feel to Mother of Learning. Also similar is Riftwar Saga by Raymond Feist. Slightly more serious but not entirely serious.

  Since you asked for books, rather than web serials, I'd like to suggest the following:

  - Yoon Ha Lee's "Machineries of Empire" series, with its Sufficiently Advanced [Technology/Magic] in the Calendrical exotics
  - Lois McMaster Bujold, and in particular "Falling Free", with its heroic engineers working together to build themselves a future
  - Graydon Saunders's "Commonweal" series, beginning with the military fantasy The March North and continuing with the sorcery school A Succession Of Bad Days; this is either a civil engineering manual lost in a fantasy or the other way around, not sure which.
  - Rick Cook's "The Wiz Biz" series is trashy pulp, but it's delicious trashy pulp with computer engineers figuring out a magic system. Well, I thought it was delicious. Note that I'm not saying it was *good*.

  In terms of web serials, not many people seem to recommend Scott Alexander's "Unsong", but there is no better repository of whale puns and bad Kabbalah in the entirety of fiction.

    Ooh I missed Machineries of Empire book 3 being published?

    I wish there was a better way to follow series continuations publishing... Like, I'm on fictfact but keeping both that and goodreads up to date is more work than I'm willing to put into it. Why doesn't kindle notify me when they get book 3 of a series where I read books 1 and 2... /rant

    Thanks for making me realise!

    (also, Bujold is indeed great)
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      True story, I met my wife through our mutual love of Bujold's books. I recommend her stuff on the slightest justification, because they're awesome.
      ```

  - u/Munchkingman:
    ```
    just saying, im halfway through falling free right now and am loving it absolutely. thanks.

  Lots of good recommendations here, so I'll add a couple of easy reading fantasy options. Both got references from HPMOR, either in-story or in an author's note.

  Lawrence Watt-Evans' *Legends of Ethshar* series dips in and out of rational fantasy territory, and they're quite good. None of the characters are hyper-rational, but their behavior is believably within the spectrum of normal humans, irrespective of their role in the plot. Narrative is unpredictable; sometimes there's a hint of deus ex machina but just as often the plots go off the rails in unexpected directions. As with Watt-Evans' other series, the world-building is excellent with well-defined political and magic systems.

  Patricia C. Wrede's *Enchanted Forest Chronicles* are not so much rational as comic fantasy deconstruction. Set in a standard high fantasy universe, with witches, wizards, dragons, magic swords, et c., but similar in tone to Discworld. Main characters tend to be normal-ish people in a world populated largely by overblown caricatures of standard fantasy archetypes.

  You'd probably like books by Lawrence Watt-Evans and Larry Niven.
