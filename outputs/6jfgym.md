  I liked the not-ghost scene; "lets ask the dead" gets you information all too easy in some stories. Interrogating the afterimage this way was a very nice angle.

    I think that's intentional. Nic has been stated as being out of his depth on at least three occassions now, by himself, Simole, and Mr. Delcroix. What just happened is clearly not a quest of his level, not a story in which he is supposed to be the main character, so it's only natural he just helplessly stands by as events quickly happen. I think it's going to slow down significantly soon.

    Then again, I've been thinking that for three chapters already...
