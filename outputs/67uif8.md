## [RT] Are there any good crackfic/ratfic?

### Post:

I'm honestly curious whether it's possible to have one fic be both. That one Harry Potter fic where he's a lazy hufflepuff comes close but doesn't quite hit the line for being a ratfic.

    HP MoR itself as well, for that matter.

  [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux) might apply.

  *[Harry the Hufflepuff](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185)*

  It's a trilogy, not just one story.

  See also *[Chary Potter and the Years of Reluctance](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9268889)* and *[Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183)*. I can't remember enough about them to be able to say whether or not they seem "rational", though.

    ```
    Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is rational in the sense that the protagonist is a huge munchkin, but most of that is on the DnD side of things. It's not actually a rational story as far as decision-making goes, though.

    ```
    The first chapter of chary doesn't seem very funny, much more the opposite really

    > TV Tropes says a crack fic is any story whose premise and events would be completely implausible in Canon. Fanlore dot org says crack has a fundamentally ludicrous premise, or otherwise includes a plethora of unbelievable, incredible, or just plain silly elements. I don't see anything about any of that which contradicts the characteristics of either rational fiction or rationalist fiction listed in the sidebar.

    However, in a "rational" story, the "fundamentally ludicrous premise" would have to be extended backward throughout the entire setting, rather than merely appearing from thin air at the start of the story. This would entail a large amount of work for the author--and what if the "fundamentally ludicrous premise" turns out to be totally incompatible with anything remotely resembling canon?

    My interpretation of the spirit of the question is more "is there any fiction that is a surreal satire of rational fiction tropes?"

    Or possibly "is there any fiction that mashes setting-elements from disparate settings together incoherently like an inexperienced 12-year-old of an author is wont to do, and then attempts to thread a character through that setting, that—while possibly 'rational' under scrutiny—is also still performing the sorts of acts an inexperienced 12-year-old author would have a character perform."

    My own simple take on this would be to imagine a rational character having semi-lucid dreams, with "their" actions being rational, while "the dream-world's" actions are surreal and silly—and where "the dream-world's actions" also includes controlling them sometimes, in the same way a DM can dictate what a player does sometimes.

        Point of note, that is what I meant.

        Something with a ludicrous/surreal/silly premise where the characters and their decision making are up to rationalfic standards.

    Crack fic? I loved what you have so far and am eagerly waiting to see how it goes, but it was also possibly the most soul-crushing sequel to HPMOR that I've ever seen.

  Does Crack Slash epilogue count?

  It's still my head-canon epilogue :)

    A crackfic is, essentially, a piece of fiction (usually fanfiction) on crack. It's difficult to define beyond that, besides generally being humorous, but the [TVTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackFic) does a decent job.

    If you've read Worm, I'd highly recommend [THE TECHNO QUEEN \**krakathoom*\*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-techno-queen-iii.311201/) as an introduction to the genre.

      THE TECHNO QUEEN is amazing (so far)!

  - u/waylandertheslayer:
    ```
    Humour-based stories that rely on absurd interpretations of characters/events to generate comedy. Done well, they can be amazing (see e.g. [Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/) as well as some of Emerald Ashes' other stories).
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      Power of Lies and [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux) felt to me like they skirted the line of crack-fic, being only just on the crack side.  I can best describe it as other crack fics tend to feel manic, while Emerald Ashes's stories are still ludicrous, but come across as calmer.
      ```

- u/redrach:
  ```
  I present [A Black Comedy](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy)

  A comedic HP fic where adult Harry ends up in a parallel dimension seeking Sirius, and finds himself fighting Voldemort all over again.

      Maybe so, but from what I recall there's a fair bit of long-term planning on both sides, and I figure it'll appeal to fans of rational fics.

      In any case it's the closest thing to a rational *crack*fic that comes to mind.
      ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        Their long term plan is break Voldemort's neck and hope he doesn't stay mad at them.......

        There is no long term plan besides that (on the part of the protagonists)
        ```

- u/masterax2000:
  ```
  This... Sort of counts. I think.
