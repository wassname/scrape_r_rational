  If you haven't read it yet, *Worth the Candle* is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, but probably not as bad as what you pictured when you read that. If you want to start from the beginning, [chapter 1 is here](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) or [read the whole thing in one page](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true) (but it's past 150K words, which is getting on the long side for a single sitting). If you want to stay up to date, get an account on Archive of Our Own and then click the subscribe button. Also maybe stay out of the comments unless you love spoilers?

  Apologies for the delay, I've been sick the last few days, but am (mostly) better now. In four days I will have been writing this story for two months without a break, with an average daily word count of 2,607 words. Go me! Thanks to everyone who has read this story, recommended it in other places, or clicked any of the buttons that make the metrics go up.

    I hope you're feeling better! Thanks for the big update <3. Worth the candle has quickly become one favorite things this year, between the world building and great writing it has blown me away.

    Hey, thanks for the update! I've been repeatedly checking, which is a bit dumb since I've got email notification set up, but it paid off! I found the update on the sub Reddit first.

    So, is there going to be a larger-than-normal delay between chapters now, since it's the end of Book II? If so, how much larger than normal do you expect it to be?
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Nope, no delay, next chapter is half-written. I do like to separate books, so there will be a tiny bit of recap stuff mixed in, but it will otherwise be like normal. (I continue to insist that I don't actually have an update schedule and no one should make expectations of me.)

        how many books are there?
        ```

        - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
          ```
          Book I is chapters 1-14, Book II is chapters 15-33. If you're asking how many books there *will be*, then the answer is that I don't know, but probably not more than ten.

          (I just counted out the planned arcs and it looks like there are about fifteen of them, but some will occupy a B-plot position, others will be only half a book, and some will inevitably get dropped when the story takes a turn, which will probably be balanced out by others coming into being.)
          ```

  ```
  > A pure magenta gem... a spread of 90 degrees... one-quarter of projectile force will be directed back at the user.

  Huh. Balanced by game design, rather than conservation of momentum (which would indicate something like 41% back-at-user).

  Or, you know, *commoner's guide*.
  ```

- u/Gilgilad7:
  ```
  Wow, double level up!  I hope he invests his points wisely!  What do you think he should put the points towards everyone?

  Would be interesting if there was a chart somewhere listing each skill we have seen so far and which stat was its primary/secondary assuming it has been revealed so far in the story.  

  By the way, great conclusion to book II.  Thank you!

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    Known skills and their primary and secondary attributes, where discovered by Juniper at the end of Book II (please let me know if this is contradicted by the text at any point):

    Skill|Value|Primary|Secondary
    :--|--|--|--
    Unarmed	|18 |SPD
    One-handed	|18	|POW
    Two-handed	|18	|POW
    Improvised	|15	|POW
    Thrown	|15	|SPD
    Dual Wield	|15	|SPD
    Pistols	|12	|SPD
    Bows	|12	|WIS
    Rifles	|12	|CUN
    Parry	|18	|SPD|INS
    Athletics	|18	|END
    Dodge	|18	|SPD|INS
    Engineering	|12	|CUN
    Horticulture	|0|	
    Art	|6	|CHA
    Blood Magic	|12	|WIS
    Bone Magic	|12	|KNO
    Gem Magic	|6||
    Skin Magic	|12	|KNO
    Flattery	|6	|CHA
    Comedy	|6	|CHA
    Romance	|6	|CHA
    Intimidation	|10	|INS
    Deception	|8	|POI/???

    Edit: Note that you can also draw some conclusions about what secondary attributes *aren't*, e.g. if Unarmed is capped at 18 then the secondary attribute can't be CHA or POI, since skills cap at five times the value of the secondary stat and that would be 10 for both CHA and POI. That information is known, but not included in this table.

      Clearly he needs to drop more points into mental/soc. Not the subskills, because unbalancing his reasoning ability is not a good idea, and also it would probably distort who he is more. But.. mental/soc. Because most of the magic runs on them, and being smarter is victory. Seriously, people in gamer setups going for physical hurts. Min-maxing a physical combatant when you are sitting at a table and can use your real life mental faculties to reason out a plot your int-3 barb could never ever follow is fine. But if the stats affect you directly, every point you dont use to get smarter is going to result in you missing things.

        > But if the stats affect you directly, every point you dont use to get smarter is going to result in you missing things.

        While ideally mental/social stuff is the best, adding physical attributes makes you directly harder to kill\*, and all Joon *really* needs is to buy time to get exp - as long as you don't minmax physical entirely, I think it makes the most sense to focus on inherent (i.e. can't be undercut by betrayal, e.g. stealing magic items (cough Aumann cough)) defense. And as a bonus, revision magic looks *super* useful as a defensive tool, so you'd be dumping points in MEN anyway.

        \*Specifically, harder to kill in an ambush - i.e. when you *don't* predict everything. By the same logic, luck is also super-important.
        ```

        - u/chicken_fried_steak:
          ```
          Agreed. Given how dangerous the world seems to be, defense and healing are key. That would mean prioritizing getting up Dodge, Parry, Bone Magic and getting his hands on some Revision Magic, pronto. So Spd, Kno and whatever stat governs Revision Magic should be the immediate priorities.
          ```

            ```
            > So Spd, Kno and whatever stat governs Revision Magic should be the immediate priorities.

            Uh, what about the stat that gives Max HP directly? I mean, parrying et al are great but in some circumstances you just have to take a blow. Not to mention Max HP is an implicit cap on self-healing, for obvious reasons.
            ```

    - u/chicken_fried_steak:
      ```
      Interesting to think about what the best investments would be to fix Juniper's bones and Amaryllis' Ratrot... It seems obvious to me that getting Bone magic up can only help for both problems, so dumping 3 points into Kno to get it to 20 might be wise. On the flip side, that's a big investment for something that might not work.

      Dropping all four points into Luk and hoping it influences things to start breaking a bit easier for the party as a result might be the best bet for a quick resolution, or else investing 2 into Men and 2 into Soc to try and engineer a solution... Tricky.
      ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        Men + soc are the most universally applicable. Of course, if he drops too many points into them, he gets really hard to write for the author.

      - u/cthulhuraejepsen:

        No, I mean I keep an up-to-date character sheet as the story gets written which has all the information available on it, color-coded to show what Juniper knows and what the reader knows so I have less of a chance of screwing things up. The above table is a snapshot of part of what's on my canonical character sheet, as of ch 33.

  Ugh, the Aumann ~~showdown~~ letdown. It's official: gold mages suck. I thought there was no way Aumann would fall for their obvious scavenger-hunt bait, being the schemer that he is - having outmaneuvered two gold mages, presumably through knowing his profession's weaknesses. I mean, gold suddenly springing up at conveniently remote locations (then disappearing in their dry runs)? Here hold my ~~beer~~ idiot ball. 

  If it can't be ignored despite one's best rational efforts, the call of gold seems like a severe Achilles' heel. I imagine the few gold mages stronger than Aumann are all rabid prospectors twitching at every granny's gold tooth passing by.

  >Wards are heavy, absolute velocity, blood and bone to stop us, but all three breakable in five minutes.

  Warding is a surprisingly unreliable field. It's overpowered when you can set the field for an imminent confrontation against a non-warder, but amounts to a glorified delay tactic against a warder of equal or greater skill. At least this applies to Bessemer's temp wards. Not sure how Sheriot would have subverted the permanent wards at Caer Laga.

  >I was wrapped in a golden glow, tinged with red this time, and it was like a goddess had taken my brain for my skull, trailing every yellow-white nerve from it, then stuck it into her mouth and ran her warm, sucking tongue along the tip of every nerve ending.

  Lewdest level-up ever. Now I'm expecting a smut warning at level 20!

  Do note that if loyalty mind magic works in both directions ( assuming it exists and keeps actual loyalty close to the game stats) , Fenn and Juniper are never getting rid of each other. At max loyalty, that's probably a more severe commitment than getting married.
  ```

  - u/OrangeBasket:
    ```
    Hell, the name Twinned Souls alone could mean that there might be another layer to this relationship - if one of them (aka Fenn, sadly) is hurt or dies could it have an adverse effect on the other (Joon) not just mentally or physically, but on a magical layer?
    ```

    - u/Kuratius:
      ```
      Calling it now: 
      Twinned souls heals his companions on level-up if they would fall too far behind in power otherwise.
      The implications are left as an exercise to the reader.

  ```
  Ahaha. I suspected that the "kiss at the end" of this particular quest might have come from someone other than Amaryllis (it seemed like the kind of dickish thing the game layer likes to do), but for some reason it never actually occurred to me that it would be *Fenn*. On a more serious note: this indicates an absolutely insane amount of precognitive ability on the part of the game layer, which combined with the whole "Juniper Smith" thing pretty much shoots the dream-skewer hypothesis to dust.
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    >I suspected that the "kiss at the end" of this particular quest might have come from someone other than Amaryllis

    I'm still a little disappointed it wasn't Amaryllis kissing Fenn or something, as [someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vcsdh/rt_worth_the_candle_chapter_23_siege/dm0djad/) in a previous thread speculated. That would have been hilarious.

    > this indicates an absolutely insane amount of precognitive ability on the part of the game layer

    I would bet on subtle reality-warping/probability-manipulation instead. We've seen, apparently, how it manipulated Fenn's mental state, so that it corresponded to her loyalty level. If it was working on precognition, what we should expect is Fenn and Juniper never ending up in a situation that would lead to her loyalty going down, not the game rewriting her mind — which is exactly what happened, since Juniper's game-assisted model of her personality (as well as Fenn's own model of her own personality) strongly disagreed with Fenn's actual behaviour.

    That said, it *could* still be precognition — a situation just special enough that Fenn exhibits model-surprising behaviour — but the evidence are more indicative of reality-warping than precognition. Remember also Juniper's speculations about DM retconning these two girls he left to die in the Risen Lands into not being Amaryllis.

    We're choosing between reality-warping + precognition, and reality-warping. Occam's Razor suggests the latter.
    ```

    - u/valeskas:
      ```
      No need for subtle reality-warping/precog. If the game is capable of tailoring Amaryllis looks to MC brain, it is definitely capable to create Fenn in such a way, that she will like MC naturally.

      Plus, I think there were hints that Fenn likes MC. 
      For example, Ch 19:
      >I couldn’t tell whether she had any actual interest in me or whether she was just having fun at my expense, or maybe both.

      So, the kiss was probable from the game POV, and it added "maybe kiss" to quest description.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        > If the game is capable of tailoring Amaryllis looks to MC brain, it is definitely capable to create Fenn in such a way, that she will like MC naturally.

        "Naturally liking Juniper" and "never starting to like Juniper less" are two different things. The latter is much harder to implement without reality-warping, and it would likely result in either a horribly twisted human mind, or not *human* mind at all. Can you imagine someone who always likes you at the exact same level, no matter what you do?

        Good point point about the probabilistic nature of the kiss-related statement, though. It indeed said "there might even be a kiss", not "there will be".
        ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    >insane amount of precognitive ability on the part of the game layer

    That could be "timeless physics" case. All non-negligible probability paths have specific invariant preserved, that would be "kiss at the end".
    ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    I was dreading that bit after hearing about the "cloacal kiss." We're safe.

  I recently read a few shitty korean translations and enjoyed them (even though the english is bad).

  I enjoy these kinds of books. What are the preemo quality books in this genre? Maybe even readable?

  - u/HeartwarmingLies:

    My taste is somewhat questionable but I'll link some I've liked recently: 

    In this one Earth gets absorbed into a game system and due to being underground at the time the MC spawns in a dungeon leading to some powergamey stuff.

    http://royalroadl.com/fiction/11209/the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound/chapter/127131/chapter-1

    In this one the MC ends up in an abandoned inn and becomes an inn keeper in a magical world. Much less focused on power gaming than the other 2.

    https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com

    And finally in this one the MC and her class are killed by dimensional magic and then are reborn into a magical world, with MC spawning as a spider.

    ```
    Like heartwarminglies said, The Wandering Inn is a great piece of LitRPG fiction. It takes a while to set up the story, but it's worth having the patience to get into this one. The updates are definitely highlights of my week.
