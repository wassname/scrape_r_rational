## Intelligent D&D(5e) Villains Utilising the Physical Laws of their Universe

### Post:

I've got a few of these already active in my campaign. I'd be interested in hearing people's thoughts on additional schemes this kind of villain might employ in a world where the D&D(5e) rulebook is an accurate description of how physics works rather than an abstraction to facilitate gameplay.   


Example from my current game:  
A Mindflayer using domination of a Kuo-Toa highpriest to direct the tribe to worship them as a god (Kuo-Toa are a humanoid fish people whose special ability is that any idol they worship as a god becomes a god).

  Munchkinry by villains in d&d is only fun if it results in something stabbable by the party. Otherwise it is a thing that happens to other people in the world.

  For example, it's best to assume that the spell Fireball is the best possible fireball at a given power threshold. It has probably out-competed every other aoe fire spell or whatever. However, [3.5 and pathfinder](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances) had a bunch of consumables that just made your fireball noticeably better than the next guy's.

  Anyone with enough power to cast a fireball should have a bunch of black powder on hand in their component pouch too. It out competes clearly, and so should be the staple rather than the exception.

  In your example, if mindflayers know they can flay a KT society and make gods, why would any mindflayers of sufficient skill even bother with goblins and hook horrors?

  The stable state (like, whatever is read in the books) of Forgotten Realms says they don't, so they either can't or don't know how or whatever. Applications that adapt the stable state are just contrivances for the purpose of story, and stories need stuff to be stabbed eventually.

  Passwall will sink any boat. Teleport will let you target a boat. Sink any ship with 3 spells.

  Be a halfling wizard, weigh 80lbs. Cast reduce person, weigh 10lbs. Mage hand yourself around at 60ft per round.

    Do be a halfling wizard, but only because it is the superior RP option.

    I don't think that teleport thing would fly.  Spell failure is based on how well you know the location, and "any ship" doesn't imply that you're familiar with it (so at least a 33% chance of a miscellaneous mishap, 10% to end up on the wrong ship, and 10% to probably drop into the ocean).  

    You'd need access to the ship to take a chunk off it for the teleport to work reliably so at that point you can sabotage the ship for fewer spell slots and attacks of opportunity.
    ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      I think the presumption is that you can see the ship in question, from another ship or from the shore, and that vision is plenty for "familiarity".
      ```

  Any intelligent actor could quickly go infinite if they knew both the spells *Simulacrum* and *True Polymorph*


  Step 0: Make sure you won't fight with your infinite clones.


  Step 1: True polymorph a pebble into whatever material components you need.


  Step 2: Make a simulacrum of yourself.


  Step 3: True polymorph the simulacrum into a true copy of yourself. Maintain until permanent. 


  Step 4: Have your new twin repeat the process. Go to bed and start fresh in the morning with your triplet buddies. 

  ~~Step 5: Be executed by the gods for daring to overstep your bounds~~
  Step 5: Enjoy Infinity

  You should triple your numbers 12 hours if my logic is right.
  You might be able to cut out the simulacrum entirely depending on how you interpret the Polymorph any Object text (by polymorphing a pebble into yourself), making you multiply much much faster.


  Though ultimately any exploit that undoes the setting will have to be explained away. Maybe exploits are how gods get made, and they then get patched, a la WTC Exclusions, whenever a new one is found?
  ```

  - u/BreakingBaaaahhhhd:
    ```
    In the web serial Worth the Candle, when someone learns to exploit something or become to powerful, whole schools of magic can become "excluded" where sometimes they end up just being excluded to a geological location so it only functions within that area setting up exclusion zones. I like the concept.
    ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    You can do this (and much, much worse) at level 5 in Pathfinder.
    ```

- u/CCC_037:
  ```
  Does the mindflayer become divine, or do the Kuo-toa create a god who looks *exactly like* the mindflayer?

  Do their beliefs about the mindflayer ("he is protective and will save us from any external threats, even at the cost of his own life") affect his behaviour?
  ```

  - u/GET_A_LAWYER:
    ```
    That would be a fabulous DM twist. And completely appropriate, since the beliefs of the Koa-toa actually determine reality.

    "Congratulations, you're now the God of the Koa-toa, exactly as kind and devoted to them as they imagined you to be. Have fun watching over this tribe for the rest of your days."
    ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      "Congratulations. You have exactly what you asked for." is my favourite sort of twist.

  There's no rule that you can't take actions while dead.
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    unfortunately every single ghost in the universe is locked in an eternal cold war with every other ghost, so their action every turn is "try to prevent the actions of anyone who's currently dead". This leads to such massive penalties that any attempted action while dead inevitably has zero effect.
    ```

  - u/staged_interpreter:
    ```
    There's also no rule that you can take actions while dead. Trust me, you don't want to have this discussion with the Divine Management.
    ```

    - u/archpawn:
      ```
      Is there a rule that you can take actions while alive?
      ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  I literally wrote a book on this.

  * A 10' ladder costs 1sp. A 10' pole cost 5cp. Firewood costs 1cp. Buy a ladder for 1sp, break it into 2 10' poles and a pile of firewood (the rungs). 
  * Create an [Ice Assassin](http://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/frostburn--68/ice-assassin--1279/index.html) of yourself. As its creator, order it to "always maximize my CEV".
  * Grapple N willing creatures, where N is your number of hands. Each of them grapples N' other creatures, where N' is their number of hands. On your action, move, dragging everyone with you. Release one target (no action required). They grapple you and drag you, and everyone else in your grapple ball. Repeat. Note that you can fit 100 Fine creatures in a square and they can all reach each other.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    In 3.5 edition I established a Great Cleave messenger service with goblins chained to poles exactly 5' apart linking all major cities.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Yes, but that's single-use. The commoner railgun is repeatable. Have a lot of commoners stand in a line 5' apart. The first one picks up a person or object (one action) and drops it into the hands of the best person in line (free action) that person drops it into the hands of the next person, etc. In one round, the person/object can crowdsurf an arbitrary distance.

      Note that the CR does not actually serve as a 
      damage-causing railgun, as that application requires shifting from RAW to physics halfway through.
      ```

      - u/staged_interpreter:
        ```
        I would have you pay for the commoners time/food/accommodations and 4 shift replacements. At useful distances this turns out to be more expensive then just using commonly acceptable ways of transportation. 


        Also even if you pay the commoners, their lord might take exception to why Joe Farmer is not dirt farming but standing around waiting for someone passing him an item. 


        Commoners aren't free and everything in the books while buyable isn't an infinite resource. 


        My general rule of thumb for fiction is can be summed up with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton's_fence

        Rules and fiction may sound illogical or without reason because the story doesn't focus on that particular mechanic. If the player decides to abuse it the story changes it focus and reality will ensure.


        Rocks will fall and may cause harm as appropriate.

          > At useful distances this turns out to be more expensive then just using commonly acceptable ways of transportation.

          Has this been calculated? There could be uses where the speed is just that profitable.

  - u/Geminii27:

    I'd wonder if the Assassin would be able to determine your CEV accurately, though. Presumably it'd be better at it the more intelligent it was. The "you can cast any self-targeted spell on yourself and the Assassin" mechanic has got to be munchkinable, though.

    Come to think of it, does the Assassin have its own XP and mana pool equivalents? It does have "all the skills and abilities" of the original. Can it burn its own XP and/or mana to increase yours beyond the 5000 XP it costs to make one? If you have access to an enormous amount of diamond dust, can your Assassin create an Assassin of its own, and that one create its own, and so forth?

    Come to think of it twice, is there anything preventing you creating an Ice Assassin of something epic-level? The diamond dust and XP cost is the same regardless. Create an Assassin of something capable of casting Wish, or massively boosting your own stats, or producing items of significant monetary value.

    Perhaps most important: there's no information about what an Ice Assassin does when its original/nemesis dies. Does it stop working? Does it just melt away? Does it instead become a completely pliant golem, doing whatever you tell it, until it disintegrates of accumulated damage at some future point? Is it, in fact, possible to create an Assassin using a body part from a dead creature at all?
    ```

  ```
  The lore says that through their madness from being broken by Illithids they end up creating entities resembling gods that can manifest, and that they can draw power from those to cast spells if enough of them believe in it.

  That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a path to apotheosis, and even if that can happen, those entities are shaped by the Kuo Tao's beliefs, so anyone seeking godhood through that path will most likely suffer significant personality changes to the point that they might as well be considered dead, and the entity left, an entirely different person.After all it's created from madness, so any kind of stable transference seems pretty unlikely.  
   I'm not even sure that those entities created have anything resembling full-fledged personhood.

  That said, a botched attempt at apotheosis could be a pretty interesting plot element to explore.

  Do they have rules for sleep deprivation yet? ;)
  ```

  - u/edwardkmett:
    ```
    [Yes](http://gdnd.wikidot.com/condition:exhaustion). Exhaustion gets added by long marches, a bunch of taxing spells, and eventually by sleep deprivation. In the description of Constitution it says that the DM may request a character to roll a Constitution or incur a level of exhaustion for each day past the first it tries to "go without sleep". 

    As usual, this is a little flubbed and the exact connection between a long rest and actual sleep is a bit sloppy, but they have rules now. RAW, you can still get away with a [sleepless sorclock](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?409694-The-Coffee-Drow-A-Sleepless-Sorclock), though.
