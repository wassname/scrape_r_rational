## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Worthwhile Media I've seen in 2021-22. If there's any stuff you think is good that I might have missed, please tell me in the replies. 


  All are considered good to great by me, the ordering is just the strength of my recommendation, **not** how good I think it is comparatively.

  +++ unreserved rec
  ++ rec with a few reservations
  + rec with many reservations


  #**Films**

  +++:


  - Pig - Completely unpredictable and refreshing. 
  - Dune - Amazing vision and realization of my favourite books growing up. 


  ++:

  - The French Dispatch - Uniquely quirky and charming comedy about France/the French as seen from an exaggerated American lens.
  - Everything Everywhere All At Once - A delicate balance between hilarious and emotional.
  - The Green Knight - Bad pacing, but awesomely deconstructive. 
  - The Last Duel - Amazing production value(set design, set pieces, costume design), decent plot. 

  +:

  - Licorice Pizza - Much more interesting if you understand it as a subversion of >!our society's definitions of childhood and adulthood.!<
  - The Power of the Dog - Trauma begets trauma. Also the pacing feels traumatic at times. 


  #Episodic shows

  +++:

  - Station Eleven - Meandering in the middle, but with amazing beginning and end. 
  - Severance - A scifi dark comedy. The reducto ad absurdum of a typical megacorporation's controlling employees in their totality, with particular emphasis on their obsession with creating a mythos/culture, and our natural aversion to that kind of thing.
  - Andor(ongoing) - Andor is unbelievably good. Not just on its own, but also for overcoming the massive rotting albatross around its neck that comes from being associated with the Star Wars universe. The plot itself is pretty straightforward, but examined from the outside it's almost like it's a meta deconstruction of the Star Wars IP, in that, where every SW movie or show in the Disney era relies completely on nostalgia baiting for appeal and quality, Andor eschews it completely, and it does so *despite being a prequel show of a prequel movie of a mid-saga movie trilogy*. There are no jedi or sith or the force, no epic set pieces or stakes at play, no cameos, no callbacks, no references or quotes. Nothing ties it to the wider universe besides obscure lore and the aesthetics. Ultimately, it means the creators managed to create a superb Star Wars show *that didn't even need to be set in Star Wars to work*. 

  ++:

  - House of the Dragon - Good so far, but once burned twice shy. 
  - Midnight Mass - Great miniseries with no true villains, just victims. Horror aesthetics, but more of a character drama imo. 
  - Watchmen - A bit over the top with its themes, but I still loved it. Just wish they had spent some budget on >!doctor manhattan's appearance. He looks like a member of the blue man group more than a demi-god.!<

  +:     

  - We Own This City - A "based on actual events" miniseries from the makers of The Wire. Go watch The Wire if you haven't already.  
  - Peripheral(ongoing) - I liked the book, the show is off to a good start.

    *Andor* is disgustingly good. It's offensively good. I'm actually kinda pissed off they dumped stuff like *Book of Boba Fett* on us before letting us in on *Andor*. It genuinely blows my mind that... it's not just a *product*. It's got vision, it's got directorial affect, it's got ambition. I've seen people levy the criticism that, 'oh, you could strip out the Star Wars stuff and it would still work fine' like that's a bad thing, but that's part of what makes it good! It is written, shot, directed, as a highly competent and enthralling serial espioinage thriller at baseline, and the Star-Warsyness that is there is able to act as styling and gilding, not forced to pretend to be substance in itself.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I'd have liked to have been a fly on the wall when they pitched it to Kathleen Kennedy. 

      Something like:

      > Imagine a Star Wars show, except everyone is competent and actually gives a shit about it beyond a paycheck or seeing their name in the credits. 

      ---

      I agree with respect to creator vision, I've always liked my film auteurs, but come to appreciate it more and more in episodic content with the rise of streaming websites and the drivel they put out. 

      I recommend you check out Station Eleven, Severance, and Midnight Mass. All of them feel similar to Andor in that they're clearly the result of thoughtful, competent people finally given a creative outlet, whereas most shit nowadays feels more like an executive went: "find me someone to quickly make stuff so we can put it on our website, STAT!", e.g. LotR RoP, Kenobi, Witcher, WoT, etc.

    What's your main reservation(s) with We Own This City? Just from the pedigree it sounds amazing, did the apple just roll a bit far from the tree?

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      First I should reiterate that I did like it, and a lot. Still, I admit it wasn't anywhere near the level of The Wire or even Treme. 

      Part of it is definitely the length, only 6 episodes. That's how long The Wire takes to click with most people! It's not enough to connect to characters or to delve into a subject like they did with The Wire and Treme. 

      Another part of it is that it's based on real events and real people, and so we have "villains" instead of grey, compelling characters. You can't make a real life pieces of shit too sympathetic, you know? Also because of that the narrative becomes kind of predictable, even for me, someone who did not know almost anything of the events the show is based of. The first few episodes felt extremely compelling because of how they framed it. But there's only so much framing you can do with reality so the last couple episodes were kind of predictable, like a slow motion replay of a car crash. Gruesome, depressing, and completely inevitable.

          On a side note, the author has quite a few other great Star Wars SI fics set in different eras, some from Jedi perspective, some Sith, some neutral, and some non-force sensitive. Unfortunately, all of them besides "Path of Ruin" haven't gotten much past 20k words. That said, in my opinion they are very well written with great characterization and world building. If you don't mind short fics that might never be finished, I suggest checking them out. Here are some of my favorites:

            Best I could sum it up was Neutral Evil or Chaotic Neutral. He's not a murderhobo but his morals go out the window when it comes to self preservation or self gain.

            - u/chiruochiba:
              ```
              I disagree with pigeonholing the SI into unrealistic DnD morality.

              The character's main motivation from the very beginning is to survive, which is nearly impossible when he's trapped as an aspiring acolyte on sith-controlled Korriban during the Old Republic era. He is quickly forced to accept that his survival requires killing other people. He tries to do what good he can, or at least avoid wanton cruelty, but that's difficult when he's constantly embroiled in sith powergames while dealing with his own growing Dark Side corruption. He's a rational protagonist who never commits 'evil for the sake of evil', but his utilitarian focus on survival eventually leads him to do many bad things.

      I read through Kaleidoscope based on the thread last week. The first part of the story is depressing and angsty, but I enjoyed it enough. The story then circles the drain and ends terribly.

        I pretty much treat the 2nd part as an entirely separate story. The author themselves voices a similar notion:

        And to be clear, my recommendation is / was mainly about the 1st part.

      Careful of Dreaming of Sunshine. It is very irrational. I guess it is okay to pass the time but you probably have to turn your brain off while reading. Couldn’t get pass the point where >! The SI warns Gaara that Sasori, a famous criminal akatsuki member, is out to get him. Nothing comes of it, and Gaara didn’t even ask why or how does the SI, a leaf genin, know this valuable information. No fact checks or follow ups in the ninja world where people are killed for knowledge. !< Also, it looks like the timeline is impossible to change and canon is going on schedule.

        I'll defend it on that particular plot point: >!If Gaara had checked the veracity of the information -- and I assume he did this discreetly, because he *is* a ninja -- he would have found that she had a violent run-in with two of them in the middle of a town, near a crowd of people, and subsequently spent a month in a hospital. If Sand follows up with quality spying, he might also find that a lot of Leaf's secret info about Akatsuki either came from or was confirmed by the mid-fight conversation she had with Itachi.!<

        As for the plot following the canon storyline: this is a valid criticism, and it bugs me. Fortunately things start getting increasingly derailed as time goes on. You stopped reading before the consequences of this really make themselves felt, but >!Sasuke's decision to *not* turn traitor unavoidably changes things quite a bit from canon.!<

        >The SI  >!warns Gaara that Sasori, a famous criminal akatsuki member, is out to get him.!< Nothing comes of it

        False. What came of it was that >!Gaara reciprocated by sharing a dossier on Sasori that Konohagakure could use to protect against the Akatsuki. Thus, Konoha's operatives (including the SI) could use that as a leaping off point to gather more intel on Akatsuki. As a further result, the SI is forced to join the intel branch of Konoha's bureaucracy, and she uses her position there to gather and present key intel on Hidan and Kakuzu. Obviously, Konoha's top ninja would be better prepared to fight Akatsuki than they were in canon, which comes to fruition when the adult Ino-Shika-Cho squad easily captures Hidan.!<

        The other effect was that >!Gaara trained to become stronger in anticipation of the threats he and his village would face, which is obvious at the Grass Exams. When the fic went on indefinite hiatus, it hadn't yet reached the part of the plot where Akatsuki would ramp up its attacks on jinchuriki. Thus, you have no way of knowing the further long term effect of Gaara's forewarning.!<

        >Gaara didn’t even ask why or how does the SI, a leaf genin, >!know this valuable information.!< No fact checks or follow ups in the ninja world where people are killed for knowledge.

        All of this is adequately explained in the SI's internal dialogue. >!She is a personal friend of Gaara, so he has motive *not to* question her about anything that would force him to treat her as an enemy of the village. That said, the SI is the dauther of Konoha's Jounin Commander, close friends with the daughter of the Yamanka clan head (known for mind reading), and could plausibly have close contact with Jiraiya (Konoha's Spymaster). Thus, there are plenty of plausible avenues through which the SI could have aquired the info, and in fact the SI already provided the true reason: she was told because she is the teammate of Konoha's jinchuriki, so she needs to know about Akatsuki to be prepared.!<

        >Also, it looks like the timeline is impossible to change and canon is going on schedule. It is basically a rewrite of Naruto with a different character but same exact plot.

        False. The changes ramp up slowly in the beginning, but by the hiatus point >!Konoha is embroiled in a war that never existed in canon, has hugely important allies that never existed in canon, Sasuke is one of Konoha's strongest ninja because he never defected, and Konoha has made huge advances investigating and defeating Akatsuki which wouldn't have happened until much later in canon.!<

          The story may have pivoted, but I remember reading 200k words of dry anime + filler + movies recitation of exact plot points with the added presence of the protagonist. You can't exactly deny that one, if a reader's going to have to sit down and power through such a ridiculous amount of it. It's not just canon, it's everything the writer could conceivably novelize, play by play.

            I never claimed the early parts aren't a rehash of canon. In fact, I've pointed that fact out in past comment chains on the subject. I definitely agree that the reader has to go through many, many chapters to get to the truly interesting later parts. Personally, I skim read to get past about 60% of the filler arc and movie chapters. To me the fic is well written and enjoyable enough that I still go back to reread it periodically, but I definitely understand that it's not everyone's cup of tea.

    I like to think my self insert recommendations are in lined with the spirit of this sub, not completely rational but rationalist. I was surprised on last weeks thread that someone remembered and linked my comment from three years ago about self inserts. Sadly it looks like I am shadow banned off Reddit and couldn’t reply. Soon this account will be banned as well. Oh well, but here is a old thread on SV of [rationalist self inserts](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/i-am-looking-for-well-written-serious-self-insert-fanfiction.52716/) that I will try to update soon. 

    I am actively reading these consistently updated self inserts which I find very fun.

    [The Wandbearer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-wandbearer-asoiaf-si.19721/) is a Viserys Targaryen SI set in Essos after Robert Baratheon usurped the throne. It explores and melds many different magic systems that the show and books failed to do. Fairly new, but with a strong start. +1 for me since there are rarely and Viserys Targaryen self inserts in the fandom.

    [A Gamer In South Blue](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/a-gamer-in-south-blue.19722/) is a one piece self insert where the SI makes it a point not to mess with the timeline and chase after the main characters. The SI actually shows a sense of self. Typically I despise gamer Self inserts because the gamer system fandom is usually mindless wish fulfillment where the SI is OP. I commend the author for keeping power levels In check and they show how even with an OP gamer system with endless growth does not matter to the monsters in the world of One Piece.

    One of the best completed worm self insert I read in the past years is [Adversary](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/adversary-oc-si.798962/). As a lover of Self inserts this is one of the only self inserts that show the cold harsh reality of what a self insert really is. It seems like a dream manifested to existence being suddenly whisked away to a fantasy world that you know and love. However, if people relied and depended on you, your children, your aging parents, can you really live and enjoy your new life with the fact that they will forevor suffer with your sudden absence? This harsh truth can break people and I for one find it unrealistic how every self insert seems like a happy go lucky adventure without ever prodding this fact.

Alternatives include a subreddit-specific automoderator rule that deletes posts and comments by a user, actual subreddit- and reddit-wide bans (though those should be obvious), and being blocked by a user upthread (on old reddit, if the comment or a near ancestor shows as "[unavailable]") prevents you from replying, ever since they fell for the social media self-service-moderation interpretation of blocking, rather than the forum-esque classic "ignore".

I don't really know how best to describe it, black comedy with a dose of heartfelt characterization? The protagonist is mentally... unwell and hides it through making jokes, which no one laughs at. I really liked the way the author portrayed the body dysmorphia of having your face and body changing so suddenly, and how that changes you. While a lot of the protagonist's mental illnesses seem a bit played up for laughs, I found them to still be suitably authentic. Overall this is a recommendation, as long as you can get behind the way the author writes jokes.

        The protagonist becomes more of a Mary Sue, you start seeing some really dumb decisions required to force the plot along, and the central idea of the mark limiting magic and combat becomes a non-issue.

        Up to the wizard college is great, then the MC has to always win socially and the author turns it into slice of life.  I dropped around CH100.

        It's a bit light-hearted and silly in places, but I enjoy that too.

        My main problem with the story is that the MC finds a few solutions to his problem of not being able to fight normally that seem a bit OP and should be more widespread, such as lobbing flawed potions at people.  A lesser problem is that the author every now and then tries to wedge in references to modern pop culture on the sly in a way that isn't very sly.

        Other than that, if you'd enjoy YA fiction, you'll probably enjoy this.  If you're looking for something grimmer or more literary, no probably not.

  So I watched Wakanda Forever, which is just more of the same when it comes to the worldbuilding issues with Wakanda. If you had any complaints about the realism of that country, nothing much changes in the sequel so even the "they're modernizing" excuse goes out the window. 

  Do we have a good, rational-ish take on Wakanda that tries to create a more coherent explanation for the existence of this superpower? It doesn't necessarily have to be MCU.

    Here's a rational-ish take on another country with pseudo-medieval governance structures that has grown to be a regional superpower thanks to the discovery of natural resources:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_history_of_Saudi_Arabia

    They even have their very own Killmonger-ish character who engaged in violence in order to overthrow the traditional leadership and push the country towards spreading a better ideology to the world:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden

    He's kind of a badass - literally declared war on the world and did the murder hobo thing while hiding in the mountains *with his portable kidney dialysis machine.* In some sense a real life paranoid mage.

      Lol, I guess I did say outside of the MCU. 

      >on another country with pseudo-medieval governance structures

      Still a better succession system than Wakanda.

  - u/GlimmervoidG:

    I sometimes wonder if 'small secret super advanced city states' is the natural course of human development in the MCU. Wakanda isn't the only one. There's Ta Lo and many many more if we also look at the comics. 

    Maybe small dynasties of super-geniuses are the principle means of technological development. Maintaining this level of enhanced intelligence might require a small mostly  closed genetic pool (hence the isolated city states). If you try to expand out, the new blood breaks your super intelligence linages. 

    The question then becomes - why did the West advance. I'd guess there was a western secret super city state (likely in Britain) but it fell sometime around the industrial revolution and just enough technology survived the transition to set of  wider technological growth.

    The likes of Tony Stark could be atavistic call backs to these fallen intelligence linages.

    - u/chiruochiba:

      In a universe where super powers and/or super science are real but relatively rare, it's probably much easier for a cabal of powerful individuals to maintain a monopoly on violence. I'd expect oligarchies and autocracies to be the most widespread governing systems. If anything, it's surprising that democracy managed to gain any foothold in a world like that.
      ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Wakanda actually annoys me because it *could* have been a whole lot better with very, very minor world building changes. Just one, really... Democratize the use of the heart-shaped herb. 

    The *entire city* is on it. The Black Panther isn't special because of the herb, they are special because they are the greatest champion  out of a city of super-humans  (And because they, as the greatest champion that gets sent out to empress the heathens get the coolest toys). This is also why the state hasn't spread - they can only grow the herb there.

        It makes a lot of the visuals the director wanted less dumb - the high tech spear walls, for example. 
        It also very directly explains how an isolated city state has such a good economy, makes a combat challenge for the position of Black Panter not utterly stupid and makes the implied politics of Wakanda not just pointlessly Evil.

  So I'm going to recommend the recently completed [To The Far Shore](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50836/to-the-far-shore)

  In simplest terms, it's radiation death wizard does (multi) post apocalyptic Organ Trail. But that gives something of the wrong impression. This isn't a OP power fantasy or a numbers-get-bigger progression fantasy. It's something rather more subtle than that. 

  To The Far Shore is set in an *old* world. Civilisation has risen and fallen multiple times, giving birth to strange wonders and horrors both. 

  The main character Mazelton is from the ancient Ma clan, living in a eastern seaboard city in a far future American cost. Ancient in this case means they can partly remember their history up to a few apocalypses ago (exact dates aren't given but several thousand years). The clan's highest virtue is to *survive* and given their proven track record they're rather good at it.

  Mazelton is a below average core polisher in his clan (that's the radiation death wizard from above, though knowledgeable people don't consider it magic). This means he can absorb radiation from the world around him (given the multiple apocalypses , there's a lot of it) and store it inside of himself, in his core. He can then use it to create tools to project that energy in special ways, such as light, or sterilising radiation or as a bug zapper. These tools are one of the main sources of technology in the current apocalypse cycle, alongside engineered lifeforms ('greensmithing').

  In the opening chapter, Mazelton's home is destroyed by a rival faction and, doing what a good Ma does, he runs away and survives.

  This begins a cross continent journey as part of a wagon train, to reach the west coast and a large fertile area recently cleared for resettlement. Conflict is a mix of stuff straight out of the Oregon Trail game like fording rivers and avoiding dysentery, scifi hazards, science fantasy hazards (it's an old weird world) and lots of interpersonal drama in the wagon train. This last is made worse because many of the poor farmers on the train see polishers as cannibalistic radiation death wizard.

  One of the most important things in the story, though, is the *emotional complexity*. Mazelton is broken by the destruction of his home and what he needed to do to survive. He wasn't exactly emotionally healthy before either but was at least better at hiding it. The journey across the continent is, just as much, a journey of Mazelton learning to put himself back together. Sometimes well, sometimes badly but the Mazelton who reaches the end is a very different person.

  Whether it is rational is a complex question. To start with, no. Mazelton is running and reacting. But as he starts to heal, he starts to regain his agency and manipulate situations to his advantage. By that point it's at least rational adjacent.

  To anyone who has read To The Far Shore, what did you think?

  And to everyone, can you recommend some more 'old' world stories? Works that depict an Earth that has experienced true long history, rising and falling again and again. Not merely post apocalyptic or post-post apocalyptic but *old*. Other works I can think of include Dying Earth by Jack Vance and Torment: Tides of Numenera. Maybe Anathem too.
  ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    *Malazan.* It's not apparent in the first book, except in retrospect, but the setting is *old*, hundreds of thousands of years. The warrens which power sorcery have decayed and evolved over the millennia, with consequences for their traditions. Undead survivors of glacial eras were one of the emperor's trump cards. Immortals run the gauntlet from tortured to self-confident. A wizard pilots around a moon older than all of them. And given that sealing something away has historically been easier than killing it, the world has an alarming number of buried entities...
    ```

  - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
    ```
    *Fine Structure* ends up there eventually, though it's not something I'd consider the main focus of the story.

    There's elements of this in the Book of the Ancestor series, though again I wouldn't call it a central focus (and, IMO, the second series pulls back the curtain in a way that diminishes that vibe).

    The Humanity's Fire trilogy does a more galactic version of this, with several layers of history being relevant to the narrative. This one is a close fit, but I found the ending somewhat disappointing, so it's a softer rec in general.

    Magic's Dominaria plane has ended up with this as its identity since they kept doing big events there. However, I can't point out a specific story to look at, as I haven't really paid attention to the Magic story for a long time.

    I also would've sworn there's a TV Tropes entry for something like this, but the only ones I can find are single-apocalypse versions.

    ```
    A Succession of Bad Days by Grayson Saunders is set in world where wizard lords have been ruling countries for ages and their various creations have made the world basically unlivable. The protagonists are learning to be wizards that serve the state in a country called the Commonwealth that overthrew their wizard lords. It is the second book in the series but the first book isn’t needed to understand the plot of the second.
    ```

  - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
    ```
    I'll second this rec. Very well written story, with interesting world building and well-developed characters. The only down-side I'd say is that the book is done, and he author will be taking a break from the MC's story, at least for a while. 

    >And to everyone, can you recommend some more 'old' world stories?

    The Book of the New Sun series by Gene Wolfe definitely fits this bill, though it's both very much fantasy, as well as being more literary, so the tone comes across as quite different.
    ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    > To anyone who has read To The Far Shore, what did you think?

    I liked it a lot but the ending drops it quite a few notches in my view. Not a fan of that kind of closer to a story like this. It also suffers a bit from the serial format. The writer has to achieve a level of output, and editing goes out the window. 

    >!If I had been counting the times Mazelton mentions his family's motto per chapter, it would definitely be too much. Easy to forget when the story's pulling you along and it's so entertaining, but now that I'm a step removed, there's a lot about the clans and Mazelton's characterization that feels circular and repetitious in a bad way. Like the meme about the Ma's parties that gets passed around like a bad pepe by everyone for a few chapters, for example. It feels like the story starts an arc that's meant to pull Mazelton away from his generational trauma every other chapter and aborts it halfway through the next.!<

  - u/Krakenarrior:
    ```
    I want to say *The Shadow of the Torturer* by Gene Wolfe fits the bill but it’s been a while since I read it so I’m not 100% sure. 


    What I am 100% sure of is *Worlds Without Number* by Kevin Crawford fits the bill. It’s an RPG sourcebook but inside it is descriptions of a world like To The Far Shore. Very ancient- post post post apocalypse.
    ```

    - u/loltimetodie_:
      ```
      Seconding Gene Wolf's *Shadow of the Torturer*/*Book of the New Sun*. Obviously because of this recommendation you can't really go in blind, but when I did I approached it like a particularly literary fantasy novel until about half-way through when I finally put the pieces together and it blew my mind. Recontextualized so much.

      Also one of the best fantasy/sci-fi/speculative fiction novels out there period, so you can't really go wrong.

      Tacking on another recommendation - go back to the classics of the genre and check out Jack Vance's (of 'Vancian Magic' fame) *Dying Earth*. Format-wise it's more like an anthology or collection of short stories in one setting, but it basically codified the whole unimaginably-far-in-the-future, sci-fi-fantasy-confusion, sun-literally-burning-out type of setting. Plain good writer too.

      ```

      - u/GlimmervoidG:
        ```
        Also Torment: Tides of Numenera, the CRPG based on the setting. It's a good game. I name checked it in the op.

    Self-Insert: [Walk Two Lifetimes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5345492/chapters/12343022#workskin), SI into pre-canon Soul Society. A usual bit of SI jank for the first few chapters, then it really hits it's stride and becomes amazing. Warning for dying on the mother of all cliffhangers.

    [Psychopomp](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psychopomp-bleach-si.747151/) got recced a week or two ago, but I'll +1 it here. Very good, very fun. SI/OC Hollow mucking about in Hueco Mundo way before canon. First volume/book is complete, second in progress.


    Non-SI: [Now You Feel Like Number None](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/) I personally hate quests; this is the exception. Favorite Bleach fanfic bar none, featuring a Hollow protagonist, a ton of amazing action, and a super satisfying ending. Complete.


    I've got a few other mediocre ones that I'll edit onto here when I'm no longer on mobile.

      I think you mean book 7 just ended. 

      Another story like that is [Apocalypse Redux](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52873/apocalypse-redux-a-litrpg-apocalypse) is a story where the protagonist goes back in time after being the last human alive on Earth. The protagonist's goal is to make sure that humanity survives, for which he uses his future knowledge to disseminate important information early while working with researchers and politicians to set up effective laws and SOPs early enough. He also, of course, takes care of the problematic people he remembers before they can get too powerful. I'd say the writing can be a bit dull at times, but it's enjoyable enough.

    ```
    In the Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988), the antagonist does this to the Empire, to the point where the protagonist acknowledges the Empire is now a better society than the rebel alliance, and the only reason to fight him is because his successors may not be as good.
    ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    If you haven't heard of it yet, I can recommend [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/). The protagonist starts out with the clear goal of making her country more independent from the Evil Empire that conquered it, without rising up in open rebellion, which she judges to be infeasible. This goal is her driving motivation throughout most of the story.
