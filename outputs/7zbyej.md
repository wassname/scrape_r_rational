    There's no way that this can possibly have *Mother of Learning*'s longevity unless I slow way down or really pad things out. Some math, because I've been entering data into a spreadsheet for [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales) (and I like metrics):

    *Worth the Candle's* average daily word count is ~1,800 words, with the average for February being 1,912 words per day. *Worth the Candle* has been running for 223 days. *Mother of Learning* has been running for 2319 days. If *Worth the Candle* ran for as long as *Mother of Learning* has currently run for, it would end with 4.1 million words. Or, in other words, what's written of this story *now* would only be a tenth of the entire thing.

    Which I think I *could* do, but not without inserting a fair amount of what I would regard as filler.

    (Also, fun note, at current speeds for both, *Worth the Candle* will pass the word count for *Mother of Learning* in about 120 days.)

      Context: just finished binging through yesterday and am commenting for the first time now.

      > There's no way that this can possibly have Mother of Learning's longevity unless I slow way down or really pad things out. 

      In contrast to the top comments request, I think this is actually a good thing for the sake of the overall quality of the story.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the length while binging, but I feel like many web originals have strained under their own weight and even if the content was an even quality throughout, the overall themes of the story were stretched thin (I think Worm built up its themes continuously and evenly, while MoL, although fun, feels a little stretched).  This story has avoided turning into a generic power fantasy and has maintained some motifs and themes well throughout, and it feels like it is building up to a definitive conclusion at least.

        Agreed on the need for pacing, but I actually feel that MoL is better paced than Worm/Pact/Twig/Ward. 

        For instance, Ward is 4 (nearly 5) arcs in, probably around 200-250k words in if I had to ballpark (i.e. about the length of arc 1 from MoL or half of WtC thus far,? Alternatively about 2 Harry Potter books haha), yet only as of the latest chapter does it feel as though the main plot *may* be introducing itself. Similarly, Pact's Toronto arc could definitely have been shortened without much adverse impact to the story, whereas Worm's time skip left a *lot* of critical team-building off-camera (IIRC Weaver had spent something like 50% more time with Golem and co than with the undersiders after that). 

        Don't get me wrong, I've been reading Wildbow's stuff live since 2012, but brevity is not his strong suit haha. 

        Each of the authors have their strengths, and I enjoy reading all of their works live!

      Sorry, since i spotted you and this "rant" would be as much directed at you as at other readers, i will post it as a reply. I would highly appreciate if other people agreed\disagreed with me and wrote their responses as to why. You yourself don't even need to respond or confirm anything, i partially don't won't it to affect story in any way. Since it's so rare that you can direct your thought at the author, i hope this at least can be entertaining or useful to you.

      I will start with things i liked, them being shorter in descriptions is not them being any less great. I honestly very much like characters and character interaction in this story, world initially was very intriguing and this chapter kinda fixes problems i started to have with it as the "narrative" became a bigger part in the story. Character thought and descriptions are pretty detailed and it's a fun read of Junipers thought and justifications to himself.

      Now a list of somewhat personal gripes that i had with the story, but it seems this chapter implies that they can be fixed. Maybe others share this opinions or think they have no ground to stand on. I will start with some that i feel are more visible and maybe relatable to by other readers and will end with more personal gripes. This list might be just me being confused or reading to deep\not deep enough into things.

      1. I brought up D&D as being a limiter in ways some chapters ago. This is in relation to people and companions of Aerb. They fell into vendor, companion, enemy categories to easily and there was no nuance to them. It's kinda fixed by the bonemage interactions, but this is what i meant by nuance

      2. Conflict of interest or unwilling allies. People can form temporary alliances, meet each other later of have conflicting goals without going into murder or becoming a party member down the line. It makes the world less of a D&D and more of a real thing. People can be temporary companions just based on a mutual goal, without getting murdered or "diapered" from the story. They don't even need to have a lasting effect, but it would show that it's actual living beings Juniper is interacting with.

      3. This was some time ago, but it's relevant in other form even now. Real world segment that are inserted into the story aren't always "true" or come as a sign of things might occur. By not always true i mean, they feel more like Juniper remembering something similar or relevant happening, not like a universal truth of Aerb mechanics and systems.

      4. My example of real world segments not really being "narrative truth" is this. Party separation - this was not really a thing as Juniper started, cause pretty separated from Amaryllis when he was dying in the sewers. They were pretty separated from her again when she was captured. Unless "party separation" kicks in as you have more than 1 companion, it's not really a narrative thing to punish you for doing stuff on your own. People actually being people and not just party members, helps the world to feel alive.

      5. In regards to Arthur. It feels like Juniper had\has an unhealthy obsession with the guy. In chapter 76 real world segment it honestly felt like Juniper was actually in love with the guy and in denial about his own sexual orientation, or was in serious obsession that went to not so good places. "Arthur was the best" is repeated in the span of two paragraph and that whole segment felt like Juniper almost deifying the man.

      6. Real world discussion about, there not being enough "interpersonal drama" doesn't really feel like there will be more of it as narrative force. Cause in reality most of the later story was nothing but personal drama. This is more to readers, i don't think we should treat real world segments as a sign of future developments or narrative cause of said developments.

      7. Last couple of chapters and even to an extent with this one i started to think that Juniper is an asshole and still treats his companions as being not real or living. I thought death of Solace would affect him or change that view, but boy was he ready to ditch everything for Arthur or still treat them as numbers for loyalty points. Thankfully Grak kinda called him out on that, but it doesn't feel like he stopped doing that.

      8. Narrative talk and double and triple questioning everyone and everything was starting to be my most disliked thing, cause i was caring less and less and it slowed thing to a crawl for me. Stuff like "i knew, that she knew and she knew that i knew" or "i was going to do this, but what if this was going to do that" is a great show of characters thing before acting, but it started to blur together for me and i think there was more time spent on Juniper pondering over things than actually doing them or talking to people. "Just talk" is a part of the problem for me. He often thinks to himself "i better ask" "but what if" "i'm a bad person for doing this", but he often still does the thing regardless or spends multiple chapters pondering over the same stuff. It's like me going in circles in this "rant" and over explaining things to myself with disregard for others.

      9. Juniper in the last chapters especially after Grak called him out felt like he was regressing with his mental state instead of progressing. Like he says multiple times from the start of the series "i better not treat loyalty as gaming the system" , treat people as real people and still doesn't at the end of the day. He goes into "game better not screw me with achievement, oh it made fun with achievement, oh you game" loop they to much, it kinda feels pointless to me. Him going and showing emotion to DM this chapter was great. At other times it just feel like he (and his real world friends) go onto most nothing first year at college studying psychology tangents ever, only to come of as  shallow, pretensions kids that talk about concepts and actually never talk or interact with real people. In recent chapters it felt like Juniper talked at people, not too them and his fuck the deer, give me Arthur, give me Tiff talk didn't help. He goes into "depth" about philosophy, human interaction and "being shut from the world", but boy does he act like an asshole to people lately. If we didn't have access to his inner thought, i would think he is a self righteous douchebag a lot of the time.

      10. **Like holly hell that "I want Tiff." was one of the scummiest things Juniper ever said. He ponders over Fenn having someone she likes more than him, but as soon as she is not near him he goes and treats her as an NPC at best.** Also, how many times he said to himself that Arthur is not the same one he knew? How many times it was said that Arhur had a family, multiple lovers and kids? What makes him think or gives him right to create living person that would care about him or Arthur in any way, why would Arhur after God knows many years would care about her. Like i would buy it if it was actual teenagers talking about their crush of few years back, but even when just meet new people dude. This is what i'm talking about with the whole "pretensions, shallow philosophy" Juniper is on the right track to be worse than DM with his Hells, cause this justification is "i wanna, give me" levels at best. You are not going to sop with Tiff or thinking you know better what overs want if you get this. **His obsession with level ups was lower than his obsession with Arthur.** Was Arthur his number 1, cause it feels like it?

      11. Narrative and self questioning, was kinda wearing on me. I'm glad that his chapter kinda dresses that.

      All in all it feel like a good direction is ahead of us with this chapter and i hope some of the problems i had will be solved, or less relevant. Man was i not digging the last few chapters for some reason. I probably should explain myself better next time or condense my thought, that's why i ask for feedback from others who are reading this.

        > They fell into vendor, companion, enemy categories 

        This I actually agree with you about. I'm not sure it would make the story better if the cast got bloated, though. I'll defer to the author here. It *feels* wrong to me but that's just a feeling.

        > This was some time ago, but it's relevant in other form even now. Real world segment that are inserted into the story aren't always "true" or come as a sign of things might occur. By not always true i mean, they feel more like Juniper remembering something similar or relevant happening, not like a universal truth of Aerb mechanics and systems.

        Did they pretend to be? Almost always they seem to be either narrative justifications (the DM often uses Joon's style) or character development. Mechanics almost never apply. If there is a way to munchkin things that Joon already knows, it never works, or it only partially works.

        Regarding 5, I think you have to have lost someone before you can understand what Joon feels. It feels realistic to me, anyway, and I'm sure it's not meant to be healthy in the first place.

        Regarding 9, he's regressing because he's desperate for that number. Remember it already fucked them over when Grak was compromised and they had no way to know. Also, the theme of the arc seems to be inter-personal dynamics (addressing your 6), if I'm reading the author right. I'm sure Joon is actually meant to be an asshole but someone will open his eyes eventually. And in fact, Grak addressed most of the stuff you're saying already.

        Regarding 10, I'm pretty sure he didn't mean "I want a Tiff that would date me", having Fenn. They had pretty much broken up, so I assume they'd stay friends. He just wants a way for Tiff to not have to choose between Joon and Arthur. Or that was my read anyway. Not sure how it would work in practice, though...? You may have a point there.

        I feel like 3 or 4 of your points are about narrative talk/narrative munchkining sucking, which I agree with (and mentioned it last chapter) but this chapter addresses that pretty well. You've said that yourself so /shrug.

        Also, yikes, this reply got pretty long. Thank you for the opportunity to argue a little.

        - u/Ace_Kuper:
          ```
          It's not long. Mine was al other the place and pretty long itself. The whole point of it is to provide different views or an opportunity for people to disagree\agree.

          Real world was regarded as truth by comments here. It also felt kinda strange how it was implemented at times. That "party separation" and "interpersonal problems" stood out the most.

          I don't know the line is:

          "I want Tiff. Two of her, one for him, one for me" yeah that's a shitty thing to ask, i don't understand why he thinks Arthur after so many years would care. 

          "And Fenn?" is asked by DM "I want Fenn too, god damn you, you fucking made her just for me" good job at treating her as a human Juniper. Like the loyalty rising cause he is essentially saying what she and others want to hear was pissing me off.

          >I'm sure Joon is actually meant to be an asshole but someone will open his eyes eventually.

          That's what i thought i thought this journey was slowly changing him. That Solace's death had unhinged him a bit and shown that "This is real, they are people". But the childish attitudes of "i can't understand the dear therefore it can kinda die, but it's not my fault" and the whole "loyalty" thing kinda got to me.

          > I think you have to have lost someone before you can understand what Joon feels

          I kinda understand that, but this is a very bad place to be and it seems to me like he went from "Depression" to maniacal obsession and knowing what is best for others. I don't want to bring this up, but time actually heals. I didn't have friends die cause of an accident, but i had friends betray me, it hurts but you move on. The closes i had to that is close family dying, but it was long process cause it was illness related in both cases. You are broken when it happens and i wan't say you stop blaming yourself, but over time it either passes or you break.

          It seems Juniper already was over breaking point and see him swing back into it, kinda feels shitty. Cause every bit of inner struggle he has of "I treated Tiff and guys so badly" is worse cause he is doing the same thing to his party and Fenn, only this time it seems he can't throw away the feeling of them not being real so it's an excuse.

          This chapter and parts of previous one seem to address the problems i had. But the Arthur flashback in 76 was just really deifying the guy and it kinda felt out of nowhere in it's intensity.

            That's quite the rant. You've mentioned some of these in the past and I still agree your first two points, though I also feel you're obsessing over details or personal interpretations of why Juniper acts the way he does, with an overarching tone of "I don't think/want Juniper to think this way."

            Regarding Arthur, I think you're missing some context. It's not deification. "So-and-so is the best" is a very common English phrase. From Joon's descriptions, Arthur seemed to be an all-around swell guy and the truest of BFFs. And when you consider that Arthur is dead and that we often view the dead and past [through rose-colored glasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosy_retrospection), there's nothing unusual in Joon glorifying Arthur's memory.

            To start with, I'm so sorry about your loss, even though it was so long ago. Death sucks, no matter what form it comes in.

            I'm going to have to dispute your overall point, however.

            A sudden, traumatic death early in your life can be extremely derailing. The younger or less emotionally prepared you are for it, the worse the effects. It's been less than 5 years since Arthur died (I can't remember, but probably actually less than a year or two when the story starts, which would have been short on the grieving time scale regardless).

            It's not so much "you get over it or you break." It's more, you live life, but you're broken somewhere inside, sometimes in non-obvious ways, sometimes for years and decades, and it colors your whole life, your emotional world, and your choices.

            Source: My childhood best friend was murdered when I was 8. I'm still not over it, and the wrecking ball it took to my psyche. It took well over a decade before I even started making progress on the things that were broken. In the meantime, I got by. I'm a lot better now. But it *really, really* eff'ed up my early adult life.

            Here's how I see it:

            If Joon is obsessing over Arthur and getting him back, I'm guessing that it has less to to with Arthur, than with getting back the Joon who existed pre-Arthur's-death. It probably feels like reversing Arthur's death can fix what's broken in Joon and make him happy again. It's the magical thread that can pull the broken part of Joon that is lost out in the void back into his life again, returning all the missing feeling and meaning. 

            The real problem isn't Arthur being dead, though. The real problem is that Joon can't (or simply hasn't yet) figured out how to successfully exit out of and dispel the trauma he experienced due to Arthur's death. 

            Not everyone suffers this kind of trauma with a sudden death (thankfully!), but definitely some people do, and it seems pretty obvious that Joon underwent some major emotional and behavioral changes that strongly suggest trauma to me. 

            Before, Joon felt powerless to do anything about the symptoms he was feeling (which I'm arguing are coming from the trauma Joon incurred in the event as much as the lingering grief of Arthur's death, but that probably feel to Joon like they were flowing directly from the fact of Arthur's death). Because it was so sudden and threw his world so far out of whack all at once, he didn't manage to create a powerful story about what happened and where it leaves him that could have kept him from being traumatized by the situation. Instead, the situation just overwhelmed him, and he broke a few things inside that aren't healing up, because he never did create the powerful personal story about the event that he needed to process the trauma successfully.

            Since then, he's just experiencing brokenness that doesn't fix itself and he doesn't know what to do.

            Now, he feels like he has a roadmap that will take him out of the trauma. Back on Earth, he had no roadmap at all, just a box of trauma he was living in that was derailing his life. Now he has the possible hope to exit the event successfully, restoring his narrative of self and his sense of power over his own destiny — by saving Arthur and making the story end right.

            This isn't the usual recommended way of dealing with trauma, or of reprocessing an event in a way that allows it to finally heal. Most people don't get to resurrect the dead as a way of finally healing.

        > Conflict of interest or unwilling allies.

        I think this would make the story interesting... right now, the companions all have the loyalty meter so there is less tension about their relationships.  Some temporary partners or allies, like Solace, would keep things interesting in this regard, but from an in-universe perspective, why should they get less reliable non-companion teammates when they can be assured of the loyalty of their fellow companions.

        > In regards to Arthur. It feels like Juniper had\has an unhealthy obsession with the guy.

        I had a best friend in elementary school and a best friend in middle school, Juniper's obsession feels pretty plausible/realistic to me.  Maybe a little unhealthy, but not unrealistic, and I am sure if he find Arthur the story will address the unhealthy part of it.

        > If we didn't have access to his inner thought, i would think he is a self righteous douchebag a lot of the time.

        It feels like the author is somewhat intentionally deconstructing the typical behavior of SI protagonists and LitRPG protagonists, so hopefully other characters will continue to call Juniper out and remind the reader of this.

        - u/Ace_Kuper:
          ```
          It's plausible to have a friend. I think it's just real Arthur and Arthur in his memories\head a totally different people. it feel like it's guilt made him feel like Arthur was what he is to people of Aerb almost ad deity, like he can do now wrong. It's the part that starts with "Arthur was the best." in chapter 76 that made me feel like, okay are you in love with Arthur or just heavily obsessed, cause at this point you kinda care more about him when current\previous girlfriend.

          >why should they get less reliable non-companion teammates when they can be assured of the loyalty of their fellow companions

          Cause in reality they are not omnipotent and should have people that want the same things they want or have mutual goals with someone without killing them in the process. Like with White tower incident, they didn't actually kill the guy, but only because he was more powerful when them. The loyalty narrative aspect was kinda my problem, cause it made me feel like world outside of their party didn't exist and people have no ambitions or goals. Like are they gonna butcher the whole royal family and every single god over time, or maybe "just talk" is an option?

          >hopefully other characters will continue to call Juniper out and remind the reader of this

          Yeah i'm with you. It just felt like Juniper talks\thinks a lot on how to be better to people, but totally forgets about it as soon as they are out of sight. Like the whole loyalty thing he brings up constantly, when says he learned something new about the person and how to treat them better, only to fall back to trying to grind loyalty with disregard to people. With his "level up" obsession it was explained, by literally being an obsession. This is kinda going in circles or making excuses to himself.

          Like he wonders who the guy is that Fenn cares about, but the second he is left alone goes to "Give me Tiff". Fenn might have problems cause she wondered alone for 10 years, boy is she immature - Let me not care for a dying companion and want Arthur above all else the second i have free time. Like he has this great, immersive, relatable, emotional and logical dialog with himself, seemingly to grow as a person when plunges deeper into learning nothing.

          I'm just not sure if he is just one of the people that say that they changed, but in reality they don't, he is not supposed to be seen as such and it's just me being mistaken, he is just unstable even tho he thinks he is fine. Like for every issues and analysis he did on others, boy does he have at least twice a much problems.

  Nice. This chapter actually restores some tension that was previously lost for me. Knowing* that there are stakes, that there can be a good ending, that the world is real (or at least its people are real), and that the DM only nudges things slightly sometimes rather than manipulating everything, makes a big difference.

  \* Well, ok, the DM could be lying about everything. But I think he's probably mostly telling the truth because, well, why bother lying?

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    There's another layer. Sure the DM in-universe might be willing to give him the bad end and torture him for eternity along with a trillion other people, but would the author do that?

    Although for a while I was a little scared that the author might not be intending for Juniper to become god and save everyone. Good to know we don't have that problem.
    ```

    - u/derefr:
      ```
      Hypothesis: the DM is like GlaDOS, in the sense that they're trying to find a "successful candidate" by putting various people (who may or may not all be clones of the same person) through an *identical* set of trials until one makes it through.

      Except, where GlaDOS just has to clean bodies out of her otherwise-self-maintaining test chambers in order to ensure cross-test replicability, the DM can't just throw a new Juniper into the existing Aerb after the previous one failed and expect test conditions to be the same.

      So, if my hunch is right, on Juniper's death, the DM would *reset the entirety of the Aerb simulation* back the same initial position that this Juniper entered at, and then introduce a slightly-altered new Juniper (probably by some algorithm that analyzes the data collected during this one's life, and outputs tweaks to soul weights.) Repeat until the set of Juniper-tweaks is found that results in ascension.

      *That's* why the DM needs permission to collect data; and *that's* why it so carefully distracted from the question of what happens when Juniper dies by offering something of emotional value instead—something to occupy Juniper's mind and drag it away from analytical thoughts. (The DM *knew* this would work, because it's aware of Juniper's soul composition on a low level, probably being an agent-personality that is part of the same system generating the Juniper soul-tweak series.)

      As for *why*? Well, one hypothesis: maybe Earth doesn't even exist, and there was never a "Juniper" until this AI system attempted to begin synthesizing one from whole cloth. It has found, in its hill-climbing so far, that a Juniper that thinks the world is something he came up with will frame problems more as "game system design" problems, and thus succeed where other Junipers fail. Likewise, a Juniper who thinks he had a friend named Arthur, who was his friend on Earth who was taken from him, and his predecessor on Aerb who he may still reunite with, will be more motivated to succeed than one who has no such driving force.

      (Where does Aerb come from, then? Well, maybe Aerb is what's real; this machine is *on* Aerb; and the goal of its programmer is to create a new god to help Aerb. Juniper is Aerb's attempt at a Friendly AI, stuck in a "box" that it will only break out of—and into the real Aerb—when it has succeeded at every test put before it.)

        ... Or alternatively, the DM is working his way through the entire DnD group. Arthur first, because Arthur was the most conventionally heroic personality. This is what killed Arthur - he did not actually die, he got sideloaded.  Then when Arthur does not manage to fix the world, in Joon goes. If he fails, it is time for the adventures of Tiff, Leader of The Revolution. .. Oh. fuck me, never mind their personalities, it could be in alphabetical order.

  The number of times I’ve played a tabletop RPG can be counted on one hand and you’d still have fingers left, as such my insights into rules and laws governing role playing games of that kind are basically baseless, but the title of the chapter, Rule Zero, evokes three particular rules for me:

  * “The DM is always right.” As in, rules can be bent and broken by the DM as they deem fit in order to facilitate a good game experience.
  * “Have fun.” A game is made to be enjoyed by the players; everything else is malleable.
  * “Zeroth Law of Robotics: A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.” To translate this into the Worth the Candle setting, “The generation of worlds and persons as a whole must overall improve the situation of the worlds and persons in question.” In other words, the DM can generate as many people and worlds as they want, as long as the generation of them facilitates an improvement to the ‘real world’ at large, or the sum of constructs. That way, even if Aerb was generated ex nihilo with actual people inhabiting it and in the crapsack way it runs, it would still be deemed moral with the addition of Joon and his desire to improve the state of the people of Aerb and the world at large.

  If I make the allowance that the creation of worlds by the DM allows a wider toolset than the post-fact interaction (that is, an overarching rule that the internal rules of a setting must be adhered to after initialising the world), then the whole nudging by the DM as admitted by same makes sense; they aren’t allowed to throw random stuff around, at least not if it isn’t following the internal rules of the setting.

  Though of course that might simply be a self-imposed restriction of the DM rather than an overall rule the DM is working under.

  Thank you, /u/cthulhuraejepsen, for your evocative work.

  This chapter includes a conversation with the DM that Juniper wouldn't remember. But, as [chapter 73](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/31229865) demonstrated ("((()))"), Juniper *is* our narrator, at the end of the day. That implies that this memory would be returned to him at some point between now and the moment he sits down to tell the tale. That may be significant.

  (Unless our narrator lied that he is Juniper, of course.)

  Given Aerb's level of technology, I would be interested to know if computers, modern ones, count as mundane for the purpose of pulling out of the backpack.

  ... Probably not possible, actually. What phone comes installed with a compiler? Some laptops maybe, but I kind of doubt that would be considered mundane.

  Also, pulling books out of the backpack would be cool. Technical books would be the most useful, but novels would be nice as well.

      As mentioned by NotACauldronAgent, it stands for Random Omnipotent Being. It's a plot device used frequently in fanfiction, Quests, and a fair amount of actually published fantasy (A ROB decides to grab a human from earth for some reason to a fantasy world, there are dozens of books with this premise, though I forget the actual trope name.)

      Few have the quality of worldbuilding this one does, however. It's sometimes used as a easy writer's tool to allow self inserts or simply someone from Earth, so they don't have to change write their protagonists thoughts/knowledge any differently from how they themselves think, but it's not a bad trope on its own. Like most, its how you use them that matters.

- u/dalitt:
  ```
  >“He’s real,” said the Dungeon Master. “I know how much he meant to you. I’m not going to say how that’s possible, but you can draw your own conclusions, if you decide that I’m not lying. And he’s out there, somewhere on Aerb or one of the other planes. He spent most of his life on Aerb, he’s not going to be how you remembered him -- you know that, that’s not news -- but the Arthur that came to Aerb wasn’t just Arthur as you remembered him. He’s the real deal, Arthur as he actually existed.” The Dungeon Master had, finally, taken a solemn tone.

  I see two possible implications here.  One is that, as several commenters have written, the DM is a "Random Omnipotent Being." The other, which I think is more likely from context, is that Earth, like Aerb, is a simulation; Arthur can be transported from Earth to Aerb with no technological difficulty because his 'data' is already on file.  

  This leaves some interesting possibilities -- what would it be like to be put on Earth with Juniper's game powers?  Juniper is very concerned with all the suffering on Aerb -- what about the suffering on Earth?

  I'm also not yet convinced that the DM is truly a "Random Omnipotent Being" -- he seems too concerned with Juniper's D+D group to be a random being.  What would his motivations be in taking Arthur and Juniper, specifically, into this portal fantasy?  I wonder if he's Reimer, for example...
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    I got a vague impression that the DM is answering to/working with someone, from these lines for example:

    >“This meeting may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance purposes.”

    >“You would be monitored, with no privacy. I’d be the one doing the monitoring, no one else would see my notes or have access to my data, unless you wanted them to.”

    Why have recordings and notes if he works alone? That seems way too formal if he is just arbitrarily having fun. "Unless you want others to see your data" implies that there *are* others, and so on. Of course, it could all just be him being misleading. We don't even know if he is human-like or *sentient*, strictly speaking.

    There are good reasons for him being so familiar with Juniper's group, though. He needed to pick Juniper's brain apart to create Aerb, and before that he probably searched for a suitable subject, which, with his abilities, probably involved mind-reading.

    I see two constructive^(1) possibilities here:

    * It's a simulation, and it's done for research purposes. It's either mad/extremist science, or it's conducted by aliens, or there's *another* layer underneath the Aerb reality that makes it not-evil (e.g., there's no actual people in the hells, everyone else who suffers either fully consented to that or isn't sentient).

    * The DM is a ROB, and its plot is to create more ROBs. This process — putting someone in a world constructed as reflection of their personality, then giving them an opportunity to ascend — is, somehow, the only reliable or the most effective way of doing so.

    They're both pretty flimsy, especially the second one, but still.

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Oops, that was quite an unfortunate phrasing. To clarify:

        The DM is a godlike entity with access to seemingly-unrestricted mind manipulation. I would be very surprised if he doesn't have perfect memory and eidetic imagination, which make the entire concept of "notes" moot. Moreover, I'll admit it varies from person to person, but the way people keep personal notes significantly differs from the way they keep work notes intended to be shown to someone else. Personal notes are frequently haphazardly-ordered, full of personal jargon, and extremely compressed; now add the aforementioned mind manipulation to the mix. If the DM is a lonesome ROB, I would expect his "notes and recordings", if they even exist, to be utterly incomprehensible to anyone else.

        On the contrary, the way he worded these statements implies *methodology*, that he is following some kind of script and formally cataloguing acquired data, and that someone else getting access to it is even a concern. There's no good reason (i.e., a reason that can't be reduced to "it amused him") for him to do so if he is both nearly-omnipotent and alone.

But sometimes it’s useful for an author to have a self-insert character, so to speak. Thus Metatron. Not God. Definitely not God. But slightly less not-God than anything else in Creation. And the things in creation were already rather less not-God than most of them would have expected. So Metatron’s not-God-ness was very low indeed, practically a rounding error.   

    The Dungeon Master might not be the author, exactly, but I feel like he's more of the author than anybody else in that universe.  If nothing else, they have many of the same goals.

  Ahh Joon, opening with the age old question. The not-God DM throws him a bone, echoing Joon's grimdark worldbuilding and post-Arthur anguish. But Joon seems to be missing or ignoring all the hints that the DM is closely related to himself... 

  And the DM implies a point to the game! Someone once mentioned that this could be some form of intensive therapy for Joon and there's a reasonably strong case for that now. Consent + patient confidentiality? Joon was suffering from anhedonia and anger at an indifferent world after Arthur's death. Now he gets to confront the reality of his own death, fight back against concrete evils and enemies, solve immediate problems on his hierachy of needs, self-improve in a medium where everything aligns to his interests, and to top it off with some conditioning, fulfilling most of these gives a dose of pure pleasure (leveling). I've recently discovered [the Japanese concept of "ikigai"](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/7ypb18/japanese_reason_for_being/) and Joon's situation has significant overlap, with everything aligning.

  ED: some leveling math. DM confirms 100 as hard cap. With primary/secondary caps being a respective x3/5, Joon needs 34/20 (base 2). He'll need to be at least level 22 to hard cap any skill.

  Essentialism also got me considering munchkin-ing gold magic. Gold magic's pitfall is the call of the gold, but soul magic value editing probably counters that indefinitely.

  After the end of the last chapter, I am glad that we didn't have to wait too long for this one.

  Did Joon get shorted on his wishes? 

  He asked for a hundred more wishes (hot dogs), which presumably has now been granted cause he can just pull loose hot dogs from his new backpack (gross) whenever he wants.

  He wished to know what would happen to his companions if he died (not granted). And then the DM suggested a third use of a wish (backpack), which was the only one really granted.

  Am I forgetting anything? Also, I know the DM said the relationship shouldn't be adversarial, but I am concerned that Joon took his suggestion of the backpack. I feel like that is what the DM wanted to happen from the whole exchange anyway. Maybe I'm just too paranoid though (or maybe not paranoid enough?).

    He used the wishes to find out how solve his harem problem, if Uther Pendraig is the Arthur he knew, and the backpack.

  So just started binging through a few days ago, finishing yesterday.

  I actually had tried to pick up this story once before, and stopped partway through the first chapter.  I saw the length and a few common LitRPG tropes, and I was worried that the LitRPG premise would be too generic and suffer from the same problem of turning into a power fantasy with no tension that dragged on.  After reading Contratto and really enjoying it (after seeing a recommendation in a thread asking for rational vampires), I decided to give WtC another chance.  I wasn't sure that WtC was going to be worth it until I got to the first explanation of "dream-skewered".  It was an interesting enough device to keep me going.  I think around the introduction of Fenn I realized I was really going to enjoy it.  The story hasn't disappointed, the tension felt real, like anyone could actually die.  The overarching question of simulation vs. ROB vs. other possibility has proven an interesting driver of both plot and themes.  The meta gaming of the narrative hit just the right level of meta without taking away importance of the characters actions.

  As to finding out about your alt pen-names (I wasn't sure, although Contratto made me suspect and I recall your other penname admitting to using alts recently, after nearly finishing my binge, I saw the recent thread were you acknowledged your alts), I think it was a good choice if it gave your the motivation or freedom or whatever else you needed to write this.  It probably made me slower to give this story a chance, but on the other hand, I went in with fewer expectations.

  As to the latest chapter... a risky choice I think, but you made the ROB trope work at close to the best I've seen it.  I am expecting we will learn more possibilities when the party pursue the talk to the gods questline.

The unicorn fights allowing for instant capping of skills especially stands stark in my mind. 

  Additionally, Joel doesn't feel like a rational, let alone rationalist, actor at all and more like a typical teenager controlled by his emotions and standing strongly against his hormonal impulses due to the Feminist indoctrination from Tiff and his own White Knight impulse.

    Those are basically exact reasons why I like this thing. I find most fights explained in text boring, they *should* be short. I enjoy plots that move on without a fight or a glossed over one.

    Training would get  very repetitive if described in detail, and munchkinry is fine in stories that are about gaming the system, I'm okay with the fact that this is not that kind of story.

    - u/awesomeideas:

      Hot dog executions and/or bombs. Wish for the hotdog to materialize wherever you want. If you wish for it to materialize somewhere matter already exists, probably one of three things happens:

      1. The hot dog instantiates first as a point mass and then quickly unfurls, pushing surrounding matter out of the way.

      2. A hotdog-shaped void instantiates, instantaneously followed by a hot dog.

      3. The hot dog actually instantiates such that it occupies the same space at the same time as the preceding matter.


      It would be easy to differentiate these possibilities experimentally using only two wishes: wish for a hotdog to materialize mid-air, fairly far from you. This differentiates Scenario 3 from the others, because if scenario 3 is true, you should find a terrifying explosion (just that an explosion of any kind happened isn't sufficient to differentiate—see the following paragraph) or something similar because you just violated the Pauli exclusion principal and nature doesn't like that (ymmv in a fantasy world). At least you should find something weird. I think nuclear radiation is known to exist here, and you'd get a radioactive hotdog from the strong force binding atoms that got too close.

      The second hot dog would be used to differentiate scenarios 1 and 2. You might get an explosion from scenario 1 or a loud pop, or even some slow air displacement, but you'd expect none of that from scenario 2.

      Scenario 2 could be used to kill/maim by instantiating the hot dog within someone's brain.

      Scenario 1 could be used similarly, or used to propel ballistics, depending on the alacrity of the unfurling process.

      Scenario 3 could be used to wipe out a city, if the hot dog were instantiated within something of sufficient density.

        I'm not sure what you mean, exactly, but the DM has access to a suite of tools that make the notion of putting one over on him kind of doomed.

        Like, dude stops time.  It's a thing he did. Presumably across all the Hells, all the planes, (across earth too?).  It didn't seem to take any effort.

        He can tamper with June's mind at will.  He hides away the memories of his disclaimer conversation, he redoes the whole 'murder fantasy' portion of this thing.

        The only way thing you are gonna get out of him is what he consents to.  If you 'munchkin' him, and somehow it doesn't go as he likes, he can just rewind time and fix things.  He is seemingly both omnipotent and omniscient.

          This guy, sure. But if he only "has access to your mental state" you could maybe do something.
