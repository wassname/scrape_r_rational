## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Suppose you have a character John that has an inborn ability to time travel by just thinking about when he wants to go back to and has grown up always able to fix his mistakes. 

  No time limits. No travel count limits. Sends his mind back to his younger body. Cannot go forward. If he dies, it's permanent. 

  Let's not make John rational/ist because such a character would have infinite time to think and it's going to be as hard to predict as AGI, but this time the FOOM period is 0 seconds. Instead we have Alice who John talks to. Since John can simply rewind time if he screws up, he has no fears about confiding his ability to Alice (even though it could actually be dangerous. Think how Zach in MOL talked with everyone). Alice does some quick tests and finds that John does indeed  have this ability. Alice realises major implications of this but must tread carefully, because it is all to easy for John to back out in an instant.

  You are Alice. What are your objectives and how do you achieve them?

  Eg:  
  a) You are convinced that it's a terrible ethical problem for John to exist, so you must find a way to kill him and you cannot afford any chance of failure.  
  b) You would benefit greatly from exploiting his abilities, but so would anyone else. How do you convince him you're more important, trustworthy, etc?

  EDIT: added details to the ability. Elaborated on the task.

    He can time travel or he can send his present mind back into his past body? Can he go to the future?   
    Cause I think that is important.  


    I would convince him to have a child (not sure if with me, cause giving birth sucks) or better more children. And to let his ability be tested. Try to find the mechanism. (And steal it for myself.\^\^ And some decades later give as many as possible that power. )  


    Other than that, try to make him smarter, and teach him to think before acting. Also give him the reflex to go back in time (1hr or some days), if he panics/gets threatened. Assuming he is a decent human being.  


    Next get some money via betting and lotteries then invest it (in the past). Start an organization that influence the world for him/me/us. (They get told they work for aliens with a predictive algorithm or some other bullshit.)  


    Now no clue what technology he could jumpstart. But whatever he does, he should tell his organization, which would give the knowledge to someone else. Let's start with internet and rockets. Maybe cheap food or cloned meat.   


    And whenever a war breaks out send the organization some years before out for non-violent activism and peace propaganda. (Depending what the cause and reason for the war is. Maybe send assassins.)  


    Of course in RL I would tell John to go back in time and kill himself, so we/he can find out what happens.
