  Heh. If you're interested in fictional investment opportunities, I recommend Julian Gough's [The Great Hargeisa Goat Bubble](http://www.juliangough.com/the-great-hargeisa-goat-bubble/), which is even more hilarious.

  I'd really like to play a tycoon game based on this.  Investing in land you don't own, creating contracts for murder hobo squads, and investing in the talents of up and coming murder hobos.

    Have you ever heard of Lords of Waterdeep? It's not a tycoon game, but rather a worker-placement board game where you recruit adventurers to go on quests for you in order to increase your own influence and wealth.

      Yeah, I have.  It's a good worker placement game, but the theme is really only delivered as flavor text on quest cards. (A common weakness of American board games I guess.)

  Suddenly, I *really* want to get a D&D game together.  If only I weren't on a separate continent from every gamer I know. :/

    I would sell someone else's soul to have a dnd game with you. Even to just watch.

  A game called Darkest Dungeon is vaguely like this. You use expendable adventurers to rebuild your town and manor, and only pay out for their entertainment and refreshment costs. There's not even death insurance or worker's compensation!
