## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  If anyone has watched [Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi / Erased](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi) anime, highly recommended. Its about a guy that's blessed/cursed with the ability to go back in time and is forced to stop bad events from happening.

  He is chased by a serial killer from an unsolved crime of his past and he must travel back and figure a way to stop him. I enjoyed the protagonist as he takes a head on approach to solve the problem without falling into needless angst, the characters feel somewhat human (besides some small cases which may or may not have a reason to be) and I enjoy how the author has the protagonist gather clues and piece things together in a logical progression.

  Also got some really nice music and the cinema approach to several scenes.

    it was nice, and I even mentioned it here a while ago, but the story turned on worst side.
    Not that it was too surprising, seeing as it was obvious where it was going. 
    But it was still unfortunate that it ended up aiming so low. [recent episodes](#s "it has fallen into the worst possible thriller tropes, from a guy running away from a murder scene, to having high ranking officials involved, to perfect framing of innocent people. and continues with Diabolus ex Machina etc.")

    And that is really unfortunate, because the parts where the story was actually trying it managed to convey emotions and immerse very will.
    But instead of going for those strong points its just going on with cheap writing tricks to produce forced tension. Which makes all the clues scattered in the series uninteresting because it is obvious the entire point is to go for twists, so the author has no reason to make it "solvable".

  I just realized The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is prime fodder for a ratfic. Canon is Link goes to this island, finds out it's the dream of a giant fish (organic simulation), then naturally decides he has to wake up the fish, in so doing killing the many sapient inhabitants of its dream.

  He doesn't think twice before doing this, because he is Link.

  But I wonder how it would have gone if he had.

      Hmm I could definitely see myself doing this, if I can allow myself to postpone the star wars rationalization project I was working on.˅

      One of the big challenges I can see is coming up with a thoughtful link, when sociopathic Links seem to be an immutable rule of the Legendary Hero reincarnation process. Sure, their mission may be good and they're very bishi, but every one of them kills and steals like it's nothing.

      ˅: basically, an attempt to account for the star wars universe's defining characteristics (droids, no internet, not much science, no AI, no immortality, mixing of alien species with similar levels of development and augmentation, *all of which is totally bizarre from a futurist standpoint*), rather than the ridiculous stuff like Jedis, The Force (although there will be features comparable to that), The Evil Empire, which isn't all that interesting IMO. Though, TBH, if a reader finds those aspects of canon interesting it is probably easier than you'd think to convey that interest to me. Before proceeding to do so, please consider the weight of the problem constraints I have already taken on, any more just might break my back :p

        I think Link's awakening was my first proper encounter with a game telling me I was a hero... and then getting me to actually commit genocide and letting me realize it.

        by all accounts link is a monster and the villains are heroes in that game.

        The ending of that game had me in tears.

        It also had some other good features... like if you stole form a shop keeper you would be renamed thief in the game save file and the shop keeper would murder you next time you show up.
        ```

        - u/makoConstruct:
          ```
          The ending had me in tears *today*. Though I don't remember it meaning much to me when I finished it when I was like 11. I guess the fact that my friend beat my copy before me might have depersonalized the experience a bit. Or maybe I just hadn't made enough sense of the world for anything to mean much to me.

          The wind fish sure was happy for the dream to end. Maybe it was the monster. The utility monster, who's needs outweighed the needs of its projections. I imagine that's possible, for some variations of utilitarianism.

            My traditional internalization of 'the dream ends' scenarios is in the style of Nyarlathotep, in that, all the identities that are wiped out when the dreamer wakes up are, by that nature, the identity of the dreamer filtered through a particular mask. When the dreamer awakens, their memories and identities aren't lost, just subsumed into the waking ones.
            ```

            - u/makoConstruct:
              ```
              I like that line of thought, but I think you might be overlooking something. The values of the dreamer do not need to align with those of the projections at all. If an AGI subsumes your memories and uses them how it pleases to pursue goals orthogonal or antagonistic to yours, that is not survival, it's arguably even worse than total erasure.
              ```

              - u/makoConstruct:
                ```
                Hang on, does this mean that all a dreamer has to do to commit murder is to imagine very clearly someone who's aesthetic diverges from their own in some coherent way, simulate them for a bit, then stop thinking about them?

                  Depending in where one draws the line, perhaps even switching social modes, when changing from interacting with one group to another, could be considered a sort of extinction of identity, and thus 'murder.'
                  ```

                    ```
                    And perhaps watering down the concept of "murder" so that it doesn't involve actually killing anyone is a *bit* silly.
                    ```

                    - u/Aabcehmu112358:
                      ```
                      That was my point with that hypothetical, though I can see how that might be unclear.
                      ```

                I guess subsume might not be exactly the right concept.

                If I were a facade of an AGI, I don't if "Is it in my interest for the AGI to drop the facade" is even a coherent question.

                In this specific instance, I am assuming that, depth of the NPCs identities is insufficient for them to be considered more than facades through which the wind fish can interact with his subconscious and Link.

                  > If I were a facade of an AGI, I don't if(think?) "Is it in my interest for the AGI to drop the facade" is even a coherent question.

                  Why not? I suppose that any strong intelligence would have protections against child processes harming their hosts, you and I, for instance, may find such things difficult to conceive of because early social apes who found recursive processes hostile to their hosts easy to conceive of were all castrated by them, as they imagined too vividly what their rivals might want to do if they realized they could have been a mental process being emulated by their own rivals in turn. It doesn't seem like there'd be any advantages, anyway.

                  But if you look at cruder information processing systems like modern computers, child computations subverting their hosts is a common occurrence. My thought is, it looks quite a bit like the wind fish's dreaming capacity is probably just that crude. It clearly is already running malicious processes, for one thing. For another, the wind fish doesn't really look like something that would have been born entirely of evolution, that would necessarily have protections, it looks like a one-off. The fact that it's wearing clothes strongly suggests that its people have technology (which, in hyrule, includes magic), it may have been born of some kind of spell, and its capacity to dream does seem to transcend its individual intelligence, as if it were just bolted on after the fact, it's plausible that it wouldn't have the ability to instate any of the required limits on resource consumption or secure a sandboxing perimiter around its agent-models.

                  I am kind of disappointed to find this quote, though: Owl: "But one day, the Nightmares entered the dream and began wreaking havoc" Entered. Like they didn't emerge there. It's possible the owl is wrong, but, unexplained incursion of mysterious dark forces would fit the pattern of the series =__=

                    ```
                    Well, Link is also a foreign body (albeit a rather exceptional one), so it's clear that being in the right situation and possessed of the right power can enter the wind fish's dream.

                    Anyway, you have a good point. It is rather untenable that the NPCs are fully intelligent and aligned with the wind fish. Is the opposite possibility valid, though.

                    Perhaps the models are simple enough to not be of significant moral weight?

      Not really. [We can tell he speaks here](https://youtu.be/xmfUW9m9fuU?t=2m18s) (he calls marin "zelda"), even if it isn't depicted directly.

      > how is he to rant about his solutions

      True enough, he doesn't seem the kind of exhibitionist to go off on long monologues explaining how clever he is. But it'd be kind of interesting, and probably truer to the medium to depict his mental process directly instead, I don't think that's a problem.

      >and Zelda is the "wisdom" triforce piece

      I think there's a difference between wisdom and wit, or general intelligence. Aside from that, problem solving skills shouldn't be seen as a special magical endowment that can't be learned.

  You know how the Evil Overlord list says that you should run all Ingenious Plans past a five-year-old advisor first?  The older I get, the more I realize *everything* should be done like that.  It stops bullshit ideologies, sublimated feelings of impotence and resentment, and passive acceptance of the status quo getting in the way.

    There's a lot of good advice there, and some it is applicable to non-evil non-overlords:

    > - When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their advice.

    > - I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look diabolic. Now they just make you look like a disaffected member of Generation X.

    > - My five-year-old child advisor will also be asked to decipher any code I am thinking of using. If he breaks the code in under 30 seconds, it will not be used. Note: this also applies to passwords.

    > - I will see a competent psychiatrist and get cured of all extremely unusual phobias and bizarre compulsive habits which could prove to be a disadvantage.

    > - If my advisors ask "Why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme?", I will not proceed until I have a response that satisfies them.

    > - My main computers will have their own special operating system that will be completely incompatible with standard IBM and Macintosh powerbooks.

    > - If a group fails miserably at a task, I will not berate them for incompetence then send the same group out to try the task again.

    > - I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.

  Point of note for people who have depression. I have been keeping a diary of good/bad feelings and or situations, as a means of tracking problems, having better recall to events and something to talk about with my therapist. Granted I haven't vent to therapy in a long while, but once I do i will have a lot to tell. 

  This was purely by accident though.

  I originally started the diary to keep munchkin and rational ideas for real life and a certain fiction. Then one day I just wrote down: 

  13.09 - Increased desire for talking + replacement for music/introvert thinking. 

  Lately I have been writing down my mothers bad behavior in low stress situations. Mostly to give evidence to a special therapist we will both go and see.

    Sounds good. Journals are amazing way to unwind and store data that may be hogging the brain. I keep a "research journal" where I write everything I'm working on and that ended being used as a diary about thoughts and rants.

    I've been thinking about making an electronic journal but find it more satisfactory to use pen and paper.

- u/Restinan:

  So, recently I've been thinking about something. For me at least, a great deal of rationality's benefits have come from chains of self modifications only made possible by some realizations about myself. My own rationality, developed on my own starting when I was at about the age of 15, helped me see myself more clearly, and that included my various flaws. But that wasn't the most important bit, the noticing of the flaws. The important bit was getting rid of them, the long slow work I did on those flaws, from my temper, to my tendency to be uncharitable to people I disagreed with, to a hundred other things. Many of those flaws weren't something I could remedy simply by realizing they were flaws, I actually had to work at it, it wasn't just something I could snap out of. However, over time I have dealt with these things. I now no longer have an unusually bad temper, and can keep calm much better than almost everyone I interact with. I don't feel shy in social situations. I am no longer habitually uncharitable to the groups I have realized I was being habitually uncharitable to.

  I'm not sure how typical this is, the ability to simply excise bits of my personality I don't like, and slowly shape who I am, to the extant that I am capable of. I have some evidence to suggest most people aren't quite as capable of changing themselves as I am, as I frequently see rationalists mention that they have a specific irrational emotional reaction to certain circumstances, or are less charitable than they should be of a particular group, and just lament that fact, instead of ending with "... and I expect to have this problem solved withing a year, at the outside." The me of five years ago is scarcely recognizable to the me of today, and as far as I can tell, I'm speeding up, not slowing down. But everybody else seems to be standing still. All the people I know are all the same as they were half a decade ago, and probably will be half a decade from now. It's not just that I'm learning new things, it's that who I am is changing, and it doesn't really seem like anyone else is. 

  I honestly don't know how much of this is unique to me within the rationalist community, but I suspect the answer is that it's actually rather typical, but most people don't really talk about it too much.

  EDIT: Also, that type of slow effort to change who you are has been the keystone to much of my progress towards becoming the person that I am, but I don't see many characters in rationalist fiction deliberately undergoing such changes. It's all accidental, or just picked up. Nobody ever goes "Oh, I seem to have a problem where I react with strong anger to anyone who intellectually defeats me, I should deal with that." Anybody have any idea why?
  ```

  - u/IWantUsToMerge:
    ```
    For me there's usually an *incident* where I realize the way I'm conducting myself is rotten. Changing isn't much of a conscious effort, after that. The way I was becomes ugly, to me, and I no longer wish to be it.

    So for me the more difficult processes are the ones where it's difficult to consider the problem ugly. I make no effort to network, because nothing about going out of my way to make connections seems virtuous. Most networking seems like a waste of time, and most of the social practices the west promotes seem childish, pathetic, sick, rife with crutches and bad habits. It's plain, though, that the insight into the way others think, insight into the demographics of the market and the audience, and earning the trust of people I could use(the nice kind of using though!) (you can probably guess I could be better at this) would all be very valuable to me. At the same time, I don't think I've ever met anyone who'd hear about how rarely I go out and how few connections I maintain and respond "what an unappealing character trait, obviously you suck and I don't want to be around you". That just doesn't happen. People like the hermit. They find them interesting, and unthreatening, their sense of virtue might even praise them, and so my sense for virtue ethics cannot help me out of this hole.

    From the inside, you see your reasons for acting.  From the outside, you see the trends *in* your actions.  Since your actions are a noisy result of your reasons for acting, which may not be consistent, checking that outside view is helpful for observing where your actions deviate from your reasons and where your reasons conflict, fade away, or fail to be tied to realities outside yourself.

    I've had similar experiences, but they've been rather hit-or-miss, in some sense. A few months ago I finally figured out how to activate this at will. Disclaimer: This might not generalize to all people, I've just found it works very well for me.

    My trick is to write down the observations (e.g., in a journal) that made me realize I wanted to change something, and then to just sorta go off on various tangents exploring the idea. Half the time I have some pretty awesome insights into the situation, because I'm literally sitting down and thinking about the problem, as opposed to instantly trying to toss out a solution as people are wont to do. Note that there's no real pressure to actually *do* anything -- it's just a nice mental excursion.

    Within one or two sessions of this, the change process activates and becomes mostly automatic. I think it has to do with the act of writing and thinking deeply somehow focusing unconscious parts of your mind into action. Otherwise you wind up having System 1 and System 2 at odds, and your entire effort fails. 

    Interesting observation: It doesn't work if I type things, only if I write them. Not sure why this is the case. Maybe because I tend to slow down and focus on shaping the letters or something, inducing a mildly suggestive state.

    There's a lot of self-improvement stuff that we can steal from various mystic and meditative traditions. The annoying thing is having to wade through all the metaphysical cruft to get to the actual meat of the ritual.

  I've recently read "The Anvil of the Gods" and the ending really irked me. The plot is that Earth was destroyed by Von Neumann machines, and some of the survivors, aided by an alien race, go out to seek the civilization that created the machines and destroy them.

  [Spoiler](#s "Except when they finally come to the star system, they discover that the civilization armoured themselves with psychological armour: populating their system with a large number of other naive sentient species, forcing the humans to kill trillions of innocents in order to destroy the remnants of the Von Neumann producers.

  Thoughts on the use of and circumvention of psychological armour?
