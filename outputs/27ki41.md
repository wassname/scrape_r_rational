  The main sub for Ra is, of course, /r/qntm, as listed in the sidebar. And yet, new chapters are never posted here, for some reason! I decided I'd take the initiative and post it myself.

  (Same thing with [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com), on that note. Hmm.)

    Thanks for this! I doubt I'd have noticed that there was a new chapter until July.

    Edit: actually, I *had* missed two chapters. I guess it's updated a little quicker than I thought.
