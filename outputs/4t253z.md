  >Author unknown, translated from Russian.

  The author's name is [Pyotr Bormor](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80,_%D0%9F%D1%91%D1%82%D1%80), russian-jewish writer. He published 4 books, each is a collection of short stories, generally focused on deconstructing and subverting religious and fantasy tropes. Most of them are extremely good in my opinion) Sadly, almost no english translations available.
