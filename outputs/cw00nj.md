  Finally, I've been waiting for the continuation for what feels like forever :) 

  I feel that the antimemetics storyline is hands down the best on the site, highly recommend it if you haven't read it yet.

    I hadn't realized how much of it there was! I just brushed up on Ará Orún, somehow I completely missed that Antimemetics had a ghost squad helping out.

      Maybe you just... forgot.
      ```

        Forgot what?
        ```

  I think they've done something to the previous stories in the series, so they won't load? It's very appropriate, but outweighed by being incredibly obnoxious. Especially since it's been quite a while since I've read something in the series, and I'm not sure if I've missed something.

    Going from [the hub page](http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub) they all look fine to me except the immediately preceding entry, "Ará Orún"

    I'm fairly sure I successfully loaded that page just earlier today, so it failing to load is new since then.

      [In the Trenches With the Dead](http://www.scp-wiki.net/in-the-trenches-with-the-dead) and [Ara Orun](http://www.scp-wiki.net/ara-orun) both load a totally blank page.
      ```

        ```
        I had the same problem. Open up an incognito window and view from there, that fixes it.
        ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      Ah, a technical issue then. I'm glad - appropriate as it may be it was very irritating! I'll try again tomorrow.
      ```

    ```
    This chapter is the continuation of two storylines: Marion Wheeler's and the one with the ghost foundation.

    You can skip the ghost one. It's by a different author, and feels more gimmicky, less well-written than the mainline antimemetics series. It really doesn't have that inexplicable oppressing feeling that the qntm stories have.
    ```

    - u/VorpalAuroch:
      ```
      It's more optimistic, but not much worse.

      Thanks!

  ```
  Is it just me or is http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3125 not working (showing blank)? Rather, the scp page loads but the body is blank. Is there supposed to be some widget that lets you enter a password?
  ```

- u/serge_cell:
  ```
  What I find strange is that reaction of the rest of SCP is not shown at all. It is as if only antimemetic division exists. It should be other way around - the SCP is more visible and antimemetic is hidden.
  ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    They're dead or coopted. I thought that was pretty clear.
    ```
