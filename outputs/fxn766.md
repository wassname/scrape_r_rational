A WH40K fanfic about a necron. A rather nice examination of how a singularity could end up wrong dispite going right. I'm not quite sure how to put it correctly. The main character starts out with the technology of a kardashive 2-3 civilization. This is mostly unimportant, it's not a story about what one can do but rather the mechanisms that underly one's choices and motivations and why. It's quite high concept and done well. Seeking the end of death and what that means is a major theme.

  Would this be enjoyable for those with no knowledge of WH40K?

    Yes definitely

  Thanks for the recommendation. All I've read by this author is their excellent ongoing story Onwards to Providence. It has an incredible setting and a wonderful set of characters, so I highly recommend that one, and I'm eager to check this one out.

    Yeah I've read that one fully too. You might wanna read the one this story is a sequel to too, I'm not sure I'd call it rational though, atleast comparatively and it's not nessesary to this one, it's still a good story and there's a few places where this story investigates questions that the first raised but sort of glossed over. It's called Hope and Silence in the Hive.

  I didn't know /u/Nighzmarquls had any new projects, they've been known to post them here themselves sometimes.

  - u/OnlyEvonix:
    ```
    Yeah, they get surprisingly little attention considering  they're consistently some of the better ones in this subreddit.

  It's pretty good. It seems to be slightly out of tune with how 40K power scaling between factions should work, but then again everything in the franchise has its own interpretation of *that* horrible mess.

  There are some interesting plot points regarding antimemes, souls, and philosophical zombies, but it can be a bit hard to follow in places. I had to reorient myself by reading an author's note in the thread at one point when things were getting a little *too* high concept and I couldn't follow what they were trying to portray with the in-character perspectives on philosophy. 

  The fact that it's a sequel to another fanfic threw me off as well, because to be frank some of the stuff that came from the previous fic just seems ridiculous [spoilers here](https://Inquisitors_helped_turn_a_genestealer_into_the_Chaos_Goddess_of_Friendship_apparently), but that setup does work well with some of the philosophical ideas that were discussed.

    That 'spoiler here' thing didn't happen (interesting way of making a spoiler, haven't seen it before), Amica's origins as far as the story is concerned is said right at the start in Hope and Silence so you can read that without reading the rest if you don't want to, the comment about "genestealers make terrible parents" was about a different later thing.
    ```

- u/Yes_This_Is_God:
  ```
  The concept is alright but the author canâ€™t write dialogue to save their life. There are a host of weird errors like not using periods and randomly capitalizing words.
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    Fair points, would be interested to hear what parts of the dialogue don't work for you.  


    The punctuation errors are almost certainly a product of not taking very much time with things. The capitalization is probably from an attempt to emphasize things in a way that does not gel, or forgetting I was doing that.
    ```

- u/Nighzmarquls:
  ```
  Oh hey neat!  


  Happy you thought it met the subreddit's criteria, personally was not sharing it here because it's not strictly intended to hold so much to rational or rationalist fiction.
  ```

  - u/OnlyEvonix:
    ```
    I think it does, more than that it raises and attempts to answer a lot of subjects that are common here but I think usually aren't thought through in such depth.
    ```
