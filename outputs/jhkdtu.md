Edit: This is an Avatar: The last airbender fanfiction, focusing primarily on new characters, placed a couple of hundred years after the events of TLoK

It has a bit of a slow start, and I might rewrite the first chapter entirely after the first 'book', is done, but I'm hoping to make a good and enjoyable story out of this.

It should be noted that this is rationalist fiction, and whilst the main character starts off with some given faculties of information, he has yet to reach his pique potential.

  Suggestion: clarify what it is you're making a fanfic of. Preferably in the title.

    Oh wow, I was so tired I didn't even notice. Thank you for the info. However, I don't want to make a repost of this post, as I feel that would be taking attention away from others. I will note this information for more proper advertisement later, however.

  Cool, it always a good thing when people try and add to the list of works.

  Thanks for sharing!

  From a writing standpoint, the main thing I'd suggest is that you need to remove about 80% of your commas. Many are unnecessary and distract from the meaning of the sentence.  They should only be used when necessary to break up two different thoughts in a sentence.

    Thank you for the tip!!!

    It's a problem that I've been aware of for awhile, using commas is almost like a default switch in my head for some reason. I'll make sure to keep note of it as I go forwards!

    That is fair. I wasn't really paying attention, and this was posted on my phone, not my computer (where I'm doing the work from). I will edit the mistake.

    Hey, if you do decide to read it, I'd love to have someone who could help me with some of the grammatical errors I might be prone to, so as to make it more enjoyable, and help fix any improper thought processes within my writing style.

    I'm not proposing an active commitment, of course, but I would love the help!

        Really? That's cool!!!

        You don't have to if you don't want to, I'd be happy with someone just spreading the word for me. Thank you for the offer!!!
