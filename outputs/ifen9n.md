  A new chapter on something like the old schedule! Storytime with Armadillo, as Flicker recovers. You know you've lived an interesting life when your birthday party pictures are still restricted access almost 40 years later 8-)
  ```

- u/VorpalAuroch:
  ```
  So Devon is/was >!the Volunteer!<, right? Works hard, no known(-to-Flicker) family, many years of service. And then of course, there are few other named characters known to be active at that point, and  strong implications that almost everyone who *was* active died between that point and the present (the Lost Years), so anyone still alive from that era would be notable just for that. Without Flicker's addition after realizing, I think one other person technically would fit, but he'd be too young at that point and would be noted for other reasons. (>!Gumshoe, Armadillo's son, not that Flicker knew that yet!<)
  ```

  - u/DocFuture:
    ```
    You are correct. The other person is the one who took the picture.  And it looks like I may have been too subtle with Devon's name--if you don't already know the inspiration for it, the etymology of the joke isn't very clear.  But I needed a good name, and it made me happy 8-)
    ```

      ```
      Incidentally, Armadillo and her chosen family reminded me of another story I'd love to hear. If you want a short thing to write after Princess (and one more likely to *stay* short), it would be really neat to hear the story of the end of the Lost Years, as narrated by Jetgirl, probably telling it to Flicker long after the fact.

      We know that the Nietzchean credited Doc with ending them, and that he was (largely due to misogyny) leaving out Jetgirl's role, which was as important or nearly so. And it's sort of hard to see how a technically-unpowered 'merely very fast by human standards' hero could be crucial to that kind of thing. Especially since I'd expect V-man to be more important than her *or* Doc on that front and he was (implied to be?) uninvolved.
      ```

      - u/DocFuture:
        ```
        Heh. I've had the story about the end of the Lost Years plotted out for more than 7(!) years, and no it won't stay necessarily stay short if I do it right 8-).  It's called "A Different World", and it's *really hard* not to spoiler it 8-). It's from Jetgirl's viewpoint and was intended to be a bonus story for the published version of Fall, the reason for everyone who already read the serialized version to buy it.  I'm still undecided how I'm going to handle it at this point. The Nietzchean crediting Doc with ending the Lost Years is intended to show he was a misogynistic revisionist.  "Never mind Jetgirl's part in it" was sarcastic understatement.  Doc's part in the events ending the Lost Years consisted of:
        1) Being very busy
        2) Answering his phone
        3) Losing his temper completely because people who should have been cooperating with Jetgirl weren't
        4) Giving Jetgirl full Database access
        5) Providing minor backup afterwards

        The Volunteer was also busy, but he arrived in time to help a little bit at the end.

        What were Doc and the Volunteer busy with? (Rot-13 spoiler) :

        ```

        - u/VorpalAuroch:
          ```
          Huh. Now I'm instead confused about what the Lost Years were and how their end could be a coherent event that society acquired common knowledge of.
          ```

          - u/DocFuture:
            ```
            The public view of the Lost Years is simplified over what actually happened, but they were a decade long period where a faction in the US (mostly) government attempted to (more or less covertly) kill or coopt all domestic superheroes/villains while conducting a PR campaign against them, with killing or kidnapping family and close associates to goad individuals into responses that they could use for PR as a standard tactic. The origins of the desire to do that are complicated, stretch back to WW2 and will likely be the subject of more than one story. The immediate trigger was Doc and a number of other superheroes stopping a war that they were all ready for and *really really* wanted in the early 90s (you can probably guess which one). It ended when Jetgirl did something really dramatic, then gave a live speech which caused a sudden massive shift in public opinion, followed by a horribly inappropriate initial government response. They then realized they were facing a badly unpopular losing regime change war followed by war crimes trials and opted for resignations, conciliation and the Lost Years Agreement instead. The Lost Years Agreement was supposed to be a treaty, but it was never ratified by the Senate, so it remained as a cease-fire instead from the 'end' of the Lost Years until the Maker's Ark.

      Even knowing it's a joke, I can't figure it out so, yeah, probably too subtle.
      ```

      - u/Mors_morieris:
        ```
        There's a very famous comic book super hero with a very similar archetype to V-man whose last name is also the name of an English County.

        Edit: if there's a reference in the first name I'm missing it. The pattern I was trying to match would have had Clyde Devon be Cooper Devon or Carter Devon instead, since those are both first names that were originally surnames, and both come from professions, but probably they weren't first names yet 100 years ago, so they aren't really good matches either.
        ```

        - u/DocFuture:
          ```
          We have a winner! 8-) The name is Chandler Devon, and Chandler is a profession name originally meaning 'candle-maker'
          ```

          - u/Mors_morieris:
            ```
            Omg how did I misremember his first name between reading the chapter and writing this? Chandler, not Clyde! The pattern fits!
            ```

- u/Adrastos42:
  ```
  Huh, I feel a little silly not realising that "One-Eyed" Jack plus magic user meant Odin archetype before you explicitly called it out:D So I'm guessing he either was taken out by the Wanderer to clear out a competitor for the archetype, or cleared out before he could be taken out.

  Or, to put my tinfoil hat on, perhaps he was the Wanderer all along!!

  Loving this look into heroic history, and also into the various ways a giant database does not lead to it's users knowing impartial and objective facts about everything.
  ```

  - u/DocFuture:
    ```
    Thanks! One of many funny things about Jack is that the archetype was an unintended side effect. There are many folk tales about shapeshifters that have one feature they can't change, and I decided to use that with Jack (no specific one, just the idea). The feature he couldn't hide was the unusual appearance of one of his eyes, so he had to keep it concealed to keep from blowing his cover, so he had to have an *excuse* to keep it covered. And if you're called 'One-eyed Jack' people tend not to ask why you're wearing an eyepatch because it's obvious 8-). The other part is if you have an essential tool that is bulky, you want to have some way to fit it into your look.

    The reason he had disappear is a little clearer if you know when--Doc was off helping Zirjack, someone significant was about to show up, and Jack didn't want either Armadillo or Doc asking him for advice about this new person.

    If you *really* want to put your tinfoil hat on (spoiler Rot-13'ed) :

      Huh, an Odin-archetype sneaking into your story unexpectedly is very Odinic:D And I love it when a couple of ideas and a bit of logic grow into a whole character like that!

      Hah, I did wonder what the timeline might have lined up with if I'd dived through the archives. I can see how someone might want to get out of the way of that person and ensuing series of events.

      *Tinfoil hat engaged* Oh, fascinating! I really love how you scatter about all these clues and references and puzzle pieces about your wider world:)

  I'm feeling dumb... Is Chandler Devon supposed to be Doc before he took the name "Doc Future"?
  ```

  - u/DocFuture:
    ```
    The picture was taken the year Doc was born, so he was far too young. Chandler Devon was the Volunteer's original secret identity--he was mentioned, but not as being in the picture. The Volunteer was who Flicker thought was the photographer but was wrong about.  And don't feel dumb; I wanted this to be something that Flicker plausibly wouldn't get instantly--and her problem with the stories from the 'old days' was missing clues to things like that, that the Database would make clear.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Aha!  Thanks for explaining.  That was bugging me.
      ```

- u/Adrastos42:
  ```
  Hmm. Combining this with The Old Man...

  "Chandler Devon" was married to Luce Cannon? And started going on patrol more after her death from cancer, culminating in faking the death of Chandler and Volunteering full time?

  And Luce was a reporter when she met him? I wonder, is it on purpose that Luce and Lois sound somewhat similar?
  ```

  - u/DocFuture:
    ```
    Reporter was Luce's first cover. And yes, Luce and Lois sounding somewhat similar helped me decide I'd found just the right name for her 8-)
    ```

    - u/Adrastos42:
      ```
      Ah, brilliant:)

      And I'm glad it did, because Luce Cannon is the Best name:D
      ```

      - u/DocFuture:
        ```
        In the part of my brain that yells at me for not writing This Other Cool Thing Instead, a prominent voice is advocating for pulpy Science Adventure Stories! starring Luce Cannon and Belle Tinker! 8-)
        ```

        - u/Adrastos42:
          ```
          You have my sympathies, my brain keeps bouncing between ideas for a cute and fluffy story and gothic horror at the moment:D

          I know this won't help, but after you're done with Flicker's story, I would absolutely devour The Adventures of Luce Cannon and Belle Tinker.

          Or anything else you write to be fair, because you're, like, really good at it?
          ```

  ```
  >  And she’d mentioned her problem to Stavros, the owner of her favorite Greek restaurant, he’d gotten a look on his face like he’d been personally called upon to save the world, and now she had enough takeout in her fridge to feed a starving pseudo-mythological extradimensional being for a week.

  This sentence seems like it should start with something other than "And". (Although maybe leaving it this way can give an impression that the Flicker is feeling tired or inactive - things are just happening, rather than being caused or anticipated, as a result of old events, rather than new motions.)
  ```

  - u/DocFuture:
    ```
    I tend to use a lot of conjunctions, and Flicker uses even more.  I usually write in 'very tight limited third person', the same style used by C. J. Cherryh, so all the narrative description in "Princess" is in Flicker's voice, not just her viewpoint. Flicker's idiolect is full of conjunctions, as she struggles with the competing demands of chronology, completeness, and coherence--she was not able to speak understandably to most people until she was ten, and wasn't able to pass for normal until thirteen.  And as mentioned in the previous chapter, her verbal organization abilities took a hit when she was injured.
    ```

    - u/GeneralExtension:
      ```
      That makes sense. (Kind of wish I'd made this comment with disquis on the chapter because as a reader, having that mentioned adds something.)

      I love your writing, and these chapters are great!
      ```
