  Left out memetic hazards, which is information that IN ITSELF is dangerous to have in your mind. Temptation being the earliest form of this: if you know where the cookies are, you are in danger of eating one. 

  But more insidious would be something like a false belief which can lead to a bad action: You think she's cheating, you burst into her therapy session and ruin everything. 

  There are stories in which simply knowing the name of something calls its attention to you, and saying the name can summon it. There's an apocryphal story about the northern European name for bears being lost because in the very early mythology if you said the name you'd call them. So they were called 'brown ones' which became 'bruin' and then 'bear'. But the name still persists in 'Arctic' (the word was arktos) 

  Then there are the physical meme hazards like SCP where you see the picture and you die. Snow Crash did it first with the Asherah Virus. See a QR code and if you're nerdy enough to be able to process it even subconsciously, you're infected. 

  One of the key factors in an infohazard is who is in danger from who knowing it. Are you in danger because you know it? Are you in danger because they know it? Are you in danger because they know you know it? 

  And you know they know you know they know you know it.

    These would be cognitohazards and/or mnemohazards, depending on wether the danger lies only in actively thinking them or knowing them is enough.

    Memetic has more to do with a tendency to spread.

      I suppose that's true. I'd consider 'meme' to be more about the quantization of the information into discrete units. Information spreads generally, but memes specifically spread as coherent units. The division of 'unit' is a bit arbitrary but the metaphor can extend that far.

    every time someone mentions Roko's basilisk, in any context, no matter what they have to say about it, I cringe so hard that I metaphorically tear out all my feathers and fall out of the sky into the ocean, sinking to the bottom of the mariana trench

      Yeah, rokos basilisk is like, the least likely hell to end up in.

      Personally I worry about the nature of consciousness, whether it really is entirely dependent on the brain, and whether the universe that created bot flies might treat a link between a consciousness and a dead body like a tv with a bad input, just feeding it dirty noise for eternity.

        There's an SCP about that. Can't remember the number, but it's about a foundation leader who dies and then years later is revived by a freak accident. He comes back obsessed with not dying again, because eternity after death is just pain and boredom as you keep experiencing the decay of your body and the fate of the atoms that made it up.

          It's actually worse than that - the phenomenon is an infohazard. The real phenomenon is that if you've ever had the idea that death is like that, then that's what happens to you when you die. Always follow the infohazard warnings!
          ```

          In my nightmare you kind of lose structured thought, it's like some kernel of awareness or perspective just being unpleasantly stimulated, but that's really on point.
          ```

            ```
            This is part of the reason I decided not to pursue cryo-preservation which is portrayed by its proponents as a binary thing: you either hit the immortality jackpot or you don't. But there is a wide continuum of mental states between conscious vs. dead that seems plausible given how much of the fine structure gets preserved during freezing. Given that current cryo-tech is barely above quackery, ending up in a nightmarish vegetative state has a non-zero probability.
