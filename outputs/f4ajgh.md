## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are colonists on a new continent, and the ecology is highly magical.  You have access to middle ages technology and a DnD-like magic system, but have no access to your home continent and limited access to domesticated animals.  Every forest is a Mirkwood or Lost Woods, every grassland a poppy field or field of blades, and the animal life includes magical megafauna such as dragons and dinosaurs alongside the more modern mammalian fauna.

  How do you go about surviving this environment as a colony?
  ```

    Jesus.  The first way to survive is to embrace the crazy, go native, and become one with said ecosystems.  Elves lived in Mirkwood just fine.  

    &#x200B;

    As to surviving with Middle Ages technology, that's kind of doubtful.  The Spanish had 10 failing colonies on the East coast and only one successful one in Florida, and they had guns and germs on their side.  The Vikings were also similarly pushed out by war.  The only way to survive would be get lucky with the climate, till fields, and slowly destroy the magical habitat while taking things that may be of use for you.

    The most useful D&D-like spell that I can see here is Divination. If you can predict something on the scale of a Dragon attack a week in advance, you can overextend yourself across the poppy fields for farming and meet whatever is coming with your full fortification. Charm Monster, Animate Dead and the like turn Dinosaurs into an asset, and the Fields of Blades mean you don't need mines.
    ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    D&D spells include *Create Food and Water*, various healing and curative spells, plus spells like *Stone Shape*. Simply burying the colony is possible in this situation. Growing food is far less of a priority; getting material components for spells is more of a limiting factor.

    Trade is possible for these reagents, assuming you can find creatures willing to do so.

    It's necessary to know how common casters are, as well as a rough estimate of how much magic they can handle.

    I would start by moving to safer-looking parts of a nearby forest and setting up a settlement on elevated ground close to a creek, river, or stream. The trees would provide a natural barrier against the larger predators like dragons and big dinosaurs, though we'd still have to fend off the smaller ones. The flowing water would provide for both drinking water as well as a natural path through the forest to help avoid getting lost, with an included freshwater supply along the way, as well as a high probability of encountering game animals that have come to drink and/or their game trails. Building this settlement on elevated ground helps to reduce risk of problems with floods or high rainfall.

    I assume we'd start off by hunting and gathering food as we go, and we'd be starting with some basic equipment like axes, picks, swords, clothing, cooking pots, waterskins, etc., but if we don't have that, then getting some basic gear such as simple spears with knapped stone spearheads would be step two. With basic gear, I'd then start making small clearings in the forest and carving out trails to connect the clearings together. The small clearings would provide space to grow crops while still affording nearby cover to run to in case of dragons and such, and the process of making the clearings would provide a good initial source of wood, as well as potentially edible roots and tubers.

    I'd be very cautious with any potential food sources we come across. If we have anyone who can cast detect poison, I'd want to try that on everything. If not, I would try touching the potential food first and waiting a few hours to see if there's any skin reaction. If that's fine, I'd want to boil or cook it first and then try tasting it, chewing it, spitting it out and waiting to see if there's any reaction. If we don't have cooking pots, I'd try carving out wooden bowls and then boiling the water by putting heated rocks inside. If boiling and tasting the food goes okay and I can tolerate the taste, I'd try eating a tiny amount of it. If there's no problems with that, I'd try eating progressively larger portions of it. Having other people along would help since each person could separately test out the potential food sources to avoid having one person trying multiple things at the same time and then being unsure of the cause if they have problems.

    If we do identify anything poisonous, I would take note of it as a potentially useful weapon - a baited trap laced with the poison might be able to drop a dinosaur, helping us expand into the fields later on. Also, if we identify any plants or animals that are particularly tasty, I would make an effort to domesticate them.

    At the same time, while we're sorting out what's safe to eat, I'd focus on getting basic shelter and defenses set up. Simple lean-tos with felled debris might have to suffice early on, but real defenses and fortified homes like log cabins would be needed quickly to reduce the reliance on a night watch. The most reliable settlement defense would be set up a wall and moat. This could start with a trench dug along a level perimeter around the settlement, with a berm raised on the inward side. Eventually that trench would need to be dug deep enough so that, when filled, it could drown nearly any of the ground-based forest predators, and the berm would need to be converted into a perimeter wall at least 10-20 ft. tall, possibly using a combination of lumber and packed earth.

    Beyond this fortified zone, we might then want to start setting up all kinds of traps. Pit traps along game trails, baited traps for predators, snares for smaller game, etc. The traps would provide a fairly regular supply of food for the settlement, as well as helping to cull local game animal and predator populations, improving the overall safety of the area as long as the traps are avoided. People leaving the settlement to explore would need to be traveling with the trappers so they can be guided away from any of the traps that have been set.

    As long as things have been okay up to this point, the next step would hopefully be to wait while the population starts to grow, and then begin expanding the edges of the fortified zone further and further into the forest. As before, we'd mostly keep the trees to both hide from the dragons and create an obstacle for them if they try to attack.

    When we get larger than the local water supply can support, or larger than the settlement boundaries can be reasonably made to contain, it will be time for a large chunk of the population to move. The first place to settle should be a nearby mountain. There, mines can be dug into the rock which has been thankfully brought above the groundwater level, and coal or ore can be extracted. Trade can be started between the two settlements, with large and heavily-armed convoys traveling along paths that should be increasingly fortified over time. Ideally, the path will initially be given walls and intermittently-spaced bunkers to hide in. Later, it should be given arched supports and a ceiling, then finally get buried with soil so that it effectively becomes a near-surface underground tunnel connecting the two settlements. With that approach, the predators in the region have nothing left to even notice as a possibility for attacking.

    The mountain settlement itself can be dug into the rock and designed so that all surface points have quick escape routes through narrow tunnels to get underground in case of a dragon attack. This way, the settlement can also have surface-level terraced farms with minimal danger. Other niches will need to be colonized over time to gain civilizational access to a wide range of resources for trade, but eventually it should be feasible to get back to a middle-ages level of technology and infrastructure, and then gradually progress beyond that point.

      Love it.  I'd probably rush mining myself for spell components, and it doesn't acknowledge the issues of harvesting trees from a deeply magical forest, but those are minor details compared to the problems of food and protection.

      I wonder how the architecture would be affected.  Would they end up with wattle-and-dorb walls to conserve wood and build more vertically, and if so how do you protect those tall buildings from aerial predators effectively?  Perhaps concrete and steel would catch on earlier with magical refinement available.
      ```

      - u/Norseman2:
        ```
        The easiest way to conserve materials and improve defenses is to make larger buildings and then maximize your use of the space, like with bunk beds arranged in rows in a fortified thick-walled barracks rather than having individual beds in individual rooms in multiple individual houses. The sleeping space is the main living area that needs to be optimized for security because we want pretty much everyone to be able to sleep soundly at night so they can all be awake and combat-ready together when they're outside during the day. Other living spaces should still offer some security, but they don't need the same level of security.

        As for materials, assuming we're restricted to relatively low-level spells, I'd look at stone shape (3rd level druid and cleric spell in Pathfinder), and wood shape (2nd level druid spell in Pathfinder). You can use stone shape to quarry stone fairly quickly. A 5th-level cleric casting [stone shape](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stone-shape/) could create 15 cubic feet of stone bricks by casting the spell just once. A 3rd level druid casting [wood shape](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wood-shape/) could make 13 cubic feet of wood boards by casting the spell once.

        Suppose you want to make a 20' tall 5,000 sq. ft. barracks (a square with 50 ft. on each side, internally, and two floors) with 6" thick outer stone walls, a 5' thick mass of densely packed earth, and then 1/2" thick lumber interior walls, a 1/2" thick lumber floor for each level, a 1/2" thick lumber roof sloped at 30° and overhanging the walls by 3', plus 1/2" thick stone shingles on top of it, plus 2" thick 4" wide framing lumber spaced 1' apart to support the floors, walls, and ceiling. To do that, you'd need about 2,500 cu. ft. of stone bricks, 170 cu. ft. of wall boards, 210 cu. ft. of floor boards, 250 cu. ft. of roof boards, 840 cu. ft. of framing lumber, and 250 cu. ft. of stone shingles. All told, it would take about 114 castings of wood shape, and 184 castings of stone shape. Once the barracks is filled with bunk beds, you should be able to fairly easily fit over 200 people inside.

        With a barracks like this, the exterior walls would probably hold up to almost anything, though the ceiling might be vulnerable to a dragon actually trying to claw its way through. To reduce that risk, you'd want to build very close to some tall trees so that the building is obscured by the tree canopy and so that any dragon trying to attack it would not have room to move or fly due to the surrounding tree cover. Even simply attempting to land when there's dense tree cover would probably end with the dragon impaling itself on a tree trunk.

          If bunkers are the way to go, using a Mold Earth cantrip plus these methods would allow you to build it underground, eliminating the threats of most large animals entirely.  Assuming the plants above don't have magical defenses to protect their root systems(some will, to fend off parasites and burrowing animals), you could set living spaces underground and maximize the arable land you reclaim from the wilderness.  Collapse and airflow would be your biggest dangers.

          As settlements grew large enough in population and power though, I feel like they'd have to start building vertically.  Every inch of land that has existing plant life and animal territory is land you have to work incredibly hard to claim, and magical assistance would lead to better building techniques even if the number of archmages doesn't scale with the population.  Multistory communal buildings with robust weaponry to drive off attacks seems like an important step to concentrating a farming bunker into a true town or holdfast.

          I can see already that this setting is going to be pretty crazy to worldbuild, with every settlement needing to take its immediate environment into account in order to survive.

            Don't forget about groundwater and rain. You can get away without one if you build on a hill or slope and direct all drainage that seeps in through the walls along channels that lead outside of the house, basically just using gravity as your sump pump. However, if you're just building underground on flat terrain without any way to drain seepage, you're going to be dealing with endless bugs, mold, and damp socks. Without sump pumps, I'd be building exclusively above ground or on hills/slopes. You can always just heap dirt over an above-ground structure if needed.

            As far as territory expansion is concerned, once you can deal with dragons, you can start expanding pretty freely. Those forests? Burn them to the ground. You can make tree farms using benign trees to produce wood instead. The open plains? Easy expansion, just put up walls that will stop large dinosaurs and you're set. You will need a large population with a lot of mages so you can transmit messages by magic to ask people to teleport in to help fight off occasional dragons, but that will basically be the end of your challenges as a civilization.

              I hate to keep adding complications, but fire would be a very poor idea.  Without going into a two page dissertation, strong sudden energy input can cause the environment to cast spells, enchant or cause effects using mana stored in the things and materials affected.  It's actually why there are so many magical living things but humans are the only ones that can really cast; most living things have common ancestors who were magically mutated or enchanted by volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, lighting strikes, forest fires, and more importantly extraterrestrial impacts like the one that should have wiped out the dinosaurs.  The same phenomenon can rarely cause permanent, self-sustained area effects, though more often it does something random like a wide-area prestidigitation.

              A forest fire is probably about the lowest level of those and therefore least dangerous, but it could potentially leave the area inhospitable to invasive species for years while the native trees rise from the surviving seeds, possibly with new abilities that complement the magically altered environment.

              Grasses might not care about that though, now that I think about it.  They'd probably spread like wildfire themselves.  Hmm.

              Side note: this also makes nonmagical explosives into wild magic bombs.  I doubt gunpowder will be a thing in any way we recognize, and thank the gods they can use magelights for coal mining to limit explosions.

  You have the power to pick a strikingly appropriate name for someone. However, this only works if they actually take on the name; it's a self-fulfilling prophecy kind of deal. They're normal-ish human names, and you don't know why they will prove appropriate until later.

  e.g. a person named Romulus or Remus might grow up to be obsessed with wolves, they might be bitten by a werewolf, they might found a city or a country, they might be orphaned and raised by animals or people named Wolfe, they might found a startup named Rome, they might kill or be killed by their brother... but you don't know which, if any, until it actually happens. And it could be multiple options.

  Is there any use for this other than the obvious (selling people new parents, or people planning to change their name, names so that they have a vague nearly-useless insight into the future?)

    Offer to name someone Richie Rich in exchange for a good chunk of their income.

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      This seems like the best option. Name people Richie Rich, Moira Moneybags, Mike Millionaire, Cassius Green, etc. until one or more of them make it big. 

      You could also try similar things like naming people Timothy Touchdown or Olivia Olympian in exchange for some of their pro sports paychecks. 

      Honestly, you might have to pay people to take the names, since the majority of them won't end up wealthy anyway.

  You have short range telekinesis and clairvoyance.

  * Within 2 meters from you, you can see from any point of view in addition to your own eyes. You can only see from a single spot at a time. This is normal human level vision, so no seeing inside closed dark containers.

  * Within 2 meters from you, you can manipulate objects. It works as if you did it yourself with one hand and applies as much force as you can one handed. It tires you out as if you did it yourself and requires a little focus to use so it's not automatic.

  * Basically a one-eyed one-armed Stand.

    There is huge potential for espionage and illegal activity with this power combination.  Sit in a waiting room and read information off a nearby computer while you read a magazine, watch someone input a password from the other side of a wall, get all the answers to a test by reading off the proctor's sheets.  Combined with a disembodied hand and a lot of dexterity training, you can unlock doors from the other side to bypass most security measures, disable power grids to entire buildings without effort, even kill people with a thought by, say, crushing their heart inside their chest.  A third-person view with full freedom of movement could be the kind of thing that saves you in a gunfight, too.

    In terms of benevolent uses, they would be incredibly useful in animal-related professions such as extermination/relocation, wild study, and rehabilitation/zookeeping, all professions where extra eyes and hands are important, and the ability to keep your distance or access incredibly tight areas with no sightline are valuable.  They could be a bomb disposal expert or factory mechanic for similar reasons.  An interesting idea would be a professional photographer, cameraman or director, able to get shots without rigging that couldn't be accomplished normally to further enhance their productions.


    Edit:  It should be mentioned that the rules for this power are a bit hard to define.  For instance, two meters from youself seems small, but what constitutes 'yourself'?  Can you raise your arm above your head to get another half a meter vertical range?   Normal human vision is binocular, but is the sensor?  'As if by one hand' could mean 'as if with five individual points of fine contact and one force pane in the rough shape of a hand', which leads to more flexibility by doing things a hand could theoretically accomplish without all those pesky bones in it.  I could go on, but I've overthought it enough for now.
    ```

    - u/Kaos_Dragon:
      ```
      Pretty cool ideas. As for extra definition, I'd say the brain as the center of a 2m sphere, since telekinesis is mental. And the sensor is monocular. I specified human vision so it's not seeing infrared/ultraviolet or micro/telescopic. And your definition for the hand seems like a pretty good interpretation of it.
      ```

      - u/The_FatOne:
        ```
        2m radius sphere based on the brain actually severely cuts down on the area.  The average male would barely be able to affect things around their armspan at foot level.  Could still do most of these, but now head position is super important.

    So if I want to solder a wire onto something, I finally have enough hands - one to hold the wire, one to hold the solder, and one to hold the soldering iron? I can change gears while keeping both hands on the steering wheel?

    This will be so incredibly useful!

    Hmmm - can my telekinetic hand be injured? Or can I use it to pick up red-hot things directly? Grab a wire with high voltage running through it without worry?
    ```

    - u/Kaos_Dragon:
      ```
      I'd imagine it wouldn't be damageable by heat/electricy. Though it wouldn't be able to stick in between some gears to lock up a machine like some unstoppable force.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Ooooh, neat. I can pick small things up out of the oven without oven gloves! I can grab and move live electrical wiring! Limited force, sure, but that can be worked around in various ways...

        I can probably ruin any electronic device just by tugging randomly at its innards. I can unlock certain doors by turning the inside handle even while I stand outside. I can certainly unlock a car door in this manner (though making the car *go* is another question entirely).

        If I wanted to conquer the world with this power, I'd probably start out by winning money at card games in casinos, in order to obtain financing. Sooner or later the casinos would ban me (for winning too much), but I'd make a fair amount before then. Not *quite* sure what I'd do with the financing, but I'd be able to do more with it than without it.

    As long as you're reasonably strong and/or not overweight, this grants flying. You could pick yourself up by your belt loops or a climbing harness and then 'lift' yourself wherever you want to go.

      ```
      That might be possible for short distances, but lifting a human one handed over an extended distance will tire you out pretty quickly and getting exhausted 100 feet in the air sounds like a bad time.
