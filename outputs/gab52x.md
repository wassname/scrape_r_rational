## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  The newest update to Worth the Candle has me thinking about calendar systems in non-Earth settings. Almost every fantasy setting I've read about has a 24-hour day and a 365-day year, or close enough that a reader won't notice the difference. From an author's perspective, there are good reasons for this - readers take our system for granted, and changing it is a lot of worldbuilding effort for something that probably doesn't contribute to the story you want to tell. But I can't help but wonder what interesting societal differences would result from a planet that didn't rotate about its axis every 24 hours.

  What would our world look like if:

  * days were much shorter? Say, a couple of hours long?
  * days were much longer? What if a day lasted 1 Earth week? 1 Earth month?
  * years (and therefore seasons) were much shorter or much longer?
  * seasons were more extreme or less extreme? If the planet's axis didn't tilt at 23 degrees?
  ```

    All else (Earth's mass, air pressure, distance to the Sun, etc.) remaining the same, then off the top of my head:

    * As the days get shorter due to faster planetary rotation, the planet gets windier.  So, stronger and more frequent storms, and rarer moments of calm.  It gets a lot harder to walk or run anywhere that isn't downwind, and wind chill gets a lot nastier in cooler regions.  Land features that act as natural windbreaks become oases, while natural wind-funnels become Hell-on-Earth.  And as wind direction shifts, so will the positions of these oases and hells  So, I'm guessing there'll be a selective bias towards staying underground and in caves prior to inventing the great indoors, and the wearing of layers whenever you go outside.  The former could extend towards an architecture-culture focus on interconnected dwellings and cities (possibly beginning with tunnels, later extending to underground cities!).  The latter could be reflected in fashion trends -- heavy, concealing clothing is practical wear associated with outdoors labour, while leisure wear is the very opposite.  Wildlife will have to adjust to a windier world: flying in any direction that isn't downwind becomes very difficult (maybe not worth the evolutionary effort), but using the wind to glide or sail become easier; mammals select for wind-proof coats of fur while wild plants select to become shorter and denser.  Agriculture probably begins in natural wind-shadows, and expands with the building of artificial windbreaks.  Overall, probably looking at smaller, denser populations.  One wrong plague, and... whoops, there goes that settlement/civilization.  Oh, and of course, with a shorter day-night cycle, humans and animals would likely evolve  different sleep cycles, but with more time spent indoors the passage of day and night could become less culturally relevant.
    * With longer days and nights... you're looking at slower planetary rotation, so less rotation-driven wind, but more temperature-driven wind thanks to the enhanced temperature differential.  That *might* mean crazier atmospheric circulation, with hot daytime air and cold nighttime air constantly chasing each other.  Earth becomes slightly more Mercury-like, with more extreme high and low temperatures for day and night.  Lots of daytime evaporation and nighttime precipitation, possibly as snow.  Deserts are probably widespread far beyond the subtropics.  Early land plants either evolved to tolerate both extremes, or you're not looking at much terrestrial primary production.  If they did, then caves and the underground are likely still the habitat of choice.  If not... then life is probably better down where it's wetter, under the sea.
    * If the year and seasons are longer... well, you have a longer winter to prepare for, but a longer spring, summer, and fall to spend preparing, so perhaps not terribly different.  That said... longer summers and winters mean greater temperature extremes.  That could lead to greater risks of drought in summer, which means less food for a longer winter... unless you establish trade with agriculture in the tropics, where seasonal change isn't as extreme.    Longer winter means a longer cold and flu season, and a longer period of less daylight, adding greater stress to both physical *and* mental health.
    * If the year gets shorter, then the reader of the story may encounter the same problem I did with Victor Milan's Dinosaur Lord Series, wherein the shorter year means everybody is described as many more years-old than their Earth equivalent.  So until they get to part where the Old Home (i.e. Earth) to Paradise conversion is outright given, the reader is left wondering exactly how old all the characters are supposed to be.
    * And lastly... seasonal extremes are directly controlled by Earth's axial tilt, so a change in one ought to necessitate a change the other. If seasons are more intense, see two bullet points above, but over a shorter time scale so leave out the chronic effects.  Expect cultural adaption to hotter summers (more intense and regular droughts) with longer daylight periods, and colder and darker winters.  *ESPECIALLY* in the high-latitudes and polar regions.  With less extreme seasons... a lot more lifestyles like the tropics.  Temperature variations still occur with latitude, but the climate at one latitude is more or less what you get year-round.  Without strong or noticeable winters in most areas, there's more time for food production in most places, but less relief from mosquitoes, ticks, and other parasites.

    Well, that was fun!  I'm a bit out of practice with my climatology and Earth-Sun astronomy; anybody more current could probably go into even more depth on everything, and patch up a lot stuff that I oversimplified/ignored/got wrong, whatev!

  I'm tossing up between making my vampire hunter character a paramedic or a firefighter. She used to be a cop but I just suddenly realised that my big Rationality problem ("why don't they go to the police instead of hunting vampires?") is compounded a lot by the fact that a cop, of all people, should go to the cops.

  PARAMEDIC:

  - puts her near other major characters who all work in the hospital (okay, two major characters, an ER doctor and an ER nurse)
  - gives her advanced medical knowledge which is kinda cool 
  - helps people directly (more similar to one of the things I was going for with cop)
  - lives a relatively normal life 

  FIREFIGHTER:

  - more emphasis on physical prowess (more similar to one of the things I was going for with cop)
  - she will know how fire works, like, the theory behind fire, which is obviously big for killing vampires
  - delicious irony in her starting fires to kill vampires, but also allows her to have a passing knowledge (not Dexter level tho) of how to get away with arson
  - I'm pretty sure firies have a strange schedule/lifestyle where they're on call for ~48 hours at a time and sleep in bunkbeds (this is a con)

  Downsides to her not being a police officer like I'd pictured her for the last 5-10 years:

  - she'll have no work-related weapon skills, and it's set in Australia so access to guns any other way is very difficult (that said I always write her with a crossbow, so she could have had archery as a hobby in high school, which is in-character for her). 
  - she won't have access to police reports
  - despite everything I don't want the police to be corrupt, so it doesn't altogether cut away the "why don't they go to the cops" thing
  - however, I suppose one or two cops could be corrupt, and she could happen to get there
  - the original backstory has her being put on desk duty after a run in with vampires, which results in her finding similarities in old files for murder or mysterious deaths. This is maybe a pro, because I was never satisfied with that, but I'm not sure how a reasonable firefighter can come up with "OMG VAMPIRES" when the prior probability is so dang low; an ambulance driver, however, could see weird vampire-consistent injuries and get suspicions that way?
  - that said, depending on how Our Vampires look after burning to death, the local firefighters / all firefighters in the world could have legends about houses that are meant to have people in them but they just find ash no bodies and the houses are always really weird; however I think a sufficiently hot fire can turn bones into ash straight up so occasionally finding no trace of corpses is probably not that bad
  - maybe her awakening to the supernatural is some sort of "fire monster" or, like, say a centaur who she finds in a house that's burned down and decides to look after (or a centaur skeleton, idk). like, she doesn't need to find vampires? she can find some other Urban Fantasy Creature and it can be like "oh no, there are vampires, hon"
  - also maybe it's not her who finds out about the Supernatural Menace, perhaps it's her "vampire hunting partner/housemate" and she just joins in with the whole thing because she is a badass firefighter/paramedic who is handy with a crossbow. I think her housemate was a kindergarten teacher or daycare employee but she could be something more likely to find something interesting, OR she could suspect abuse in a family and when she drives past their house to investigate whether hte kid has food (or whatever) she finds out the family is actually nagas or whatever and is very scared and confused? IDK?

  Anyway, this is all "THOUGHTS"???? 

  Also, I heard somewhere that police officers and firefighters have a rivalry? [maybe that somewhere was Brooklyn 99 tho]

    It seems to me that making the vampire hunter a paramedic or firefighter doesn't really solve the "why don't they go to the police?" problem. On the other hand, if she is a police officer, then going to the police could result in her being tasked to deal with vampires anyway.

    Does something bad happen if everyone in that police department learns about vampires? If they all get Obliviated by vampire wizards, then there's a good reason not to tell the other officers. But it raises the question of how our vampire hunter doesn't get Obliviated herself. If nothing bad happens, then why isn't the supernatural public knowledge yet?

      I really need more information on the setting to answer the question of  'why don't they go to the police'. Are vampires known to the general publicand/or to the relevant government? If so what systems does the government have in place to deal with the superhuman man-eating monsters? Assuming we're in the present time keeping the existence of vampires hidden from government surveilance would take massive work and would have implication for the rest of the setting. Even if a massive vampire organization had information suppressent agents in all government you only need one Snowden to leak everything unless literally everyone was mind controlled(which vampires conveniently have easy access to). 

      Point being that either there are government agencies tasked to deal with vampires or the vampires have large control over the government. A largely uncorrupt police could happen in smaller towns and could just be told from the top that they should close cases that look vampire related. In that sense I would predict that the police might just not look into cases or the vampire hunter would be directed to a vampire hunter organization. 

      Setting all of that aside: Maybe the MC have had experience with the police with the police that either makes them (possibly incorrectly) mistrust their ethics or competence. Maybe they or a close friend were mistreated by the police, possibly just very biased accounts or possibly a few rotten fruits. Maybe the police tried and failed to solve a murder of someone they held dear. Maybe all of their friends are acab people and their social norms doesn't allow them to go to the police. 

      I think there are some perks involved with having an acquiantance be involved with an organization that hunts vampires(possibly one that works with the government or one that is funded privately because some rich people want to train soldiers or whatnot). It lends credence to the idea of not going to the police because they probably already know.

      Regardless, I really do think that being part of a vampire hunter organization should be a full time job rather than something you do on the side. Aside from the time training and missions would take, I think that being a vampire hunter shapes your personality. Assuming vampires are fast you need to be physically strong, learn to rely on your instincts, and train your instincts to kill when surprised. I really don't think that that training combined with the trauma from getting into near death experience with monsters that can both control your mind and literally want to eat lends itself well to working in a kindergarden. You daydream of your nightjob for one moment, a child surprises you, and the child ends up injured or even killed.

      > If nothing bad happens, then why isn't the supernatural public knowledge yet?

      Vampires have, essentially, "pet humans" covering for them at most major places, but the masquerade is wearing thin and ultimately shatters by the end of the story (think of it as maybe the prequel to true blood). 

      Apart from that the masquerade is maintained by a combination of:

      - vampire-aligned moles in high places

      - very low vampire population (about 1 vampire per million people)

      - the vampire monster is a relatively recent invention (~1700s); stories of Pharoahs and Emporers being gods/etc may well have been a cover story for people who were (at least at one point) openly vampires

      - other supernatural beasties are even lower population (that said Our City is one of the few places where the veil between the 'real' world and the 'supernatural' world is at its thinnest, so to speak, so Our City has more supernatural beasties though fewer vampires. 

      - except for werewolves (see below), supernatural creatures have no interest in incorporating themselves into human society as they have their own culture, traditions, customs, etc. (even most vampires). 

      - the powers just aren't that impressive unless you really know what you're doing (for witches of all kinds) - James Randi's challenge aside, who is *actually* going to notice a 'real' psychic / a plant medicine doctor who is about as effective as a real doctor / etc. 

      - tight-knit culture of secrecy (for werewolves)

      - some light mind control

      - in extreme cases (think like one or two shades below Godzilla; so something not easy to wipe under the rug), Obliviation may come into play 

      Not sure how well this comes together; the big problem with Rationality for urban fantasy is definitely the Masquerade. Unfortunately it's something that I'm more-or-less treating as a gimme (maybe I shouldn't, but having no Masquerade or having a plausible Masquerade both aren't stories I want to tell), but I do still want to have an answer to "why not go to the police" and when you *are* the police it's pretty rough. The idea of her being put in charge of a secret vampire hunting division is quite clever, though, and could be a good way to sell it. But she'd be too young and inexperienced for that sort of responsibility, unless her boss is like a conspiracy theorist (who happens to be right) who brings it up *to her* and then tells her to tackle it as an off-the-books assignment? IDK

      /u/callmesalticidae would also appreciate your thoughts on this whole thing

        Since *Heroes Save the World* was mentioned today, I guess it's worth bringing up that two major characters were put in charge of paranormal investigatory stuff because their task force had originally been a way to get rid of people without firing them.

        So, maybe there's some kind of Bullshit Task Force that she's part of, which gets thrown this terrible, stupid "lead," and then later on it turns out that there are vampires involved here, and...now Jack is in a bit of a pickle.

        See, she *could* come right out and tell her boss about Oh Shit, Vampires, but Jack knows exactly where that'll go: Boss is gonna take the matter out of her hands and she'll go back to Bullshit Work. 

        Orrrrrr...she could keep quiet about what she's investigating, and pile up evidence all the while until she's able to put together an open-and-shut case on the whole thing, so that nobody can just *take* this from her when she presents it to her superiors. (Either there's nobody else on the Bullshit Task Force, or they're tired of being underestimated and poorly treated too, and are totally on board with this plan). 

        Not only does this mean that she can be a cop who does cop things, but it explains why she's actively trying to keep her boss in the dark about everything.

    Another option, of course, is that she *isn't* the first cop in the area to notice something odd (that leads to the discovery of vampires). The *first* cop to notice something odd *did*, in fact, report it up the chain (after maybe privately sharing his worries with her) - only it turned out that their direct superior was one of the Vampire Goons infiltrated into the police force. His report vanished entirely, he himself was killed in what the evidence shows was *clearly* a "totally unrelated incident" (perhaps shot by an escaping prisoner who was in turn shot by him, only it turned out the escapee was due to be released the next day and didn't have access to a gun in any case - *that* sort of accident). The sort of thing that shows the Vampire Hunter character that (a) whatever these things are, they do exist, and (b) they've infiltrated the police force quite thoroughly; then she has *every* reason to avoid passing it on to the (other) cops.
