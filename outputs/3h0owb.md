## [Q] Recommended works with smaller "scope"?

  Looking through /r/rational/top/ (and limited to those I've read):

  * *The Martain*, a man has to survive alone on Mars (exotic location but small scope)
  * [*The Cambist and the Lord Iron*](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/?xcbv), a story about economics in a small city

  Everything else accelerates in scope towards the end or just starts with a scope that's quite large. (Or I haven't read it, or I don't recommend it, or I was skimming.)

      well it was a mutually beneficial exchange and the analysis of a good virtuous life's price in pounds sterling

          [Spoiler](/s "well the lord gave up his vapid unfulfilling life of fortune for the cambist's simple life so he could better himself/pay for his sins/make real friends. the cambist was a good person already so he *just* got the money the lord was squandering")
          ```

  I would have to reread it to see whether it's actually rational, but the young-adult novel *Hatchet* might be something like what you want; it's just about a teenage boy surviving in the woods. (If you've already read it, let me know whether this is sort of what you mean by "smaller scope".)

      There's always *[Robinson Crusoe](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/521)*...
      ```

        and the mysterious island by Verne
        ```

          I preferred *[Perseverance Island](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46128)*, myself--it reads like a game of *Dwarf Fortress*! [It has, however, been excoriated as rather non-rational.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1127697713)

  I'd recommend [Truth](http://web.archive.org/web/20090414062819/http://www.asimovs.com/hugos_2009/Truth.shtml), a 2009 Hugo nominee novella by Robert Reed.

  I'd also recommend reading it with zero information going in, not even the little blurb at the top.

      Yeah, it doesn't fit with the letter of what you were looking for, but I figured that keeping it contained to a (mostly) 1v1 mental battle made it close enough.

      I did. Both twists. :3 (Well, half of the first. Didn't see any reason to think [spoiler](#s "it was only him, but the signature of an autoimmune disorder was pretty visible."))
