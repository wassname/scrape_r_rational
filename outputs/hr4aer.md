  I only know Door Media from the We've Got Ward podcast, which I've listened to about a dozen random episodes of. If anything these guys are a little *too* charitable.

  >\#1...Assume the author is a genius

  This is actually a HUGE turn-off when listening to their podcasts. They take this to such an extreme that some sections are spent just fawning over the author. Maybe some people like that kind of thing, but I find it tiresome.

  >Principle #3: Ownership. Take responsibility for your reading.

  I wish they did this one more! It would take the edge off of the overdoing of #1 a bit

  Overall I do enjoy the podcast. I don't often agree with the interpretations of the hosts, but they have enough ideas and insights that I hadn't thought of to make it worthwhile
  ```

    ```
    I think if you read listen to their Method of Rationality podcast, you get a better sense of why #1 is important even if it can occasionally be to a fault. There was enough discussion in the first 5-10 podcasts where they weren't being charitable enough to the author that it put me off as someone who knows where it's going and paid attention ahead of time. 

    I'd rather listen to peeps err on assuming too much positive traits.
    ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      I think if anything it goes to show that their list of principles is kind of hollow. If you only act like the author is a genius when you believe they're a genius it's not a principle, it's a bias.
      ```

      - u/orta:
        ```
        That's tricky because of the nature of how these podcasts work. One person knows the book well, and is versed in the culture of the readers, the other is new. If you've only read 2-3 chapters of a book from an author you don't know well, are you really in a position to make a that call? 

        It seems like an acceptable fallback to say our principle is "OK, for the focus of this podcast, then we will assume positive intent on the author the entire time" which makes for good listening because it can skip a lot of uninteresting back-and-firth banter IMO
        ```

        - u/Revlar:
          ```
          If you read my other comment on this section you can see my argument against that. To summarize it: Assuming the author is a genius wouldn't have helped interpret either story better. It would've only had an effect on his reading of MoR because reading any story with an uncharitable view towards it is a waste of time.

          What this reads to me is as Matt deciding to be more like Scott, which is a bad outcome considering he's a million times more tolerable, even if Scott usually just leads him by the nose in any podcast that doesn't have We've Got Worm format of having him reread while Scott is only reading for the first time.

          Ultimately the question is what kind of discussion podcast they want to make. I'm sure tons of fans want to listen to them tell every reason why the thing they already like is great, and maybe that's the smarter move for a podcast trying to appeal to a wide audience, but their saccharine take on Ward made me stop listening to them and I don't think they're getting better if this is what they learned.
          ```

      I used to think that Doof Media was too charitable until I started listening to We Want MOR. It made me realize that given the option between a podcast being too charitable and not charitable enough i'd much prefer a podcast to be too positive/nice.
      ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  I think that #1 might be worse for the reading of a story than doing otherwise; something might be better as a surface detail than otherwise.

  For example, in Harry Potter, the Chronicles of Amber, etc., the name "Merlin" is used to basically imply "really powerful wizard" but not much else.  If you try to read further into Arthurian legend, you're not going to get much benefit out of it.  And this, I think, is part of my problem getting immersed in Wheel of Time; there are so many names that are references to Arthurian legend that I am expecting someone named Lannot (or something similar) to show up any time now to try to woo Egwene away from Al'Thor (that, or Nynaeve delivering Al'Thor a sword).  And reading this as a retelling of Arthur's story is *killing* my immersion, because, like the Fionavar Tapestry, it just *doesn't work* as a re-telling of the Arthur myth (so far, at least).  If I could step back and say, "these names are just references," instead of, "surely, this person is a genius who knows what they're doing," I would be able to better evaluate the text on its own merits.
  ```

  - u/moridinamael:
    ```
    I think the a more broad approach to "Robert Jordan was a genius" would first require that we ask what he was trying to do with the reuse of Arthurian names, rather than deciding that a genius would obviously be doing an Arthurian retelling and then finding the Arthurian retelling lacking. Textually, on the Watsonian level, the Arthurian names are a symptom of each turning of the Wheel rhyming with itself, and names/meanings becoming corrupted over time. On a Doylist level, Jordan knew that we knew those names, so they caught our attention and prompted us to wonder about it in the first place.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      The Wheel of Time is a repetition of events and personalities as much as it is of names, or that's the impression I got from reading the first couple of stories.  There's some variation between repetitions, but the general pattern remains the same.  So, if the names are repeating, then the events should *also* be a variation on the Arthur myth.  And, again, the events (to the point I've read) don't really *work* in that light.

      To go back to the essay, when Yudkowsky breaks immersion through Harry not behaving like an eleven-year-old, he's presenting the reader with a mystery to solve.  When Wildbow presents Taylor doing villainous things, they're breaking immersion in an attempt to get people to consider questions of morality.

      If I subscribe to the "genius" technique of reading, I need to try to determine why the author thought it was important to break my immersion by naming a character "Egwene al'Vere," to find some sort of important meaning behind that name before I continue reading.  As you put it, I need to spend time and effort *asking what he is trying to do by using these names*.  And the answer, "just the name is being repeated but nothing else is" isn't a satisfying answer to that question, so I go through the story trying to pull it apart and figure out "Exactly in what way is this character supposed to be Guinevere?  Who is Lancelot?  How is Lancelot going to come between them when they're not destined to marry?" and so on.

      If, on the other hand, I give Jordan *less* credit for genius, I can do what you say, and think, "Wow, he really didn't consider how much this would break the immersion of someone who recognizes the name.  I'll just set that aside and try to let the story carry me along."  Which, if I could actually accomplish it (*so* much immersion-breaking in WoT so far), would make it a much more enjoyable read.  In my opinion, of course.
      ```

      - u/Versac:
        ```
        > The Wheel of Time is a repetition of events and personalities as much as it is of names, or that's the impression I got from reading the first couple of stories.

        Wait, this comes after reading books 2? At that point you'll have come across both Al'Thor and Artur, so it's obvious the author isn't pursuing a direct 1-to-1 Arthurian comparison even while there are strong elements in common between all three of the characters. If the original material hit major thematic points A-B-C-D-E-F, and Artur hit A-C-D-F in his story, that doesn't tell you much about whether Al'Thor is obligated to hit E.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          Yes, there's another Arthur, who wasn't, for some reason, the Dragon or the Dragon Reborn (or at least isn't clearly presented as such), which *only raises further questions.*

          As I've said, it's trying to figure out stuff like this that is distracting me from actually enjoying the story that Jordan is trying to tell.

          Not that I have a problem with unanswered questions, especially two books into a fifteen book series, but, with all the hints and allusions, it feels like I'm looking at a Sudoku with 80 of the 81 squares filled in, but the answer to the last square, the answer to "What role is the legend of King Arthur supposed to play in this narrative?" is somehow not obvious.
          ```

      - u/moridinamael:
        ```
        Since, as Versac points out, the story does ultimately make the parallels to Arthurian (and Norse) legend a lot more directly, I have to ask: Do you think it's possible that if you hadn't concluded after 2 books of a 15 book series that you knew the author *didn't* know what he was doing, maybe your reading experience would have been more enjoyable, as the article suggests?
        ```

  - u/bassicallyboss:
    ```
    The name you are looking for is Lan.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      ...  That both disturbs me, that I didn't notice something so obvious, and raises a whole bunch of further questions about the role of Arthurian legend in this story.
      ```

      - u/bassicallyboss:
        ```
        The role is mostly allusional and referential.  The Wheel of Time is not an Arthurian story; it's something else that occasionally nods in Arthur's direction.

        Jordan was very into folklore, legends, and myths, which are oral traditions, and therefore have heavy borrowing and very little consistency.  Consider folk music:  There are [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-TgxTmglE8) [ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBSO5SJBzuA) to [play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBBSYK20-T0) a song like "The Lowlands of Holland".  The tone varies a lot, the tune varies slightly, the lyrics a little more, but it's all recognizably the same song about a woman's lover who goes away to war in Holland (or New Holland) and dies.  But the variety gets broader:  It's related by derivation (though I don't know which way the derivation goes) to [Bonny Bee Hom](https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/child/ch092.htm), in which the woman gives her lover a magic ring who's stone will fade when she dies--it does, and he kills himself.  And the lyrics of "Lowlands" seem to have gotten borrowed into (and then almost completely discarded from) a sea shanty about a ghostly woman appearing one night to her former lover, "Lowlands [away]" ([this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfMm7cIsb_I) is a pretty traditional rendition, despite coming from a video game).  The melody to that song probably comes, somehow, from an African American dockworkers' song in New Orleans, complaining about low wages ("My dollar and a half a day").  The same thing happens to stories in oral traditions.

        (Arthurian legend is itself a great example of this sort of thing that I happen to be really into, and I wrote a few paragraphs about it before I realized that you probably know most of it given what you've been saying.  I'm happy to geek out about the evolution of Arthur with you if you want, though.)

        Jordan makes it pretty clear he's writing this kind of story, I think:
        >The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.

        There are Gleemen working in the oral tradition, telling stories from our own age:  The Cold War becomes the giants Mosk and Merc, who fought from opposite sides of the world with lances of fire, and the US Space program becomes the tale [G]Lenn and his daughter Salya, who flew to the moon in the belly of an eagle.  Everywhere the Emond's Fielders go, people know different dances to similar songs with different names, and there never seems to be a canonical version of anything.


        I think your confusion is pretty understandable, though.  The whole centerless variation of stories and songs is foreign to most modern audiences, when stories are published word for word in books and music is reproduced as an exact replica of a single performance.  The closest most of us have to a living folk tradition is fanfiction, and even that still has a canonical reference source.  So it's kind of natural to see the names and assume Jordan's doing a retelling of Arthur, or at least writing a story to be read in the knowledge of the Arthurian tradition.  But in this context, that's like hearing "Lowlands Away" and assuming it's written as a re-styling of "The Lowlands of Holland", and that you need to memorize the latter and read up on [The Anglo-Dutch Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Wars) to enjoy it; it's applying the right tools to the wrong object of study.  Jordan is writing a story whose broad strokes are the kind of thing that Arthurian legend might become after 5 or 6 thousand years of further mutation.  Or equivalently, the kind of thing that might, after millennia, become something broadly similar to our stories of Arthur.  Or perhaps neither, given that the Heroes of the Horn don't live out exactly the same stories in every lifetime.  With that kind of change, characters, events, and plots are altered, split, fused, borrowed, made up out of whole cloth, and recombined into something new.  In any case, our memory of Arthur has long since passed through legend and into myth; even if he were a reincarnation of The Dragon or Artur Hawking, we're too distant from the man himself to say, and our stories belong to our age, not theirs.

        And it's not just Arthur that The Wheel of Time does this with, either.  Jordan incorporates stuff from all over, though mostly Northern Europe.  For example the beings known as elves, fairies, or the [aes sidhe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aos_S%C3%AD) are clearly referenced in the Aes Sedai--dangerous and magical people who will try to mislead you but never outright lie--and also in the people you meet in book 4, >!the foxlike and snakelike people beyond the stone doorway ter'angreal, who abide cruelly by the strict letter of mysterious bargains, and fear cold iron, in a world where time and space work a bit differently!<.  Which ones are "really" supposed to be the fairies?  That's a wrong question, like asking which is the real "Lowlands" and which are references.  Knowing the material he draws from can give another layer of depth or pleasure to a reader, just like knowing lots of folk music can can provide another layer of appreciation to a listener when a song references or borrows from another.  But this isn't a remake, or a remix, or a retelling, or even a pastiche.  It's just a story that borrows names and mythemes in the way all stories used to.

  Number 1 is... like... straight up kind of a bad idea? 

  Like this is a place where people with a bizarre preoccupation of talking about media on the internet have been before. Dealing with the guy in the NGE fandom who interprets the living fuck out of every little detail that Anno threw in because he thought it was cool, or the people who get sucked into Snyder movie discourse where you defend every choice as intentional genius no matter how obviously it was driven by production factors or outright incompetence. Those kinds of fans are as much the bane of the amateur critic's existence as the super negative people. Try not to become that guy.

  It also leaves you open to feeling like a dope when you're speculations about a given plot element end up falling apart because you were reading too much into it in the first place. Or say a story does something you think is messed up or hurtful, like if it does something transphobic. Then you have three choices: 

  **a.** Presume that the author is either clueless, ignorant, or just didn't think the implications through.

  **b.** Assume there's something else coming that will justify it and make it okay in the end.

  **c.** That the author was actually *intentionally being bigoted.*

  Despite not seeming like it, A is actually the most charitable option. The author didn't know or did a goof, someone hurt by a story may be able to recover their enjoyment of the story from that. B sets yourself up for a letdown, and C involves just accepting that the author of a story you enjoy is a big piece of shit. Both if which involving a lot of intent on part of the author, and neither of which are very fun. 

  While, yeah, a measure of faith in an author is a good thing, I think it really should be tempered by skepticism and a critical eye to keep your assessment of a story on an even keel. Or at the very least pick and choose what you think is genius and intentional and what you think is just the author being a dummy.

  I mean, sure. This might be good for curating your ability to enjoy stories more (as opposed to just moving onto something else **^(SHE-RA SHE-RA SHE-RA)**), but for an amateur critic and/or artist I think it's way more helpful to internalize the fact that stories are products brought about by a creative process rather than being perfectly shaped from the author's mind like Athena popping out of Zeus's head. A process that can run into problems by circumstance or just the author making less than ideal choices. 

  A movie can run into shooting and editing issues, a writer can run into time constraints brought on by life. Video games are often made by people having their noses ground into the dirt by companies (AAA games) or by themselves (indie games). This allows you to more easily shift what you like away from what you don't and deconstruct media as things people made that can be closely analyzed on a narrative and craft level without your negativity and positivity of certain aspects of it getting in the way.

    I sort of agree with your takedown, but I still think the first precept of "assume the best of the author" is good to follow so long as we caveat it with: "given that all other quality indicators prove that the author is decently skilled."

    For example, many times I've seen antagonists acting mean/unfair towards the POV character with no immediately apparant reason.

    * The uncharitable assumption is that the antagonist is just a flat character stereotypically making life hard for the Mary Sue protagonist.
    * The charitable assumption is that the antagonists have background reasons for acting the way they do that haven't been revealed yet. (The reasons don't have to make the action justified, they just have to provide a believable motive.)

    I've also seen a few occasions that tie in with your hypothetical "*a story does something you think is messed up or hurtful*". Sometimes the 'good guys' are shown doing something morally despicable, and the POV character completely fails to recognize or act on just how bad it is.

    * The uncharitable assumption is that the POV character doesn't notice or act because the author doesn't think it's unforgivable, which has disturbing implications for the author's moral reasoning (your options A, B, and C).

    * The *actual* charitable assumption is that the author designed the POV character to be flawed with biases that shape his or her inability to recognize the truth, and the author intends that the 'good guys' not actually be good. For instance, they could be living in a world of [Black-and-Gray Morality](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality), or the POV character might be experiencing an emotional handicap that prevents them from assigning blame correctly (such as battered person syndrome.)

    Most authors signal the correct view through their presentation of the story, but picking out their intentions is more difficult when the story is written in a limited POV or has an unreliable narrator. Usually I can tell over the course of the first few chapters whether or not an author has any skill portraying characters with fleshed-out inner lives and believable motives, so *usually* my assumptions are calibrated with those quality indicators in mind and I turn out to be right.

    But even on the occasions where I turn out to be wrong, I'd rather assume the best and have a fun time reading while the good parts last rather than miss out on reading something potentially great.
    ```

  - u/moridinamael:
    ```
    This specifically concerns being charitable toward the creator as an artist, not as a human being. I think you're conflating a sort of Scott Alexander variety of ideological charity with a specific willingness to provisionally assume that an author or filmmaker is in control of their craft.

    It's also possible that something that appears transphobic is instead commenting on transphobia. This lens would give you the space needed to explore that ambiguity. Like Robert Downey Junior's blackface in \*Tropic Thunder\*, it's only offensive if you don't bother to extend artistic charity to the choice; it's only offensive if you assume they either don't know what they're doing, or know what they're doing but they're bad people. So really, either kind of charity (artistic or ideological) is sufficient to make the correct answer obvious.

    Anyway, I'm not really saying you need to always read things this way. I don't. I just find it vastly more rewarding when I do. I was really predisposed not to like \*Puella Magi Madoka Magica\*. It was really rough to get into it. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was doing what it was doing on purpose, and in the end it completely rewarded my charity.

  Ironically, people here are not being particularly charitable to Matt.  I think the point being made is quite legible - if you're going to criticize an author or story, it's immensely valuable to *have actually thought your criticism through enough to know what the hell you're talking about*.  If your complaint about the work misses its point because you were too lazy to get past your first negative reaction, you haven't actually located a problem with the work; you've just been a dick.  Lists of plot holes are generally worth very little because they're generally just lists of plot points the listmaker failed to understand or think through; even plot hole lists compiled by smart critics will generally let a few really dumb points slip through where the critic is being weirdly dense about something.  (There's actually one particular "plot hole" that MoR makes fun of canon HP about, the Goblet Of Fire plot, where I think people including Yudkowsky badly overestimate how irrational canon is; it's extremely easy to imagine what might have been left unexplained that would make that plot make sense, if you're actually supposing that it makes sense.)

    > it's immensely valuable to have actually thought your criticism through enough to know what the hell you're talking about.

    Yeah, but a principle of charity *removes* thought from the equation. if you're assuming the creator is a genius, you're not exploring the possibility space where they aren't, which is far larger.

    I agree with you that lists of plot holes are worthless, but the universe of media criticism isn't a coin with one side being CinemaSins and the other being Doof Media.

  1 is an ok rule if you look for clues. Did the author actually show you they know what they're doing in that first chapter?

  There's no reason to assume they're a genius. Just be open to the possibility that they're competent.

- u/RMcD94:
  ```
  >
  Principle #1: Charity. Assume the author is a genius and every choice is intentional.

  I try to do this but I think it's better to have lower expectations in 99% of cases. Most authors are disappointing because you just need to think of one thing they didn't think of

  I do not understand how the author of this doesn't realize they're defeating their own main point by bringing up the Star Wars Prequels.

  Hell, RedLetterMedia often assumes the authors are hacks, *especially* in the Plinkett reviews. If you went into the movies thinking Lucas is a genius, you'd likely miss the entire point.

  Just because you can come up with two examples in which a heuristic works doesn't mean you can apply it to everything, or even make it a rule of thumb. I even disagree you need to think EY is a genius to grasp the subtleties of HPMOR, it's barely under the surface.

  I'm still glad you posted this link though since it unwittingly explains why their podcasts are full of horrible, nonsensical takes on fiction and how they've spearheaded a brand new type of fanboy.

  In the end, Doof Media has released a statement on why fiction analysis should behave more like theology.
  ```

- u/Anew_Returner:
  ```
  That first point, yikes, I understand how some readers can be very reactive and not give the author nearly enough credit, but going from one extreme to another? And that is without even going into the risks of pedestalizing someone like that. You think that with what is currently going on (the whole J.K Rowling situation, cancel culture, etc) it would be a time to encourage people to separate works from their authors and let their fiction speak for itself^^1 , not the other way around.

  I think a more apt principle would be to give authors the benefit of the doubt and then exercise critical thinking based on what you're reading. There is no need to turn this into a binary choice, not all authors write everything in a deliberate way, and even when they do they sometimes fail at properly conveying what they want to communicate or even stumble and fall flat on their faces, holding them to the absurd standard of 'genius' isn't very charitable for them and is setting yourself up for a lot of potential disappointment.

  >If you really deeply adopt this framing, then arguments about whether a piece of text was “good” or “bad” become uninteresting, to the point of feeling like a category error. A movie can be “good for you” and “bad for me” and that’s not only fine, it’s typical. I don’t need to convince you you’re wrong for liking it. On the contrary, I’m interested in understanding your reading. Maybe I missed something.

  Everyone has different standards and different approaches with regards to how they consume media, and while the reading will always be subjective sometimes the properties and structures that compose the fiction are not^^2 . Some things don't work, or aren't properly executed, or were left unfinished, or could have been done or handled better, and there is merit to that sort of discussion as well (even enjoyment if you're the sort of individual that likes to dissect such things). I think both subjective and objective takes have their place on a discussion. Or at the very least

  "(Book) got X, Y and Z wrong so it sucks."

  is as bad as:

  "I had fun with (Book), so your criticism isn't valid."

  Since both can and are used to shut down any possible discussion.

  I'll agree that if you have to choose one or another, then the principles proposed in this post are the ones that would likely lead to the most enjoyment, and perhaps it would even be the most optimal choice for people who prioritize their own entertainment over any kind of technical analysis. But I'm not quite sure how big the overlap is between people who read 'just for fun' and people who read WildBow's works and rationalist fiction. Maybe that is why I consider a nuanced and thoughtful approach to be better suited than a emotional and bias-driven one, the demographic that consumes that niche subgenre of fiction is one that likely can or could identify the problems the Star Wars Prequels had aside from Jar Jar (to use the example provided).

  &nbsp;

  ^^1 Keeping in mind the context it was made and produced in.

  ^^2 Most of the time, I'm mostly referring to grammar, plot structure, character arcs, endings, etc, where you have to either be very competent or put a lot of work into its subversion for it to not become a detriment to the story being told.

  What I find ridiculous is that the two examples given are so disparate from each other and an assumption of the author's genius just would not help in either situation. The dark undertones of Worm are not *invisible.* Taylor breaks YA protagonist tropes right from the get-go. HPMoR has a bad reputation among people with bad taste, but that's your fault if you listened to them and let them color your experience, not a fact of reality that you need to work around with a heuristic/principle. Update your values and lower the weight of their opinions on your predictions for next time.

  You can get the "superior reading experience" of both MoR and Worm by not being a prejudiced jackass prone to assumptions. Just letting each work speak for itself is usually enough.

  If anything, the heuristic should be to stop being uncharitable, not to be maximally charitable at all times to try and squeeze dopamine out of rocks. The front-facing content of a story is not something to base your opinion off of. "Don't judge a book by its cover" is a lesson everyone hears for a reason: It cuts both ways.
