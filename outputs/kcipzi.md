## Escape your literary echo chamber?

### Post:

I just saw this on HN. Not sure how well this works, but the concept is interesting:

  Not quite sure this works. I put in Prey and Making Money, two random books I enjoyed, and got 90% young children's literature, 5% books I already read (including a David Wong book, which doesn't feel a bubblebreaker for Discworld readers in the slightest) and 5% stuff that just sounded outright atrocious, not out of my tastes.

    I got a strange mix of religious literature (which challenges my views alright, but not in a productive way), socially left literature (which mostly aligns with my views, go figure), and Hunger Games (....sure).

    To be fair, I put *Atlas Shrugged* on my list since I enjoyed the book in the "it's terribly written but has a heart" way people usually enjoy web novels, and in that category it's my favorite by far. When I took it out, I got "Rationality: From AI to Zombies" as one of the first (anti?)recommendations which is just *wowsers* level of terrible predictions.

      David Wong's actual book books are basically what you'd get if 'A Scanner Darkly' was set in a cosmic horror universe, written with the same sort of tongue in cheek tone as Discworld. Not at all like his work at Cracked.

          The book I was recommended was This Book is Full of Spiders, the JDATE sequel, so yeah (original is still way better but it's not half bad I guess).

        - u/grekhaus:

          Yeah. It's been expanded out into a whole trilogy now.

  It works I guess?? It recommended only modern crime mystery books. Some other oddball stuff like sword art online was the only one I recognized.

  I won't be reading any of them because I absolutely detest any books set in modern earth but it definitely gives new options.

  My echo chamber is comfortable and cozy. Good books all around.

  I had a hard time getting it to pick books.  Eventually, I picked the widest selection of books that I enjoyed which still felt representatives of my tastes.

  American Gods - Gaiman (All sorts of Gaiman really)

  Men At Arms - Pratchett (I have / read every Discworld book)

  Tortilla Flat - Steinbeck (I have / read almost every Steinbeck book, especially the comedies)

  1776 - David McCullough (I read a lot of History for my job, sometimes for fun).

  2001: A Space Odyssey - (I like old school sci-fi, and this felt like the easiest one to find).

  Watchmen - (I read all sorts of comic books; ditto on it being easy to find)

  &#x200B;

  In response my top 12 was:

  2 volumes of Naruto - No

  2 volumes of Bleach - No

  2 young children's books - No

  Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson - No

  Borges - Absolutely not.  I loathe him, and I loathe the story they recommended.

  Abhorsen by Garth Nix - Maybe

  The Powder Mage Trilogy - Maybe, although I really don't want to read another book glorifying the military.

  Vorkosigian Saga - This one I've come across, but I'm still leaning towards no for the same reasons above.

  &#x200B;

  I've got to say, I'm less than impressed.  It seems far too focused on sci-fi / fantasy and children's lit.

    Abhorsen is fucking rad, just FYI.

      ```
      Cool; I may order it.  What's so good about it?
      ```

      - u/SlidshockingKrow:
        ```
        For me, at least, it's the worldbuilding. It's not super thorough or technical, if that's your thing, but it's so goddamn vivid. I haven't read Abhorsen or the Seventh Tower series in a decade, and I don't remember anything that actually happens in them, but I can still see the locations he describes in my mind.
        ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        As the other commenter said the worldbuilding is awesome--sort of dark gothic high fantasy, very memorable. The magic system is also totally iconic, I'd say on the order of Sanderson's Allomancy, but with bells instead of metals. Also necromancy rarely gets a fair shake in fantasy, this is the exception. 

        To be 100% honest with you I haven't read these books since middle school, but I absolutely adored them. Gotta find my copy of Sabriel and start again.
        ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    I would strongly recommend reading the first 2-book omnibus in the Vorkosigan Saga (Cordelia's Honor). It is absolutely not a glorification of the military.
    ```

    ```
    What's your beef with Borges? Not that not liking him is a problem, just curious.

    >The Powder Mage Trilogy - Maybe, although I really don't want to read another book glorifying the military.

    If you're on the fence for this one, I will confirm that it absolutely is glorifying the military (though less than I anticipated when I started the series), but that I really enjoyed it regardless. 

    Also, if you want a series that is similarly thick with intrigue and politics, but without the focus on the military, may I suggest The Tethered Mage by Melissa Caruso. It has a somewhat unfortunate love triangle subplot that was kind of annoying, but the worldbuilding and plotting is great and the main characters had a lot of moments where I was pleasantly surprised by them avoiding making the obviously stupid decision.

    ```
    Do you mean "no" as in "it doesn't challenge my views" or "no, it challenges my views but I think the quality is too low"?
    ```

    - u/FireHawkDelta:
      ```
      Naruto, Bleach, and Percy Jackson are all for children/teens and don't challenge anyone's views in a meaningful way. I'm not familiar with Borges.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        This and exactly this.  Borges' wrote the Infinite Library, which is an influence on one arc of Worth the Candle and Computer Science in general.  I read it and one other thing for class a decade ago and still remember strongly disliking his prose.
        ```

- u/plutonicHumanoid:
  ```
  It’s somewhat extreme but it definitely shows books I haven’t read or  considered reading. Got a lot of poetry, some romance novels, and a Christian historical fiction novel (which is a genre?) about King Hezekiah, which which sounded interesting until I realized it was a historical fiction novel and not a religious themed fantasy novel.
  ```
