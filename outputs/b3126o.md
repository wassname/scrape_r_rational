  I was messing around on your website and did you consider allowing comments on wiki entries ?

  Specifically 710mm is fairly short for a dagger (assuming irl measures), also daggers without and edge were a thing, they were mainly used for stabbing anyway, the edge just makes it a more useful tool in general, but triangular daggers and sword blades were a thing..

  Anyway you seem smart, I'll check out your story =D
