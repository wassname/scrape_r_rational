## Any HP fanfic that has an un-munchkin-able physics and society?

### Post:

ie. one where the magic system and the laws and customs are such that an intelligent person can't simply abuse the system.

  Harry Potter fanfic but not abusable?  No, there isn't. The HP magic system is completely broken, and trying to fix it would require so many patches it would be not-HP before you were done. 

  The general answer to this question is also probably "it depends on your definition of abuse."  When does it stop being sensible use and start being abuse?

    I started working out how you would have to change HP to prevent munchkinry but stopped when I realized I was essentially recreating the Dresden Files magic system.

      Yeah, Butcher did a good job with that.  There's no obvious "why aren't all wizards infinitely wealthy?" tricks in there, and when he pulls something new out (e.g. Harry using his fire spell to freeze something) it makes sense.
      ```

      Dresden Files gives a better explanation of why people in Harry Potter run around using latin phrases than Harry Potter does.

    How do you feel about the *Effulgence* treatment of D&D: a land where things *look* broken, but where the world keeps going because some Alien God (i.e. "the DM") smites anyone who so much as looks at the power curve funny?

    The equivalent would be, say, a really shoddily-coded website, put up on the public Internet, but with a perfect, magical Intrusion Detection System in front of it that triggers a satellite laser to blow up a hacker's house the moment they get in.

      I think that that is not Harry Potter, but is the only way you could keep something that looks like HP remotely in check.  It's also the system I used in [The Two Year Emperor](http://patreon.com/davidstorrs) because it's the only way I see to keep the D&D magic system anything like sane.

    Trying to make it all be sensible without abusing clichés like Matrix-like virtual reality or some higher-dimensional creature’s dream can be quite the conundrum. Especially so when your goal is to build a Cosmicism-valid universe and not one that operates based on psychological and moral traits of a single species.

      You can  treat spells as contracts with invisible spirits of nature and/or magic (something like Wildbow's Pact) Munchkining would be against the *spirit* of the contract and as such punished punished by spirits, may be indirectly (bad luck, alliances forming against offender spontaneously, super lucky enemy etc). In fact HP story could be considers as such punishment for Tom Riddle attempt to munchkin  horcruxes.

    Can you be more specific about some of the ways to abuse the HP magic system? I think most munchkinish fics I've seen interpret the rules in ways that are biased toward munchkinry that could easily have been interpreted otherwise. Free energy is the main trivial path to victory in HP that I see.

    Everyone in here is taking it for granted that canon HP is trivially munchkinable, without any discussion at all of specifics. This sends up alarms.

      I mean, Aguamenti exists. Free transfiguration is apparently fairly limitless. Unbreakable Vows are relatively cheap and insanely powerful, not to mention unicorn blood. Avada Kedavra, as canonically stated, is either completely unusable (because it hits bacteria) or insanely broken (because it only hits people and can't be stopped). Conjuration is also thrown out offhand, come to think of it. And oh god, the Fidelius...
      ```

      - u/chaosmosis:
        ```
        Free transfiguration takes Dumbledore skill levels and doesn't result in an automatic win. Unbreakable Vows are OP, I agree. The Fidelius seems limited utility. Conjuration seems limited utility. AK seems powerful but not so powerful that it needs to be changed. Unicorn blood is not worth the cost. Unbreakable Vows are the only important thing you've mentioned, in my opinion. Given their consequences, it's reasonable that almost no one would ever be willing to enter one. I think the fandom exaggerates the brokenness of canon often.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          What do you mean fidelius is low utility? 

          What if in the next goblin rebellion they fidelius gringotts? Hell, what if I fidelius gringotts? That’s even assuming it only works on locations too lol.

          So why doesn’t Dumbledore transfigure grey goo or botulism or anything else? Why in combat doesn’t he transfigure his opponents robes into metal or his own into Kevlar or unicorn hair? That’s assuming you can’t transfigure your opponents, say, hair, or bones, or heart...

          Why doesn’t any given maniac spam AK downward through the earth, or at Hogwarts or the ministry? Even in canon no shield blocks it.

          Canon is messed up lol. Let’s not even talk about the Philosopher’s stone, or Hallows...

      All spells taken from [Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spells_in_Harry_Potter)

      Aguamenti creates water, meaning that it creates hydroelectric power.

      Accio] can summon (apparently) absolutely anything.  How about writing down 'P=NP' and 'P != NP' on two sheets of paper and then saying "Accio piece of paper with true statement on it!"

      [Felix Felicitis](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Felix_Felicis) gives you incredible luck.  From the wiki: "Horace Slughorn claimed that he used the potion twice in his life: once when he was 24 years old, and again when he was 57, each resulting in a perfect day."  Okay, how about running some very difficult scientific experiment while under the influence?  Or brute-forcing a code -- the one password that you happen to guess will be the right one.

      Avis creates living animals (birds). Infinite food.

      Confringo:  Causes explosions.  Free energy.

      I put this list together in about two minutes, and I only made it to 'C' in the spell list.

      I explored all this in more detail in [Squiring the Phoenix](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11107471/1/Squiring-the-Phoenix) if you have interest.

  That's just never going to be true in non-Earthfic fiction barring anti-exploitation deities. No one author can think of all the exploits.  Our civilization has millions of people trying to exploit it and it's still exploitable anywhere that isn't string theory or a stock market.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Stock markets are still exploitable, it's just that we've added artificial meta rules to prevent it. It's exactly the same as "because a God showed up and said he would punish you if you did that."
    ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    Perhaps it would be clearer to say "not easily, quickly taken over by an intelligent outsider upon introduction".
    ```

  - u/luminarium:
    ```
    ok, so what about a fanfiction that tries to make it harder to exploit?

    Uh... all he has to do to escape the time loop is become immortal and the philosopher's stone is literally right there.

    Munchkined! 

    After a few near-immortal loops he will surely figure out how to make *everyone* immortal, and they can all hang out until heat death.

    After a few more loops in which *everyone* is immortal and working on the problem, perhaps they'll figure out how to embed the rest of humanity into the data structures within Harry's brain so they can send *everyone* back into the start of the loop.

    Boom, immortal humanity forever, we even beat heat death. "Unmunchkinable", hmph.

      I think that the point was that "the universe" or "God" or "the writer" was preventing him from succeeding in really changing anything, and causing more and more unlikely deaths when he tries to cross these boundaries.
      ```

      - u/glowingfibre:
        ```
        You can *always* munchkin. Even if one has concluded that one cannot fight and win against the malevolent entity depicted, there are still ways to improve one's lot.

        You can try to "kill" yourself in a way that propagates back to the beginning of the loop. Alternatively if the malevolent entity forbids that, you can memory charm away the past so as to end the subjective torture. Dumbledore has already established that memory charming works and does not disturb the malevolent entity's goals.

  My Immortal. It's so random, that it seems pretty impossible to abuse. :P
  ```

- u/brmj:
  ```
  I strongly suspect that to make that setting non-munchkinable, you'd pretty much have to have some sort of godlike entity working behind the scenes to keep it from being munchkined. You could maybe pull it off if you have the entire setting be the product of an especially weird singularity gone wrong, but that's probably not the type of story you are looking for.

  Alternatively, maybe it would work for either the capability to perform magic, or exposure to it, to have an impact on brain function that makes someone in a position to munchkin it most likely incapable of doing so?That might explain quite a bit about the setting, actually.
