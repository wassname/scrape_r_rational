  Haven't read this, I see it's a sequel. What's The Last Angel about? Rational  Space Opera?
  ```

    The last angel is about an AI built by humans that survived after they were all killed by aliens. It's still mad and is fighting a 2000 year long, one ship war.

    IMO it's a bit slow paced, with lots of flashbacks and perspectives from all the different sides. But there's also a lot of r/hfy to it.

  Is this the finale? Waiting to binge the last half of season 2 until it's done.
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    It's the *start* of the finale.

    From the top of the latest chapter:

    >And here, after 44 chapters of build-up, everything will be hitting the fan.   
    >
    >The next few chapters are probably going to be HUEG LIEK WHOA so to make things easier on myself and a (hopefully) consistent update schedule, I'll more than likely be posting them in halves.
    ```

  ```
  This seems interesting but I dislike the idea of reading it on a forum, is there an epub out there or am I out of luck?
