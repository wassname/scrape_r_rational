  Oof. [XKCD's Michael Jordan of Making You Feel Bad](https://xkcd.com/1027/) has been given a run for her money.

    Idk man I feel like Akua came out way on top that exchange. He got a couple zingers in but nothing as foundational as she did.
    ```

    - u/aldonius:
      ```
      Yes, and that's why xkcd's Michael Jordan of Making You Feel Bad has been given a run for her money.
      ```

      - u/ArcTruth:
        ```
        Oh fucking duh I thought that meant Kairos was giving Akua a run for her money when you guys meant *Akua* was giving *XKCD-girl* a run for her money.
        ```

  ```
  Man some super solid dialogue in this chapter.

  What was the crawling line referring to at the end?
  ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    Grey Pilgrim made him crawl away from the big drama before.
    ```

    - u/Wolydarg:
      ```
      Oohh duhh, for some reason that felt a lot longer than just the night before. 

      I kept thinking it might've been referring to how crawling is sneaky and how he might've sneaked Archer/Rogue away but that sounded dumb.

  > maybe one of these days I’d have to sit her down along with Archer for a friendly talk about Why Other People, Who Are Not Us, Matter. 

  If any of you watch the good place this reminds me a lot of a certain scene in the second season. 

  > “Is that a bedsheet?”  

  This is such a perfect thing for the heirarch. I like to imagine that every time it happens someone in the army tries to take the bedsheet clean it, mend it, embroider it etc. so he just gets another fresh dirty one each time. 

  Though as a representative of the people he would ensure Fair Compensation rather than engaging in Tyrannical Appropriation of the Property of the Common People. 

  > Akua said. “Queen of my heart, shall we proceed?”

  At this point Cat is just ignoring the blatant flirting which amuses me greatly


  >  So we resumed our advance as if we were untouchable, and so went untouched.  

  The bluffing her way into things (like stopping the cavalry charge) is becoming Cat’s signature move. 


  > “Did one of your most infamous emperors not style himself Traitorous?” Kairos said.
  >She laughed, rather cuttingly.
  >“Traitorous?” she smiled. “Oh, youth. You are barely even a Malignant.”

  The most Praesi burn ever. 


  > “I am more than blood,” Akua Sahelian hissed. “I am more than what I was made from. But you, Kairos Theodosian? You are the apostle of the cage, the congregant of scrapped iron.  

  Another reference to the “we can do better” theme? Akua has realised she can’t just lean into the Praesi history of madness, evil and treachery but she has to overcome it and use the good parts of it to become something more. 
  Don’t know why I didn’t notice the parallel with her and kairos before, they both wanted to be old school villains in rebellion against the new wave of “practical” evil.

    >Akua said. “Queen of my heart, shall we proceed?”

    it was both a flit and a pun, is glorious.
    ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  Got to be honest, I'm sad that Kairos is so hated now we can't have the same ridiculous banter and the like that used to happen. Miss that ship :P
  ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  So, like, for a while now I've been on the "Kairos' endgame is to put the Gods Above on trial before the Hierarch" train.  If so, he needs the Bard/Intercessor, since she is the one who speaks for them.

  &#x200B;

  He may also need Cat, since her Crows (I've been thinking of them as Gods Between) may be able to threaten Above/Below that they will join with the other.  He wants them to blackmail the Gods Above into speaking directly through Bard, use other means to get her to cooperate, and then put her on trial before the People.
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    I don't know if the Crows are as much Gods Between, as they are basically Angels for below, their power almost 100% from below, gifted through the sacrifice of their people on the alter that was the Everdark to achieve immortality for the rest, and finally completed with the seed of Godhood that was Cat's mantle. Gods Between isn't a bad name for them, as it's not like they follow Bellow's orders or anything, but they are most certainly not neutral in any way.
    ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    I think if anything that's thinking too small. Creation is after all the board on which Both sets of Gods play, to say that Tyrant would leave either when he could get both is thinking too little of him.
    ```

- u/avret:
  ```
  motion to update Akua's name to Mistress of Mic Dropping?
  ```

- u/Flashbunny:
  ```
  Worth noting Kairos, who can no longer tell lies without keeling over dead, just told Cat that "a greater game is in the works than [she] suspect[s]." Granted that's pretty vague, but it's unequivocally true.
  ```

  - u/earnestadmission:
    ```
    Kairos is not an Oracle, he’s merely constrained from uttering falsehoods. So this says merely that Kairos believes there’s a greater game afoot (for Kairos’s personal definition of “Greater”, “game”, and “afoot”). It may be more constrained if he also has to use words unlikely to be misinterpreted by Cat.
    ```
