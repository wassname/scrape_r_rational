  Checking out the relevant [We've Got Worm](http://wevegotworm.libsyn.com) episode after each arc might do close enough to what you're asking. Great podcast, and could be finished by the time you make your way through the story again (they're on Arc 26 right now, one episode per week).

  ```
  Yep, I've been thinking of doing the same. What kind of pace are you thinking of setting?

  I'm about halfway through a reread right now for not-Ward reasons, and it's already making Ward interludes and such more interesting to me
