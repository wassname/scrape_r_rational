  Did a cat fall asleep on the keyboard at an inopportune time?

  > As Hannah had saidâ€”it was the Hogwarts Express. What could possibly happen?

  Oh he should _definitely_ know better.

    That's Hannah's name in Draconic, of course.

      The 9 is silent. Silent 9s are a main feature of Draconic.

  This chapter makes me happy, it's nice to see Milo and Fiona finally talk. And now we're going to see Hogwarts again! My anticipation is palpable.

  ```
  Amazing chapter as always.  Still, I wonder how Dementors will react to Milo given I'm unsure if they should be treated like torture or mind magic, which Milo seems to be able to shrug of easily or more as living a "goodness" vacuums to be introduced to a good-aligned character with potentially disastrous, temporary alignment flipping results.

  Any thoughts?

  This story is so much fun. I started reading it for all the hardcore  munchkining, but when Fiona was introduced it took on a whole other life. It's like two fanfics in one!
