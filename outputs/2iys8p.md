  Hey everyone!

  [The Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention) that I've been talking about is finally live!  Please take 90 seconds to check it out; I took me 46 separate takes to make a 35 second video, and I'm going to be very sad if no one watches it.  Oh, and if you felt like reading the text and / or donating while you're there, that would be very cool.

  If you don't want to give, please take a look anyway and give me your feedback -- I intend to do more of these, and I can't improve without criticism.

  Again, the first 48 hours of [a Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention) pretty much determine its success (bandwagon effects for the win!), so if you think you might want to donate it would be very appreciated if you'd do it today.

    I just discovered Kickstarter won't accept Paypal, and I don't have any credit cards. I'm glad to contribute ten bucks in exchange for the $10 tier rewards if you could direct me to a suitable email address to send it to, but raising the green bar to $300 is apparently not in my power. 

    I don't have much of a critique- I think the video was short and to-the-point and the whole Kickstarter seemed equally straightforward. I am curious, though, about how your plot can adapt to having one of several different word counts. Granted, it sounds like a really cool idea for a reward, but when you say that 20,000 words could potentially be added to the story, would that affect the nature of the plot, or would it be roughly the same story with five times the breathing room?

      Yeah, Kickstarter only accepts Amazon Payments.  Which **really** cheeses me off.  Not only because they are a non-standard payment provider and most people won't have an account with them, but because I found it a pain in the butt to set up my merchant account with them so that I can receive money through Kickstarter.  

      I admit though, it was easy to set up a personal account on Amazon Payments.  I'll give them that.

      Anyway, you can use this email to PayPal me: **dstorrs.payments@gmail.com**

      I just now set up the PayPal account, so it's possible that it can't receive yet but, if not, it will be able to in a couple of days.

      As to the plot thing...there's a lot that I could do here.  Writing it as a 5,000 word short story requires keeping everything really tight.  Writing it as a novella would mean I could explore the characters' backgrounds a bit more, as well as the cause of the supernatural goings-on.  I could also extend the number of bad things that happen and spend more time on the psychological deterioration it will cause.  So, there's advantages at every length.

        Amazon payments _does_ have one incredible advantage though: Lets you pay with money you make via mechanical turk.  So even poor bastards like me can put in a few hours of boring work and fund you :)

          *blush*  Thank you.  It's incredibly flattering that you would put time in for this.  I really can't tell you how much I appreciate it.

            You've already given me hours of entertainment with your stories, I'm just paying time for time :)

            And I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to Pay Attention.  I'm one of those guys that yells at the tv about how stupid the protagonists are in horror stories.

              Fair enough.  :>   Have you read "One Hot Night"?  If not, PM me your email and I'll send it to you.

              > I'm one of those guys that yells at the tv about how stupid the protagonists are in horror stories.

              Me too!  That's a big part of why I started this whole thing.

              Although, actually, even if it weren't for horror movies / TV, I'd still be going to the special hell.  At a movie, I tend to lean over and whisper to my friends when I think of something funny, or when something stupid happens, or etc.  I'm very quiet about it, at least.

                I have, actually!  I bought it a little while back after I made a little money dogsitting.  It was a fun little story, just the right length for the price, and I want to see how Ingfred's day in court goes :P

                  Hm.  I hadn't actually thought of doing a sequel to that.  I'll chew on it a bit and see if anything falls out.  Thanks for the idea.

                    You've got a pretty good world and pretty interesting characters, so I think you've got plenty of material that you could work with.  Besides, usually when you think of a society with magic, you think pre-renaissance levels of technology and society.  Seeing a magical society that actually _uses_ the magic to boost themselves up to post-scarcity... That's pretty innovative for fantasy, and a lovely thing to see.

                      Oh, I've been intending to write more in the Anundjå setting.  I just hadn't thought of doing a direct sequel to "One Hot Night."

                      Among other things, the story of "How Albrecht defended the Legion camp from the first attack of the drauga" has been itching to get out of my brain.

      Those are great points.  Thank you; I'll have to check if KS allows me to update the video after the approval / launch.  If so, I'll take another crack at it.
