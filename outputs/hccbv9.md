  ~~**Voting time!**~~ E: Voting is closed.

  And so ends the Spire saga!

  You can assume Link & Fi updated Zelda regarding everything. Zelda is currently en route back to Hyrule.

  **What do you do next?**

  * Head towards the location Link saw in the vision ASAP! Go fight some ghosts!!

  * So *about* that Ja'bu situation…

  * [X] Do *all* the research

  * Go directly back to Castletown and make sure it hasn't collapsed in a pile of flaming rubble since Zelda's been gone

  * Have Zelda visit with the troops near the front to improve morale

  * Followup on Triforce pieces? Gorons? Vesyrn? Golvara? Lost Woods?

  * Other (write-in)

  Your previous VP total was 2679.

  Following the Obsidian Spire dungeon crawl, Fi is left with 963 VP and 972 stored magic.

  (Most of this was updated in realtime but not itemized, and included converting VP to magic, stamina restores, several ethereal and intangible avatars, and telepathic communications.)

  Chapters 16-18 spanned 2 days. During that time, you earned 54 VP from Zelda and 164 VP from Link.

  You have earned 125 additional VP per day in place of the usual incentive bonus. Total = 250.

  Link's spiritual awakening generated 8988 VP.

  **You currently have 10419 VP.**

  I am just astonished at how much the ancient [glagolitic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glagolitic_script) character equivalent to modern cyrillic Ѣ or Я looks like a triforce. Serious, look at that thing:  "Ⱑ" 

  It's perfect for any Zelda fanfiction.

    One of the first things I did in worldbuilding was crafting(/generating) the pseudo-languages. For ligatures, I chose sets of unicode characters that were thematically appropriate (i.e. - looked cool). I too was shocked by how *awesome* that one in particular is.

  EDIT: This plan is cancelled as a result of QM feedback; a reduced-scope replacement plan will be created shortly.

  [Plan: Magitech Mysteries]

  [Next Steps: Link]

  * Head off to hunt ghosts.
  * Have Fi conduct scans to see if Link's essence has changed.
  * Attempt to see if you have new abilities, especially in regards to wind magic. 
  * Test if you can make yourself float or fly. 
  * Test to see if you have stronger wind blast capabilities. 
  * Test if you can imbue your sword with wind.
  * Practice Invigorate + Sword Move combo that you were previously advised to practice.

  *Transfabrulator Research*:

  * Spend up to 100 VP researching the transfabrulator. 
  * Perform active scans while Link practices with the item. 
  * Attempt to study how individual functions work, such as conjuring and projecting objects. 
  * Attempt to discern how it recharges after use, and if that self-recharging function could be emulated.
  * Attempt to scan to learn what type of power (VP, mana, etc.) powers the item.
  * Attempt to discern if it may be possible to recharge the transfabrulator manually with magic or VP, but do not attempt to do it yet.

  *Courage Fragment Research*:

  * Spend up to 50 VP on performing scans on Link's courage fragment. Attempt to discern if it is currently recharging, and if so, if how long it may take to recharge after each use.
  * Attempt to discern the type of magic used in the fragment (e.g. green, void, a mix, etc.)
  * Attempt to discern if it may be possible to recharge the fragment manually with magic or VP, but do not attempt to do it.

  *Book Research*:

  * Have Link briefly skim over the books with Fi to determine their general subject matter. If any of them have information that may be immediately relevant (e.g. material on fragments, Demise, Lightsworn, any form of magic that or magic item that is presently unable to be replicated, etc.), have Link go through high priority sections with Fi translating.
  * If there's lots of relevant information, consider sending a sheikah or two to deliver the books to the Last Bastion to drop them off with a trusted sheikah agent for immediate delivery to Zelda. (If this occurs, then have the sheikah return to meet up with Link + remaining sheikah afterward.)

  [Next Steps: Zelda]

  * Zelda heads back to to check in on the kingdom and resume her rulership for the time being.
  * Get updated on the current situation. Assess regent candidates. Assess possible candidates for holding power fragments.
  * Explain marks to the council.
  * Discuss marking council members, as well as allies from other species, e.g. goron, zora, etc. to help secure an alliance and gain intelligence and long-distance messaging capabilities.
  * Make a public speech to raise morale before leaving her kingdom again, both to raise support for the regent and to clarify that she is not abandoning the kingdom - she is gathering allies (like the gerudo and zora) and taking the war to the enemy. 
  * If possible, spin up propaganda to emphasize the heroic role that Zelda and Link are taking, likening them to heroic figures of the past that proved to be the salvation of Hyrule.

  **Taken from /u/Mathematicae:** 

  * Meet with Vestele personally, because of the sensitive nature, to have the seekers review what sort of sacrifices and boons the Fae usually demanded/gave. Ganondorf is probably using it for more power, so we want info on how he could use it to benefit himself. Additionally, Fi might be able to replicate what the Fae did with VP.
  * Get some language training in Gerudo speech, mostly so Fi can listen in and be capable of translating the language. If we can have Zelda and Fi relay translations for the dungeon crew if need be that would be nice too.
  * When possible, she begins working on research projects. See research projects section below.

  **Research Ideas:**

  While traveling, Zelda will attempt any of the following projects that she personally feels, based on her magical expertise, have any reasonable likelihood of success. She will employ reasonable safety precautions, such as putting Luck spells up before testing anything potentially dangerous, Foretelling right beforehand if applicable, and having a healer nearby (but outside of any predicted potential blast radius). If applicable, she may have someone else physically do any dangerous components of the testing and stand nearby to do the healing herself.

  *Rod/Imbue Research*:

  * Attempt to draw on Blue Burst and Blue Imbue at the same time with the intent of creating an ice rod.
  * If this does not work, attempt to mix a Blue Burst with a Green Imbue and see what happens.
  * Attempt to imbue an item with all three colors of magic at once in a sufficient quantity that it would normally cause the item to glow and reach the state of conceptual improvement. See what happens.
  * If none of the previous methods have caused the creation of a new form of item, but also have not caused anything dangerous to occur, attempt a triple color imbue + Blue Burst on the same item if it is physically possible to do so.
  * If we manage to get a triple imbued item, but it doesn't seem to do anything different than a normal imbued item, attempt to power it with up to 50 VP to see if that does anything.
  * If we manage to get an item to hold both an imbue and a burst, but that doesn't make it into an elemental rod, attempt to power it with up to 50 VP.
  * If none of the mixed imbues work, attempt to power a normal imbued item with up to 50 VP and see if that does anything.
  * If any of the tests seem like they are noticeably working toward successfully making something like an ice rod, spend up to 500 VP to make a functional ice rod.

  *Empower Research*:

  * Note: Need to find out if VP was spent on Empower research during the dungeon crawl; if so, will amend this or remove based on results.
  * Spend up to 50 VP attempting to research the Empowerment function that was used on Zelda with the intent of learning how to create a scaling version of the effect with variable power output.
  * Utilize any data that Fi has available from pre-empowerment Zelda, during empowerment Zelda, post-empowerment Zelda, and other baseline scans of Hyleans in this research process.
  * Also utilize information from other forms of temporary magic transfer, e.g. siphon, and similar abilities such as Marking, Imbue Object, and Invigorate.
  * **Intended magic goal:** *Scaleable Empowerment* - This empowers the target, temporarily granting them a tremendous increase in ability by suffusing them with old magic. The level of improvement scales with VP expended, with a minimum expenditure of 100 VP and no upper limit. This lasts a variable duration based on the VP expended in this process.

  *Triforce Research*:

  * Spend 50 VP on general scans on Zelda and the fragments when they are not obviously in use to develop baseline data for them.
  * Spend up to 50 VP running scans on Zelda and her fragments while Zelda is sleeping, attempting to discern any changes in Zelda's mental and spiritual state that may be linked to the wisdom fragments activating and giving her prophetic dreams.
  * Spend another 10 VP scanning Zelda when she casts Fortelling to see if there are any similarities.

  **Fi Memory Projects:**

  Defer this to a future update or ignore entirely if the QMs do not feel it is appropriate to include in this update.

  * Ask Fi if Marking someone who speaks another language would give Fi an easier time comprehending that language.
  * If Fi consents and believes there is any possibility of success, attempt to use Healing magic to restore Fi's lost memories. If this does not work or seem viable to Fi/Zelda, discuss if it may be possible to restore Fi's lost memories through other means, such as direct applications of VP.

    Some good stuff here!

    First I just want to say I really appreciate having a player such as you so dedicated and engaged with the quest. Please don't take any of this as more than "constructive criticism" -- just trying to prod ya'll towards more productive paths and/or provide more usable and actionable information in plans.

    A few points:

    > Have Fi conduct scans to see if Link's essence has changed.

    What *precisely* are you trying to accomplish or find out here? I'm not saying it won't be fruitful to try this, but you're likely to get more out of it if you specify to Fi what you're looking for and why.

    In absence of additional information or extenuating circumstances (the silvery egg right after marking Link was one such circumstance), telling Fi to "do scans" is going to result in her pumping VP into a thing and seeing what happens. She can also spend time observing and try to detect when things are giving off significant (i.e. - more than trace) quantities of magic, but there isn't anything *unique* about her ability in that regard, and the result is going to be "it's magic" or "I don't think it's magic."

    I realize some of that might be new info (or at least not explicitly stated before), but in general Fi isn't a magic-oracle or a magitechnobabble omnitool. Due to the nature of Marks, she will be able to tell you conclusively that *something* changed with Link's essence after he drank the water, but that doesn't mean she knows what result of the change will be or how it will manifest.

    > Explain marks to the council.

    You'll have to do more legwork here and specify what exactly it is you know about marks and what all you want to convey. Also, is there anyone in particular you want to share this with, or literally "the entire council?" There are the main figures that Zelda herself usually interacts with (Lensa, Nyllara, Adresin, Taetus, Wymar), but keep in mind there are a few dozen nobles and other elected officials that comprise the full body.

    > Discuss marking council members, as well as allies from other species, e.g. goron, zora, etc. to help secure an alliance and gain intelligence and long-distance messaging capabilities.

    "Discuss" to what ends? What are you trying to accomplish? "Help secure an alliance and gain intelligence and long-distance messaging capabilities" is incredibly nebulous. What should the end state of this discussion be? Or is this just a general "see if the NPCs have ideas?"

    (Not that I want to discourage you from asking NPCs for ideas -- that's completely fine and could lead to interesting things. Just note that if we're doing most of the legwork and have to spend a significant amount of time modeling and simming background NPCs it's probably going to result in less VP rewards. That *could* but is not guaranteed to be offset by "interestingness of worldbuilding.")

    > Make a public speech

    Going to need more than that.

    The subject matter listed is good, but if you want there to be a *public speech* written on screen, you'll at least have to outline it. So she's gathering allies, taking war to the enemy, and expressing confidence in her chosen reagent. That's all good, but *how do you intend to have that resonate with the people she's addressing?* That is the bulk of the work here, and it's wholly omitted in this bullet point.

    Note: There was a similar bullet point in the chapter 5 plan that was similarly frustrating. Again, it's fine to leave the details of the speech up to Zelda (/let qms fill it out), but as written I can't do much with it without substantial work.

    > If possible, spin up propaganda to emphasize the heroic role that Zelda and Link are taking, likening them to heroic figures of the past that proved to be the salvation of Hyrule.

    Good idea, but again, suggestions or specific ideas to try would be helpful.

    > Note: Need to find out if VP was spent on Empower research during the dungeon crawl; if so, will amend this or remove based on results.

    There was not time for this during the dungeon crawl.

    > Spend 50 VP on general scans on Zelda and the fragments when they are not obviously in use to develop baseline data for them.

    I don't know if this was written onscreen or as a bullet point anywhere, but one of the first things Zelda had Fi try was dumping VP into the triforce fragments. It doesn't work. They also can't be imbued.

    Note: As part of the next update that includes research, I intend to have a Zelda journal entry cataloging all the things that were previously Fi-posts and/or IC forum/reddit posts to consolidate.

    General feedback:

    While overall well-written and comprehensive, this plan is unacceptably long. I would greatly appreciate if you could pick out 3-4 elements of it you want most to focus on.

    Keep in mind timelines (previous updates have all been at most a few days), how long you expect the items to take to explore in-universe, how much of chapter you expect it to take to address, and how much detail you want us to go into. Those are the most relevant criteria as to what gets written and what doesn't. Generally I like to aim for >5k words per chapter and <10k words. The content of this plan is like 5 or more chapters' worth of material.

    General bullet points to get balls rolling like "continue to X location" or "send a message" or "arrange a meeting for X" are fine to include.

      Oh, sure! You're welcome, and I actually appreciate the criticism - it helps me get a better idea of what you're looking for in a plan, which is extremely helpful. Thank you.

      > What precisely are you trying to accomplish or find out here? I'm not saying it won't be fruitful to try this, but you're likely to get more out of it if you specify to Fi what you're looking for and why.

      Sure! I wasn't very specific because we don't really understand much about Fi's scans, both because we haven't broken her conlang and because they're deliberately abstracted. 

      My intent was something like:

      * General goal: Determine if there are measurable components of Link's essence changes that correspond directly to affinities, Lightsworn status, and specific Lightsworn powers.
      * The end-goal for the above information is to figure out if these metrics can be used to measure these characteristics in individual people, and later influence those metrics in some way.
      * For example, let's say that Link has five essence attributes that are being measured: A, B, C, D, and E. When Fi conducts her scans from before and after Link getting his lightsworn status, we observe (hypothetically) that A through D increase from 5 to 10. We also observe that after drinking the water from this particular dungeon, D increases again, from 10 to 20. We can speculate that "D" may have a relationship (but not necessarily a causal relationship) with any new abilities Link acquired in the dungeon.
      * My expectation is that the reality of things like affinities may be more complex than a single measurable stat, but this is generally the type of thing I'm looking for. If it's multi-variable or non-numeric, that's all still good to know as players.

      That said, your following lines appear to imply that this is not a valid test method.

      > I realize some of that might be new info (or at least not explicitly stated before), but in general Fi isn't a magic-oracle or a magitechnobabble omnitool. Due to the nature of Marks, she will be able to tell you conclusively that something changed with Link's essence after he drank the water, but that doesn't mean she knows what result of the change will be or how it will manifest.

      The reason for my confusion here comes down to two main factors:

      * We haven't broken the conlang, so we don't really know what Fi has already told us about essence. This is largely player-side.
      * The description of Research Magic *does* make it come across like Fi is a magitechnobabble tool.

      In specific, this line:

      > Fi attempts to engineer a modulated attunement matrix to convert raw Void Power into Magic Power and channel it towards a useful purpose.

      If Fi is not supposed to be a magitechnobabble tool, I would like to request a description for Research Magic that provides us with a bit more context of what Fi is and is not capable of doing with her scans. Currently, I think the open-ended nature of the description of Research Magic is a large part of why we, as players, have routinely had difficulty writing up magic research requests in ways that make sense to the QMs and/or provide the players with desirable results.

      > You'll have to do more legwork here and specify what exactly it is you know about marks and what all you want to convey.

      Good clarification, thank you. Will revise.

      > "Discuss" to what ends? What are you trying to accomplish? "Help secure an alliance and gain intelligence and long-distance messaging capabilities" is incredibly nebulous. What should the end state of this discussion be? Or is this just a general "see if the NPCs have ideas?"

      Understood, will clarify or cut.

      > Going to need more than that.

      Sounds good, will clarify or cut.

      > There was not time for this during the dungeon crawl.

      Okay, great, thank you.

      > I don't know if this was written onscreen or as a bullet point anywhere, but one of the first things Zelda had Fi try was dumping VP into the triforce fragments. It doesn't work. They also can't be imbued.

      These are both super good notes, thank you. Appreciate this very much.

      > grumblegrumble

      Would something like, "Have Fi scan to attempt to get metrics for improvements on affinities and specific Lightsworn powers" be possible and useful? 

      > While overall well-written and comprehensive, this plan is unacceptably long. I would greatly appreciate if you could pick out 3-4 elements of it you want most to focus on.

      Understood. Will do.

      Thank you for the detailed feedback!

        ---

        A few points:


        (1) The character of the player interface has changed considerably since we started. As with Legacy, Fi threatened to overwhelm the story, and her involvement often sidelined the actual characters. This was a mistake, and I have since issued a retcon to correct it. As a result, everything written in the original SV thread (including Fi's infoposts) is no longer canon. The only canon material is what has been written in the "Story" section on the website. That said, some of the stuff that was previously included as footnotes/Fi-posts will be written in as Zelda journal entries very soon, likely the next chapter.

        ---

        (2) Fi's posts with language-gibberish are *intended* to be opaque. The intent of the language-gibberish was firstly to add flair and interestingness to the setting, and secondly (mostly with Fi) to hide seams of the interface. Sometimes we use Fi as a convenient way to provide additional context or IC information in-universe. That doesn't mean you get to query her for arbitrary information or worldbuilding details, and pushing in that direction will result in running into non-answers and gibberish responses.

        More explicitly: You aren't going to break the conlang and learn anything new. You're of course welcome to try (not like I could stop you), but I am very confident you will not succeed. This is by design. With the system I wanted something that would output the same language-gibberish given the same input, and would even have some features of languages, but that would be completely infeasible to reverse-engineer. In this way it is more akin to a fancy hash than an actual translation to a conlang.

        ---

        (3) With Fi, we did not create or find an actual sentient magitech construct to base her on, nor do we know in detail how one would function. Aside from being woefully incomplete, any attempt to systematize Fi would be riddled with holes that would be exploited to death and cause the world to explode in a flash of munchkinry overnight. As a result, her interface with the world is ill-defined.


        That isn't to say "anything goes"; far from it. Other elements (i.e. magic) are very well defined. Fi interacts with those elements, and while *her interaction with them* will be abstractified and glossed over, this does not mean she is capable of doing anything unique, that wouldn't be in-principle possible for some other entity in-universe to do.


        That actually works as a general rule: unless it's in-principle possible for other entities in-universe to do a thing, Fi can't do it either. Further, everything she *is* capable of will be constrained to (a) making sense given the conceit that she exists in the first place, and (b) will, to the best of our ability, not generate plotholes or inconsistencies.

        Put another way: if we write her being able to detect hormonal changes and stress-response activation, then yes you can use her as a crude lie-detector. But that doesn't work in reverse; you can't use her ill-defined nature to foist new capabilities on her.

        No "scanning."

        ---

        (4) As for "[difficulties] writing up magic research requests in ways that make sense to the QMs and/or provide the players with desirable results":

        There is no "tooltip" for research. The post you reference was only ever meant as a fun way to provide information to players. It was flawed in a number of ways, and yes also misleading. Mea culpa. It has since been retconed.

        I've said this before, but you will get further with research if you cease treating it like an ability to be invoked and more like a scientific undertaking that requires work, intelligence, and active engagement to make progress on. Make "doing research" a focus of your plans (i.e. - a dedicated undertaking by your characters), rather than a footnote to be maybe considered while engaging in more demanding tasks (like trekking through the desert), and you will see results.


        Put another way, "research is not a free action."


        ---

        Hope this helps and/or clears things up.

        Unfortunately, I'm not looking to enter a protracted discussion on any of these points -- there just isn't enough time in the day. As such, feel free to discuss but I won't be responding any further in this thread.
        ```

- u/Mathematicae:
  ```
  \[Plan: Wordcount Matters\]

  Please reply with suggestions on changes to the plan. I've borrowed a number of research items from u/Salaris.

  \[Link Actions\]

  * Wait a day or more at the spire if food supply won't be an issue. This gives Zelda time to locate Ibosso more precisely than a vague 'somewhere east of here'
  * Attempt to see if you have new abilities, like stronger magic affinity, a larger mana pool, or instinctive understanding of an ability like what happened with Invigorate.
  * Experiment using the *Transfabrulator* with the Sheikah trio while Fi runs tests on it. Let them ~~play with the new toy~~ practice using it as well (assuming a non-Lightsworn is able to).
  * Head off to hunt ghosts, resupplying at small bandit camps as needed.

  \[Zelda Actions while journeying\]

  * Check with Shesan and Naibi on what they know about Ibosso, his tribe, and his burial site. Also ask the Order of Sages, via scry-link, if there are any records on a Gerudo king named Ibosso. Fragment should not be mentioned over scry-link.
  * Talk to her advisers, Laylith & Izu mainly, about what Hyrule does with the blin corpses. I suppose checking with Shesan on what she knows about Stalfos would be prudent as well. If Ganondorf can turn them into Stalfos, he could raise another army in the middle of Hyrule! Perhaps the dream about skeletons refers to this potential threat? The corpses should be destroyed if it's not done already. Send orders to that effect via scry-link if needed.
  * Get some language training in Gerudo speech, mostly for Fi's benefit.
  * The attribute associated with the power fragments might be ambition. Does Shesan think Naibi would be a possible candidate and does she agree that ambition as a character trait might be it? Distressingly, Taetus might be the most ambitious person Zelda knows if she can't find anyone else suitable.

  \[Zelda Actions back in town\] Marking this down as future reference of things to do in future plans.

  * Once back in Castletown, arrange to meet with Vestele in person, because of the sensitive nature, to have the seekers review what sort of sacrifices and boons the Fae usually demanded/gave. Ganondorf is probably using Sacrifice for power, so we want info on how he could use it to benefit himself and harm Hyrule. Additionally, Fi might be able to replicate what the Fae did with VP.
  * If the Zora members of the Order of Sages are willing and able, have them give Zelda a crash course on speaking the Zora language. Only do it for however long Fi thinks it will take for Fi to understand the language. Read them in on Fi's existence and her language ability if needed to convince them.
  * When some blin have been captured, they might talk to each other if confined together. Zelda and Fi can listen in. If her advisors have other ideas about how to get blin prisoners to talk, that would be lovely.
  * Ask Lensa for her help in getting a short list of suitable consorts.

  Research:

  *Transfabrulator Research*:

  * Spend up to 100 VP researching the transfabrulator.
  * Attempt to study how individual functions work, such as conjuring and projecting objects. Can Fi replicate the functions using VP?
  * Attempt to discern how it recharges after use, and if that self-recharging function could be emulated.
  * Attempt to scan to learn what type of power (VP, mana, etc.) powers the item.
  * Attempt to discern if it may be possible to recharge the transfabrulator with magic or VP.

  *Book Research*:

  * Have Link briefly skim over the books and papers with Fi to determine their general subject matter. If any of them have information that may be immediately relevant (e.g. material on fragments, Demise, Lightsworn, any form of magic that or magic item that is presently unable to be replicated, etc.), have Link go through high priority sections with Fi translating.

  *Empower Research*:

  * Spend up to 50 VP attempting to research the Empowerment function that was used on Zelda with the intent of learning how to create a scaling version of the effect with variable power output.
  * Utilize any data that Fi has available from pre-empowerment Zelda, during empowerment Zelda, post-empowerment Zelda, and other baseline scans of Hylians in this research process.
  * Also utilize information from other forms of temporary magic transfer, e.g. siphon, and similar abilities such as Marking, Imbue Object, and Invigorate.
  * **Intended magic goal:** *Scaleable Empowerment* \- This empowers the target, temporarily granting them a tremendous increase in ability by suffusing them with old magic. The level of improvement scales with VP expended, with a minimum expenditure of 100 VP and no upper limit. This lasts a variable duration based on the VP expended in this process.

  **Fi Memory Projects:**

  Defer this to a future update or ignore entirely if the QMs do not feel it is appropriate to include in this update.

  * Ask Fi if Marking someone who speaks another language would give Fi an easier time comprehending that language.
  * If Fi consents and believes there is any possibility of success, attempt to use Healing magic to restore Fi's lost memories. If this does not work or seem viable to Fi/Zelda/Link, discuss if it may be possible to restore Fi's lost memories through other means, such as direct applications of VP.

    I might write up a revised plan of my own, but honestly, it wouldn't be far from this.

    I approve of this plan.

    I'd still like to get to the rod research eventually, but we can save that for later.

    Edit: Also, we should do some research on Barrier creation soonish as well.
    ```

    - u/Mathematicae:
      ```
      I cut the rod research since Vecht indicated my plan was adequate, but still had too many things for one update. 

      We also have the purple gem that reacts differently depending on if a Lightsworn or non-Lightsworn touches it. Might be a useful data source for Fi when doing Lightsworn related research.
      ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    I'd suggest including Taetus as a potential candidate for using the Power Fragments (partially out of amusement at Zelda's realization of such and partially because I think he *is* one.), as well as consideration toward marking him for similar reasons. If she doesn't trust him, all the more reason to do so.

  Reaction post for all three updates incoming. I was a participant in the live session, so I get partial blame for stupid stuff Link does. I also get partial credit for smart stuff Link does, which I will be more than happy to point out!

  >The Shifting Sands proved to be less of a challenge than Link anticipated.

  Way to tempt fate Link. If you die it’s not our fault. (It totally will be our fault)

  >“*Mother Above*,” Koja muttered off to Link’s side. “You weren’t kidding. That thing is *huge*.”

  Strangely enough, no one made a dirty joke here.

  >“An ancient structure built—probably by the Goddesses themselves—to seal away an otherworldly evil from beyond the Void,” Grenja said with confidence. “Obviously.”

  I don’t think we have enough evidence to support that claim, Grenja.

  >Murals on the walls depicting the Holy Mother and her Lightsworn armies had been defaced.

  Zelda would be horrified at the defacing of ancient artifacts

  >“Zelda says Shesan has no pertinent information regarding the runes,”

  How shocking /s

  >“Yes, Master,” Ryn said, imitating Fi with a clumsy pirouette. Link let out a snort of laughter despite himself, and the others had a good chuckle too. Fi twirled in mid-air, as if to show her how it was properly done.  
  >  
  >“That kind of relationship, huh?” Koja said.

  Let the dirty jokes begin!

  >“Fi, notice anything unusual?” he asked.  
  >  
  >“Yes, Master. Towards the center of the room lies the remains of an improbably large annelidoid creature. Also, the ceiling is unusually luminous.”

  You need to work on your phrasing, Link

  >“I understand your confusion,” Fi said. “Allow me to clarify..."

  That was not a good clarification Fi. Here, let me show you how it’s done. ‘This is not a good research project.’

  >“Maybe we should take some physical samples too?” Ryn suggested. “Might help. For research, I mean.”

  Poor phrasing is something you two have in common.

  >Link sighed. So much for that. “So, uh. What about the ceiling?” he asked.

  Link, phrasing.

  >“To clarify: the light is significantly dimmer than that of the sky. It is however the same color as the sky. Precisely so, in a way that is difficult to describe in your language using terms you understand.”

  So this means the light is the actual sunlight. And the ceiling is enchanted to somehow let the sunlight through, but dimmer. Wait! Did we find the great hall for Lightsworn! Hogwarts?

  >“How can you even touch that thing? Holy Mother Above—it’s *ficking hot!*”  
  >  
  >“Err… no it isn’t?” Link examined the gem again, rubbing his hand over the surface. It was uniformly cool to the touch, and hadn’t changed in any way—even where Grenja touched it.

  I don’t recall this happening during the live session. We should have Fi run some tests on it, although my guess is that it’s because of Link’s—

  >“Must be his magical Lightsworn powers,” Koja said confidently.

  Yeah, that.

  >“I guess that would explain why no one else has taken it yet,” Ryn said.  
  >  
  >“Hey, *you* managed, didn’t you?” Koja said, giving her a nudge. “What do you think, Ryn? Wanna give it another go?”

   *sigh*

  >“Koja—” Ryn rolled her eyes, placing a hand on her hip. “That’s not even a good joke. Look, if you’re going to tease me about ficking his brains out, at least—”  
  >  
  >“—*Girls!*” Grenja chided. “Come on! We’re better than this!”

  Grenja, evidence.

  >Link cleared his throat. “Maybe we should try the blue-runed wall?”  
  >  
  >“Oh yeah,” Koja said cattily. “I bet you’re just *dying* to slide your gem into that socket.”

  Oh, Hylia when will it stop?

  >The gem leapt from his hand and snapped into place with an audible *click*. The blue runes flashed and disappeared as the gem pulsed and spun in a half-turn clockwise. An echoing rumble, and the wall raised upward into the ceiling.

  ARRRGH! Priceless ancient artifact lost! I mean it was apparently just a door key, but it was a really cool door key. Or a really *hot* doorkey for non-Lightsworn.

  >“Seriously, what even is this place?” Ryn asked rhetorically.

  Grenja, evi—

  >A resounding *vwoom!* echoed from behind. Link spun. A shimmering golden barrier stood between him and the others.

  And this where we first started panicking.

  >“Master,” Fi said from the other side, “I regret to inform you that due to potent magical interference, my assistance will be limited in this area. I will still be capable of observation and direct telepathic communication, but I will be unable to manifest an avatar or channel my other abilities while you are within. I recommend proceeding with a greater degree of caution.”

  Fi? Could you do an ELI5 again?

  >“Oh… um… hmm…” Grenja articulated, poking at the barrier. “Hey, uh, Link? It won’t let me through.”

  Never mind Fi, Grenja’s got it.

  >“Hey, don’t sweat it,” Grenja said with a big grin. “You’re the singular most badass guy in the kingdom, Link. You got this!”

  …You and Link are both getting remedial training in not tempting fate. Also, Grenja, evidence.

  >Link looked to her quizzically. “How do you know that?”  
  >  
  >“Because you didn’t hear what I just sent you telepathically.”  
  >  
  >“Oh.”  
  >  
  >Koja snickered.

  Care to share your dirty joke with the class Koja? Please don’t.

  >“Why does what still work?” Grenja asked.  
  >  
  >“My sword?” Link waved it around.  
  >  
  >Grenja stared at him incredulously for a moment before his face went pale. “Oh, fick. Fick!”

  Another dirty joke in 3….2…

  >“No, you *dolt*,” Koja said, rolling her eyes. “I can’t heal scrambled brains. And his brains aren’t scrambled. He means—why’s it still imbued?”

  Koja! that was the perfect— I mean, excellent point we should investigate this after Link finishing looting. Speaking of, we still haven’t moved out of the vestibule. I’m also very impressed at your restr—

  >“Wait, why’s Ryn imbuing *your* sword?”  
  >  
  >“Isn’t it obvious?” Koja said. “It’s because she’s imbuing his *other*—”

  Never mind.

  >“Apologies,” Fi said. “It was not my intention to upset you. I will continue to observe from a more socially appropriate distance.” She floated about six feet away and continued to peer down at him.

  Obligatory social distancing joke.

  >Link decided to press on ahead.

  And there was much rejoicing. By the QMs, because we finally got on with it.

  >The door was now open.

  5,000 words just to open a couple doors. The poor QMs.

    Part 2

    >Link heard a low rumbling noise coming from nowhere in particular. He turned around to see guardrails rise up around the pit. Also, a stone door now blocked the entrance to the room from whence he came.

    It’s a boss room!!!

    >“*Aaaah!*” Link remarked, grabbing the left switch again. It wouldn't budge. He definitely didn’t panic as he tried the right one a second time.

    Yes, Link is far too smooth to panic, unlike us.

    >As he traced around the north edge of the pit, two vaguely humanoid figures came into view—a pair of skeletons still half-buried in a mound of sand.

    Eeek! Mini-Boss!

    >Exploring the rest of the pit,

    LINK DON’T TURN YOUR BACK ON THE MINI-BOSS!!!

    >he found several small indentations along the floor, each less than two feet deep. There were six in total; each of them uniquely shaped—each the bottom half of one of the perfect solids: sphere, tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron.  
    >  
    >Was it a puzzle? If so, Link had no idea what he was supposed to do to solve it.

    …Link even my 2-year old can solve this puzzle. You just take the blocks and put them into the indent with the right shape.

    >Better safe than sorry. Heart thumping in his chest, Link rushed the skeletons, stomping their skulls into pieces and breaking a few of the other bones for good measure.

    No boss?

    >Link hefted it in his hand. It was almost identical to the blue one from earlier.Blue gemstone: blue-runed door. Red gemstone…? Was it really that easy?

    This dungeon is so easy even my two-year old could do it.

    >“So let me get this straight,” Grenja said. “For who knows how long—possibly *thousands* of years—the Lightsworn can’t manage to kill a giant worm monster. Then one day, big G-man just waltzes on in here and gives it what-for.

    My nickname is canon!!!

    >“Seriously?” Koja let out a long sigh from a few paces behind. “Grenja, you are never allowed to question my naming of things *ever again*.”

    I hate you.

    >At the center of the room was a pedestal with a small ornate box, trimmed in blue. A skeleton in tattered rags lay near its base.

    Eh, just another skeleton to desecrate, no big deal.

    >…Was that it? Seriously? Was *that* supposed to be a challenge?

    Remember, Link. This is a dungeon for two-year old—

    >The once dormant bones began to shake and rattle. Black smoke clung tightly to them, inhabiting and animating the previously lifeless body.

    AAAAH!!! STALFOS!!!

    >*Another* wind tunnel? Link wasn’t about to get sucked in this time.

    If it hadn’t been for me, and another guy, Link would have been sucked in again.

    >Huffing, Link stood over the remains of his re-dead enemies. Blood oozed from a nasty cut on his forearm, and he was pretty sure he had exhausted his magic reserves.

    On a more serious note, we screwed up this fight. Stalfos are apparently capable of independent thought and coordinate with each other… Hey, um, didn’t Zelda have a dream about a horde of Stalfos?

    >“…I should go,” Link said, turning to leave.

    I got that reference.

    >Link chased the rabbit through a branching hallway into a long, narrow room, then into a shorter hallway and then into another smaller room with many entrances and exits and then up a ramp and into another long room and then back again to the *other* room and then back to the branching hallway and then…

    Let’s turn on some appropriate [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK6TXMsvgQg)

    >He’d have to map the place out and think of something clever…

    \*Gets out popcorn\*

    >The rabbit chittered and squeaked loudly in the next room over as if to mock him.

    Snnrk

    >Link fished out a bag of shiny pebbles from his pack, then took a step forward. The rabbit’s ear twitched and it crouched like it was about to hop away. Link stopped.“Was that a yes?”“Squeak squeak.”Link waited for a good minute before extending the bag and——The rabbit turned and hopped off.

    Lol

    >Link took aim, carefully lining up the shot—*Clink!* It harmlessly glanced off the rabbit’s side.  
    >  
    >*SQUEAK!*

    *pfft*

    >“Just wait, you little shit,” he muttered, pausing for a short breather. “I have just the plan for— wait, where are you going? No… nonono—”*Click! Fuzz.*Link fell forward onto his hands and knees as the block dematerialized. He punched the ground over and over as inarticulate cries of anguish escaped him.

    Aren’t puzzles fun?

    >Link cackled like a madman as he held the blue gemstone high in the air above his head.

    Let’s get Link another therapist.

    >*Seriously?!* How many more trials did he have to go through? Wasn’t the rabbit enough??

    Eh, the rabbit was probably the boss so it’s just another Stalfos or two.

    >the room was filled with large bones. Gargantuan, oversized bones that looked like they belonged to a creature from a storybook.

    Ok, a lot of Stalfos.

    >At the center of the room, sitting inside a pentagonal-shaped recess was… a shiny, semi-circular object?

    LOOOT!!!

    >In front of him stood a towering skeletal abomination. A… skeletal Hinox? A *Stalnox*!?

    We were panicking so much here someone, who most definitely wasn’t me, did a prompt to have Link let the Stalnox hit him.

    >Link half-stumbled into base camp from the west, trailing puddles of water. Koja sat by herself on the stairs, tending to her nails. Ryn was lying sprawled out on a bedroll, staring up at the ceiling. Grenja was doing pushups near the entrance.

    I think the Sheikah might need therapists too.

    >“What the fick, man?” Grenja darted over. “Stal-*children*?” He paced around, lifting Link’s arm. “Did they bite you? Are you infected?!”

    Grenja, evidence.

    >“*I do not want to talk about the rabbit*,” Link said, trying and failing to keep the tension out of his voice.

    Lightsworn rule #1. Do not talk about the rabbit.

    >“Wait—hold up,” Koja called out from behind. “Remind me, why’d you need the block again?”Link stopped and pivoted. “To solve the puzzle?” he answered.

    Yes, the toddler puzzle.

    >“The chest behind the iron bars with an ominous sandstorm pit nearby, containing a puzzle that is almost certainly a trap?” Koja clarified.

    Well yes, but there’s—

    >“And have you thought to avoid the trap by just *breaking through the bars*?”“Yeah, of course,” Link said. “That was the first…” He trailed off as his thoughts caught up to him. He glanced down to the transfabrulator on his belt.  
    >  
    >No other way too…

    Oh.

      >The kneeling warrior wielded a gleaming sword with a blue hilt—a sword that glowed with a holy light, surpassed only by the radiance of the Mother Goddess.

      Heh, Shesan was wroooong!!!

      >two warriors stood back-to-back, facing away towards either side of a branching path. One wore robes and their hands glowed with magic. The other wore armor and brandished a sword. 

      Sword lightsworn or mage lightsworn. Gee, I wonder which one Link is? /s On a more serious note, the third mural has some serious plot significance too. Here, let me dig up the description from our dungeon run. 

      >*The mural on the floor is very similar thematically to the one in the previous room. Hylia stands at the center surrounded by glowing figures wearing flowing robes. The figures have their arms outstretched, and a multicolored sphere separates them from the darkness at the edges.*

      Remember that barrier we saw in Shesan’s vision? Looks like the mage Lightsworn were involved in creating/maintaining it. Anyways, back to funny comments

      >Was he ready?

      Link, you’re a Link. Ready is your middle name.

      >Surely the threats ahead wouldn’t be *that* dire. How bad could they be? Nothing else in this place had proved to be all that dangerous…

      You just had to think that.

      >Link’s longsword was among the finest quality in the kingdom, but it was certainly not a mythical blade capable of banishing evil to the depths of the Void. Would the *Sword of Evil’s Bane* be required to proceed?

      …Link, stop setting off so many death flags!

      >He was probably overthinking it.

      YES! Go slay some monsters! Stop. Thinking.

      >“Just in case you *are* still listening,” he muttered. “In case you do have a hand in this still… I could really use some help right about now.”  
      >  
      >Fi appeared at his side. “I would be happy to help, Master. What is it you need assistance with?”

      Hylia is there anything you *can* do to help us? “Well gosh, Link, I could give you my amazing magical construct. Do you think that would help?”

      >Link grinned. Why had he ever doubted?

      Excellent, we have our Link back.

      >A small handheld device that ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧꡙ→Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ and ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗꡙ→ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔꡙ.

      Is this an instruction manual? In Fi conlang? The crypotography guys are gonna have a field day.

      >Runes all along the rocks lit up with an eerie green glow. The ground rumbled and Link nearly lost his footing. The pile *moved*, boulders shifting over one another as they rose up into the air.

      Time for some boss [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2vaSlpliEs)! 

      >Link could barely believe what he saw. Before him stood a *Stone Talus*—a mythical creature of living rock!

      Meh, they’re easy. Just pepper it with bombs from the sheikah slate…. Oh. Well, you’re doomed Link.

      >The Stone Talus reared back. All too late, Link realized it held a boulder in its left hand.  
      >  
      >His stomach sunk to his feet. He turned and—

      No….

      >“Fi… tell Zelda… tell her I…”  
      >  
      >The darkness took him.

      NOOOO!!! He died to the first boss?!

      >Link snatched the transfabrulator from his belt and spun, creating a block off to the side. Several tons of certain death filled his vision, the mass growing larger with every passing thought. He pointed and squeezed.

      Courage fragment, you’re the best fragment type ever. 

      >A blast of air sent Link stumbling back. He struggled to stay on his feet. Ahead, the Stone Talus writhed in agony amid a cloud of shimmering dust. Glowing spiderweb cracks radiated from a missing chunk at its right shoulder—its entire arm had been obliterated.

      Now that’s the Link action I signed up for!

      >Link barely had a chance to register the event; an enormous aracha burst from the ground, skittering over the sand with frightening speed and kicking up a trail of dust in its wake.

       Ugh, [Spiders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRhnEnnpHJY).

      >Link smacked himself. It wasn’t *courage* that he lacked, but *wisdom*.

      Speaking of wisdom, have you thought about reapplying luck?

      >He couldn’t very well choose to give up on his ideals, could he?

      Well you could, but then you’d probably lose that OP Courage fragment.

      >“Goddess Above,” he whispered, feeling once more the conviction burning within. “I *will* be your champion.”

      That’s the spirit. Now go kill that last boss! And reapply luck.

      >If he wasn’t looking for it, he might have missed it. On the far side of the room, two mounds of dirt shifted.

      Great. A duo boss.

      >…How did they know where he was?

      Tremor sense.

      > The worm-creature jerked and twitched violently, but its thrashing grew weaker with every attack until at last it fell still.

      Yay! Link's not dead!

      >Please place the transfabrulator upon the altar so that it may be used to test the next candidate, then proceed ahead to receive your blessing.’”

      No, no we’re here to *get* loot not give it away.

      >A large basin stood at the center of the platform, filled with shimmering, sky blue water.

      My Cosmere senses are tingling.

      >Huh? He lifted it in and out of the water. It wouldn’t fill. Not only was the waterskin empty, but it was still bone dry.

      Is this a perpendicularity? Fi! We need to do some science on this ‘water’.

      >He bent forward and cupped his hands, taking in a mouthful. It was ice cold, but in a nice way. It had to be the best, most refreshing water he’d ever tasted.

      …Link you just resolved to be wiser and here you are ingesting unknown substances.

      >Link grunted. “Uhhhh—*hrk.* Maybe that wasn’t the best idea.”

      Yes, maybe next time think that *before* you do the dumb thing. In fact, I have a simple acronym for you to remember. WWZD. What Would Zelda Do. Except, Zelda’s a drug addict so maybe that’s not a great acronym.

      >Above, a rift in the sky opened to an endless golden expanse. Around him, the lake flowed outward from a single island at its center, cascading over the edges of a great structure in five tiers of luminous waterfalls.

      Pretty

      >“Be brave, my child,” Hylia said sadly, her fingers brushing over his. “Go forth, and defend the realm.”

      Good thing we brought 3 Sheikah. That way Link can go fourth!

      >“Aww yeah, new mission!” Grenja shouted, pumping his hand in the air. “Time to kill us some ghosts!”

      No, no we’re supposed to free them from their prison, move on to the afterlife or something not kill them. Also, they’re already dead.

      >“Right now, I need a good, long nap.”

      After writing this I need one too, Link.
