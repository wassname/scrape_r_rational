## Secret Krampus Prompts Voting

### Post:

Welcome to the Secret Krampus Contest!

We'll be seeing who has the best prompt!

The winner will be ~~working in a coal mine~~ whoever gets the most votes!

All of the prompts will be posted as top level comments and anyone can vote for whichever prompt that they liked.

The voting will close on September 13th, 11:59 pm (EST) and the winner will get a month of reddit gold and bragging rights.

Anyone can vote, including the participants.

Some people haven't submitted their stories yet, but I will permit stories to be submitted after the deadline. They just will have less time to gain votes just like how late submissions for the Biweekly Challenge had less time to gather votes and win.

The only prompts posted here will be for people who have also submitted a story.

This means that some prompts posted here don't have a story written for them and some stories that were submitted, were written for a prompt where the prompter didn't submit a story for the contest.

  ```
  Prompter: u/red_adair

  Prompt: A doomsday meteor will soon hit Earth! Can you convince your parents to help you stop it before bedtime?

  Suggested framing: You are a brilliant young scientist whose talent and acumen for building experimental doohickeys has won you many social media followers. Last month, you discovered and constructed an experimental device that seemed to confirm that the world would be impacted by a doomsday meteorite next year! You've spent your last month's allowance on widgets and thingamabobs to help you build the refined super-device that will help you and your correspondents across the globe determine whether this rock will hit or miss Earth, but you're missing one critical component.

  Suggested framing: You have latent psychic abilities that allow you to feel the future deaths of people you care about. You didn't know this when grandma died last year, but now that the whole world will die, you've figured out what your power is.

  Suggested framing: The last electronic toy your $family\_member gave you wasn't what it said on the box: it was a receiver for messages from the future. It's sending you messages from yourself, $time\_span in the future.
