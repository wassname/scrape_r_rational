## [D]You know what would be interesting? Rationalist McDuck.

### Post:

As in "Uncle Scrooge". It'd explain how he managed to own half the planet, too.

  His secret is his wealth management via a holodeck with a full body haptic interface. By feeling the flows of money as virtual coinage, he can get a feel for the market unmatched by any normal analyst.

  I loved the Scrooge McDuck comics as a kid. Rationalist McDuck would be a force multiplier on his awesomeness.
  ```

    This reminds me of the old "Whose hoard would you rather steal from: a dragon's or Scrooge McDuck's?" threads on /tg/. 

    Even before his rationality force multiplier, nobody wants to steal from McDuck.

      With a dragon, at least you can hide in a small space. McDuck will hunt you down and shove your head up your ass.

    The money bin is nowhere near his entire wealth. Those are merely his most liquid assets.

    Geddit, cuz he swims in it? :D

      Actually there was one episode in which it was said that all the cash in his vault is merely that with some form of sentimental value. Fist coin earned on each venture and such.
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        ...I don't think Scrooge is old enough to have that much sentiment.
        ```

- u/ancientcampus:
  ```
  Heck, McDuck already *is* very much a rationalist. The stories about his early life and his road to wealth are full of ambition, risk taking where opportunity arises, and serious critical thinking. (as opposed to race cars, lasers, aeroplanes). Highly recommended.

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  If you rationalize Duckburg, you've got to explain Darkwing Duck as well, since he's in the same universe via Launchpad McQuack.
  ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  OK, you go ahead and explain how he can literally swim through money.
  ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    He can swim through it because they're his most *liquid* assets. ;D
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      NOT HELPING :)
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    He's not perfectly rational. That's why he spent all that money on developing a gold-coloured gelatine additive that conceals into small disc shapes.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      Congeals?

      That... almost makes sense, but you still can't swim through jello like that.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Oh, no, that bit's nanotech/superpowers/handwavium field generator beneath the pool.
        ```

            ```
            The Local Council attempted to send a lightning bolt in retribution, followed by a host of tall winged figures named Erika wielding flaming swords.

            Said tall winged figures are enjoying their Honolulu vacation house, and I finally got to test out that supercapacitor charge system.

            When I then winked at the Local Council, He grumbled, rolled His eyes, and did say: All Right, You Wrinkly Mallard, You Win This Time.
