  I have finished reading the prologue and first chapter.

  This appears to be the story of a man, born from the unholy union of a Harem Protagonist and a Yandere, with a correspondingly traumatic childhood.

  He is Transported to Another World shortly after becoming a NEET.

  I have not seen this particular mix of tropes before and am mildly interested.

  I will continue reading for the time being.

  Is there more than one English translation source?  Because the only one I can find is pretty low quality.

    The one in the link i posted has the TL by shalvation. I thought that their translation was p good... Did you maybe find a more obscure translator?

      (Not OP)

      I think it's probably a matter of expectations. By light novel standards the translation is pretty good. I enjoyed the small amount I've read so far. But not everyone reads light novels, and so they go in with expectations set by the fluid prose of English-native novels. Even professionally-edited LN translations can't do that without essentially rewriting the story, since what works in Japanese/Korean just *doesn't* when it's ported into English. The languages emphasise different things.

      To anyone unfamiliar with the writing style and the quirks of translation, stuff like awkward pronouns ("That person surely did..."), stilted dialogue ("I treated you like an accomplice of equal standing, and yet, did you not look at me as if you were looking at trash?"), lack of environmental or personal descriptions, etc. are all very common features of the format. Anyone used to reading light novel translations wouldn't blink at them; they're not a sign one way or another of how accurate the translation is. But if you haven't read one before, they make the text seem amateurish.

        This is exactly it. I'm reading shalvation's translation and it looks pretty accurate so far. However, that accuracy is the reason it doesn't flow well or sound good in English, a common problem for light novels. Rewriting (or localizing) Japanese text is the only way to solve the issue, but fan translators often either prefer a direct, accurate translation or just won't take the tame to do it, which is understandable since they're not getting paid. Still, so far this story is much more readable to me than some of the other LN translations I've seen like Mushoku Tensei.

        Another problem is that light novels by nature are, well, light. They don't use enough description to give you a clear picture of what's going on a lot of the time, and you're more likely to get a narrator telling you what happened instead of showing you. It's the nature of the genre, unfortunately.

  After reading what's available of all three volumes, I would say the quality has decreased with each volume.

    I would agree. I'm currently on the second one. The first one had some interesting plots, despite the fact that they were based around outside knowledge of the game that the readers didn't know. The second one has turned into a sort of love novel thing, and I don't even know what the main plot is supposed to be.
    ```

  - u/t3tsubo:
    ```
    I agree, I put it down a few chapters into book 2 to come see if anyone here read further so I can know whether the quality/rationality picks back up guess that's not the case.

    Book 1 was a good light read though.

  ```
  I just read the first two chapters and I think it's a fairly interesting read, albeit I'd only recommend it to people who already like this sort of story.

  The interesting part I wanted to comment on was that [after the tutorial](#s " there was a perk called Cronus Heritage where the player can 'save' his progress every ten years and reset. In addition, both the tutorial and 'game' are both set at difficulty, Lunatic. I suspect that if the main character had allowed himself to die, he would have had a reset of the tutorial, and the tutorial would get progressively easier with multiple deaths.")
  ```

  - u/TheAtomicOption:
    ```
    Possibly. I would have definitely gone for that save feature just so that I could shout "LOAD GAME" after every mistake--even if you have to repeate 9.9 years of flawless play to undo a last mistake, it'd be worth it to have a perfect life. But I wouldn't ever try to rely on being allowed to continue if I fully died. What if the game resets, but this time you're not posessing the demon? What if when you die, you're just dead and it's someone elses turn? Too risky.

      > You know on an intellectual level that there are people who would choose something other than the black pill, just like you know on an intellectual level that there are people who shoot up schools. That doesnâ€™t mean you expect to ever understand it.

      Almost that kind of feeling, right? I get that the protagonist is playing to his strengths, but not choosing the ability to save is definitely suboptimal. It's not like he's really getting anything out of his chosen ability so far.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        That's not a work I see referenced nearly often enough.

        Also: BRUTE STRENGTH.

        Also also: Did anyone else who has read this feel bad for the Green Pill person? That one, sadly, didn't really seem to get the concept of their pill.

  ```
  I'm slightly appalled at people's tendency to comment before reading or after reading a very small portion)

  That said, the novel is very good, if a bit too serious.

    If we didn't, we wouldn't comment for like a week and we'd have lost the link to the thread.

      Touche.
