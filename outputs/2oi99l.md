## Building a world to write rational fiction in. Would love feedback.

[RT] [HSF][HF][BST]

I would like to get some input about the basic premise of a world I am building to write rational fiction in.

Go Here for the most recent version.  It's too big to put in Reddit without breaking it up.

** Original version **

Humanity managed to make it to the stars, using generation ships, but shortly after the generation ships left the Sol system, Earth and it's first colony, Mars, warred with each other.  The generation ships received many messages, and monitored many transmissions during the course of the horrific war which lasted several months, but eventually, the Sol system went completely silent.  It is unknown if any of humanity survived in the Sol system, but there were no radio transmissions, for hundreds of years.

The planet Secundus was the second known extra-solar rocky planet with liquid water found around a stable star. It was a lifeless, barren place when the generation ship Leviathan arrived, several centuries after leaving Earth.  None of the original crew or passengers were still alive when Leviathan arrived at it's destination, but the citizens of Leviathan had maintained a civil society.  The colonists were mostly well-educated and industrious.

Leviathan was meant to start a core colony, and seed the world with Earth life-forms.  Genetic material from almost every known creature on Earth was included in the ship's storage, and it's databases contained nearly the entire sum of genetic knowledge that the human race had collected.  The colonists could populate the planet with Earth life forms, modified Earth life forms, and even new forms of life, if they wished.  Unfortunately, Leviathan was not designed to be a base for heavy industry.  Prometheus, which was nearly ten years from completion when Leviathan had left the Sol system had itself never left Sol.  The energy of the initial acceleration of a generation ship would have been impossible to miss.

The colonists would need a habitable world in order to prosper.  The star that Secundus orbited had no other rocky planets, nor any asteroid belts, and very few free asteroids.  There were a few rocky moons around three gas giants, and Secundus itself had a substantial moon, but Leviathan didn't have the proper industrial capacity to establish an in-space colony.  They were a forerunner ship.  A terraforming ship.

For all the crew of the Leviathan knew, the other colonies might fail, and the descendants of Leviathan might be all that remained of humanity.  There were many powerful arguments either way, but it was eventually decided that Leviathan would use it's available resources in the way that they were intended - to terraform Secundus and provide the best possible place for their descendants to survive, in a biological environment as close to Earth's as possible.

Tiny interstellar probes had told planners on Earth what to expect from Secundus.  The planet was significantly larger in diameter than Earth, but about the same gravity.  It was very iron poor, with no radioactive materials to speak of.  There was some tectonic activity, and some small amount of iron in the crust.

The oceans of Secundus contained a good deal of dissolved iron, collected over billions of years of exposure to the underwater recycling of the planet's crust.  Additionally, the oceans of Secundus were very large, and contained many times more water than Earth's oceans.  The landmass of Secundus was split into several disconnected continents, and a great many islands, but the total area of dry land was significantly less than half that of Earth.  It was almost an ocean world.

Hundreds of years had been spent planning during the voyage, fifteen generations participated.  Every resource on Leviathan was planned for, every likely problem had been considered and a great many unlikely scenarios as well.  Everything would be used.  After Leviathan finally arrived, the great work began.

The colonists started with microbes and bacteria, yeasts and molds.  Then came ferns, lichens, moss, grasses, and simple invertebrates.  Soon after that were crustaceans, arachnids, insects, followed closely by woody plants, bushes, fruits, vegetables, fish and then birds.  After twenty years, the Leviathan started seeding the planet with small mammals.

The lack of surface iron and other metals on the planet was a problem,  The small mammals and inland plants of most types also had difficulties with lack of metals.  This had been foreseen, but the geneticists wanted to see the real scope of the issue before they modified any creatures.

After some time experimenting with expendable probes dropped from the orbiting Leviathan, locusts were modified.  Each year after the end of the growing season, they would emerge and head from inland to the seaside, consume seaside plants, which had plenty of iron and other trace metals in them, and then return inland to breed, lay eggs, and then die.  This mass migration, every year, moved sufficient quantities of iron inland to improve the health of inland plants and animals.  Most mammals that did not consume fish would still need to be modified to better retain iron.

The colonists would need metals for industry as well, and the Leviathan simply did not have the materials or industrial equipment required to create an Earth ecology as well as create the industry required to support either deep crust mining or massive water electrolysis efforts that would be needed to supply significant metals.  Instead, most species of crabs were modified to collect metals from seawater for use in building their shells.  From iron to silver, gold to copper, modified crab biology collected a great number of useful metals from the ocean.

Nearly a hundred years after Leviathan first entered Secundus orbit, colonists began to be delivered to the planet. Once down, nobody was allowed to return.  The industrial costs of maintaining the cargo shuttles wasn't ruinous, but it was significant.  Every down shuttle was carefully loaded for maximum efficiency, and every up shuttle was empty.

Humans who had lived in artificial environment inside a gigantic cylinder for decades experienced the real thing, and for the most part, they were happy.  For another twenty years, the terraforming of Secundus was carefully monitored.  The first colonists on the planet bore children who had been conceived there, and the first children born on the planet had their own children.  All seemed well.

Leviathan was large enough to pose a threat to life on Secundus if it de-orbited, so it was landed on the moon of Secundus, in a crater. Over the next hundred years, the great ship was stripped of everything useful that was not required to operate the ship.  As metal-poor as Secundus and it's moon were, creating another Leviathan would be absurdly difficult.  There were already long term plans to eventually send Leviathan back to Earth when they had enough of a population to crew it and not leave Secundus with a dearth of capable adults.  The colonists were confident that even if truly terrible things had been done to Earth, by the time the Leviathan could return, well over a thousand years would have passed, and it was likely that the Earth would be habitable again, if Leviathan came prepared to restore her.

It was a grand plan, but evolution raised it's ugly head.  A genetic variant of sand mite developed, somehow incorporating modified genetic material, probably from fiddler crabs.  The mites were extremely small, and aggressively sought out strongly conductive metals of all sorts, consuming them directly, for use in their carapaces.  The colony's computers, lab equipment, even their shuttles were made entirely useless in a single season.  The most sensitive and high powered computer equipment was damaged beyond function first.  Those were the computers that once ran the genetic programs.

A high tech society crashed back to the equivalent of the pre-computer age in a single season, but as a whole they were strong people, and there was no question of their survival.  For a thousand years or so, there was sufficient metal from the colonists' supplies to allow metallic tools to be fairly commonplace.  The mites preferred more conductive metals, but would all metals and incorporate them into their carapaces.

Eventually, nearly two thousand years after the mites consumed the computers of the colony, metals were almost unheard of on Secundus.  A metal tool was worth a king's ransom.  No matter how well kept, if a metal tool were exposed and used, it would be consumed by the mites in anywhere from months to a few years, depending on how carefully it was protected between uses, and how often it was exposed.

And that's the rough world background story.  Anyone spot anything in there that needs to be looked at from a rationality point of view?

### Comments:

- u/Anakiri:
  ```
  "And that, Mr. Moore," concluded the head of the review committee, "is why we will not be approving these *ridiculous deathtraps* of yours."

  "With respect, sir, that all sounds rather farfetched-"

  "Do you deny that the loss of either of the vessels will damn the other, and doom the mission to failure without rapid improvisation from the survivors?"

  "Well, that's true, but-"

  "That alone throws your credentials into question! If we are already sending two ships to a system *known to be poor in certain resources*, then the first city-sized ship shall be a *giant robotic supply crate* and whatever autonomous asteroid mining equipment we have available. The star system should lack nothing by the time the first living soul arrives, and then *Leviathan* will have its own industrial equipment *anyway*, because having a generation ship that is not self-sufficient is *lunacy*."

  "Actually, sir, that can't be done," said Mr. Moore. He had run the numbers on this. "With the population we have to support, we're already close to the mass limit of the-"

  "So lower the population! Or are you already so near the population viability limit that a single sector hull breach could kill the mission? Even if it were so close - which would get your proposal denied all on its own - there's a genetic engineering suite onboard. God's sakes, man, you're growing deer in test tubes! Include human DNA - genetic colonists - and we can maintain an *arbitrarily large* genetic population for an arbitrarily small headcount. Genetic viability is not a concern.

  "*Furthermore*," the head continued as Mr. Moore flinched, "What is this nonsense about being unable to build a space colony? Generation ships *are* space colonies! And this contraption had *better* be able to build a copy of *every single part of itself*, or else it will already be doomed by centuries of compounding minor mechanical problems."

  "But the-"

  "Granted," the man waved him off before he could even speak the obvious objection. "The main drive system and fuel are not so easily replaced. But onboard repair mechanisms alone ought to be able to build a fully functional space colony given adequate resources, if not an interstellar ship. And as an engineer, a lack of resources would be *your fault,* because *everything* is your fault. Thinking of it, *Leviathan* itself would serve as a quite serviceable counterweight for a space elevator, don't you think? That's cheaper, easier, and safer than messing with shuttles, and the mass of a carbon nanotube cable is practically negligible to a city-ship, even if it isn't built in to the solar sails. Hell, you could genetically engineer spiders to build more on-site, as a backup, and have your shuttles as a backup for *that*."

  Mr. Moore gulped. He hadn't thought of that.

  The head of the review committee sighed, and some of the venom left him. "Look, Mr. Moore, I applaud your terraforming plans. It took cyanobacteria two hundred million years to terraform Earth. Even with intelligent oversight, getting it down to a single century is as impressive as anything I've seen. But I must advise you to include basic knowledge of *mosquito nets* into all future documentation, and I urge you to recognize how extremely useful *airlocks* are on a barely habitable rock. That's the least of it. Your plan could fail in a *dozen* places, in a *dozen* ways, with *no* backup. You could *get thousands of people killed*. We are engineers. Imagining the worst case scenario and stopping it from ever coming about *is our job*. I'm sorry, Mr. Moore. I am placing you on administrative leave pending investigation for continued employment."

    And *that* is what makes a rationalfic within the broader genre of science fiction.  Well done.

    Not that it's unrealistic to have fools in charge of a big government project #civilizational_inadequacy but the mark of rationalfic is that somebody, somewhere is thinking more clearly than usual.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    In order to offer some suggestions for changing things around to get the desired result:

    The robot/industry ship *did* go first, it just failed when it got there. Probably due to something that a human might have been able to compensate for but the autonomous systems couldn't, information about the system that just wasn't available when the mission was launched, or maybe just from plain bad luck - a serious meteor strike in just the right place that was outside the extremely generous engineering requirements for the project. Since it takes centuries to get to the planet, it makes sense that the generation ship would be in transit at the same time, since humans aren't patient enough to wait for phase one success over that time span, especially if there are concerns about existential threats and the colony was envisioned as a back up. Maybe both ships are launched at the same time, and the industrial ship was supposed to make it there sooner because it could accelerate faster with no living souls on board - and it was in contact with the generation ship the whole time anyway through radio.

    The generation ship not being able to build a copy of itself isn't that unbelievable. It can be built with dozens of redundant systems, fabrication capabilities for 99% of its internals, and still not be able to build a second copy of itself, at least not without supplies. It can simply be a case of the engineers planning for some very bad scenarios and things happening that are even worse than that (whether they're outside of scope or simply considered too improbable to engineer for).

    I think that patches most of it. The second ship can (and does) complete the mission even though the first ship is toast, so you can't fault the engineers for that. Space elevators or shuttles is more a matter of what's practical given their engineering and the planet in question. Maybe space elevators are just really hard to do, or the planet has too much debris orbiting it to make that practical (maybe because the first ship's malfunction or accident left something like Kessler syndrome around the planet). I think I would actually make most of the shuttles one way only, so the generation ship would be carving off portions of itself after they had run from Plan A all the way down to Plan Y.

    And if not for the mites, it *still* would have worked. Airlocks are over-engineering if the atmosphere is breathable, mosquito nets aren't really necessary if every lifeform on the planet is known to the colonists, so it's believable (to me) that they wouldn't have much of a defense. Or maybe they had all those defenses in place, and the mites still got in (riding on clothes, for example) and played havoc with their systems and put them in a state that was beyond recovery.

    I guess I'm picturing a civilization where genetic engineering has outpaced most other technologies, and the space travel (and fabrication) technologies are only about at the level that you'd need to build a generation ship. No AI, no nanoassemblers.
    ```

    - u/Anakiri:
      ```
      I mostly agree, most of it isn't that hard to fix. I just wanted to emphasize the point that, in a rational universe, smart people see probable failures coming. Whatever your first thought is, they've thought it also, and they don't like it.

      I would quibble with one point, though. Airlocks are over-engineering if the atmosphere is breathable, but there should be some ground stations from before then. You can't monitor everything from orbit, after all. The shuttles should definitely have airlocks, and should be nearly impenetrable. Genetic engineering labs should have clean rooms. There are all sorts of isolated areas that should be really hard for the mites to get in to, especially once the characters figure out their technology is being eaten. As for mosquito nets, I'd expect them to have some because mosquitoes are necessary for healthy ecosystems. You can't just bring the organisms you like.

      Of course, human failure is the weak point. A single lapse in procedure could contaminate the isolated areas, and over a long enough time they'll be destroyed one by one. So I'm not really disputing anything, I guess. Just that it should take longer than a single season to lose *everything*.

  While I definitely second Anakiri's narrated remarks, I do want to say you had me at the locusts. That's mostly brilliant, and I would really love to see more of the culture and society that works with that ecology.

  Your source problem, I think, is that you're sticking to the initial premise you wanted: A metal-poor cargo cult. This was clearly a great inspiration for the initial world-building iteration, but now you should drop it until you can find a reasonable way to get what you wanted. But right now, reasonable people plus your original setup don't get you a metal-poor cargo cult.

  The solution is really easy: Iterate some more! Now to subject you all to an attempt at narration -

  "And here we have the results from the first stage of the Drake Extrasolar Planetary Survey. We focused on G-type main-sequence stars within XX lightyears, in order to keep the ark-ship travel time to under XX centuries. We restricted our survey to systems with Earth-sized planets in the so-called Goldilocks zone, and have ranked the results based upon system resources, planetary atmosphere, and planetary water. There was some initial debate about whether to target or avoid planets with signs of life, but the question was rendered moot when none were found in any candidate systems.

  Note that we are NOT considering systems with promising system resources but WITHOUT an appropriate planet - while the o'Neal cyclinders and other orbital colonies are both effective, and serve to demonstrate the viability of Arkships (after all, an Ark is basically an orbital with an engine), it is this project's specific goal to create new Earths. If you're interested in purely spreading humanity, that's two doors down with our friends at the Lagrange Survey.

  With that, let's go over the results...

  ..which brings us to the second system on the list, the proposed target for the *Leviathan* and the *Prometheus*. Currently dubbed simply "Secundus", it was originally number eight on the list (and thus beyond the scope of the first wave), but a Dr Moore at GMO Genetics proposed an absolutely ingenious terraforming plan utilizing gene modifications from heavy metal extremophiles, allowing human surface habitation in *under a century* - I see some you realizing that this would means the terraforming could be done before any human saw the planet, and indeed, that's what we're aiming for!

  If you'll look at page X of the report, you'll see a summary of the upsides and downsides to the system and the planet. As you can see, there's some concern about the overall heavy metal content in the system and the specific distribution on the planet, but as you'll also note, it's got a truly astounding quantity of orbital water, and the medium-sized gas giant shows a high likelihood of being able to supply the necessary fusion fuels for, well, to be frank, that *second* wave of colonization we're all hoping for... While this system isn't likely to reach Earth's industrial capability as quickly as our number one choice, we do think that this wealth of orbital fuel will allow the Secundus colony to beat the rest on fueling a return trip.

  You'll also note that while Secundus as an overall lack of surface metals, its oceans are surprisingly oxygen rich - indeed, that's a critical part of Dr Moore's plan, and what alerted him to the system in the first place... You see, it seems as though most of Secundus' surface metals are bound up in oxides suspended in it's ample oceans... making them rather similar to the industrial sites GMO Genetics has been cleaning up for the past few decades.

  Furthermore, with the exception of the undesirable distribution (and lack) of surface metals, Secundus has the most important trait of all: dullness. There's no weather to speak of, very little tectonic activity, and nothing that'll hit you while in orbit - you may or may not know, but the original system the Diaspora project was founded to examine was eventually disqualified due to system meteorites. There simply wasn't an orbit for the Ark that wouldn't see it hole within a century by a passing shower - a problem this system resolutely does not have. 

  In short: dull enough that the dullness is *almost* problematic, which makes it perfect."

  ---

  Basically - Given the problems of the system, what else is true there to make colonization worth while? Work that out some more and come back - the stage after that is the shopping list to outfit the colonists with what they need to deal with the problems and capitalize on the benefits. Include things that might be true but that you won't know until you're half way there.

  It looks great, but if you want us to be able to criticize it based on rational aspects, we wouldn't be able to do very much. It seems like all of the colonists were smart enough to willingly cooperate together and leveraged their resources (intelligent people, bio-manipulation, components of their ships) near optimally. The most I can do is to be given a direct problem to help resolve or be given more details about the present day society to suggest actions for the main character.

  The only thing I can think of to help is the part about computers. Computers are so useful that I can't imagine humanity not trying to recreate it. If you look up 'computer' in Wikipedia, you'll see that the oldest computers were made of stone or wood. Recently, there has been research into making a chemical computer. In addition, it states that any computer which is Turing-complete, can stimulate any other computer given sufficient time and space. I would expect there to be attempts in making computers out of chemicals, stone, wood, biology, or even diamonds if you want to go crazy. Metals (or more specifically metalloids like silicon) were the best choice of materials for computing, but not the only one.

  There's even a joke about making a computer out of billiard balls as a thought experiment in the wiki article.
  Thank you for giving me a fascinating prompt on recreating computers without any modern materials.

  So far this looks like standard SF worldbuilding, I don't detect any invocation of rationality as yet.

  Having one of these background facts be unknown to the characters, be important, and leave causal shadows allowing its deduction, is potentially a setup for a Fair Play Insight.

  Holy shit, this is an incredible premise for a series. I'd recommend reading "Crabs Walk on the Island" by Anatoly Dneprov - it has a very interesting exploration of how evolution would work in this kind of circumstance. Other than that, I suck at writing and have no suggestions :(
  ```

  - u/Farmerbob1:
    ```
    "Crabs Walk on the Island" was a very good short story, and thought provoking.  Thank You.

    The purpose of the biology background setting is to create a scenario where I can have a rational reason for humans to combine stone age technology with water power, and some limited steam power.  I needed to move it off-Earth, because there's simply too much metal available on Earth.  I'd have to completely erase all education from every human for metalworking knowledge to disappear, and then water-power and steam-power would also be gone from collective knowledge.

    I also needed to isolate the community, prevent it from getting outside help.  So Earth and the Sol system had to be taken out of the picture.

    I could design it as some sort of contrived alien experiment, but that's potentially a LOT darker than anything I want to do, if I wanted to write about it in a rational manner.

      This is what's causing you your problem. You know the end result you want, and you're willing to make your people dumber in order to get it. That's not going to make the greatest scifi, and it's not going to make rational fiction at all.

      Ideally, instead of making Frodo dumber when you give him the lightsaber, you give Sauron a death star, but then you just wouldn't have tried to colonize *this* system in the first place.

      Edit: ...but that just means that when *do* find the problems to throw at them to get where you're aiming, they'll fill in all kinds of amazing details in your setting.

      Edit 2: 
      Go check out Eliezer's "Optimize Literally Everything" post (in this reddit under "Inexploitability"). The central take away (IMHO) is that in rationalist fiction, *first* you write a reasonable setting, and *then* you see what narrative comes from it when you add thinking characters. If you want this set in our universe, your setting is already written, so you really only get to do the latter.

      If you want a specific tech and material base for your setting... why have it be modern-Earth descended at all?

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Honestly, if this is just the backdrop for a setting, then you don't actually need any of this - especially if no one knows it. When I was reading the setting details, I was trying to fit it into the story that I assumed was there somewhere - an intrepid band of people in a world without metal, a legend of a ship high in the sky, and eventually they'd find some hidden secret, get the coordinates to a sealed off vault, find one of the lost shuttles, pilot it to the moon, restart the *Leviathan*, and so on and so forth.

      But if the *Leviathan* is never going to feature in the story, then it doesn't matter. The time you spend figuring out details that aren't going to feature in the story could be better spent writing the actual story. And if you're setting the story long after all this stuff has gone down, when immense amounts of knowledge have been lost and computers are a legend that the protagonist's grandparents were told by their grandparents, then it probably doesn't belong in the story, because you'll just end up sidetracking everything to explain it to the reader. I'm one of those people who's big on cutting as much exposition as possible, especially if it doesn't serve to tell the story. If there are metal-poor people living in the stone age, then just let us know that and don't even pay lip service to how that came to be - just leave some hints, and let the reader draw their own conclusions.

        Ah, but even if the reader never sees it, it's still critical for my understanding of the world, so I can write from a starting point, a reference.

        It's also very possible that the people of the world might have retained a great deal of their history in books, backed up by non-metallic artifacts.  They most certainly lost a great deal of science and technology, but history, perhaps not.  I haven't decided yet.

  First, good start on a solid sci-fi idea. That should butter you up for some constructive criticism, right?

  >The generation ships received many messages, and monitored many transmissions during the course of the horrific war which lasted several months, but eventually, the Sol system went completely silent. It is unknown if any of humanity survived in the Sol system, but there were no radio transmissions, for hundreds of years.

  Make sure to get your sublight travel speeds right. Hundreds of years at what speed? Months to which reference frame? Any significant time dilation while listening to the messages?

  ---

  >The energy of the initial acceleration of a generation ship would have been impossible to miss.

  What does this mean? What kind of energy, detected by what? If you're doing hard sci-fi, I'd avoid using "energy" to mean anything generic. That way lies Star Wars and, at "best", Star Trek.

  ---

  >Leviathan was large enough to pose a threat to life on Secundus if it de-orbited, so it was landed on the moon of Secundus, in a crater. 

  Is this a Luna-sized moon? Those sorts of huge, paired sub-planets are basically non-existent elsewhere in the Sol system. Need to nail this down for things like tides. This seems to be suggesting a single moon, but Luna-like can't be assumed.

  ---

  I think you need at least a lampshade for why this wasn't supported by robotic missions. Send in the robots first just makes sense. It might be the distance, the cost, or a fear they wouldn't be adaptive enough. But apparently humanity has already spent hundreds of years on this -- no FTL at all, and centuries away for the generation ship, right? The slow trip out for the probes, and the return reports at (one assumes) light speed. So why not send robots and wait a generation or two? Or just send them out even a little before the ships.

  Also, why didn't the industry ship go first if they were going to (or could) hang in orbit for a century without apparent issues? They might not have known about the metal issues on the planet, but why would the long-term terraforming ship go first if it wasn't about some rush project? If there wasn't war brewing before they left (and maybe this is an issue) why not just float around in-system until the entire mission is under way together? Ten years waiting shouldn't be an issue for a ship which holds people who know they are going to die in deep space anyway.

  Also, as in any rational fiction, you need to answer the computer information systems complexity question. Why isn't strong (if not super-human) AI a thing? It can be a single sentence that says, "it doesn't work" in so many words, but I think it needs to at least be answered when complicated genetic engineering is possible. What kind of computer systems can manage this, but not direct neural mapping of human brain-like systems (at the clunkiest)?
  ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  I'd recommend reading *7th Sigma* by Stephen Gould (whose most famous book is *Jumper*). It takes place in a section of the world where nanobots eat metals, and everyone has to use ceramics or plastics instead. It's a lot different from the setting you're talking about, but the lack of metals means there are some similarities.
  ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  The primary thing that bothered me: I find it impossible to believe that a generation ship would ever be built without the capability to build heavy industry, absent some very unlikely catastrophic restriction.  That right there wrecks the whole setting for me; you need to find a justification if you want it to be believable. 

  Perhaps the ship was sent early and only half complete because the Earth was in the process of dying? In that case, people should know what happened back on Earth, and it would have impacted the abilities of the ship -- the genetic samples likely would not have been put aboard until the ship itself was complete.

    The more I think about this, the more problems come up.

    Why did they abandon space?

    Space is terrifically useful if you are on dealing on very long time scales.  Especially on a metal-poor planet.

    * Asteroids provide all the metal you could ever want, both for building space stations, solar power satellites, weather satellites, etc and for shipping down to the planet to fill their needs.
    * Comets provide water for reaction mass, breathable atmosphere, washing, drinking, radiation shielding, etc etc etc.
    * There are almost certainly gas giants in the system.  There's your source of He3 for fusion reactors.
    * If you want to send Leviathan home again you need to refuel it.  You're going to do that from space, not haul it up the gravity well.

    Once the sand mites show up, Leviathan provides an unbreachable point where industry, computers, and serious bioengineering work can be maintained.  Shuttles go down with metals, ceramic tools / machines / etc and go up empty via remote control.  On the way you open them to vacuum / irradiate the hell out of the interior to kill the sand mites.  If you say they need to be piloted manually, then I say "they land only on floating platforms that are carefully maintained sandmite-free, all people and goods go through obsessive decon chambers, and the shuttles don't actually dock with Leviathan." 

    I mentioned solar power satellites -- why devote land and industry to power generation when you can get it from orbit for cheap?  Especially on a planet where there isn't much land.  That should be a thing that the colonists wanted, so they wouldn't have abandoned space.  If nothing else, they would have wanted weather satellites and communication satellites, so they would not have abandoned space.

    Why are there no floating ecologies?  If there's a shortage of land and people are getting a lot of their minerals from the ocean, there should be offshore arcologies (or, at least, mining platforms that can be converted to arcologies) to refine the metals.  When the sand mites show up, at least some of these platforms will survive and maintain their industry.  They provide the aforementioned safe places for the shuttles to land and transship advanced products.

    In the meantime, the metals that the sandmites eat are still in their shells, and the sandmites are wherever the metals were that they ate.  Can't you set up at least some cleanrooms, then bring in dead sandmites and recover the metals from their shells in order to build computers that are stored in very-limited-access-and-only-with-full-decon cleanrooms?

    You now have at least one and probably multiple points where full industry and bioengineering is still usable for the foreseeable future.  Given the level of bioengineering already shown, it seems unlikely that they can't find a solution for the sand mites.  Even if they can't, they can abandon the land and move to a Waterworld style of life.  (Again, appropriate decon measures to avoid bringing the sandmites to the floating arcologies.)

      Consider the advantages of a planet:

      -No need to mass-shield everything against radiation.

      -Less energy and resources devoted to transport and thermal regulation. You can just let something sit on land. In space, absolutely everything must have remass and an energy source to move around.

      -Solar power satellites are interesting... but the energy produced is directly proportional to surface area of solar panel you have. You can just lay them out on grids on a planet's surface, you know...

      -Floating ecologies have more points of failure than a land-based colony. Rust, wear-and tear, floatability, sinking... you can do away with all that, and you'd want your options to be as secure as possible during your initial stages of colonization. Plus, they have incentive for off-shore ecologies until the sandmites show up. Harvesters for sea-iron would start on seabed deposits, which could be operated from the shorelines. 

      -Appropriate decon might not be available after the sandmite catastrophe has passed. the correct procedure is to starve out the sand mites, then melt them into slabs of metal.

        People are the main thing you need to build rad-shielding for in space.  They have a generation ship; this isn't an issue.

        > -Less energy and resources devoted to transport and thermal regulation. You can just let something sit on land. In space, absolutely everything must have remass and an energy source to move around.

        I'll point out that you need to have an energy source to move around on land, too.  </snark> ;>

        You can just let things sit in orbit too; in general, they stay where you put them.  Yes, low orbits are unstable and will eventually degrade, meaning they will need small amounts of boost to avoid destabilizing.  This is a very manageable amount of energy.  

        As to solar panels -- they work *enormously* better in space than on the planet.  Here are some of the advantages solar in space has as opposed to on a planet:

        * No atmosphere.  This boosts available power levels [substantially](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolation#mediaviewer/File:Insolation.png)
        * No nighttime (assuming correct orbit so as to avoid planet's shadow)
        * No dust to cover the panels
        * No wind to move / break the panels, or scour them with dust
        * No gravity, so you can make *huge* arrays without worrying about them collapsing of their own weight
        * No clouds to get in the way
        * Panels are always at 90 degrees to the sun -- harder to maintain on earth 

        Earth-based solar isn't really a viable option for civilization-level power.  SBSP absolutely *is* a viable option.

        > -Appropriate decon might not be available after the sandmite catastrophe has passed. 

        That's the point; you do the decon *before* the sandmite catastrophe has happened.  People should be doing this level of decon every time they walk in or out of a genetics lab where you are working on new / modified life forms -- you don't want any of the specimens escaping, or to bring in anything that would distort the experiments.

    Is this one of those situations where I go 'the Eagle has landed' and just stop typing out all the arguments you've already mentioned? :(

  A few quick thoughts before I move onto the comments and your updated version:

  -Unless you're planning on crash-landing Leviathan on the planet at orbital velocities, it would be unlikely that it changes the planet's surface characteristics significantly.

  -Genetically-engineered mites are very unlikely to evolve into a ravenous grey-goo analogue. Artificial alterations that make it gather conductive metals provide *negative* selection bias. It's an energy-intensive task that does nothing directly for the specie's survival. Sure, they'll obtain impenetrable carapaces, but what predators do they have? A more likely scenario is that the colonists can't make the genetic trait stick.... the mites keep evolving away from it, and the new species pressure the iron-burdened mites into extinction again and again.

  -Even if the replicator mites cause a catastrophic event, they won't survive for hundreds of years. If they don't die off on their own, other species without the iron-gathering burden push them into extinction. Finally, just where do the mites get the energy to attack iron directly from?!

  -Iron-poor planets are usually lacking in plenty of other heavy metals. Their oceans won't be very salty.

  -Huge amounts of water and little land mass means that the land masses are like the northern rocks of scotland: Cold, hot, always wet and with no topsoil. 

  -The hard thing is to put things back into orbit, not drop them down. Dropping resources and robots is as simple as strapping an appropriate heat shield on something and launching it with a parachute attached. Putting empty shuttles back into space is counter-productive. It is much more efficient to create one-way dropships instead of shuttles in a resource-strapped situation.... unless you have shuttles that can go up at no cost at all.
