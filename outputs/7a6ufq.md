## [Biweekly Challenge] Worm

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77bdep/biweekly_challenge_slasher_movies/), the prompt was "Slasher Movies". Our winner is /u/vi_fi, with their story, ["Spaceman"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77bdep/biweekly_challenge_slasher_movies/dolinsn/). Congratulations to /u/vi_fi for their fifth win in a row, which makes you a superwinner! Enjoy the extra special flair! You will also be able to select a challenge prompt, if you so choose.

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **Worm**. [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) is a completed superhero web serial by Wildbow; I would expect spoilers in the challenge, and maybe avoid it if you care about those. Worm fanfiction is quite popular, and the work itself is very popular within this community, so hopefully that won't be a very large barrier to entry. As always, prompts are to inspire, not to limit, so if you want to write your story about some obscure side character, an original character within the world, or even outside the canon of the serial, feel free to do that. This challenge is at least partly due to the start of sequel to Worm, due soon.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, November 15th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Inexploitability**. [Inexploitability](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/inexploitability) is the principle that if there is an easy way to do something obviously valuable, people should already be doing that thing. If you're writing fiction, and especially rational fiction, there should be a justification for why your character's method of taking over the world or exploiting the rules has not already been discovered, and "they're just that smart" is probably not good enough, at least if you want to display that intelligence on the page. More generally, inexploitability can also be applied to the real world; if someone offers you a scheme to get rich quick, you should view it with skepticism, because if it were easy, efficient markets (in the general sense of the term) would have already adjusted (though note that this is not universally true).

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 11/15.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [is available here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7a6wtp/challenge_companion_worm/)
