  So now Neshemah has both a magical plague which can't be detected except by means of a Named who Cat just murdered, and shapeshifters who can impersonate anyone they've got the physical mass to duplicate.

  I sure am glad there's no one important in the Grand Alliance of notably short stature.

  Even though there's a fight scene where Cat trounced the Revenant, all I can think about is how Cat needs a hug.

  :(

  Take your bets, who's in for "Hanno encountered similar spy-ghouls and is cleaning house?"

  Anyone want to take the long shot of "the Dead king personally trounced the white knight and that's a revenant version of the spy-ghouls causing chaos in the main camp?"

    No, we've established two major facts so far.

    1) The shapeshifters are volume-limited

    2) Cat is smol

    She's shapeshifter bait.

      Adding more mass isn't hard on a battlefield when the mass is made of corpses.

      Edit: wait are you thinking that there's a fake cat inside there and the gate guards still didn't question her presence coming in? I think that's an even longer shot than it being fake hanno in there

  Are these chapters longer than they were before?  I think they are supposed to be, but I haven't really noticed a difference since the update schedule changed

    ```
    On average, these last five chapters have had 5429.6 words each. Book 5, the first five chapters had an average 3860.8 words per chapter.

      Thanks for that. How did you get those numbers? I'd like to see what it would be if you exclude the first chapter of reach book

        I just copy-pasted the text of each post into a word doc and looked at the word count, haha

        Edit:  
        Chapters 2–5 of Book 5, 3927.75 words/chapter  
        Chapters 2–5 of Book 6, 5380.75 words/chapter
        ```

    ```
    Its switched to two a week rather than 3,
    ```

- u/VorpalAuroch:
  ```
  Whoever is posting these, please change the title to "Book N Chapter X". I keep seeing a post with a small chapter number and thinking it's something new I might want to look at, instead of a long-running thing I already know I'm not interested in.
