  Huh, interesting. We learnt the backstory behind Minerva much quicker than I was expecting, and it's introducing a lot of interesting elements too. 

  On one level, it makes sense to have a few plantations be baby farms as opposed to the chaos and slaughter that was (presumably) what the world looked like before the promise but I can see why the idea would be morally repugnant. I wonder what our "world" would choose if given the same choice.
