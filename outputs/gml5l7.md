  On the one hand, I'm happy that Wes is starting to move on from Samuel.

  On the other hand, I'm not sure that Mr "Take lots of drugs all the time to forget how much your life sucks" is a step up. Hira feels like a glimpse as who Wes could be with a few years under his belt: funny, ridiculously good as a black ops unit, and still running away from himself.

  (also, I'm kind of shocked that Wes is willing to sleep with Hira so soon after Hir basically blew the whistle on him; I thought he'd be at least a little mad)

  I saw this serial yesterday and stayed awake last night till 4 am to finish it. Really liked the characters and the setting that the story takes place in.

  Nice work and I hope the serial doesn't suddenly die like so many other works

  This story is shockingly good. Reminds me of the feeling I had discovering Worm or Worth the Candle.

  Hopefully it will be a ana POV, it's been a while.

  I'm really enjoying the story so far.

  My only criticism is that it seems like scanning the area for other peoples' pith should probably be standard practice (almost like master/stranger protocols in Worm or similar counters to genjutsu found in most rational Naruto fanfiction) every so often considering it doesn't appear to have a downside and it would allow you to keep track of how many people are in the area and where they are, thereby countering illusions, of which I'm assuming Ana isn't the person capable of (we haven't heard much about light projecting but I'm guessing it could be used to make someone invisible or create holograms? Sound/air projection could probably be used for auditory "illusions" too). There are a few points in the story where it seems like the only reason someone didn't sweep the area for other piths is that it would have been counterproductive to the plot (Afzal's meeting with Commonplace, especially since we learn later he excels at multitasking, there's no reason he shouldn't have been scanning the area). This ability also seems like a hard counter for Ana's illusions, I think in 6-A Wes projects into Ana's gun to make sure she's actually in the position she appears to be but worries Ana might notice if she projects into the gun too, but a simpler way to check Ana's position without any risk of discovery would be for Wes to just look for Ana's pith with his own. This seems like something that Wes should know too. 

  To be clear though, this isn't even close to a deal-breaker for me, I still love the story.
