## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  One common trope that has always been difficult to play straight in rational fiction is the child/teen hero. We always try to explore the horrifying implications of putting minors in a position that could, and by all rights should, be filled by an adult. However, there are a ton of great stories about young heroes fighting evil and I think we should be able to tell those if we want to. So, here is the world I've created to rationalize it.

  An alien probe lands on Earth and is recovered by the government, only for the on-board AI to warn us of upcoming incursions by villainous extraterrestrials. The AI offers us Sufficiently Advanced Technology that grants people superpowers, but the neural interface can only be used safely and effectively by minors due to their neuroplasticity. If an adult tries to use it, even if they've used it as minor, they are guaranteed to develop psychological disorders.

  I'm intentionally leaving the specifics of the setting vague so you can tell whatever story you want to. The minimum and maximum age for the interface should be up to you. The kids could be kept at a school to learn their powers, or allowed to remain at home until needed if the tech does most of the work for them. The program to give these children powers could be a secret, provide the kids with heroic personas, or be publicly known. I personally envision this as a sentai or magical girl story, but that's just me.

    That's a good premise that  circumvents the biggest issue with YA protagonists, the "adults are useless" trope. Outside of "chosen one" stories, anything kids can do adults should be able to do better, which kind of ruins the point of making kids the heroes, which puts writers in an awkward place.

    I think shows like Young Justice and Hunter x Hunter do the best job of dealing with this: the kids are strong, and they can sometimes deal with major threats, but their stories are usually just part of a wider narrative that allows them to be useful and compelling without being unreasonably powerful.

      I think I created a similar situation as in the Young Wizards books, where adults are mostly relegated to an advisory role for the kids because they're just more powerful. Here though, the children have an entire support structure for their adventures, so there's plenty of room for worldbuilding now that the accepted fact have been established.

      I wanted to write this since there's been a surge in the popularity of entertainment targeted toward children. There's something to be said for stories that are intellectually simple enough for kids to understand while being emotionally mature enough for adults to enjoy. I'm late to the party myself, but so far Young Justice has become one of my favorite tv shows.

    Neon Genesis Evangelion justifies the child/teen heroes pretty well, by making the protagonists products of an experimental program that only started about fifteen years ago.

    There's a setting I briefly worked on a long time ago where the Cold War featured an arms race of kaiju in addition to nuclear weapons, and only children properly maintain the link, so you also have the kids in later years getting mentored by adults who had previously wielded such-and-such kaiju. 

    Not sure where I'd go with it nowadays. Originally I was planning for it to be a series that took place over a span of years, with kids growing up, losing their links, and mentoring their replacements. Kaiju would be used semiregularly in this case, like tactical nukes. 

    Alternately, we could just set it in the modern day: kaiju are not used, except for one or two horrific occasions in the past, but research on bigger and badder kaiju continues. Over the course of the story there's an increase in international tension, and much of the latter part of the story is about kids being ordered to, essentially, carry out nuclear strikes, probably with mixed results. 

    And then maybe a post-apocalyptic follow-up, where depending on how much infrastructure is intact one of the biggest problems might be that there are still kaiju out there, whose kids need replacing as they age out, but it's getting harder and harder to perform the necessary procedures for new kids.

    Reminds me of some stories where this trope was done poorly (the trope I'm used to referring to as "[Ratliff gas](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/MarissaPicard)", though TVTropes calls it an incidence of [OnlyFatalToAdults](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFatalToAdults).)

  Need some input for rationalising some common fantasy tropes, if anyone is feeling helpful:

  * If you were immortal and had no other special powers, how would you make your money without holding an actual job or resorting to a life of crime? Selling antiques basically requires you to be a hoarder and, well, antiques haven't always been valuable, investments require a complicated series of fake IDs, etc. Let's say you were born circa 500 CE in Europe. 

  * Where does extra mass from a transformation come from / go to? e.g. if a witch transforms into a cat, or a werewolf transforms from human to wolf.
  ```

  - u/Auride:
    ```
    * Well, how would a normal person get money without a job or crime? The main thing that comes to mind is investing. I suppose a 1500-year-old immortal would have enough insite and education to game the stock market pretty effectively. Selling things would basically be the same thing, except the objective would be to game what resources would be valuable in 100 years vs. what companies will be valuable in 6 months. 

    * If you want to  violate the conservation of mass (not necessarily a bad move imo) then it obviously doesn't matter. Otherwise, your solution is either to 1: put that mass somewhere else (hammer-space, alternate dimension, etc.) or 2: claim that the mass really does go nowhere, and the witch simply becomes an otherwise-normal 130 lb cat. I believe this is the same rule applied to X-Men's Mystique, though I'm not an expert.
    ```

      > investing

      The problem with that is maintaining a fake ID for long enough, and all the hassle associated with that. 

      > If you want to violate the conservation of mass (not necessarily a bad move imo) then it obviously doesn't matter.

      This is where I think I might go, but it bothers me. Slow regeneration can work by using mass from the air, for example, and that all makes sense. 

      Hammerspace might have to be it, though I guess if the story doesn't explain either way, either solution could be true.

        They’d need some sort of fake documents in either case, unless they were living [under a rock](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/5/5b/Game-of-thrones-season-4-finale-tree-man.jpg) or in a very rural area.

        If your story has teleportation, you can give the character a mass supply network which brings additional (bio)mass for healing (from the same 3D)^1 and takes excess mass away in case of transformations into beings of lesser mass.

        ^1 edit: this was used in *[The Games We Play,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay)* more or less (the mass could’ve been coming from another dimension — not sure)

    Denser mass/ pocket dimension is the general answer I've seen for # 2. 

    As for 1, nowadays, I would do one of those reverse mortgages, but one that goes until death ([Like this guy](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/world/a-120-year-lease-on-life-outlasts-apartment-heir.html)) on a bunch of houses. Back then? Maybe some high-stakes wagers regarding things that should kill you, but dont (if you mean that kind of immortal).

      I don't, but you made me realise - tontines were probably *invented* by immortals. Those and modern reverse mortgages would be a great source of income. Buy gold (or bitcoin) with it, and you're set with money that you can spend without having to authenticate your identity very hard.

      That would get too much unwanted attention towards your person though. At best, it would be articles like the one you linked to and science groups contacting you and requesting to participate in some tests and safe experiments. At worst, people would try to kidnap you (governments, dictators, rich sheikhs, etc) or kill you (people who suddenly found themselves to essentially be your contractually bound slaves, their families, etc).

    An idea that I played around in my head for the transformation was that magic could create a pocket dimension/astral world that keeps things in stasis. It was only accessible by magic to put matter/energy in and take it back out. A magical group could create one and then dump extra mass and energy into it to share.

    If you changed into a cat the extra mass is dumped into the pocket dimension. Someone changing into a larger creature would pull that mass out to change themselves. If there was not enough available mass to change you couldn't do it. 

    Werewolves would use a ritual to put a wolf (or other animal) into a pocket dimension and than use that for their changes.

    The big questions in this system come from reshaping mass, where does the mind go, and do you have matter to energy conversions? 
    Or is everything put into the pocket world was converted to pure energy and then used as the desired energy/mass when pulled out it plays very differently than if the energy/matter keeps a type.

    The most scientific/technically inclined method is the pocket dimension is not in stasis, it is just cut off. All of the matter and energy would interact while in storage. Dump enough stuff in and you could make a little pocket world. Dumping your body in a pocket and than large amounts of heat, would cook your body. Have one dimension where specific chemicals are dumped to under go a reaction. But that is not so useful for the turn into a cat magic.

      I like the theory a way to make things a bit more interesting if you wanted to have some degree of speration iis to have say different dimensional frequencies (i.e. two mages depending on the spell could be pulling from two different pocket dimensions if you wanted to go to a high metaphysical level you could even have the world where the story takes place be left as an open question as to whether it itself is a pocket dimension for another high dimensionality.

      At least that is what that would seem to imply to me if taking things to their inevitable outcome. It also accounts for summoning (i.e. taking a creature from another dimension according to whatever specifications were encoded into the spell.

      The missing mass could also be exchanged with energy or free atoms if one wanted to be a "green" mage and try and avoid some of the worse philosophical implications (as one could literally steal from other dimensions) their could also be an interesting inherit risk with dimensional storage depending on where in that "pocket" dimension you store something. So many fascinating implications!

      Definitely try and develop something out of this!
      You could technically still have frozen "space time magic but only if a spell formation was placed in the pocket dimension to provide that ad the objects were stashed in that formation... (which could in theory be externally broken to steal said items.
      Multi dimensional thieves/heists man
      ```

  - u/Dragrath:
    ```
    With regards to transformations My rational has always been that mass is conserved and the transformation is required to handle density changes if a 70 Kg witch were to transform into a cat the cat would have to weigh the same amount(thus be far more dense than a cat ought to be with potential health risks). Moreover they would be a very risky endeavor limiting how many transformations a caster can have as they must develop a spell construct that guides everything into its new place. attempting to perform a poorly developed transformation (or over stressing the construct/organisms mass to size ratio) could lead to very horrible ends (i.e. heavily deformed bodies beyond both medical and magical hope of reversal )
    Personally My ideas require polymorphic magic to be absurdly high level biomancy or magic of manipulating living creatures flesh bones blood and DNA (with a very slippery slope to necromancy decided usually by soul manipulation) as well as healing all coming from the same school of magic

    By necessity given the schools conditions it would heavily affect the way healers viewed among the populace considering how easy a great doctor can turn to the darker side of the art...

    Seriously why is no connection made between the various arts that all require a high level of understanding about a given organisms anatomy?
