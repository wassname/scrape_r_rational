## Rationalist Video Games

### Post:

On this sub-reddit, I am always reading about rational thinking, applying rational thinking, or books/movies with examples of rational thinking.

Are there any other mediums which foster rational thinking? Video games, visual novels, paintings, sculptures, songs, phrases or any other way humans communicate ideas.

Current List:

[Freefall](http://freefall.purrsia.com/)

[Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA)

Nitpick: While books and movies are not what I'm looking for, I consider comics to qualify by my criteria.

  I wouldn't call it rational or even HSF but Dead Space is like a horror story where the protag is actually trying to stay alive:

  -wears high tech hazard suit meant for work on space stations

  -uses power tools to cut limbs of undead 

  -stomps enemy on the ground (game rewards stomping corpses, zombies sometimes get up)

  -scavenges materials and supplies to build better weapons and armor

  bonus points:


  -has limited telekinesis, can't grab enemy but can grab spikes, circular saws and explosives and shot them at enemy at high speeds

  -has limited time stop spells, can shot at enemy and stuff but it uses ammo

  To be fair though, he is an engineer and superpowers are available for everyone. Also his first contact with the zombie ship was on a routine scavenge mission or something like that. And his armor is standard package for all engineers anyway.

  Does anyone think [Miegakure](http://miegakure.com/) might qualify? It hasn't been released yet, but its premise is about experiencing a 4D world which can teach us how to understand new systems of logic in an intuitive way, which can be helpful for rational thought in my opinion. Granted, I am biased by the fact I think it's beneficial for anyone to play it.

  Of course if I'm going to be recommending great mind-expanding, time-sucking video games, then people have to play:

  [Antichamber](http://www.antichamber-game.com/)

  [Braid](http://braid-game.com/)

  [Fez](http://fezgame.com/)

  [Limbo](http://playdead.com/limbo/)

  [Portal](http://www.valvesoftware.com/games/portal.html)

  [Q.U.B.E.](http://qube-game.com/)

  [Witness](http://the-witness.net/) -Not out yet.

  They are all good puzzle games with interesting twists on the puzzling aspects. But I don't think they are necessarily teaching anything in terms of rationality.

    Antichamber, if you are desperately trying to pull any semblance of rationality from anything, at least fosters a bit of unorthodox, time-ignoring and space-ignoring logic. Most of the rest seem to simply be problem solving and spacial reasoning, which, while good, aren't exactly rational(ist)-only.

  Have you seen Kaj Sotala's [Bayesian Network game](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lad/bayes_academy_development_report_1/)? It's as yet unfinished, but I believe it shows a lot of promise.

  Rationalist video games? You're lucky to find a video game plot that matches the quality of the average summer blockbuster.

    The reason that's the case is that most videogames are about the experience of playing the game, rather than a narrative. When the player can only meaningfully interact with the world down the barrel of a gun and can't speak (or at best, only have three or four conversational options), you're not left with much. There are a lot of strategies that game makers employ to get around this inherent separation of narrative and play, but it's *really* hard to do successfully, and most of the time the game makers don't even try. I really like *Bioshock* as a narrative and as a game, but there's so much of a disconnect between the narrative elements and the gameplay elements (a disconnect that got a lot worse in *Bioshock Infinite*).

    With that said, there are a *lot* of games that encourage better (and different) thinking merely by virtue of their gameplay elements.

  I think the closest thing would probably be Minecraft and any similar game. The world has its own consistent physics, which you can exploit to  generate gold, farm iron, and [keep track of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65g8a_Hv3ZU). Dwarf fortress, and certain other rouge-likes, may qualify, but Minecraft avoids the issue of having dumb npcs by having all npcs be animals.

  In Far Cry 4, hardly a realistic look at anything otherwise, if you simply [do the logical thing](#s " stay put and wait for the murder who kidnapped you, but has shown no signs of wishing you harm, to return to dinner -- as he asked -- instead of you running off and joining an armed insurrection of questionable moral value"), you get to immediately complete your stated objective, leave the country peacefully, live what ones imagines is a long life in the developed world without eagles the size of flying pitbulls trying to eat your face, and you (the player) win the game.

  Free indie dating sim where your date keeps dying. In the early stages, the game forces you to experiment before you make progress. In the later sections, your date makes astonishingly Level 1 intelligent responses to the situation. This game is one of a handful that managed to make an emotional impact on me just through good writing.

  [QWOP](http://foddy.net/Athletics.html), because it forces you to think through something you've done every day but never thought through.

  ```
  I wouldn't necessarily say the *story* is rational in this game, but [Hack 'n' Slash](http://store.steampowered.com/app/246070/) was recommended on this sub before for its game play elements.
