  This series of vignettes has been consistently enjoyable. Thanks for this! I also appreciate that besides the humor, other themes also get their fair shake.

  ...

  That said, "Pyrofessor" and "Inacan" are groan-inducing puns whose existence makes all other puns worse off. Boo! It reminded me of a quote, by you or another rationalist, saying something vaguely along the lines of "This pun is so bad that it will be cursed until the heat death of the universe".

  >Well, my suit’s voice analytics tell me that you’re scared, but telling the truth.  Which is *fucking unnerving*, by the way.  I can’t imagine why the public trusts anyone as good as you are at lying.

  I like how this pokes fun at one of the central ironies of this setting. There's e.g. this section from part 2:

  >"I solemnly promise you, officer *ow* that I did not, in fact, have any idea this was going to happen today.  Ow.  Honestly.”

  I find it interesting that one of the big points here is that superheroes need a secret identity to stay sane... and Bruce is a superhero without one.  If his power is that people think he's the Masculine Mongoose*, then he doesn't really have an identity where he can hide that power.

  I wonder if there will be consequences to his sanity because of that.

  *Mongoose, not Mandrake.

  - u/Lugnut1206:
    ```

    >I wonder if there will be consequences to his sanity because of that.

    Sure, but his sanity is much less important for the world than the Mongoose's.
    ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    But he does not _actually_ have a secret identity.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      ... That's my point.

      Mongoose* can stay sane by being Hegadi, who no one actually expects anything from.  As far as anyone is concerned, Hegadi is just some guy with a good excuse to always be running off whenever the Mongoose* is needed.

      Bruce Kent doesn't have that.  There's nowhere he can go to escape from the presumption that he is the Mongoose\*.  The first story shows that he can't have an honest love life, as, if he tells the truth, people will assume he's lying.  The second story shows that he can't have a normal work life: people will try to unmask him, or otherwise treat him as if he's someone he's not.  And this third story shows that he can't even run errands without being in the Mongoose's\* shadow.

      Superman can escape being Superman by becoming Clark Kent.  Batman can hang up his cowl and be Bruce Wayne.  Mongoose* can put on his thong and just be Hegadi the mediocre.

      Bruce Kent has no escape from who people think he is, a presumption so powerful that the person who *really is* who people think Bruce Kent is calls it a superpower in its own right.

      And maybe the commenter who said that Mongoose's* sanity is more important than Bruce Kent's is right.  But it's still a shame, if not outright hypocritical, that Mongoose* gets to go home and be unimportant for a while, where "the greater hero" never, *ever*, gets that opportunity.

      *Mongoose, not Mandrake.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        Bruce Kent is a billionaire playboy anyway. He can not have the unimportant guy moment. Neither can Batman.

        He does not have the stress of actually having a hidden identity. A conflict of being two things. He can at least be honest with people saying he is who he is. No cognitive dissonance, he does not have to deal with living a double life.

        But no. I do not accept his superhero status. Someone doing something heroic does not make him a superhero, and not being immune to bullets makes him a bit less of a superhero, as it is more about the powers, and consistently getting the heroing done.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          >Bruce Kent is a billionaire playboy anyway. He can not have the unimportant guy moment. Neither can Batman.

          BW plays the "spoiled rich kid" (a kind of unimportance) all the time.  Look at the scene in *Begins* where the girls on his arm start swimming in a fountain, and he buys the hotel when the concierge asks them to stop.

          BK, on the other hand, probably wouldn't be asked to stop, for fear that this is all one of the Mongoose's* plans, and they might disrupt it by intervening.

          >He does not have the stress of actually having a hidden identity. A conflict of being two things. 

          Look at the scene in the bank.  BK *can't* just be who he honestly is, the billionaire playboy.  He has to take into account what people will think of the Mongoose* when choosing how to act.  Whereas when BW takes off the cowl, the fact that they won't associate his behaviour with Batman is *entirely the point*.

          >He can at least be honest with people saying he is who he is. No cognitive dissonance, he does not have to deal with living a double life.

          Yes, he can be honest.  And everyone thinks he's a liar for it.  They react with "one part sheer incredulity, and two parts also sheer incredulity."  If he values honesty as a virtue, then it has to sting that it's a virtue that no one will *ever* associate with him.

          I disagree entirely that he doesn't have a double life.  Someone without a double life wouldn't have to disappear whenever the Mongoose\* was active, or risk his life to stop someone from getting hurt at a bank robbery.

          And it's fair to think that's not superheroism.  But I *don't* think it's fair to say that his identity as "guy who everyone thinks is the Mongoose\*" is not causing him the same kind of stress an actual superhero would experience.  Especially when there's no one he can go to with his problems who will believe him.  And, even if there were, *he still couldn't* because that would require compromising the secret that he's just a body double for the Mongoose\*, which would put Hegadi's identity in danger.

          *Mongoose, not Mandrake.

            There is at least *one* person. He's known as Baibhav Hegadi, a.k.a. Fastman.

            ...he might not be the *best* person to talk to about this particular source of stress, for various reasons, but he can at least be talked to about it safely, and he will believe what Bruce says.
            ```

            - u/Nimelennar:
              ```
              That's true, if for no other reason than Hegadi appears to be a walking lie detector.

              Yes, that would be someone he could talk to, and it wouldn't even present any serious risk towards the Mongoose's secret identity (because *of course* someone whose job it is to report on the Mongoose's location would hang around Bruce Kent).

              I agree with you that, while probably better than nothing, discussing the secret that is causing turmoil in your life *with the person who asked you to keep that secret in the first place* might not be enough to defuse the stress caused by that turmoil.

                [](/twiwink) Bruce Kent is well known for his ability to confound walking lie detectors when he continually claims not to be the 'Goose.

                ...no, the real reason that Hegadi will believe Bruce is that Hegadi *knows* that Bruce is *not* the 'Goose.

                Fortunately, Bruce seems to believe that the 'Goose is even smarter and more Good than even the 'Goose's reputation, so it seems that there is *some* good in discussing the matter with him.

  story idea:

  A few years ago a man named Clark Wayne walked into a police station and confessed to being the Feminine Falcon; arch-nemesis of the Mongoose. He plead guilty to all charges, and knew the details of many crimes that could only be known to the Falcon herself. He is now serving a life sentence, avoiding the death penalty only because he turned himself in.

  But of course everybody, including Bruce, knows Wayne is innocent. The Falcon must have bribed, threatened, brainwashed, mind-controlled or otherwise convinced Wayne to pose as her, in order to further some byzantine plot. The Falcon must still be out there, biding her time.

  Facing public outcry, the president has pardoned Wayne for all the crimes he confessed to. But Wayne does not want to leave prison, and so wishes to confess to more crimes, but he will only speak to Bruce Kent.

  Bruce is bent on getting this poor patsy out of prison. Clark wants to stay. A battle of wits ensues.
  ```

- u/russxbox:
  ```
  Just to be sure that I'm reading the last conversation correctly, the man he's conversing with is the Mongoose in the guise of Hegadi, right? 

  I think that's what this implies: "It would be crazy to wonder whether Baibhav Hegadi is secretly a metahuman, and it’s not the least bit odd that Fastman suddenly runs off whenever the Masculine Mongoose is summoned to a crisis."
  ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    I took it that Baibhav Hegadi is more-or-less openly Fastman, but Fastman is fictional and Baibhav Hegadi is the real Masculine Mongoose.
    ```

    - u/pku31:
      ```
      Which implies that when the Mongoose invented himself a cover identity, he decided to include wearing underwear he knit out of his own hair. By choice.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        True, but he no doubt considers it worth the trouble to keep his family safe.
        ```

      - u/Audere_of_the_Grey:
        ```
        I mean, the underwear may not actually have to be knit from his hair. But yeah, it seems that way.
        ```

      - u/vanillafog:
        ```
        I know, right? He could've handwaved his costume as some sort of special material. His friends can clearly make bulletproof undershirts, so why not superpower-compatible fabric?
        ```

        - u/ArisKatsaris:
          ```
          Thought about it a bit, and (even besides the added complication of an additional possibly-discoverable lie like a "special material") it actually makes sense: Even a useless superpower might be hired as \*entertainment\*, just to amuse people by demonstrating it.

          If he needs be near-nude however, he can simply proclaim he's too embarrassed to appear in public like that. He certainly can't demonstrate it around kids, etc, that's indecent.

          So it makes his seeming power even more useless.
          ```

          - u/Roxolan:
            ```
            It's also humiliating, which makes it look less like a fake power. If you could make up anything, *surely* you wouldn't do that to yourself.
            ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      ya, there's a bunch of stuff in the original vignette that tracks with Baibhav Hegadi being the MM: 

      > The day he suddenly got his meta powers, he already had a spouse and three kids, on top of a brother and two sisters and sixteen nephews and nieces. 

      > ... 

      > Wondering if Bruce Kent was one of those good friends of the 'Goose, back in the day? He wasn’t. He’s not even from the same country.

      So: at least one kid (a daughter to leave his electric scooter business to), and from a different country than probably-America.

  ```
  Short story idea for #4:

  The Setup: Continuing from #1, Bruce Kent is still looking for a date. He's finally found the woman of his dreams - besides whatever else he's looking for in a romantic partner, She seems to truly believe him when he says he isn't the Masculine Mongoose.

  The Conflict: ... which is unnerving, because, after all, \*everybody knows\* that Bruce Kent == Masculine Mongoose. Suddenly Bruce and his date switch roles from #1, as he is put in the position of having to explain to her all the circumstantial evidence, getting increasingly confused why she just doesn't believe him.

  The Development: Bruce tries to find out why she so adamantly takes his words at face value (insanity? gullibility? hidden motives?), possibly with some assistance by the Mongoose who after all has a tangential interest in the trustworthiness of Bruce's romantic partners.

  The Resolution: The date fails or succeeds, and Bruce ultimately decides whether to continue this relationship - whichever result is preferred by the author.

  \---

  The Optional Twist (if such a thing is even necessary in this short story): In a superhero setting, naturally the romantic interest has a mask identity: she's a villainess, maybe even one who has fought the Masculine Mongoose before.

  Her inability to accept staggeringly obvious notions like Bruce Kent == Masculine Mongoose stems from a side effect of her meta powers, for instance an extreme form of empiricism, or because she takes Bayesian inference very seriously but somehow had a prior of 0 for this hypothesis, so no amount of evidence could persuade her.

  She could have hidden motives for the date, but the story might work better without any. She's there in her civilian identity, after all.
  ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    I'm now picturing Bruce Kent paired with a love interest who has paid *a meta* to participate in a similar "fake secret identity" arrangement for the sake of bolstering her own reputation.  She might have honestly figured out what's going on with Bruce, except that she's right for the wrong reasons, and severely misunderstands how his arrangement works, assuming it's something more like her own.
    ```

- u/alphanumericsprawl:
  ```
  So do we assume that Team Pyro was suitably dealt with offscreen? Or did Mongoose take the meta-deal where he let them get away?
  ```

  - u/BoxSparrow:
    ```
    My interpretation (or headcanon, at least) of this is that, given that Mongoose was there and watching, he would have heard what the Pyrofessor was wanting to steal (the gems), gone to the deposit boxes, then taken them out first. That would be the reason why the Pyrofessor gave Bruce the "significant glare" before she left, and would make it so that her escape wouldn't have mattered as much.
    ```

    - u/SomeoneImSure:
      ```
      I am turning in my Intellect card, sir, because I would never have come up with that theory in a million years. Also, I am subscribing to your great headcanon.
      ```

  - u/MondSemmel:
    ```
    Timing-wise, I don't see how Pyro could've been dealt with before the end of the vignette. So Bruce would've informed the Mongoose of the deal, and I don't see why the Mongoose would violate it, since it would harm Bruce Kent's reputation, which everyone knows is his own.

    (Not to mention EY's background in decision theory, which stresses that lying has consequences, and having a reputation of keeping one's word is very useful but requires that one actually does keep one's word.)

      I mean given that we're talking about gadgets made by smart people with super-tech, the watch probably records everything that happens while it's off-network and then passes it all along as soon as it comes back online. The Mongoose would've received a summarized packet of everything that happened as soon as the watch was back up.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:

      ```
      Good point. I suppose it would've been very loud defeating the pyromaniacs. There's no way he could've missed it.

      Still, bank robbery isn't the sort of thing that should be tolerated. Wouldn't EY have something to say about social norms, about the long-term damage to financial confidence, the risk of hoarding and so on if bank-robbing becomes endemic? I'm sort of grasping at straws but at some point through HPMOR he points out that effective altruists didn't just rob a bank to send money to charity, that banks were more than just a piggy-bank that could be emptied willy-nilly?

      Oh well, I can hardly expect a detailed analysis of economics in 5000 words that focuses on a completely different branch of logic and philosophy. I suppose the point was that the Mongoose isn't an always-totally-victorious Superman who could manage to find some clever solution every time.
      ```

      - u/MondSemmel:
        ```
        Irrespective of the ethics of bank robbery, I'd expect a superhero like the Mongoose to stop any he came across.

        In the eyes of the public, the robbery unfortunately happened when he was in his civilian non-meta identity. And since the Mongoose follows the mask code so religiously that he'd never reveal his identity, preventing violence in exchange for a promise not to catch the villain was the best he could do.

        Of course, in actual fact, the Mongoose wasn't even present and thus couldn't prevent the robbery, but the promise stands.

        You can see the outcome either as a rare defeat for the admirable Mongoose, or as a triumphant victory of preventing violence without having to fight.
        ```

    - u/DuplexFields:
      ```
      One bonus of the story having played out this was is the heroes now know exactly which items were stolen from the bank. Unless Pyro lies about what was to be stolen, which deserves a Bayesian analysis of its own.
      ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  Over on Twitter you were asking for ideas for the fourth story, so here's one that might be right up your alley:
  One of the Mongoose's enemies, backed into a corner, sends Bruce Kent a means of trivially destroying the world as a last-ditch ploy to fuck with him (effectively a simple, short, easy-to-remember "erase the universe you're living in" spell that anyone can use).  Later, Bruce and the 'Goose somberly reflect on the remarkable series of *lucky coincidences* that prevented it from being spoken or published before anyone figured out what it was.
  ```

  - u/daytodave:
    ```
    This is clever and has a very fun *esprit de l'escalier* moment when you realize what actually happened, but I don't see what about it is specific to the BruceGoose setting or characters?
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      The villain thought they were giving the most noble man in existence a weapon of omnidestruction which can't be defused, just to torment him with the knowledge that it would be so easy to end everything, and he could get anything he wanted from anyone in return for not using it. Instead they gave it to a random idiot who, fortunately for all of existence, has a superhuman intellect to talk to, and perhaps the means to erase the information from his own mind.

    ```
    Deliberate, concerted effort on the part of both Bruce and the Goose, no doubt.

    I imagine it included, at minimum:

    - Bruce Kent vanishes every time the Mongoose needs to be somewhere. (Arranging for a couple of these vanishings to be from very public places - such as large billionaire-style parties - would have been easy, Bruce just needs to party until the Goose calls his watch).
    - Every time the Mongoose obtains some monetary reward for stopping some terrible crime, the cash appears in Bruce Kent's bank account. Bruce Kent has no other source of income.
    - Bruce Kent might occasionally 'slip up' and mention some things that very few people aside from the Mongoose knows.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      They'd also have plausible deniability, like they have for everything else, right?

      So Bruce Kent wouldn't appear to be someone who is Mongoose in a way that you can pinpoint directly (like no other source of income), he'd have a plausible cover story for everything - one that would make him look like Mongoose while nevertheless preserving plausible deniability.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Why? They both *want* everyone to think that Bruce is the 'Goose; honestly, the only reason that they're preserving the illusion that Bruce is still covering up his secret identity is because Bruce is *not* the 'Goose. He can't casually use the 'Goose's powers, and any actual disproof of the idea that Bruce is the 'Goose will be dismissed as just another coverup on the part of the 'Goose.

          >Why?

          All they did, so far, is consistent with Bruce Kent being a normal person and at the same time with him being secretly Mongoose, rather than it only being consistent with him being secretly Mongoose.

          E.g. Bruce Kent wore a bulletproof shirt. He appeared to be in pain from what seemed to be a broken rib. He carefully navigated the conversation with his date in a way that can be interpreted both ways. If someone questioned why he's not leaving in an ambulance, I'm sure there would be a baseline-human-compatible explanation (like Bruce Kent still being in danger). Etc.

          This is possibly because Mongoose has a reputation for being intelligent, and if there was an obvious "oversight" like Bruce Kent getting money from nowhere at the same time Mongoose gets money, his intelligent enemies could suspect he's trying to throw off his less intelligent adversaries by creating a false appearance of being Bruce Kent... but that's just my guess.

            The only reason that everything surrounding Bruce Kent is consistent with Bruce Kent being a normal person is because Bruce Kent *is* a normal person. He's agreed to - and is being paid to - be the Mongoose's public 'secret' identity, and he does so so convincingly that Professor Pyrofessor would rather believe he can fool her voice analysis software than that he's not the 'Goose, so there must be *some* incredibly suggestive evidence somewhere.

            And I'm sure it's not as blatant as the 'Goose depositing money directly into Bruce's accounts. It probably passes through a bunch of steps to get there, to obscure its source. But every time the 'Goose gets a large amount of money, a week or two later Bruce Kent's bank account gets bigger... sure, Bruce can claim it's "an investment that paid off, just coincidentally at the same time" but who will believe that?

              It might be also plausible that the revenue from this investment will be verifiable by a third party (or its unverifiability will have a plausible explanation too).

              In reality, what might be going on is that Mongoose helped Bruce to invest intelligently - deliberately just enough to obtain the right about of money, and this is Bruce's payment. Meanwhile, Mongoose kept the money *he* got and invested into e.g. a better supersuit - but better in a non-obvious way (for which there is nevertheless some "evidence").

              (Edit: Or something else.)

              >so convincingly that Professor Pyrofessor would rather believe he can fool her voice analysis software than that he's not the 'Goose, so there must be *some* incredibly suggestive evidence somewhere

              That's a good point - if there is always plausible deniability, what tipped off everyone in the first place to notice Bruce Kent "is" Mongoose?

              I think it's possible the evidence was in public long enough for everyone to notice - and so, when the plausible explanation (that provided Bruce Kent with plausible deniability) finally came to light, it was "too late" - everyone already "knew" he was Mongoose.

              (Edit: The explanation being "too late" might itself have an explanation.)

  Am I missing something, or would the argument for "active" metahumans (ones actively going out in costume, etc) having inviolate secret identities potentially also somewhat apply then to, say, police officers? And, similarly, at least some of the obvious counterarguments to the latter would apply to the former.
