## A question: Anthropic Sleeping Beauty(/Newcomb's problem) rebirths--is there any story/novel like this?

### Post:

In the (translated-from-)Chinese novel 'So what if you've been reborn?', there is a Timeline A, and a Timeline B, and a whole lot of people reborn in Timeline B with memories of Timeline A, who affect the protagonist who has *not* been reborn.

Actually, my context is out of order.  In a lot of stories (Peggy Sue type), a protagonist is reborn to an earlier age, then uses their knowledge of the future to change how the future develops (in fun-to-read ways).  Once that became semi-mainstream, there started to be a lot of other stories in which there's a pseudo-protagonist who has been reborn, and the actual protagonist is also reborn/transmigrated and clashes with them in some way.  These are often also fun (for me), but often the pseudo-protagonist is written as a boring villain, rather than being protagonist-like.

A certain daydream led me to an imagined setting, and I immediately became intensely curious as to whether there was any similar story.

Protagonist lives their first life normally, dies a tragic death, and is reborn in their *third* life.  They plan to change how the future develops (maybe involving taking revenge), but are shocked when a vengeful person unexpectedly causes them to die tragically.  They are then reborn in their *fifth* life, but with memories of their first life, third life, and this time their second life--a life in which they were reborn, changed the direction of the future, and as one of the consequences the third-life-vengeful-person died tragically, reborn in the protagonist's third life (the vengeful person's second life) wanting to take revenge.

This then recurs (social interactions in various forms, though) at least a few times.  Probably the reader-focus would be on the odd-numbered lives, but each time the protagonist cannot tell whether they are in an even-numbered life (and so have the initiative) or whether the reborn-person with the initiative is keeping a low profile until they take action later.  (Hmm, Primer also comes to mind.)  The protagonist, expecting to make the same (initial) choices in a paired even and odd life, has to plan out their choices and the possible consequences to them with the expectation that this may influence the experiences and motivations of a secret reborn-person in the same life.

Is there any story similar to this already in existence?  <would very much like to read it if so>

(Rational-fiction-possible-relevance hopefully in regards to how the protagonist would have to seriously think through the possible consequences of their actions, plus take into account and get used to how initial resolutions can change over time when living a lifetime in a world where you have the initiative and can effectively impose your will on the world for decades on end.)

(Edit:  Thinking more about things I've read similar to this, a Terminator fiction involving summoning time-travellers from the future by planning out what to do in that future comes to mind.)  


Second edit:  I'm mainly replying to comments with a question or for which I have a question, but I am very grateful for all the thoughts expressed and particularly the suggestions!  Thank you all very much!

  The story you're thinking of in your edit is likely Branches on the Tree of Time by Alexander Wales.

    Branches on the Tree of Time is my favorite Terminator movie.

  [Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder) is basically exactly like this. It's an MLP fic where the premise is that there are multiple loopers, and the only person who recalls a loop is the first looper who dies in that loop. This means that most loopers forget most of their loops. 

  Problems: It's a re-imagined version of another (decent) fic, it's dead, and it's incomplete.

    It might be revived someday - it's not marked cancelled and the author is still active. IMHO one of the best pony stories out there, if you're into time travel and arguably more intelligent versions of the characters.

      If it's been on hiatus a year it's dead.  The author isn't interested enough to make it a priority.  This one's been on hiatus for over half a decade so it's not just dead, the corpse has been eaten by scavengers and the bones are rotting away.

  ```
  so this groundhog peggy sue with two players just sounds like it converges very quickly to eliminating one player at the start of a loop.

    Who said there would be only two players?  <innocent>  


    I'm imagining someone bending over backwards to avoid known previous rebirthers from being dragged in, and ending up destroying someone else's life instead...  and trying to work out how from what-I-would-have-done and who's-trying-to-kill-me-this-time (and if/when unsuccessful, what-I-remember-doing and who-killed-me-that-time)...  


    Heh-heh, and there's always the uncertainty of 'Am I in an even life and at risk of screwing up my next odd life, am I in an odd life and just haven't been attacked yet, or am I in an odd life and I finally got my last even life 'acceptably victimless' this time?'.

  [Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder), an AU to Hard Reset and >!to canon Equestria!<: Twilight, Celestia and the queen of the changelings are in a time loop, each with a different anchor point

  [Hard Reset](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset) (possibly important to understanding the story), Twilight in a time loop has to stop the changeling invasion

  Trigger warning: ponies, implied torture, repeated-death-induced insanity

  Edit: u/Jello_Raptor beat me to it but I'll leave my comment up to signal how great the story is.

  [The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August](https://www.amazon.com/First-Fifteen-Lives-Harry-August-ebook/dp/B00ECE9OD4) is sort of like this, but you've really over-specified your request here.

    (Thank you very much for this.  It sidesteps the 'what actions to choose to handle someone who already knows what actions you would choose' thing I was curious about, but this appealed to my tastes greatly.)  


    Separate thoughts about it:  


    >!I very much liked the 'era you live in as though a place that you live' symbolism/structure (though that may be my own viewing-frame), as though people in the same place and nearby eras were nearby neighbours.  Similarly, I enjoyed the time-war approach.!<

    >!Something which bothered me the most was 'How are new kalachakras born?'.  Presumably there had been a Harry August who lived and died as a linear for many lifetimes of Virginia's, unless his birth itself was a result of a near-permanent change to the timeline.  Because of forgetting, that would have to have been from an mnemonic underpinning the timeline by making the same change each time, because aside from the mnemonics everything 'relaxes' back into shape as information isn't consistently passed on forever...  and if linears never became kalachakra, then (mnemonic underpinning aside) you'd expect kalachakra to eventually all be wiped out except for the first few, as the timeline wipes out the most-likely-to-be-born kalachakra as it thrashes around a bit.  Then again, I may have misinterpreted something never directly talked about--maybe the never-conceived can either have their next life or else start a new one, and it's only the killed-after-conception-and-before-birth which can't (in which case what's the critical moment of development?  But more to the point, people recovering from never being conceived wasn't dealt with--or rather, for the first (second?) cataclysm, it was suggested that the effects were permanent even for the never-conceived.!<

    >!It's been fun for me to consider this from a an immortality-seeking perspective.  A mnemonic alone has effective immortality (save when never born).  For a mnemonic the question becomes 'Where next?', but it's arguably fine if they still have a lot to enjoy experiencing in their lifetimes for the moment.  For humanity and the kalachakras as a whole, mnemonics aside, the situation is clearer:  the kalachakras live, the kalachakras forget.  The world ends, the linears die out.  The question then for EVERYONE is 'Where next?'.  Stagnation of a sort, staticness--death.  For the linears, everyone dies and everyone forgets through dying.  For the kalachakras, they just forget instead of dying.  The impulse next is "Okay, how do we not die?  How do we not forget?  How do we push humanity's future further--spawning more kalachakras besides--or/and how do we get actual immortality, for us and the linears, and extend humanity's future and learning/existence that way?  Do we have the option of developing technology that we can invisibly extend earlier and earlier through history, setting up an infrastructure which lets people live their lives as normal throughout history, still birthing the kalachakra origins, but whisks them away to the rest of the hidden technologically-advanced universe once they would have died?  (Kalachakras accidentally dying in the future having the option of 'leaving early' at any time?)".!<  


    >!With this perspective, Harry's reversal is straightforwardly confusing.  By the end he's destroying the quantum mirror for revenge, but then why did he do his reversal in the first place?  'This is rot, this is stagnant, the tree is dead, let's take an axe to it for the sake of the quantum mirror, which is the ONLY WAY OUT because even the kalachakras in the furthest future of humanity with all their technology have failed'--and for that matter, why hasn't humanity and/or its kalachakras at the furthest future made a quantum mirror?--and yet, after knowingly being responsible for the cataclysm-equivalent effects on the future kalachakras (all those deaths), the reversal in response to the deaths of present and past kalachakras seems perverse.!<  


    >!Hmm, a last thought for now:  as it takes one 'life' to pass a message backwards one lifetime, and it's been noted how long it takes to wait (several lives) for replies from the future, how many lives has Vincent been making small changes for before meeting Harry and talking about the quantum mirror and Harry learning about the end of humanity getting sooner in Harry's eleventh life?  Or, maybe worse, how few lifetimes are there between Harry's life and the end of humanity?  --Ah, though amusingly silly if it turns out that 'the end of the world' is because humanity ends through a happy Singularity, and that the happy Singularity was just getting sooner and sooner.  Implausible and presumably not what was intended, granted.!<
