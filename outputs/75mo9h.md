  I like this new mix of heroes and villains, it's got a vibe going with it.  50 bucks someone tries to get Masego sloshed and dresses it up so when he awakens it looks like he slept with Archer.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    50 bucks it's Archer who does it.
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      50 bucks ArcherxHierophant for reals.
      ```

      - u/Ibbot:
        ```
        Hierophant is probably more likely to do it for the complex
        ```

- u/Iconochasm:
  ```
  So, Archer and Hunter.  Who are Ranger's other three apprentices?  Scout, Woodsman, Tracker?
  ```

- u/cupofcyanide:
  ```
  Poor Cat, fending off marriage requests and requests for an heir. I wonder if Malicia faced similar pressures.
  ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    I don't think the Dreads have any tradition of inheritances.  Rather, the position is always *seized*.  I don't think we've ever heard of a child taking it from a parent, even.
    ```

    - u/nick012000:
      ```
      IIRC when Cat was learning about history early in the story it was mentioned that there was one like of Dread Emperors that did inherit it from their parents, which lasted for three generations before their enemies completely destroyed them and murdered the entire family.
      ```

        ```
        Found [it](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/chapter-15-company/)
        >There was no Imperial dynasty: the longest a family had ever managed to claim the Tower was three generations, and theyâ€™d been wiped out to the last when the third Emperor was overthrown.
        ```

    - u/cupofcyanide:
      ```
      That's a good point. I forgot about that. A child taking power from a parent is a pretty classic story though. I'd figure it would have to have happened at some point.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        That's what the name of Heir/Heiress is there for, isn't it?
        ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  And so it begins, the Woe.
  ```

  - u/PrettyDecentSort:
    ```
    They need to adopt a tree somewhere, so that they can send people there to contemplate things.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I really like this chapter, I'm all up for another hero to join cats ranks
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    You just want her to become a hero through contamination, do you?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      not at all, in the beggining black mentioned a powerfull empire that was ruled by a duo Hero/villian, I think cat can pull it off.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        The Yan Tei empire, a Chinese (?) themed empire. Their armies are lead by a hero/villain duo, but I don't believe that's the same as their political leader.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Well cat only says "No nation on our continent would be able to function with bot a hero and a villain sharing the highest level of authority, but they seemed to be doing fine"

          As far a we nowt hey could be Co emperor / empress and even a couple. I think the world building is what I like the most of the guide.
