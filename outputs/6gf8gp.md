  This is now my default response to this kind of questions.

    The funny thing is if you have a utility function it means you fundamentally haven't changed, never will, and if your character has changed, it's only because you're in a different context now where your incentives are different and probably not because you're sorry or anything like that.

      That's not remotely true. First of all: even superintelligences are not omnipotent, and there is nothing stopping events outside ones own control from changing your utility function. Whether that's a bit-flip from a stray cosmic ray, or a more powerful superintelligence twisting you to suit its own goals, or some other reason, it's entirely imaginable that an entity's utility function changes over time. (Against that entity's wishes, of course. Well, against that entity's original wishes.)

      But even aside from that: it's flat out wrong that "having a utility function" is in any way an unusual case. The VNM theorem says that any agent who satisfies four axioms has a utility function. Not that they necessarily have an explicit function that they consciously try to maximize, but rather that it is possible to construct a function that their behavior always seeks to maximize.

      Now, are you VNM-rational? For instance, are your preferences transitive? If they're not, I can money-pump you for everything you've got. So if you're not money-pumpable, you must necessarily have transitive preferences.

      Likewise, all the rest of the VNM axioms are ones that any non-trivially exploitable agent follows. This means you, *yes you*, have a utility function. Not that you're consistently trying to optimize it, but there is a function out there that you could be accurately modeled as trying your best to maximize.

      So don't treat having a utility function as something special that only AIs do. Perhaps only an AI might be aware of the explicit formula for its own utility function, but you, me, and most other humans are utility-maximizers all the same.

        Are there any ways to money pump a human that don't expose the imbalance clearly enough that the slow consistency-finding process wouldn't immediately patch it? I can't think of any. This does not mean that intransitive preferences in humans don't exist, it just means humans intuitively try to fix them where they can.

        Maybe if you take a static snapshot of a human's preference ordering, it would be VNM rational. I can't find a way to demonstrate otherwise. However, it's quite obvious that preferences are not stable over time. The evening human buys an irritating alarm clock to undermine the temporary preferences of the morning human. We drink and sleep and expose ourselves to deeply transformative influences without trepidation, we don't genuinely aspire to stability. We subject ourselves to mode shifts we might never come back from, and I'd argue that we do that so frequently that if you found a utility function that implements it, it would boil down to "It's good to implement this state machine". We lack the character of a utility function(if I as someone who is not a practicing mathematician have the right to characterize the utility function construct.. perhaps not). We are state machines that sometimes use utility functions.

        I suppose I can't argue on mathematical grounds that such a thing wouldn't be a utility function.

        I guess the disagreement is about pragmatics, when I say "utility function", I don't mean the mathematical construct, I'm talking about a machine part. If you see a utility function out in the world it's because someone built it. If a human built it, they probably would have made it behave far more.. temporally consistently.. than any human is. Many of the consequences of that elegant temporal consistency will appear monstrously strange. I wonder if it will seem monstrous enough that future, moderate FAI advocates would argue that too much consistency is bad.

  I like how the ninja is never actually encountered. As expected of a true ninja.

    Someone should write a story that has nothing to do with ninjas but where every so often they just mention that "no one knew if the ninja had been there."

  Found it via EY's Facebook, since this was a response to a prompt he tossed out about "the exceptional woman with a surfeit of supernatural lovers."

  Huh. Neat!

  ...Is it weird that my first response to this story is "She is totally a Heir of Blood"? I mean, a nexus around which bonds change... it fits!

  That ending had me in stitches. Very cute story.

  The premise has similarities to the Haruhi Suzumiya series.

  I really expected "source of income".

  Lost it. Perfect ending line. XD

  That was brilliant and engaging.  I love post-post modern works where you take a genre or trope apart, expose all the gears, then put it back together and make it work just like the original trope . . . only not.  Just brilliant, really.

  Also . . . that last line . . .LOL

  That was nice but you've gotta admit "a flawed fragment of god who loves stories did it" is the strongest possible deus ex machina, perfectly fitted to the task of explaining any nice story.

  I was smiling when I finished it, and I'm still smiling after reading all 13 comments at this point, so I'm pretty sure that I liked it and it's good.
