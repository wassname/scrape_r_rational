  One question left:  Why *Acre*?  As in, [Akko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel), the actual city across the bay from me?

  And my main objection, still mounted after all this time since reading it the first time: Gwern's lack of a model for how to run a society with zero systematic violence is not a proof that doing so is impossible.  It's not even a proof that doing so is *improbable*, since *the map is not the territory*.  Hell, many modern First World countries *already* run with very minimal systematic violence and ever-more-unobtrusive systemic violence, *and I say this as a devoted socialist*.

  I feel a rant coming on, and it's the same one as always: *pain is not Bayesian evidence, and darkness is not a probability!*

  Interesting. A lot of that echoes Dr. Cruces and, especially, Lady T'Malia's speech from Terry Pratchett's *Pyramids*. I had occasion to listen to those particular speeches just earlier today watching Mark Oshiro's markreads.net videos for this week - he is currently going through Pratchett's Discworld in publication order at a rate of 5 sections of 20-30 pages each per every fortnight and he *just* hit the relevant section of Pyramids this week.

  From *Pyramids*, part of a lecture given to a class of student assassins:

  >'And thus,' she said, 'let us consider the position before the founding of the Guild. In this city, and indeed in many places elsewhere, civilisation is nurtured and progresses by the dynamic interplay of interests among many large and powerful advantage cartels.

  >'In the days before the founding of the Guild the seeking of advancement among these consortia invariably resulted in regrettable disagreements which were terminated with extreme prejudice. These were extremely deleterious to the common interest of the city. Please understand that where disharmony rules, commerce flags.

  >'And yet, and yet.' She clasped her hands to her bosom. There was a creak like a galleon beating against a gale. 

  >'Clearly there was a need for an extreme yet responsible means of settling irreconcilable differences,' she went on, 'and thus was laid the groundwork for the Guild. What bliss − ' the sudden peak in her
  voice guiltily jerked several dozen young men out of their private reveries − 'it must have been to have been present in those early days, when men of stout moral purpose set out to forge the ultimate political tool short of warfare. How fortunate you are now, in training for a guild which demands so much in terms of manners, deportment, bearing and esoteric skills, and yet offers a power once the preserve only of the gods. Truly, the world is the mollusc of your choice . . .

  Dr. Cruces' speech is on essentially how pure their motives as profit-seekers are compared to others who kill for reasons of desire, belief, etc.

    I can't help but think that if Ankh-Morpork wasn't run by Havelock Vetinari it would never *work*, and that no such system would ever work in real life, and that we developed things like parties and elections for genuine, relevant reasons rather than because we were too stupid to come up with government-by-assassination.

  Sorry if I'm being dense, but how does legalizing anonymized assassinations actually disincentivize warfare? Can't you still just raise an army anyway?
