## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I am trying to figure out what's essentially technobabble for a story. It's the 1970s and you're a wizard. Your magic has some kind of way to interact with the new era of computing which allows for new and interesting things to be done.

  **What gaps would a magic system need to have in order to be made better by hooking it up to a 1970s microcomputer (e.g. Apple II)?**

  So far I have ***logic*** and ***memory***, which means that one of the things that a magic spell can't normally do is operate on conditionals (complex or otherwise) and another thing it can't do is store and retrieve information for later. Magic then essentially acts as a peripheral that you can hook up to your computer (as prior to computers, this was done entirely by hooking a mage up instead).

    Put yourself into the shoes of any magician. What part of your job sucks?

    * Do diabolists have to draw tediously complex pentagrams in salt to summon an imp? Can a computer + CNC machine inscribe these shapes and forms perfectly, every time?
    * Do spells require exact timing (can only operate at midnight on the first blue moon of the year)? A computer can serve as alarms or watchdog processes.
    * Do potions require exact temperatures, exact content mixtures? Can a computerized thermometer aid the process? What about mass-production of potions in a factory?
    * Can mana/magic be stored in a vessel? Can computers access and release it? Check the storage level? Use it as a battery or other input?
    * Can mystic chanting be recorded and replayed over speakers?
    * Could you use a spell search engine? A potion database?

    Automate the parts of magic that are limiting factors for humans.

      I like the idea of a C++ like compiler that reads your magic language and outputs a list of errors/warnings if you screwed something up.

          warning line23.col8:  Amount of virgin blood is inconsistent with spell casting time ...
          note line12.col8:     ... Required from this point

      It seems like the first case would have been solved by having copper etching of pentagrams that salt could be poured into.
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        It's easy enough to un-solve it:  Magically active salt must be stored in prepared containers until it is to be used.  If it touches anything other than the ritual circle (such as a stencil), it loses some of its power.
        ```

        - u/Gurkenglas:
          ```
          So make the prepared container the shape of a ritual circle negative, and wouldn't the CNC machine also reduce the power by touching this?
          ```

          - u/ulyssessword:
            ```
            *Waves hands more*.  The container can only be roughly spherical in shape.  The CNC machine doesn't reduce the power because it is holding the salt bag in place of the cutting tool, and also up an inch or so above the surface.
            ```

            - u/Gurkenglas:
              ```
              Blow through an anti-stencil? Tell an imp to draw the lines? Clockwork moving the bag along [a composition of epicycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVuU2YCwHjw) as the CNC would?
              ```

      - u/MereInterest:
        ```
        That's only if the shape being drawn is the same each time.   Perhaps the diagram requires small modifications based on current conditions, and therefore must be recalculated with each casting.
        ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    What if the logic/conditionals isn't a feature of magic, but rather a feature of making it match what people intuitively think?

    For example, what if magic spells were dependent on predictable horoscope-like features?  *Fireball* shoots towards Jupiter unless you use direction-changing metamagic, (which has a coordinate system relative to something else, like the plane of the ecliptic). 

    If you wanted to shoot someone to the east of you, your spell set would be [Fireball] + [Aim +27 degrees forwards from Jupiter] + [Rotate aim point 75 degrees clockwise (with the axis on Jupiter)].  This is useful for a human in a siege situation, but not in any context that requires quick action.

    This could also be used to reduce already-known rituals to their base components and enable generalized use.  "Ritual magic" is magic that people have only solved for one set of conditions, like a full moon that is occluding Mars, or when the sun is directly above the equator at your longitude.  This would also likely mean that there are ritual *sites* scattered all around the world, where individual spellcrafters made spells designed for the local conditions.
    ```

    One of the Discworld books has the magical computer HEX able to speed up calculation massively because it can cast the same scrying spell, with minor variations, *several times a second* - far faster than any human wizard (and then translate the results into a very accurate human-readable form), thus turning a fuzzy and uncertain picture of the future into a far *less* fuzzy and uncertain picture of the future.

    So, let us consider, for example, a simple spell that tells you where an atom, randomly selected from within a range of three centimetres the point the caster designates, will most probably be one week from now.

    Tom the Mage, without a computer, can cast this spell on an opponent (aiming for his centre of mass) and get some idea of where the opponent will be next week.

    Marvin the computer-aided mage can have the spell cast on a thousand points spaced out over his opponent's skin (or just under it), and tell not only where he'll be in a week but have a very good idea of the pose he will be standing in.

  Magic systems are hard and trying to come up them can get frustrating. Something I've been trying to formulate recently is a magic based an a finite state machine. Basically magic would have a few simple operations like force coupling and then allow for states determine which was invoked with state transitions relying on another small set of rules. The biggest problem is I really don't want to violate thermodynamics, but I'm not sure how to add this without violating at least entropy.
  ```

  - u/Afforess:
    ```
    Why not embrace the fact that magic reverses entropy? It could be the way your civilization combats the universe's heat death, down the road. That could be an epic tale.

    Make plot holes a plot feature.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I have an idea of a HPMOR RatFic (a crossover with other work) branching on chapter 74, where Tracey's summons actually work, summoning an other work character.

  I feel like it'd be good in the quest format, so that readers control Harry and I describe others characters snippets (Quirell, Dumbledore, and OtherWorkCharacter) -- that also helps to gauge the readers' interest and abandon it if there are no votes anymore. Also, it gives the freedom of action -- players can either spend time investigating Rules of Magic, risking not to foil villains' plot in time; or focus on the plot, risking that somebody else will be ahead of Harry in magic knowledge.

  I also feel that I know how to consistently merge HPMOR's vague magic model with OtherWork's magic model... basically make the OtherWork a prequel of The Times Before Merlin.

  The thing is, I've never written a line of fiction in English and am not sure if I'll be ready for turning my inconsistent set of pre-made worldbuilding connections inside my mind into actual writing.  

  Also I feel that I lack dedication to write things.

  I could find a willing co-author here, perhaps?

    ```
    Can we at least know who is being summoned? I'm very curious and am guessing it is Lina Inverse, because the summoning ritual borrows a few lines from her spell Dragon Slave.
    ```
