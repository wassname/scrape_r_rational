## Blood Crestâ€”"The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard 'rescues' a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people."

  Second the recommendation.  The author even had a one month or so block because the second Grindelwald movie contradicted elements the author planned to introduce; the author said they realised their qualms were silly in the end, but I think that shows just how committed they are to the consistency of their worldbuilding.

    Harry's situation gets less bleak later on as the plot advances, and there are some moments of levity mixed in.

  Wow, this is really fucking good. Refreshing is a good way to put it. I really like the in-depth approaches to explaining the magic we see in the original series.

  I do feel like Harry lacks a lot of agency especially at the point I'm at right now (chapter 32) but I can wholeheartedly recommend the story even with its flaws.

  What's the update frequency? 37 chapters over almost 6 years doesn't seem very fast.

  (I'm not one to talk, but...)

    Over the past year the author has posted about one chapter per month. In my experience that's a rather good rate for a fanfic.

    The author constantly complains and apologizes about their slow update rate in the author's notes over those six years, so I really don't think this will ever be finished. What's already there is worth reading.

      Hey, I do that too! And I'll totally finish! At some point.
