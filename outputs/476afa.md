  My memory of canon is vague, but these are the Howlers, and Ellimist and Crayak are basically confirmed.

  Not sure how to interpret that Rachel isn't supposed to be there. I remember in canon [spoiler](#s "Ellimist basically stacked the deck with Elfangor's son, Elfangor's brother, Visser One's host's child and Cassie's weird superpowers"), but Rachel wasn't a part of that.

    Applegate was pretty inconsistent regarding the Ellimist. At first there's a whole race of them, then there's the one. He's fighting a furious battle against Crayak in the name of everything good and decent and the only reason they hold back is to avoid destroying the universe, no, wait, he's just his superchess partner. Cassie is a temporal anomaly, except for some reason it didn't show in any of the three previous storylines involving time travel.

      I rather liked the unreliable narrator regarding crayak and co and I thought the Ellimist chronicles resolved most of the perceived inconsistency.

      The cassie thing I completely forgot about when was that brought up?

        Megamorphs #4: Back to Before.

        [Spoilers](#s "The Drode makes an offer to Jake to completely undo his involvement in the war, which an exhausted Jake agrees to.  The Drode changes the timeline so the Animorphs never go to the construction site, but the future refuses to change: the Animorphs find themselves remembering random things, and sometimes pop in and out of morph.  This results in the Yeerk movement being exposed and nearly defeated almost immediately, and the Drode calls the Ellimist out for "stacking the deck" in including Cassie in the group, who is temporally grounded.  Frustrated, the Drode undoes his undoing.")

        In the last Megamorphs book. Cassie turns to have weird "remember the original canon powers" that trigger when Crayak retcons the team into not meeting elfangor. It's mostly a very good book, because unlike every other Megamorphs and a lot of Animorphs there's not a status quo to go back to, so you're not sure what's going to happen, but the whole "Cassie is a time anchor" thing made no sense.

        And yes, the inconsistencies can somewhat be explained by the narrator lying, but that's another way to justify a nonsensical plot point by saying "Because the Ellimist was bored".

  I've only just discovered this subreddit, having blundered across this beautiful fic and binge-read it in entirety. 

  It's a work of incredible cognitive grace. When I'm addicted to rationalist fiction and recommending it to my pals, years from now, I'll be citing this fic as the one that got me into it. 

  Thanks for sharing it!

  Solid little interlude with an excellent finisher. As someone who never got very far into canon!Animorphs, I'm excited to see what it all means!

    Spoiler alert: the monstrous-looking bloodthirsty death machines with lava skin who hunt sentient aliens for sport are bad guys. Or are they ?

  I am so glad to see this back! Now to reread the entire thing so I'm prepared.
