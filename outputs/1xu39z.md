## Rationalist music [RT]

### Post:

[The Symphony of Science](http://melodysheep.bandcamp.com/album/symphony-of-science-collectors-edition), by electronic musician John Boswell. In his words, “*..the goal of the project is to bring scientific knowledge and philosophy to the public, in a novel way, through the medium of music.*” 


My personal favourite was hands down the Glorious Dawn featuring Carl Sagan. His son, Nick Sagan seeing it [commented on it in his blog..](http://nicksagan.blogs.com/nick_sagan_online/2009/09/a-glorious-dawn.html)


Boswell auto-tunes audio samples featuring popular scientists from science series and then scores it in with his original compositions. 


Honestly though, I never thought I’d be able to rock out to Stephen Hawkings.. I loved Richard Dawkins’ sayings. “*Matter flows from place to place, and momentarily comes together to be you. Some people find that thought disturbing; I find the reality thrilling.*”  Just had to go get the book itself after that. It really struck me for some reason.


Have you guys come across anything science themed before? I haven’t been able to find anything else apart from the Space-ambient genre.

  Well there is always the [Ballad of Smallpox Gone](/http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/The+Ballad+Of+Smallpox+Gone/4f7lHc?src=5) that was placed in the 'Sorta Rational Fics' section of the [TvTropes Rational Fics](/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic) page.

  It's interesting to say the least.

  More transhumanist than rationalist, with some questionable physics.  Really good though.

  My personal favorite as well. Love the imagery of "Not a sun rise, but a galaxy rise."  I think the only 'rationalist' music I've heard besides symphony of science is [Nightwish's "Song of Myself"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtFzV6P4EUs), and even then, it's kinda iffy. I've heard a decent amount of transhumanist music, but I wouldn't necessarily classify it as rational, although I guess it could be classified as a subgenre.  

  Actually, forgot about [Tim Minchin's "Storm"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U), which definitely qualifies.

  Not strictly rationalist, but science-themed: Loquat's "[Time Bending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjFphY1fMBk)" ([lyrics](http://artists.letssingit.com/loquat-lyrics-time-bending-kgm8wls#axzz2tWbltnQJ)).

  Several of their other songs have rationalist-friendly lyrics--"Comedown's Worse" and "Harder Hit" are the two I think of--but aren't science-themed.

  I believe our fearless Eliezer himself referenced MUSE's "Butterflies and Hurricanes" at one point.  It hits upon rationalist themes quite nicely, especially for a mainstream song:

  >Change  
  Everything you are  
  And everything you were  
  Your number has been called  
  [...]  
  Best  
  You've got to be the best  
  You've got to save the world  
  And use this chance to be  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard  
  Your time is now

  A bit general, but appropriate--especially since the titular phenomenon is commonly referenced in rationalist fiction.  Personally, I hear this song whenever I think of Worm, HPMOR, or Game of Thrones.  And there are other MUSE songs which may be similarly applicable: for instance, Madness, which concludes that the traditional romantic ideal of love--i.e., purely emotional/impulsive  \*and\* fully irrational--is literally a form of madness.
