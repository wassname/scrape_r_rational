  I rather liked the response on the forum that suggested funding a rescue and evacuation.

    The [Salvation War](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar?from=Main.TheSalvationWar) series comes to mind. I don't know that I would call it 'rational fiction', per se, but it featured a refreshingly pragmatic human response to an 'end times' scenario (including [] (#s "the invasion and occupation of hell and a massive multinational rescue/rehabilitation operation for the countless tortured dead from throughout human history. It also explored the social, cultural, and psychological ramifications of immortality, to a certain extent.")), written by a military analyst to boot.

      Matching your flair, I was thinking *Surface Detail*.  The Salvation War was a little too... enthusiastic about some of the horror (on both sides) for my taste.

        The problem with surface detail is that you need to have read the other series to know whose [spoiler](#s "Xanatos Gabit was behind destroying the hells.  The name Vitue goes back to: "Zakalway"  is the SC agent who was the subject of "Use of weapons": i.e. the culture planned it all along")

        The salvation war struck me as a few  hundred "take that's" against Christianity and associated religions cosmology and your usual military porn, but it's a fun read despite Heaven and Hell clutching the idiot ball to their chest.

      that has to be the most 'murican book ever.

  As I posted to Twitter, I'd go in with an army, force a regime change (i.e. take over the place) and market free immortality to all. All you have to do is be careful to sin enough!
