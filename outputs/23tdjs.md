  I think the best future I've seen is in *Down and Out in The Magic Kingdom*.

  In the unusual but excellent category, I have to reccomend *[To the Stars](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars)*.  

  It's a far-future AU of *Puella Magi Madoka Magica*, which went through WW3 before achieving post-scarcity space colonisation.  Everything was going beautifully until the aliens started attacking...

  Of note:  fantastic worldbuilding, treatment of bioenhancement (mental and physical), Friendly AI thanks to a Wish, and the main characters from the anime - now 400+ years old - being terrifyingly competent compared to the young main character.  Humanity basically got the good ending... and then sideswiped by aliens.

    So... you mean an actually realistic projection of the future, plus or minus mahou shoujo?

    Because I keep thinking we're gonna get sideswiped by aliens the minute we get our butts off this world.

    >Friendly AI thanks to a Wish

    About time someone tried that.

  Some Greg Egan stuff is kind of close. Diaspora, for example. I'm not sure everyone will get the same kind of warm fuzzies from it as I do, though, and there's a fair chunk of inaccuracy.

  I think Friendship is Optimal comes closest when it comes to a single individual's well-being and values. Once you get over the initial shock, you could live in that kind of world for a long, long time. And it seems truly fun. The only bad things are that the world doesn't seem to have any true randomness, they don't have access to the real world, and they aren't "free" the way I understand freedom.

    FiO is an interesting case. It's more of "taking a third option" if you will. Humanity fundamentally changes, not just in bodily appearance and social norms, but in how they interacted with the universe at large. To this day, I'm not sure if I want this future or not.
    ```

      I actually don't think it's that strange. I mean, the 'Superhappies' utopia in Three Worlds Collide is even more different and some people have still defended it. I have the feeling that if you seriously started implementing the [Coherent Extrapolated Volition](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition) of humanity and let it reach its conclusion, FiO utopia would be child's play when compared to that - which is an argument against FiO utopia of course.

    It's been awhile since I've read it, but there's also the [](#s "genocide of all non-human intelligences throughout the galaxy"), right?
    ```

    - u/erwgv3g34:
      ```
      Yes, with the exception of [FiO](#s " a few alien races which are similar enough to humans to count under CelestAI's hard-coded definition of what "human" means.")
      ```

- u/AmeteurOpinions:
  ```
  [Unreal Estate](http://stefangagne.com/unrealestate/) is a pretty awesome world. The story itself is great (imagine if Terry Pratchett wrote a harem anime) but also rather irrational so I've never mentioned it here before.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I should really finally finish reading *City of Angles*.

    >(imagine if Terry Pratchett wrote a harem anime)

    I don't even like harem anime, but that's a damn good recommendation.
    ```
