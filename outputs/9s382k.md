  If you're starting out, [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index) is a good place to start.

  Personal recommendations: "Worth the Candle" and "A Practical Guide to Evil". Both are quite popular around here.

  If you have more specific things about MoL that you enjoyed, we might be able to narrow down some recommendations.

      In this case, both my recommendations stand.

      If you haven't played them before, you should check out the Exile series by spiderweb software. They're a large inspiration. I suggest starting with Exile 3 ruined world, but if you can't do old games the avernum games are newer remakes.

      I can second both of those, Cat's murderous adventures is better though.

  The Good Student isn't on the same level quality wise, but I think the 2 have similar protaganists and the same tone. The sequel Good Student II just started posting.

    I felt that the later chapters of [The Good Student](http://moodylit.com/index.php/the-good-student-table-of-contents) were less clear, replacing precise descriptions by vague concepts. While I think a sense or lack of clarity is merely a stylistic choice, it is something I always appreciated about MoL. Apart from that, I do think it is worth reading.

  What I loved about MoL is the gradual improvements Zorian made throughout the story. Cradle by Will Wight and the Arcane Ascension series by Andrew Rowe. The MCs in both stories start weak and gradually improve their strengths to overcome challenges. 

  If you like the time travel aspect, Time Braid, which is a Naruto fanfiction and is complete is written pretty well. The MC in there is Sakura, but Naruto gets enough screen time as well. She is not stupid  or annoying as in canon either. You need a little familiarity with the series to enjoy it though.
  ```

    Or, if you want the badfic version of Time Braid, you can read [Chuunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day), which is inarguably its inspiration.

    I mention this because I'm fairly sure Mother of Learning owes its existence to Chuunin Exam Day - the author was active in the Naruto fandom before writing it, and a lot of worldbuilding elements and themes are similar. (Chakra control exercises versus shaping exercises, the long time loop in specific, the emphasis on finding different masters and learning things from them, and Zack in particular, who is basically Naruto with Sasuke's backstory.) I'm not certain, but that's definitely what I had in mind when I was reading it.
    ```

    - u/SnowGN:
      ```
      My favorite thing about Mother of Learning's worldbuilding is how obviously Naruto/Chakra-system-inspired it is. I absolutely love that aspect of Naruto, and it adds so much depth to Mother of Learning. A world in which magic is literally omnipresent, bloodline limits exist, the huge focus on (ahem) chakra control, etc.
      ```

      - u/randomkloud:
        ```
        They were all relatively novel concepts to me. Then again I seem to be the only one that hasn't read/watched naruto
        ```

        - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
          ```
          I watched and enjoyed naruto, but nothing about MoL specifically screamed "NARUTO REFERENCE" to me... Even now that the connection has been pointed, it's not obvious to me that shaping exercises were adapted from chakra control exercises. I've seen similar things in a bunch of different fictional universes.

          For example, one of Andur's books (I think it was Agent of the Realm) has a mana control exercise in a classroom setting where students have to try to hold an floating object in place without anchoring it to the position of their hand, just like in MoL. Isn't stuff like that fairly standard training fare for fantasy?
          ```

          - u/AnimaLepton:
            ```
            I think it's a level divorced from that. It's "Naruto-fanfic" inspired rather than Naruto-inspired. Again, read Chuunin Exam Day. Or don't read it since it's pretty garbage, quality-wise, but it was certainly influential. 

            Many of the elements from Arc 1 of Mother of Learning have the 
            same "flavor" as the powerups in Chuunin Exam Day. For specific examples, basically all of Zorian's work with working on (the basic 3) shaping to make your attacks invisible and modify magic/techniques fall into that category, including the idea of a "basic three" techniques for training/needed to progress to better magic. The numerous shaping exercises (in Arc 1) that improve control were clearly inspired by it and had analogues in Chuunin Exam Day in terms of how they were described. Some of the later ideas like bringing people across loops and some of the mind technique stuff also have a similar style to how those ideas are implemented in Chuunin Exam Day or Time Braid.

            Edit: Another thing that comes to mind is how Zach claims that people are willing to train him due to being the last Noveda when explaining himself to Zoria- this is basically what people do for Sasuke (or rather, Naruto impersonating Sasuke) in Chunin Exam Day and is phrased in a very similar manner. It gets actual further development later on in MoL, when we actually learn about the Noveda, but the initial shorthand explanation in Chapter 8 of Mother of Learning definitely feels like it's straight out of CED.

            Another minor thing that gives it the same feel is the one-month time limitation. Both Chuunin Exam Day and the early parts of Time Braid use time loops that only last one month (more accurately, just over 5 weeks, with one month of training before the end of each loop), due to primarily taking place during the Chuunin exam arc. Most other groundhog day/time loop-type fiction uses a different timescale- some have each loop last for a full lifetime, some are a single day like the titular movie, some are loops that slowly progress forward in time, etc.
            ```

              Huh... I guess that makes sense. Thanks for the explanation!

            I tried watching Naruto, but I absolutely hated it. The characters were absolutely horrible and cliche, the animation was mediocre and the whole thing was weirdly sexist. Didn't make it past 5 minutes into the first episode.

            I do seem to enjoy Naruto fanfiction. Read both Time Braid and The Waves Arisen. Had to do some reading up on the setting initially, but after that it wasnt a big deal.

    She also has sex with children after she’s an adult, you seem to have forgotten to mention that happens in time braid.  Pedophile MC is a dealbreaker for some people.

        Seducing Ino and Sasuke (who are *11*)when she’s way older and basically just trying again and again until she can manipulate them into her bed?  Also, some people get turned off of that story by the cold blooded mind-breaking torture that you-know-who inflicts.  Honestly, I have no idea why so many people just casually recommend such an... adult fic
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Timebraid's ages are weird. Technically Sakura and the rest of the genins are 12 years old at the beginning of the story, at least that's what canon says and the fic never claims otherwise. On the other hand, within the first few months of Timebraid Sakura has sex with Ino and Sasuke, and it's heavily implied by her inner dialogue that she'd had sex at least a few times before that.

          That and some other little things give the impression that the author wrote the genins like they were at least 14 or 15, even though canon says they're 12.
          ```

          - u/lifelingering:
            ```
            I managed to come across and read this story without knowing anything at all about the original, and I definitely thought the characters were ~15. Honestly, aside from being super weird, I don’t feel like they act like 12-year-olds even at the beginning of the story, so I’m going to stick with my mental image.
            ```

          - u/SpeculativeFiction:
            ```
            I'll agree Timebraid's ages are weird, and it definitely requires a disclaimer before being recommended. His Daniel Black series also has a high amount of sex, but lacks the whole squicky age problem.

            But it's source is pretty weird about ages too. Ninja are typically given minimal training and enter a death match to try and become Chunin at age 12 or so.

            It's a world where valuable magic users, even the children of the powerful leaders of communities, are made into child soldiers and have their lives, IMO, wasted frivolously. 

            They shouldn't act like normal children, because they haven't had anything like a normal childhood. It's also possible Chakra changes how people mature mentally.

            Kakashi became a Chunin at age 6. Frankly, I don't see how else to make sense of that without Chakra making humans have some pretty big biological differences.
            ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Are we talking about the same story? Sakura is the same age, physically, as the others. She's only mentally older do to the time-reset feature.
          ```

          - u/UniversalKenderLove:
            ```
            Just to tack onto what Aardvarkeating101 said and forestall arguing about definitions, not only is pedophilia usually condemned for the power imbalance (which is present in this example), but even when young children (who are usually abused and are essentially using what they've been taught) have sex play with their cohorts, the other children then generally show trauma afterwards. Time traveler having sex with 11 year-olds ticks all the components for what makes pedophilia objectionable.
            ```

            - u/Rouninscholar:
              ```
              What I find interesting about this conversation, is that it clearly does happen, but is not in the top 10 of most fucked up things that happens there.
              ```

              - u/UniversalKenderLove:
                ```
                Huh. It's been years since I read it, and I do recall some atrocities that overshadow pedophilia, but not 10. Would you mind listing those?
                ```

                - u/Rouninscholar:
                  ```
                  Well, in no particular order:

                  1. Sakura was locked into her mind and tortured moderately early on, by creating a smaller virtual time loop starting from a particular moment where the torturer has godlike controls. It hints at rape, directly mentions being dissected while still alive, and a good number of tortures that we don't have words for because it is not possible.

                  2. With these tortures he created a second trick by "releasing" her, and then giving orders, and putting her back into the other full torture system any time she slightly failed so as to condition her to be as perfectly mindless of a slave as possible.

                  3. Straight up mind control happens at several points in time.

                  4. As she is sneaking into a house she gets attacked. casually murders the guy trying to protect his family. This was basically a single sentence, but when murder is such a common occurance "opps, well moving on" is your answer, that is a bad sign.

                  5. Locking hinata's very soul to be always owned by  demon sakura, for eternity. But that is alright, because over the past few weeks they "fell in love". ( for those keeping score, this is pedophilia, followed by claiming an immortal soul, pleasure pain conditioning, and controlling her to harm others and herself because the demon said so)

                  6. The plan to literally carry every soul in the world physically into hell, along with the world itself, to be tortured for all time.

                  After that it gets foggy. Does wanton murder count?
                  Stripping someone, tying them up and carving their skin? How many different ways of losing your free will? They carved a guys eyes out early on, so she could wear them. Manipulated pretty much everyone, including kids, into having kinky sex? Throwing kids into basically a pit fight with knives to murder each other? Does the training of child soldiers count as worse? How about the Caged Bird seal?

                  hell, even canon has mutilation of babies by parents, powerful drugs, mind control, suicide, training of child soldiers, and pit fighting them to death.
                  ```

                  - u/UniversalKenderLove:
                    ```
                    Well damn. I feel like now I'll need to link this anytime someone recommends Time Braid.
                    ```

                      ```
                      Like, don't take it wrong, I loved the story. but it is DARK.
                      ```

          - u/Ardvarkeating101:
            ```
            Mentally older but in a younger body, to me, just seems like dressing up as a teenager to hook up with underage girls.  You're still a pedophile, you just don't look it.
            ```

        - u/Ozryela:
          ```
          I don't think the story mentions any age, but the characters clearly aren't 11. They talk, act and think as near-adults. Somewhere between 15 and 18. I dont know about their age in the source material, but that's not really relevant anyway. 

          The scene with Ino and Sasuke happens very early in the story, when there's only been aimited number of short loops. The main character is still basically the same age at the point.

          Later in the story she has lots more sex, but as far as I recall only with adults or other loopers.
          ```

          - u/Ardvarkeating101:
            ```
            I'm pretty sure they are just barely going through puberty at the beginning or haven't gone through it at all, which is why the "adult form" hormones cause such dramatic personality shifts, so either 11 or 10.

    How to avoid death on a daily basis started off really strong and took itself seriously. But towards the later chapters it became ridiculous and a parody of itself. It lost its grimdark feel and turned more into a comedy which is kind of misleading.
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    I enjoyed it for the first 4 books of escape death but after that it started falling off, and that hard. The main character keeps being an unbearable twat, which is fun for the first little while but becames grating once we got further in and the group stays rather immature despite several life and death situations. And the whole thing wiht >!that dead god that wasn't actually dead !< was just sprung so randomly that it kind of ruined it for me.
    ```

- u/Areign:
  ```
  Firstly, I'd recommend exploring the various time loop stories.
  Time Braid and Purple Days are good examples.

  I also felt like litrpg's scratch a similar itch. Rowe's Sufficiently Advanced Magic is more of a litrpg lite but still great, 
  Ascend Online is a good example of a solid traditional litrpg.
