## Rational Pony Fanfiction Compendium

### Post:

If rational/rationalist pony fics are for you, then you're in luck! We've just finished sorting through the list of nominated fics on the LessWrong group on FiMFiction.net. You can find all of the approved fics [here](http://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/lesswrong). Many of the approved fics deal heavily with subject matter that might interest LessWrong members (uploading, transhumanism, etc.) without being rational fics, though it should be possible to figure out which fics are which by reading the story descriptions.

Cheers!

  RHJ's [The Great Alicorn Hunt](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/92077/the-great-alicorn-hunt) and its prequel [Parting Words](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/60523/parting-words) certainly qualify.

    Thanks for the recommendations. Great Alicorn Hunt was already included. I've just given Parting Words a read, and it doesn't seem quite as relevant to our interests, since Celestia's treatment of Twilight makes more sense in a world where friendship is actually magic and where existential risks can't actually occur (because that would wreck the show's continuability) than it would in our own world.

    If you want to press the case for a specific piece of fanfic being included, the best place to do that is the [story nomination thread](http://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/lesswrong/thread/199827/story-nomination-thread)

      ... \*squints.\* Sir, you are aware that Parting Words is a *direct* sequel to The Great Alicorn Hunt, yes? As in, they are part of *the very same narrative* and that one provides if not crucial, then at least important back-story for the other?

      Parting Words is a *prologue* for TGAH. It is not a separate story, and I am genuinely confused by your reply to my post.

        There are rational-fic with irrational, or less relevantly rational, prequels. If someway made Belatrix lestrange and the rational terror as a prquel to HPMOR, it might be less rational, or less relevantly rational, as belatrix is no rationalist even in HPMOR canon

  I can't for the life of me remember what it was called, but there was a really good one where some pony comes across [](#s "an ancient human relic, which turns out to be a nuclear waste storage facility. Despite the best attempts of the ancients to discourage exploration, the ponies go in anyway")

  Thank you for getting me addicted to [The Moon's Apprentice](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice), you *monster*. How am I going to function while I wait for the next update?

    Same here, I have honestly never before found a fic quite like it.

  > Put stories in here whose central ideas are relevant to our interests.  If you don't know what's relevant to LessWrong because you haven't read LessWrong, don't put stories here. You don't need to be as strict about quality as about concept.

  I can't help but think this is overly harsh. I'd suggest that prospective authors spend time here or reading rational fic to get a feel for what rfic is first, and then submit to nominations in addition to the above to sound less exclusive. I can guess you've had a spamming problem, but they wouldn't listen to warnings anyway.

  I recommend in particular [Happily Ever After](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/57744/happily-ever-after) (2500 words) and [The Thousand Year Romance](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/138977/the-thousand-year-romance-of-clover-the-clever) (2500 words). *Both have happy endings.*

  I do not approve of the inclusion of [Blink](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/269332/blink) (4000 words). It's dumb. Teleportation is not murder.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Warning to readers: *The Thousand Year Romance* is basically, "What if cryonics *actually worked?*"

    It's basically the first time I was made to apply the term "heartbreaking" to something involving pastel colors and magic.

      I take it you've read neither [Biblical Monsters](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/87619/biblical-monsters) (10,000 words) nor [Souvenir](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/211007/souvenir) (3500 words). Both are accessible to readers with a minimum of background knowledge. The latter fic is tangentially related to futurism.
