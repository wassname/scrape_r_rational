## [RST][C][HF][DC] THE SWORD OF GOOD by Eliezer Yudkowsky: "The thought occurred to Hirou that if he'd actually KNOWN he was going to be transported into a magical universe & told to fight evil, he'd have spent less time reading fantasy novels. Joined the army, maybe. Taken fencing lessons, at least."

  That was a pretty fun read. It reminds me of that alt-LoTR story some Russian writer came up with years ago. I can't remember the title, unfortunately.

  e: Found it! It's *The Last Ringbearer* by Kirill Yeskov.

  Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. 

  IMO Hirou AND the Lord of Dark (and Dolf and anyone else, if willing) should've teamed up to fight for democracy. Hirou should not have killed or condoned the kills he has made but the kills he has made and other injustices in that world don't condone the creation of another despot (whether it's Hirou himself, Dolf or the lord of Dark), even if said despot at this point in time doesn't seem too bad. Refusing to stop the ritual would in no way make up for the deaths that happened, it would just be another evil on that pile.

  Or at the very minimum, Hirou should've halted the ritual until he was a good enough mage to understand what exactly it was doing. If this was the only time the ritual could've been done then IMO it's VERY not worth the risk of making a god to continue it and should've been stopped anyways.

    I wonder about the validity of that adage.

    Perhaps power continues to corrupt any mortal physical being that has needs and desires, but once you break through the limit to *absolute* power where all your possible needs could be met with no effort and you still have infinite capacity, you can actually be truly selfless
    ```

      You might be right but that's also exactly what the most evil person who ever existed can very well say to get you to let them torture everyone. 

      The risk is nowhere near worth it when there's any other possible way to achieve anything that is at least nearly effective and it seemed like there was. There was nothing in the story about the balance somehow actively fighting and overwhelmingly suppressing democracy.

      Further, even if there is magic in that universe that explicitly precludes power corrupting people, that still doesn't mean that a guy who is good at magic rituals is good at governing. He could just kill everyone via sheer ineptitude even if he legitimately tries to be good.

        Vhazhar touched the Sword of Good, so he's currently good. I don't think everyone is corruptible by power - I think it's possible to rule over the universe with absolute power safely, as long as one takes it step by step.

        About accidentally killing everyone - when he has absolute power, he can just choose for them to stay alive, and they will. Absolute power presumably means imposing your wishes on reality directly, rather than having to figure out how to apply that absolute power, otherwise, the Dark Lord would still be defeatable afterwards, even though they all seem to act like the spell was final.

    Citation needed.  We can see in our world people with absolute power, and they are indeed corrupted.  

    However, the causal relationship is not established.  It is true, you can in a lab reduce empathy in test subjects by giving them money. You can observe people in the world with money exibit a lack of empathy. So a trend is noted.

    However,  the factors causing that have not been established.  In our world anyone who can achive great wealth will have to be absolutely corrupted. The system selects for it.

    However we can see plenty of examples of people who gain power and use it justly.  They are just usually killed by the bad actors who want to maintain their position so the dataset is small.

    I think the kind of person who has a fully developed ethical and moral intelgence would be able to handle it well.  Further, even if they make a mistake, failing short of the mark would for sure make a better system than the one that grew by historical accident and primitive struggle.

      I prefer this quote, from Robert Caro's biography of Lyndon B Johnson:

      >But although the cliche says that power always corrupts, what is seldom said ... is that power always reveals. When a man is climbing, trying to persuade others to give him power, concealment is necessary. ... But as a man obtains more power, camouflage becomes less necessary.

      It's likely a mix of both, but it's certainly less absolute to give both statements.

      Objection - we do not.

      I do not know of any single person who has ever had the power to (say) turn off the Sun, which is still in itself far short of absolute power. At best, we have people who have the ability to command vast institutions of other people; powerful, but far from absolute.

          Well, insofar as we have seen, more power does seem to *generally* correlate to more corruption. However, it is only a bias, not a certainty. And we don't know if that bias is linear or follows some other curve, and we don't know if it cuts out at some power threshold greater than humans have ever reached.

            anything could be.   However power is like time.  We aren't talking about a cultivation manwha.  In the real world power isn't real. it is like time. It a concept we use to understand the relationship of sates.

            I could just pick up and eat an apple so I am more powerful than an apple.  Elon Musk could buy the company I work for and fire me. He also has enough money that he could probably murder me and get away with it. He is more powerful.  Both our powers are socially provisioned though.  If society just agreed not to take elon's money. then it would be all useless and he would be less powerful. In either case, power isn't real.  It is our way of describing the social distance between us, there is no intrinsic quality to which it relates. So there is no referent to which a third factor could correlate.

    Democracy works in the modern day, it would be absolutely impossible in a medieval level society where most of the population's probably illiterate.

      Then widespread literacy is part of the fight for democracy.
