  I just wanted to say, I completely understand your reaction. Luminosity was the first story I ever stopped reading because things got dark... And I've read a lot of dark things. I didn't swear off it or anything, I just decided to take a break to process what had happened. One day I'll do a writeup of how amazing that ending was, and why it punched so much harder for me than so many other stories.

  But for now I'll say that things don't ever get that bad again, and while it doesn't quite turn into a lighthearted romp, the ending of Radiance is... A bit too much in the opposite direction from the first, to be honest. Hard to explain without spoilers, but I can elaborate if you want. In any case, I think you'll be okay, and should enjoy it :)

    The biggest problem, really, is that they discuss their plan in detail, in advance, and then they carry it out, with barely a hitch. Not as climactic as it could be...

      That was one thing, but what bothered me really was [Radiance Spoilers](#s "the way they brought everyone back to life. It wasn't enough that they began ending death by making everyone a vampire, they had to actually bring back vampires that were already dead, sometimes by hundreds of years. IIRC, literally no one any of the characters cared about stayed dead.  And the mechanic for doing so was very unconvincing to me. People get blasted with the memories of thousands of people and go catatonic, but if you make them look like one you want to revive and they look in a mirror, they'll think they're just that one and "snap" back into themselves? Kind of silly, imo, and a bit too saccharine. It really took a lot of the weight away from the story, and was too far on the opposite side of the spectrum from the dark, but brilliantly done, ending to Luminosity")

  I think *Radiance* definitely is more light-hearted and enjoyable than the later portions of *Luminosity*. *Radiance* deals much more with interesting vampire powers than with werewolves and drama, IIRC. I've read *Radiance* at least twice, and *Luminosity* only about 1.5 times.

  I've read neither book in months (years?), though, so I may be misremembering.

  That's the low point of the two books for sure. It doesn't turn quickly, and there are further parts that are about as horrifying in different ways.(Chelsea is involved.)

  ```
  *Radiance* has a higher dark-to-light ratio than *Luminosity*.

  Alternative option: *Effulgence* is super happy and fun for the vast majority of the time (except when it's horrifying and the universe becomes positively hellish, but that's only <5% of time), and it always rebounds and ascends to higher fun levels.

  It can also totally be read without reading *Radiance*, which is what I did.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Is Effulgence actually good? Maybe it's just due to the super bizarre format but I couldn't really get into it. I only read the first couple of... posts? Chapters? So maybe I just didn't give it enough of a chance.
    ```

    - u/PM_ME_EXOTIC_FROGS:
      ```
      As Alicorn says, *Effulgence* is Earthfic and then it's suddenly really, really not. If you've gotten to wishcoins or Milliways and you're not entertained yet, deciding it's not your thing and moving on is totally fair (you can skim through most everything before wishcoins if it's boring you). Alternatively, you can try the Animorphs or Shell Bell arcs, which are both fun.

      If you want something a bit faster paced, [this](http://unprophesied-of-ages.dreamwidth.org/495.html?style=site) might be for you (crossover between *Mistborn* and Alicorn's Fairyland; one of Alicorn's most popular non-*Effulgence* glowfics).

      Be warned: like Fugu said, glowfic has some rather strange conventions. Ridiculous bullshit magic is a staple of the genre, although Magic A is essentially always Magic A. On the other hand, the ridiculous bullshit can often be totally *awesome*, though I wouldn't like to spoil why.

  The tooth kick isn't *that* hard. Maybe you need to increase the bone strength of your jaw. Do some weight bearing exercises. Take some calcium supplements.

  I mean look at me, my jaw is chiseled. When I want something lighthearted I pick up some WH40K and start rereading Elfen Lied. *I eat The Broadcast for breakfast*.

  Seriously though, different preferences for different people sure, but I feel that there's a lot of great culture you'll miss out on if you can't ever bring yourself to read the dark stuff.

  As for luminosity/radiance, there is sunlight (and sparkly vampires) at the end of the tunnel. But the ride there won't be a particularly happy one.

      Actually living in North Korea.

      Seriously though, stuff like Elfen Lied did make me cry the first time, but through a process similar to Borg Adaptation my feels gain total immunity after a couple hits from any given form of attack. Which is a shame, because I enjoy the feeling of Sorrow in the same way horror movie and haunted house fanatics enjoy Terror.

        How was *Worm*?
        ```

        - u/gabbalis:
          ```
          Taylor lives in a hopeless setting, yet just barely succeeds by the skin of her teeth again and again. It's tons of fun, but it just leads to mounting hope in the face of despair. Which... isn't a recipe for sorrow.

          If you write it in the reverse, and you write it well, then you have mounting despair in the face of hope. And that's a good recipe for sorrow. You know what? I think I have a perfect, succinct, well known example. The song Pompeii by Bastille perfectly contrasts hope and hopelessness in a way that consistently triggers the feeling for me. If you feel like spending 40 hours of your life playing through one of my favorite point and click adventure series instead, the Deponia series also has that sort of structure.

          I do appreciate Worm's Slaughterhouse 9. It's similar to Broadcast in that they both give a wholehearted try at fleshing out the concept of evil into the most debaucherously twisted form the author can manage. Masterfully blending psychological horror, body horror, classic fears of pain and death: In short, I appreciate them in an artistic sense. Like looking at the [painting of Saturn devouring his son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Devouring_His_Son).
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Yep. When I saw someone complain about Worm being grimdark after I read it, I had to mentally pause and think "Huh... I guess it is. But it never felt that way to me while reading it."

            Because of Taylor. Tell the story of Worm with anyone else as the main protagonist, and it's just oozing with despair and crapsack world. But Taylor was relentlessly focused and rational and pragmatic. Before long it became clear that she would never give up, never, no matter how stacked the odds. That she would always fight, and try to pull victory from the jaws of defeat. Even after failing to save everyone, she would give it her best, and sometimes succeed. And I believed in her. 

            And, for the most part, that kept the darkness at bay.

              Not to mention, she keeps gaining status and skill. The world may be rotting all around her, but she's getting bigger and bigger pieces of that rapidly-shrinking pie, so it can still feel like progress.
              ```

              - u/deccan2008:
                ```
                I think the contrast with the author's subsequent work Pact is especially stark. The world is just as crapsack but the protagonist sacrifices more and more and more of himself just to survive one more day.

    Just gonna say, *The Broadcast* was a tasty little dessert for me, but my left front tooth needed fixing after *Luminosity*.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Agreed, The Broadcast wasn't even remotely affecting, for me. As I [mentioned in that chapter's discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4pdzqr/unsong_interlude_%D7%99_the_broadcast/d4kfcrw), torturing billions of faceless, nameless people (even if you describe their faces, even if you tell me their names) for eternity is just statistics. 

      Now, making me care about a character first, knowing them for chapters and chapters, empathizing with them, THEN having them get tortured or mindraped or killed... that'll put a dent in my armor, sure enough. When /u/scottalexander sends someone we know and like to hell, that's when the gloves will really come off.

      But like /u/gabbalis said, different preferences for different people. Personally, I wouldn't even consider Warhammer 40k remotely "dark," for the aforementioned reason: it's too absurdly over the top and impersonal in its horror and cartoonish levels of gore. But the ending to Luminosity? That emanated Despair, with a capital D.

    To me, "toughen up and get used to gruesome stories. You're missing out on some great literature" is about as useful advice as "listen, if you can't just learn French so you can read Camus and Voltaire in the original language, you're missing out." like yes, you're technically right, but the reward just doesn't measure up to the task.

  I don't really agree that Radiance is less dark. For me that was the most psychologically scarring book, due to Chelseas horrific power being used a lot. To me thats way more disturbing than any physical harm.
  But sure, the ending is absurdly happy.
