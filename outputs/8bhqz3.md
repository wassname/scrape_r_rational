## Chiaroscuro discussion [RT][WIP]

### Post:

During hpmor EY  discovered that the creation of subreddit where to discuss ideas sped up the discovery of mysteries of the novel much faster then the single persons posting on FF.

So I want to discuss the mysteries of that fanfiction and bring forth issues that must be discussed.

For people unfamiliar with it, [Chiaroscuro](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11267384/1/Chiaroscuro) is a Naruto fanfcition with the best troll Kakashi I have ever seen.


**Issues**

* Black Zetsu. Was it created by a Nara ancestor? What happened to the Shikamary shadows during training? Did his father destroy them or did they escape? How did his shadow kill white Zetsus?

* Does Shika father know about Black Zetsu?

* What was the situation with Kakashi chakra? Isn't it time for it to come back?

* How old are the kids now?

* True mist ninja (AO) mentioned that one of his subordinates got killed during Kakashi teleportation. I don't remember that happening.

* Is Orochimaru dead?

* I wanna see Temari again. What character **you** hope to see?

* What the fuck is Itachi plan? Spy on Akatsuki?

  I think it's pretty obvious that there is an N+1 player on the field. Maybe even multiple. As I consider myself as intelligent as Naruto in this story, I find myself unable to even begin to discern what everyone's true goals are.

  Hell, Im having a hard time figuring on what's going on between Danzo, Shikaku, and the Third.

  What I really love about the story is how Mist got led to believe someyhing completely false, but came to it in a totally rational way. Often times I'll read a bunch of rationalistic fiction and  everyone in it come to true observations always. It's so nice to see someone come to a false conclusion, be able to trace how they got there, and be unable to argue against it.
