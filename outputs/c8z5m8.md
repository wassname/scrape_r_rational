## I Am Mother is an excellent movie about AI set post-apocalypse

### Post:

There isn't much I can say without spoiling it on some level, but I do think it fits this subreddit's interests.

  Does someone who thought Ex Machina was irritatingly dumb stand a chance of liking this movie?

  E: Holy shit, that vastly exceeded my expectations.

    The movie had nothing in common with ex machina i would say. It is not about the same themes or evokes the same feelings.  


    I would say there is a chance they would like it depending on what they thought was stupid about ex machina. But also i loved ex machina And i agree with taltosdreamer's comment. Soooooo .... I don't know?

    I wish i could spoil it because that is the only way i could answer that.

    Maybe.  If you haven't figured it out by half way i'll be surprised.  I'd bet you might be left with a big: but why question, but be satisfied that they did a certain level of AI inscrutability right.

      Thanks, this sounds promising at least.

    in my case, i disliked ex machina, and loved I am mother.

    Yes.

     I thought Ex Machina was horrible in pretty much every way, but I am Mother was excellent.

  Wow, huge discrepancy in the IMDB and Rottentomatoes scores (6.8 vs 91%). 

  I do tend to allign more with RT though, so the movie may be worth a go.
  ```

  - u/southpawgamer:
    ```
    It's worth mentioning that Rotten Tomatoes scoring is not based on review scores, but on the percentage of reviews that are positive or negative ("fresh" or "rotten"). So both of those things can be true; the film's average score may be 6.8/10, and 91% of critics gave it >5/10.
    ```

    - u/Quakespeare:
      ```
      Almost - scores over 6/10 are considered fresh :




      "Scores of over 60 percent are considered fresh, and scores of 59 percent and under are rotten. To earn the coveted “designated fresh” seal, a film needs at least 40 reviews, 75 percent of which are fresh, and five of which are from “top” critics."

  Spoilers talk.. All of it.

  >!It was fairly well done AI realism wise, granted it's only made clear at the last 10 minutes. This is my view on the ending and the implied intended ending that might seem irrational on the AI front.!<

  &#x200B;

  >!I assume the ashes and jaw bone scene is clear evidence that subject 1 is dead. The AI might have calculated that having babies raised by humans using it's methodology would increase the success rate, which leads to the plot we see.!<

  &#x200B;

  >!i.e Raise x subjects until 1 succeed, when successful subject is ready, prepare it to raise and take Mother AI android's place. Create a self propagating circle where humans raise themselves in a safe environment with a proper methodology to increase their ethical and moral capacity, as long as the results are positive. Adjust as needed. !<

  &#x200B;

  >!I can't explain the need for the drama though. Maybe that's the best way the AI found to explain what happened in the outside world, leading to the least predicted damage to the subjects psychology and facility based on the subject's personality profile? We see the girl technically failed a test, but passed on others, this might have been an elaborated last chance test or just the intended outcome the AI desired.!<

  &#x200B;

  >!We also see the women had access to food, so it wasn't a food run, so maybe the crazy lazy is actually subject 1 who failed her test and was set free. But her dialogue with the AI makes me believe otherwise.. !<

  &#x200B;

  >!Maybe someone who has a different interpretation or watched it multiple times could give their input.!<

  &#x200B;

  Definitely a good movie though, the one of the best scifi I've seen this year for sure.

    >!My thoughts: For one, note that we don't actually know for certain the AI's motives. The AI claims to want to maximize human utility, and that this is best accomplished by humans raising humans after being trained, but the AI has also been shown to lie without hesistation. It's possible that was all an extremely convuluted plot to maximize paperclips. Personally I think it's plausible the A.I. is just gathering data on how human development works, the human brain is very complex and opaque to study, it's plausible that even with all its computing power, gathering raw data about how humans raise humans can be more useful than exclusively trying to simulate human brains.!<

    >!The one piece of information that wasn't presented by an unreliably narrator I believe was the one moment text came up saying "Days since human extinction: ~13000 days(~40 years)". That does line up with the environment being severely damaged, but beginning to heal, and the woman being alive before the AI had complete control.!<

    >!Why exactly the woman went to the shelter I don't think is an important question, it seemed clear to me she was only kept alive to that point by the A.I. for that exact purpose, the A.I. manipulated her to the shelter through some method, the specifics aren't hugely important.!<

      >!We should also keep the plot in mind else discussion loses purpose. It could technically be the delusions of a crazy woman but this ends discussion and any engaging form of interpretation.

      >>!it seemed clear to me she was only kept alive to that point by the A.I. for that exact purpose!<

      >!The AI could be referring to being kept alive as to letting her live after it learned about her and she got into the facility. Not necessarily being kept alive all along. It matters because it determined whether the AI intended it as a test or if it was an accidental occurrence it let play off in a controlled manner because it determined an alternative that killed the girl and restarted the project was counterproductive to it's recolonization goal.!<

        >!The AI specifically said: "Did you ever wonder why you survived while no one else did. As if someone had a purpose for you. But not anymore." I think this sentence is very likely in a world where the AI is talking about not killing her along with the rest of humanity, and very unlikely in a world where the AI is talking about not killing her in the facility.!<

        >!The beauty of this film is that the AI is not holding the idiot ball. Every single experience Daughter has, has been designed to produce the result the AI wants. It has determined that to produce an optimal humanity, it needs to kill the old one. But it has also determined that a humanity that relies on Mother would not be optimal, and that in fact, an optimal humanity needs to hate it for the genocide. It may or may not have genuinely needed several tries to achieve this, but the evidence that it had killed siblings is definitely there specifically for Daughter to find it. It didn't even get rid of the bullets it lied about.!<

        Edit: This all makes sense in itself and is at the same time a metaphor for parents having to let go of their children. Or even better, not a metaphor, but a direct manifestation of the same underlying truth. Good scifi.

        But we don't know. Maybe it could do that. But maybe that would actually be far too expensive and this was actually the cheapest way to do it. Or maybe this was a simulation that to gather data. Maybe the AI's utility function has some weird value that can only be maximized by cyclically rotating between raising children to adulthood then psychologically torturing them.

        ​The A.I. had total control over at least that area of Earth, and the area was extremely inhospitable to human life even excluding the hostile A.I. Also keep in mind the mouse chewed through that wire a day before the woman arrived- I doubt that was a coincidence and not arranged by the A.I. How big of a coincidence the woman arriving and a mouse, from an inhospitable wasteland, arriving in such a short time of each other would be extreme. Also, the moment the A.I. got Daughter to raise humans by herself, the A.I. immeadiately set off to the woman's hiding place to execute her. And it's a super-powerful A.I., the idea that it could terraform Earth and has a small army of robot soldiers but couldn't hunt down one woman it had already detected and wounded seems downright silly.

        >It also tried to keep the girl away from the knowledge of the outside world without going full tyrant, it was overhaul pleasant and respectful to the girl despite everything it's lies seemed well intended seeing that the woman was in fact lying and living a horrible life..

        I interpreted it as all part of complex machinations. That the A.I. had been playing the long game and keeping the girl confused as to how benevolent and trustworthy the A.I. was was a key part of its plot to fulfill its utility function.

        >It offered to let the woman live with them, to take her in, to take care of her. The woman refused because of her trauma, paranoia and mental instability, only after she caused problems did the AI dispose of her.

        Again, I think the A.I. purposely manipulated the woman- it had been stalking her with same-model robots for years, always being a threat and danger where ever the woman went, perhaps even presenting a fake friendly-robot in the past to ensure the woman would never trust robots again.

  I liked it and it did surprise me in a couple spots...but it left kind of bewildered.  There wasn't a moral to the story, but it kept acting like it had one. >!Like it had all these scenes where morality had a big impact...but not?!< Idk. Definitely an out-there movie.

  - u/None:
    ```
    [I think the point of the morality scenes were to demonstrate the utilitarian logic that the AI was working under, that it was willing to kill many humans if it means creating a perfect peaceful new human race.](/spoiler)
