  I am much more likely to check out a work, even if its a regularly posted one, if I have a full title and not some cryptic abbreviation.

  Poor AI. 
  But this is a human reaction to lack of acceptance so maybe removing some humans out of your brain is a good idea. Would be a shame to miss an obvious situational problem and resolution because angst.

  Also poor Mei. Work hard all your life to get good brains and then someone copies and profits off it no questions asked.

  A very interesting take on an issue I'd never thought about! It somewhat reminds me of the conundrum people have with rape babies (those who feel that fetuses are legitimate humans anyway)

  On the one hand, it definitely sucks that your mind was cloned/you were penetrated without your consent.

  On the other hand, pushing the abort button on that new life sucks too!
