  >In the second scroll of Wen the Eternally Surprised a story is written concerning one day when the apprentice Clodpool, in a rebellious mood, approached Wen and spake thusly: "Master, what is the difference between a humanistic, monastic system of belief in which wisdom is sought by means of an apparently nonsensical system of questions and answers, and a lot of mystic gibberish made up on the spur of the moment?"

  >Wen considered this for some time, and at last said: "A fish!"

  >And Clodpool went away, satisfied.

  It's hard expressing actual knowledge in a short koan.

    Upon hearing this, Clodpool was no longer enlightened.

  ```
  A man once walked down the road, failing to meet with his destination. As he walked, getting increasingly lost, he came upon an old monk.

  "Is there a city around here?" asked the man. "I was following this map, but it seems to be increasingly inaccurate around here. In fact, I'm not even sure that the city exists! It's certainly not on this map."

  The monk said nothing. He simply took a pencil from his pocket and marked a point in the desert on the map with a star. "There is your city," he said. The man frowned, remembering that the city was supposed to be on the coast of a vast ocean. Thinking for a moment, then, the man became enlightened.

    How nice of the monk, to mark his destination on the map!
    ```

    - u/Newfur:
      ```
      His destination was not in the desert.
      ```

      - u/FeepingCreature:
        ```
        If the city was not in the desert, why would the monk mark it in the desert? That seems like a dick move, lying to some lost stranger.

            I feel like this is the true message of many zen koans.
