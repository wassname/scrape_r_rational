## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  There is very little remaining land in the world and most societies reside on large ocean fleets. The first ships themselves may have originally been built on land but it has to be possible to expand the fleet without having to be on land. What is the maximum level of technology this fleet can maintain & what would its social structures look like/is this possible?

  Some obvious things that come to mind:

  -  materials would have to consist mostly on things you can find in the shallower parts of the ocean floor & biological material (bones, fish leather,etc). Mining can be a pain depending on technology level 

  - power is a problem since in order to have electricity you need a conductor (which is hard to find) and have to extremely through with insulation (since there is so much water). Additionally coal/steam powered stuff need fire, which needs a source of fuel (possibly animal fat, but that is incredibly inefficient). Also having a fire on a ship is not generally a good idea if you have no easy way to rebuild. 

  - storms.  They can avoid most of them by sailing in calmer places that are less likely to have storms. I guess they can mitigate storm damage slightly by spreading the ships out so they have earlier warning & aren’t as likely to hit each other but I can’t think of a good solution to this.

  -food: fish

    If it's post-apocalyptic, it may be easier to recover metals from the ocean floor than it would be to mine anew.

    Hopefully you can find a way to grow trees on your ships. Unsure of the chemistry/biology here (acquiring and maintaining nutrient-rich soil sounds hard), but in addition to wood you're going to need pretty reliable and plentiful sealant to be able to manufacture boats. Rubber trees might be able to do this?

    An interesting social consequence is that it's a lot easier to sink a ship than it is to destroy a building. So terrorism/military strong-arming from violent factions is probably easier.

    Could you do anything interesting with plant-based rafts?

    I'd try to find some fast-growing woody shrub.  Grow a bunch of it, harvest the shrubs, and then lash them together.  If you're lucky, you might be able to build a self-sustaining "field" of the stuff that you could use to grow more woody plants.

    Repeat, and you might be able to make flexible, self-sustaining "islands".

    They'd be at risk during major storms, so you might not be able to use them for permanent habitation.  But they'd be a neat way to get extra living space for between storms, or just somewhere to walk around.

    >  What is the maximum level of technology this fleet can maintain

    *Maximum* level? Are we allowed to assume that they started with potentially possible technologies that we haven't worked out yet?

    Because things get a *lot* easier for the Ship People if they've mastered matter-to-energy and energy-to-matter conversion, doubly so if energy-to-matter allows you to duplicate objects in the manner of a Star Trek replicator.

    --------------

    Even without that, though, mining minerals from seawater is [quite possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine_mining) - including uranium, so using nuclear energy for power may be plausible. Mind you, it's not at all easy to do. The other option, given the possibility of submarines in the fleet, is of course [underwater mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_mining) for minerals. And a bit of googling suggests that rubber made from kelp is not only plausible but has been done (or at least claimed) before, so the ocean can provide insulators.

    For food, the people will have to eat fish and/or other seafood. A world-spanning ocean should be able to provide enough for a decent population; more once people figure out how to cultivate the ocean properly.

    Wood would be incredibly rare and valuable. Metal would be kind of expensive but replaceable and maintainable.

    The bigger your ocean society gets, the less land you'll have available. Every kilogram set afloat in the water will cause the water level to rise as if a liter of water had been added to the ocean. The mass of Manhattan has been estimated at around 100 million metric tons, which, if floated, would displace 100 million cubic meters of water. Of course, that's not much on the scale of Earth's oceans, only about enough to cause three ten-thousandths of a millimeter increase in the average ocean level. However, once we're talking about transforming the oceans into living space for an entire civilization, the issue of sea level rise could quickly become a problem.

    You have four possible options. 1) Construct dikes around dry land and shallows, 2) Build upon piles, 3) Disregard land, use floating infrastructure, or 4) Trap a lot of the water above sea-level to lower the sea level.

    Dikes are simple enough in concept. You just build them around your remaining land area to ignore a few meters of sea level rise. You can even extend these dikes out into the water and turn seabed into viable land. Obviously, the strength needs to be greater as you deal with greater pressures (deeper water), but at least in shallows you may achieve significant land gains at comparatively low cost. Note: You will need pumps to drain water, and you'll need to plan for water that flows under the dike and gradually rises up into your land from the soil beneath it. Power outages = floods. You will also need to gradually reinforce the dikes and build them up to accommodate gradual sea level rise. Storms should not be a problem if the dike is built properly.

    Option 2 is also fairly simple, but would need to be done in shallows to be cost-effective, so this is not an overlapping strategy with option 1. You sink rebar-reinforced concrete piles into the bedrock beneath the seafloor and then build heavy cities and structures upon the piles. You'll only displace the volume of the piles, not the weight of the structures you build upon them, so sea-level rise will be minimized. This is also not a flood risk during a power outage, and storms should not be a problem if the structures are made properly. Nearby [wave farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_farm) could simultaneously generate energy and reduce the force of waves against the structures.

    Option 3 is problematic. The more you build, the deeper the water gets, increasing the cost of accessing the seabed for resources. Flooding is a potential problem if your floating structures bump into each other and develop holes. Pumps will be needed to bilge out water on a regular basis, and prolonged loss of power will result in sunken ships. Storms could potentially flip the ships as well.

    Option 4 is essentially a form of terraforming. Essentially, it would involve building massive dikes in climate zones where precipitation exceeds evaporation and minimizing evaporation, e.g. with floating reflective ping pong balls. The surrounding ocean would gradually evaporate and get trapped in the dike, causing the sea level to drop. Let's say our goal is average precipitation (about 1 meter per year), and about half of that in evaporation. 

    On Earth, if we built a circular dike with an area of 90 million square kilometers (25% of the ocean's surface area) and made it 200 meters tall (2/3rds as tall as the tallest dam in the world), it would need to be about 5,360 kilometers in radius, or about 16,800 kilometers long, around twice as long as the Great Wall of China. A huge project, but maybe feasible with international cooperation and many decades of construction. Built in the ocean on Earth right now, it would likely take about 400 years to drop mean sea levels by ~67 meters (~218 ft.). This would increase the land surface area of the Earth by about 21 million square kilometers, a little more than twice the land area of the United States. It would also serve as an immensely powerful hydroelectric dam, likely producing an average of 6.7 terawatts over the course of a year, or about 37% of the world's average power consumption in 2013.

  Alright, so I wouldn't be surprised if this has been brought up here before but what would a rational Hell look like. Assuming it has a population equivalent if not (and most likely) larger to that of The Land of The Living (TLoTL) comprised entirely/mostly of suffering-maximizers, how would this work. 

  I keep trying to flesh out this idea but get hung up on trying to figure out the behavior of creatures that probably don't have primary or secondary drives remotely similar to humans. For example:

  - Do they need sustenance?

  - Can they procreate or derive pleasure from sex?

  - Are they social animals? Maybe an ability to empathize with their own kind? Would these creatures have any sort of innate sense of fairness like that which has been observed in primates?

  - If they're not social animals, would a unified inter-species goal be enough to get them to work together? Or would they just fight each other to improve their personal ability to induce suffering?

  - Can they feel die or feel pain at all for that matter? 

  - Basically, what would the demon version of Maslow's hierarchy look like?

  Which brings us to our next point, one interesting part about demons/devils seeking to maximize suffering I've seen discussed before is how they would go about it, but I'm more curious right now with why.

  - Is suffering something they feed off of for sustenance? 
  - Are they rewarded for causing suffering with some sort of pleasure, status, money? 
  - If they are rewarded with pleasure, is it a relatively fixed amount of pleasure, or does it scale such that more suffering equals more pleasure incentivizing them to play the long game for bigger payouts? If so, how does the brain recognize how much suffering has been caused and allocate pleasure accordingly (such that these creatures wouldn't find a way of tricking themselves)? Like how would their brains know that convincing a person to be a suicide bomber results in a specific amount of suffering based on not only every killed/hurt individual but the amount of suffering that ripples out to society through those individuals' interpersonal connections, contributions to society, etc?
  - Do they only seek to maximize the suffering of Homo sapiens, if so, why? 

  Next problem, civilization. Assuming the denizens of hell manage to form some sort of society what would it look like. So for this section of the thought experiment, I'm going to lay out some potential ideas for resources and rules that might exist in Hell. Let's imagine demons/devils can only influence TLoTL by projecting their minds into it and communicating with humans telepathically and certain areas/rings of Hell are easier to astral project from. Let's also assume that souls exist and if they talk a person out of their soul, that person will become the demon's/devil's personal slave in Hell once they die.  

  - What sort of monetary system might they have in place? (I was thinking they could manipulate people to set up a disaster and sell their plans to other demons so all they have to do is knock over the dominos, also slave trading.)

  - What do they do for entertainment?

  - Technology? 

  - Intellectual pursuits? (trying to figure out interdimensional travel to get to Earth)

  Bit of a brain dump here, probably missed a fair number of obvious questions that need answering, but I'm just curious what some of yall might come up with.

    Imagine infernals as feeling the opposite of empathy. This isn't *quite* sadism, and would take some emotional mapping to get the full thrust of, but ...

    * When they see someone in pain, they feel pleasure
    * When they see someone sad, they feel happy
    * When they see someone angry, they feel ... er, something. Love?

    So basically, seeing a person having good feelings makes them feel bad in various ways, and seeing someone have bad feelings makes them feel good.

    A natural consequence of this might be that they feel about The Land of the Living the same way that we might feel about Hell, or slavery, or the worst parts of the third world; it's a huge injustice that all right-thinking people know needs to be rectified, but that's not necessarily going to compel them to actually do anything about it. Demons and devils falling for the same scope sensitivity and time sensitivity as humans is, I think, interesting in its implications.
