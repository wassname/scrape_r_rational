  A while ago I showed my partner Mara the guidelines for [RT] and she said "that's just literary fiction". Then she thought about it for a few hundred days and revised that to "that's just *good* fiction".

  Then this happened. I'm told there might be more on the way.

    Excellent!  I like her style and will likely be following "Things That Keep Us Small" as well, assuming it goes somewhere.

    I also like the whole musical backdrop thing.  "The Ravens In the Library" is a cute song, and I like that there's this whole thread of music to every chapter, even if it's not usually my taste.  Well, except for Neros Dubstep Symphony, because BBC Philharmonic Orchestra.

    (Side note, I always hear [Keep Your Eyes Peeled](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7kzKfwwDFRc) in my head when reading CFMC)

      Thank you for reading! Knowing that somebody is interested in TTKUS will definitely inspire me to keep working on it. I can't promise to include music with every CFMC omake I write, though, since I'm one of those people who needs a sensory deprivation chamber to write in. *throws fireballs of jealousy at Soren_Tycho for his writing to music ability*

        Absolutely interested!  It's funny, I know you've tagged the thing as fantasy, but in a weird way, the first chapter recalls to mind "Radio Lab" or "This American Life", where they talk about how the reporter found the story initially; I see the same thing in your character, Emily as she stumbles onto the life of this philosopher.  Honestly, if it doesn't do anything supernatural (which I'm usually all about), I wouldn't be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you're taking this to crazy-town, don't let me stop you in any way.

        I look forward to reading more!

          This American Life? That may be the highest compliment I've ever received. Thank you! 

          If you're enjoying the beginning of Things That Keep Us Small, you'd probably love The End of Mr. Y by Scarlett Thomas if you haven't read it already. I'm pretty much writing this because I wish there were more books like that.

          Updates coming soon... Craziness...well...spoilers.

            Thanks for the rec!  I'm halfway through "American Gods" and then on to "The Handmaiden's Tale" (apparently it's required reading these days), but I'll queue it up.
