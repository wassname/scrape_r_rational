## Traditional novels with rationalist qualities?

### Post:

I'm sure this has been brought up before, but I couldn't find it.
 
Could you recommend any 'traditional' novels (or authors) that have the first four characteristics of rational fiction as described in the sidebar, but not necessarily the rest? 

As a good example, Brandon Sanderson does a very good job at this type of writing (Competent characters, consistent rules, realistic motivations, etc) but I've run out of books by him, and I'm having a hard time finding similar authors.

  The first name that came to mind for me was *Blindsight* by Peter Watts. Although on further reflection I can't really remember much about the characters' motivations or competency or even really the *plot*. 

  So I'm in an odd place where it's hard for me to say whether it really satisfies the characteristics of rational fiction, but something in my 'gut' is apparently pretty damn sure that it's the kind of book that an /r/rational reader might enjoy.

  I think mostly what sticks in my head from that novel is an interesting central idea about consciousness... being told through a space-exploration alien-encounter story, also with vampires.

    I'll second the recommendation of *Blindsight,* there's a lot of good problem-solving and character interaction to go with the philosophy of mind and heavy dose of sci-fi-horror.

    My recommendation would be Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosiverse novels. They definitely meet the first criteria. It's usually recommended to start with *The Warrior's Apprentice* since that's the first one that really includes the main character from this universe. And apparently Harry James Potter Evans Verres largely came from Yudkowsky wondering what would happen if Miles Vorkosigan (that main character) went to Hogwarts.

      I actually read the first book in the Vorkosiverse a while ago because someone mentioned it in relation to HPMOR, but it didn't grip me. Now I see I probably started in the wrong place, I'll definitely try The Warrior's Apprentice.

  Neal Stephenson is a good one to look into(I recommend Seveneves). Andy Weir of course (The Martian is a great movie, but the book is better). I think a lot of semi-hard sci-fi can fit into this trope. The Niven+Pournelle joint novels (Mote in God's Eye, etc), Peter F. Hamilton (Pandora's Star), Ben Bova (Mars), Frank Herbert,  maaaybe Asimov and Heinlein?

    Good point about hard sci-fi. I've read The Martian and Seveneves and loved them, I'll check out the others you mentioned.

        It's a good suggestion, but I have to admit I've begun it several times only to get bored in the beginning of the book and start reading something else. Does it pick up pace later in the book?

          Basically, yes. Within a few chapters everything has gone sideways.

    I found Seveneves really terible, every couple of chapters some new weirdness would throw me out of the story. I got the point where the girl was prophesizing that her decendants would be a seprate race because races only split the don't combine and just gave up.

    In a better book I would have been intrigued by a character saying something so strange, hoping that the author would do something interesting with it..but here I just didn't have the patiance or trust for that.

      I found fist two thirds pretty interesting, but the last third (after the 5000 years time skip) horrible. I describe it as Anthropology Porn (by analogy with Scenery Porn, etc.). The author takes us on a tour through his weird utopia where he contrived for (ethnicity equals culture equals thought) to be true (to the point that at one point there's talk that maybe individuals from one "race" wouldn't actually like to isolate themselves, but their ethnicity=culture compels them). With some selective Luddism and Cybernetics Eat Your Soul (quote: "every augmentation is an amputation") thrown in for good measure. And then after some very plot-demanded (our heroes get sidetracked on their tour but happen to arrive exactly where they headed, and then some) grand revelations it just ends.

  The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson is pretty great and from what I remember it meets the criteria. It gets *really* into speculative politics after the first book, which may or may not appeal to you - there's a lot of time spent later in the series with the characters trying to figure out what type of government Mars should use.

  In the Sequences Yudkowsky mentions Orwells books, especially 1984, as rationalist 'must reads'. Orwell apparently had a fine understanding of biased and shady thinking and nicely weaved that into the dystopian story. 

  "If you really want an artist's perspective on rationality, then read Orwell; he is mandatory reading for rationalists"

  *Rokka no Yuusha* is a Japanese light novel series that's very rational, with largely solvable fair play mysteries. 

  Brian McClellan was one of Brandon Sanderson's students, and I've heard good things about his *Powder Mage* books, but I haven't gotten into them myself yet. 

  Will Wight's *Unsouled* is generally pretty rational, with a cunning character that demonstrates a lot of lateral thinking.

  My own *War of Broken Mirrors* books are rationalish hard fantasy, with a pretty similar style to Sanderson's. My characters actually do more active exploration of the magic system and optimization than Sanderson's do, but the pace is somewhat slower, especially at the beginning of the first book, [Forging Divinity](http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-War-Broken-Mirrors/dp/1505886554). There's a lot more of what I think /r/rational enjoys reading in the second book (a lot of tests with multiple possible solutions and magic optimization), and my third book will have even more of that.

    I've heard Powder Mage mentioned several times, I'll give that a try, and put the rest on the to-read list. Thanks!

    I'm reading a lot of mixed reviews for Unsouled, does anyone have an opinion on it overall?
    ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      I'm curious - where are you seeing mixed reviews? It has a phenomenally good average on both amazon and goodreads. 

      I personally enjoyed it a lot, but you should be aware that there are some twists that could easily frustrate a reader if you don't enjoy them. I could go into detail, but it would require some fairly significant spoilers.
      ```

      - u/whywhisperwhy:
        ```
        Goodreads, actually, on mobile. It has an overall high score but some good reviews made it seem questionable.
        ```

        - u/Salaris:
          ```
          Gotcha. I always assume that there's going to be a % of readers that won't like virtually any book out there. 

          I suspect *some* of the people that disliked Unsouled probably just don't enjoy some of the tropes that come with the genre (it's a very heavily Xianxia inspired book). 

          There are a few things in Unsouled that I had a pretty strongly negative reaction to myself, though, and maybe those were deal breakers for other readers. I connected with the protagonist enough to keep reading even if I didn't enjoy some of the other story elements.

          Edit: Also, just so it's clear, I'm talking about Will Wight's Unsouled, not Neal Shusterman's UnSouled.
          ```

          - u/whywhisperwhy:
            ```
            I ended up reading it, and really enjoying it. Also, nearly in time for [the second book to come out](http://www.willwight.com/a-blog-of-dubious-intent), apparently.

            Like you said, there were a few things I had a problem with, but ultimately a pretty respectable story and the first Xianxia book I've been able to read more than a chapter from. Thanks for recommending it.
            ```

            - u/Salaris:
              ```
              Glad you enjoyed it! I'll bet the second book will be even better - he's got a lot of room to work with now that he's shown the basics of the magic system and the setting.

    I'm just over halfway through your first book, it's definitely picking up. I had trouble staying motivated to read chapters 1-3, but read 7-11 all in one go. I think it's related to the heavy exposition early on, and it's easier to dump it when at least one viewpoint character is a newbie, rather than having a full cast of intelligent, experienced badasses. It was so worth it though.
    ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      Yeah, I completely agree with your assessment. In future series, I plan to have someone who isn't already an experienced character to help the audience learn along with the characters more smoothly.

      I'm glad you're enjoying it more now - I think most people tend to like it after around chapter 7 or 8, but I understand that the beginning is too slow for some readers.

  Ken Follett's novels are pretty good on that regard.
