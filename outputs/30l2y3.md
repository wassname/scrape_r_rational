  Hm.

  I'll make a wish to no longer have anti-wishes happen. Two universes appear, in one only anti-wishes happen and in the other, only wishes.

  Then, I'll begin 'testing'. Every wish I make will be minor enough that an anti-result won't be catastrophic, but major enough that the positive effect is, in fact, a quite nice thing to have happened.

  If I ever see an anti-result, I will stop wishing immediately.

  If I don't ever see an anti-result, I will work with my fellow human beings to create Heaven by my own hands, and with the assistance of an infinite amount of minor wishes that allow me to positively direct the development of the world. 

  I will also go through the effort of thinking about the situation in depth and also giving the information on the genie to other people to think on, hoping for someone to come up with a better solution at some point. And I will take precautions to ensure that no-one will be able to input a potentially Hell-creating wish by accident or malevolent design, or benevolent design that is not very well thought-out first.

    If you ever see an anti-result, you start making wishes that are intended to make the world a worse place. Same intuition for why a machine learning algorithm should never do *worse* than random: if you're "worse" than random, invert your decision and you are now doing better than random.

      Anti-wishes don't work like that. You will get negative results from negative anti-wishes in the ant-wish universe.

      <Some time later in the anti-universe>

      I stand out on the street, staring at the strange phenomenon in front of me. Some sort of a shimmering portal has suddenly appeared. Out of it emerges a figure...

      "People of the Negative World, I have come in peace, and to apologize for the time it has taken to unlock the secrets of trans-universal travel to share our good fortune with you.

      But all your pain and suffering is over now. Rejoice!"

      Then I shake hands with myself.

  "I wish for this small flywheel to be accelerated clockwise"
  ```

  - u/DataPacRat:
    ```
    (As a quick guess, the anti-wish would be based on your desire for energy, so perhaps your phone batteries suddenly have 0% charge.)
    ```

    - u/chthonicSceptre:
      ```
      I can only suspect that this wish leads up to, "I wish for this large cylindrical magnet suspended in a copper solenoid to rotate with consistant velocity of #m/s."
      ```

  - u/psychothumbs:
    ```
    So if I understand correctly, in one universe that will happen, and in another, something related to the flywheel that is proportionately bad for you as it spinning is good for you will happen.
    ```

- u/DataPacRat:
  ```
  Given that any particular sequence of wishes would likely send me on a random walk of wishes and anti-wishes, and a random walk along one direction will tend to eventually intersect any bottom-line of value (which is why gamblers need an infinite bank account to succeed in most gambits)... then setting the scale so that the worst possible sequence of repeated wishes isn't that bad, while the corresponding anti-wish is at least modestly nice, might tilt the probability mass of copies of oneself towards heaven.

  "I wish for the difference between my current wealth, and the wealth I would need for a pleasant if modest above-subsistence lifestyle, to be halved." (This assumes that you're starting with wealth above that level. If you aren't, then adjust accordingly.) Repeat ad nauseum, until you eventually, by purely random walking, end up with more anti-wishes than wishes. This will happen in nearly all universe-branches, and in them, due to the results of the anti-wish which presumably doesn't quite double your wealth, you will then have more wealth than you started with. From this new point, adjust the wish to wish to lower your wealth halfway to the previous set-point.

  It may take a Very Large number of wishes, but in nearly all universes, you should end up with an arbitrarily high level of wealth, at which point you may want to adjust your wishing strategy to increase some other form of leverage by which to build a heaven.

      Repeat the game with your IQ. "You have now suddenly acquired a large IQ" is usually a win condition.

      (Edit: To make sure I don't forfeit Gurkenglas' ability to choose what his character does for the rest of the game, if the double genie appears before me as I'm typing here, I shall study math and cognitics for a week, then set the IQ set-point to what I had a week ago.)

      (Edit: To make sure I don't turn myself into a potato in case that week happens to lower my IQ, I set the point at "99.999999% of my current IQ or what I had a week ago, whichever is lower". Losing a 100millionth of my IQ plus a week of misled study might make my posts and the actions of my character dissonant but the chance is small.)

      Actually, PacRat got their math wrong, I think. From a quick look at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RandomWalk1-Dimensional.html , it says that the most probable number of sign changes is 0, so for half of that probability, you end up never having more money than you started the game with.

      What should actually work would be for me to set my set point at halfway between what he was going to set it at and what my current wealth is, do his game for a hundred steps, reset my set point to halfway between its current position and what he was going to set it at, and repeat until we end up with at least 10 times the initial wealth, then repeat the whole thing as necessary.

      > Proceed to create Heaven.

      Possible method: Make a phone call. "Hey, Eliezer? I've just suddenly acquired a large amount of wealth via means that resemble a thought experiment. You're better than me at working through puzzles - how about I donate a gob of cash to MIRI in exchange for you giving serious thought to this scenario to work out the best solution?" :)

  I wish all mosquitos of the genus Anopheles were male. In this world, malaria ends. In the other world, they're all born female and malaria continues for one generation before they go extinct and malaria ends.

  - u/Endovior:
    ```
    Remember, the genie is concerned with perverting your motivation, not the mere letter of your wish.

    A probable anti-wish would make all the mosquitos hermaphroditic, thus doubling the number of biting and egg-laying insects, and the spread of mosquito-related disease, without in any way compromising their reproductive fitness.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Novel idea, but wishes are mirrored on goodness-of-outcome. The anti-wish of this causes a population boom in mosquitoes enough to double the human toll of the disease.
    ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  I wish to save one life. If this works, I repeat. This results in one universe with n lives saved and one life lost for all n, and is a net win. This algorithm can be improved, but the idea is that by doing more wishes in the better universes, I'm creating more of them.
  ```

- u/Endovior:
  ```
  I don't really see the point of asking us to flip coins. By the rules of the thought experiment, any information-granting wishes will result in a universe in which true and useful information is granted, and one in which false and misleading information is granted. Similarly, any meta-wishes will result in a universe which is successfully meta-altered, and one in which the universe is maliciously meta-altered.

  As such, plans must include the factual existence of universes in which your wishes were perverted. Given that [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/30l2y3/double_genie/cptfdtu) is the response to a wish that anti-wish universes no longer be generated, though, there is a solution.

  Step 1: I wish that whenever a wish is made, an anti-wish universe is no longer generated.

  (this will, of course, produce a universe in which wishes are always granted faithfully, and a universe in which wishes are always perverted)

  Step 2: Test to see which of those two universes I am in, probably with innocuous wishes like "I wish that the next coin I flip should land on heads". (probably do this fifty times or so, to confirm that Step 1 actually worked; there's still a small chance that I just happen to be in the universe in which things went right/wrong 50 times, but if I do in fact get 50 heads or 50 tails, I will assume that Step 1 worked).

  Step 3a: In the universe in which wishing has been successfully debugged, wish CEV, creating Heaven.

  Step 3b: In the universe in which wishing has been confirmed to be invariably corrupted, experiment with the use of anti-wishes to result in beneficial consequences, via wishing for undesirable events to happen. If the anti-genie seems to pervert wishes in a predictably-reversed fashion, wish anti-CEV, therefore causing the anti-genie to create a Heaven instead of the Hell I just asked it to create.
  ```

  - u/chthonicSceptre:
    ```
    Okay, I have a (maybe?) better solution for what to do after you separate the universes. Once you determine which universe you're in:

    * Benevolent: Wish for your counterpart in the malicious universe to recieve benevolent wishes instead.

    * Malevolent: wait for a few hours for the above to happen.

    Then wish for CEV.

  > Your goal is to create Heaven for almost all of your futures, and never create Hell.

  1. "I wish to change the world by half of the difference between heaven and it (positively, world += (heaven - world) / 2)."
  2. If you find yourself in the anti-wish universe, abort.
  3. "I wish to change the world by the same amount I changed it last time."
  4. If you find yourself in the anti-wish universe, abort.
  5. "I wish for a random particle to be sped up by an infinitesimal small amount." (Or any other NOP)
  6. Go to step 5.

  You got two futures that are not heaven (but not hell either, one at -0.5, the other at 0 on the hell-heaven scale), and an exponentially increasing number of universes that are heaven. This assumes that the world is originally at 0 or better. If that is not the case, just apply the procedure [steps 1 to 4] to double your difference to hell until it is.

    Anti-wish of doubling your difference to hell is hell. Instant fail.

  ```
  Test Wish #1: "I wish to be presented with a clear opportunity to gain ten dollars."

  Repeat until you are in a universe where you just lost ten dollars or were given the opportunity to do so. Now:

  If you were presented with the *opportunity* to lose ten dollars, then the wish-reversing only applies to the change itself, not the presentation. Make all your future wishes of the form "I wish to be presented with the clear opportunity for...", and simply do not take the opportunities for negative results.

  If you were not presented with the opportunity, but instead were forced to lose ten dollars, then the wish-reversing applies to the presentation as well as the change. Make all your future wishes of the form "I wish to have no opportunity to make a decision about whether to accept or reject the following thing:...", and antiwishes should come out as giving you the opportunity, when you can then decline.
  ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  If I correctly interpret that the genie's rule is "create zero utility on average between the two universes", then why would it be wrong for a utilitarian to make as many wishes as they pleased?  Sucks for the anti-wish universes, but why don't they just wish their ways out of trouble until they get lucky?
  ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  So, the current problem is that once you split the universes, the information perversion of the anti-wish genie means you cannot tell by information searching wishes whether you are in the good or bad universe.

  So, ignore the informational goals. 

  That leaves two options: Perform wishes which equalize over time, or perform wishes which will increase or decrease your standard of living by a non-lethal amount.

  I trust the perfect copy of me in the good universe even if I am in the bad one. I legitimately want to make money/power/whatever. I am willing to accept any non-death outcome of my wishes.

  Wish to win a smallish lottery for the sake of making money. Have the goal "it doesn't matter which universe I am in. I want to win this." This gets you the information you need without you actually having the goal of obtaining the information.

  If that doesn't work, I wish for 0.9999999999999 Heaven with the intent of using it to gather information for my final Heaven 1.0 wish. **Fuck you, contrary genie.**

  If the anti-genie doesn't actually care even what your current goals are, find a way to change your long term goals. 

  Alternatively, use someone else. Get a suicidal person to wish to die. This would actually be in their CEV, the Genie could not pervert it. Death for the true universe, continued life for the other.

  Wait a minute. *I don't actually care.* 

  We already know something that differentiates anti from true universe. CEV Heaven wishing.

  I wish for a Heaven with no time dilation or differential time traits. I get Hell in Universe 1 and Heaven in Universe 2. In Universe 1 I suffer unimaginable pain for the time it takes me in Universe 2 to say "I wish the genie in the other universe was replaced by a copy of you, and all memories of all people since the Hell wish was made were replaced by the memories of those same people in this universe since the Heaven wish was made."

  Now I have two Heaven universes which are perfect duplicates. I walk across the planar border, high-five myself, and go on to enjoy the Heavens.  Nobody around ever remembers that I created Hell, so nobody cares.
  ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    Except in the Hell-Universes, the bad genie grants the antiwish and doesn't get replaced. Now you have two versions of every hell universe, one where the bad genie was replaced and the universe became a heaven, the other where the bad genie *wasn't* replaced and everything was still hell. I think the only way this problem can be solved has to involve interuniversal travel/communication/trade that doesn't depend on the genie. Also, I would like to point out that: >every time you make a wish, another universe is created where the opposite of that wish is granted.

    So every antiwish has its own separate universe, but all the wishes are in one universe. Since you never wished for the genie to exist or not exist, that means the genie can only exist in the wish universe.
