## [RT][RST][BST] Psychonauts and dimension-hopping!

### Post:

**Background**

So, in my younger days, I tried a few different hallucinogenic and psychedelic substances.

High-potency Salvia Divinorum extracts, in particular, were very accessible in that the "real world" falls completely out of mind and things can be very different for a time, but the nature of the drug is such that a return to normalcy occurs within 5-30 minutes with even the highest doses.

**Idea**

I'm considering a rational treatment of the experience: what if a drug (or other mechanism) were discovered which moves the consciousness (or physical body) of a person to an alternate reality?

Outside of fiction, a drug-induced "alternate reality" is just a corruption of cognitive processes. Consequently, it's highly variable between individuals and often between sessions because it's entirely dependent on the internal state of the drugged individual. I propose a setting in which the "alternate reality" is consistent between individuals and from session to session: in other words, the experience is of an actual reality that exists apart from subjective experience.

I don't propose that the characters lick some stamps and are whisked away to a fantasyland with elves and giant purple mushrooms. Both the mechanism and the destination should be novel, so both reader and characters have something to discover:

* Mechanism: ideas include strange EM resonance modes from a basement EMDrive/Alcubierre drive test setup, eyedrops with quantum-entangled water, Wim Hof-style meditation/ice-bath session, or Martian algae that are recovered, grown in vats, and sold as health food but has entirely different effects when dried and smoked out of a pipe.

* Destination: the destination first appears as fields of colors and unfamiliar sensations. Just as a newborn has to learn to make sense of sights and sounds to figure out causality, gravity, what is hard or soft and so on, the psychonauts have to figure out the rules governing the new world. It should be as alien as possible, with a different number of dimensions, physics that make internal sense but are very different from the familiar Newtonian system, and the same richness and variety as we have here on Earth but completely unfamiliar in every way.

Over time, by visiting repeatedly, taking and comparing notes, and doing the needed research, the characters should become more and more comfortable in the other universe, able to reason according to its strange logics, maneuver its geometries, and manipulate whatever entities are there. 

* Conflict: I'm considering a few options

1. Longer stints in psychospace give ample opportunities for psychonauts from other universes to enter the "empty vessel" left behind: i.e. possession by a (most likely confused and disoriented) alien entity.

2. The psychonauts become less adept at reasoning and functioning in their home universe.

3. The psychonauts disagree on whether they "return" to the same universe after an expedition, or whether they may be "returning" to other universes and were originally from somewhere else entirely.

**Thoughts?**

  Reminds me of a long-held curiosity (of the sort that could never be ethically tested) about how an infant brain would develop if you put them in a simulated environment with wildly different physics than the norm - just how much of the standard set of assumptions is "hard wired" and how much is learned by experience?

  Given a VR feed with 4 spatial dimensions, or a hyperbolic space, or noticeable relativistic effects, is the brain plastic enough to learn how to operate in that space like a true native?

  Also, separately, I felt a twinge of disappointment that this wasn't about an idea for Rational [Psychonauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonauts)

    I think the amount of things that are "hard wired" are fewer than most people realize. Gravity, causality, object persistence, and so on appear to me as a parent to have been wholly strange to a newborn infant because I observed him learning these concepts over time. Cognitive feats like recognizing vertical lines in the visual field are also learned, as demonstrated by an experience using cats.

    What is "hard-wired" is the potential to learn from experience and to create abstractions. If a weird alternate reality does not lend itself to abstraction for some reason (perhaps it's purely noise, but of a kind that due to Lovecraftian whimsy simply cannot be characterized in any way), then I think a baby would be unable to function... but then again, so would an adult. 

    Of course, there are other aspects of "hard-wiring" - some brain structures lend themselves to facial recognition, vocalization, and so on, which means that human babies are simply very good at acquiring those skills. I think if we put a baby in a hyperdimensional simulator, it could learn to operate in space like a true native, but like a mentally handicapped native (i.e. slow to learn).

    I've never played Psychonauts but I did wonder if anybody would associate my post with the game. Would Rational Psychonauts be interesting?

      The game Psychonauts is of the "Kid saves the world for no reason and adults are incompetent for no reason" formula. Making the adults competent/rational and still having kids with no experience have a reason to be centerpieces of the plot is ... difficult. HPMOR took similarly problematic source material and worked with it, but still - a lot of the Psychonauts plot makes very little sense. Admittedly, most of the people involved had very obvious psychological problems... 

      I really liked the game's aesthetics, it's general ideas, and it's setting. However, the actual implementation stunk - the platforming was sort of garbage, collecting a billion collectables was made extremely unfun, and the actual plot was sort of cliche and also silly. Also, Psychonauts isn't the sort of thing that necessarily calls out for fanfiction - the actual plot was resolved fairly well and the game felt pretty satisfactory, and there is less of a feeling of potential greatness missed that seems to motivate so much fanfiction.

      If I was making some sort of Psychonauts fanfic, a good start might be to make Raz, the kid who just came to camp this day with no real experience and who in canon solves all problems and fixes everything by himself... less of a mary sue, and involve more of the other characters as active agents. There's a huge cast of colorful characters in psychonauts, and almost none of them really do anything important in the plot.

  You might like JAGS wonderland
  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/JAGSWonderland
  http://mchacon8.wix.com/jagsrpg#!books/cngp

  It's a free tabletop roleplaying game where the characters are afflicted with a paranormal disease that causes them to periodically disappear into wonderland, swapping places with their insane duplicate on a lower level of reality.

  ```
  There's been a number of SF novels and short stories where this kind of things happen, chemically, geometrically, and so on. Rudy Rucker visits this in a number of his works starting with _White Light_, and then in _The Indian Rope trick Explained_ he describes something like this from the point of view of someone outside the experience.

  I like #3. Even better if it's true. Also, I've got a horror story idea in the same neighborhood as this (more about the drugs than the dimension-hopping), so I'd be open to bouncing ideas back and forth if you're interested.
