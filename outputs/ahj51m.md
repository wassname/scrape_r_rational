## Apart from the Luminosity series, what other rational/hyperrational Count Dracula stories are there?

### Post:

Manipulation, suggestions, mind control, immortality, expansive knowledge capacity, superstrength, and the ability to create vampires. These leave a lot of room for a HpMor-like scenario. Has this landscape been explored in sufficience?

    Love Blindsight. It's hard to call it a vampire story, when just one of the main cast is a vampire. The others have similar superhuman augmentations that are also interesting.

    Just read Contratto for the first time, and was a bit disappointed in the main character's irrationality at times. I appreciated that it used rational world building to answer the question "what would a secret society of vampires look like today". However, the main character doesn't use rationality to answer questions about the world around her, or to act reasonablyvon the information she's given. The story could turn out very differently if she'd tested any of their assertions and found them to be false.

      Out of curiosity, what assertions could she have safely tested?

    Contratto is great >!but as it turns out, it's not actually about vampirism at all !<

      What..?  After seeing your comment, I read through the whole thing while waiting for the twist.  I'm now significantly confused.

        So the critical sentence for me was 

        >!"She mocked up posters with vampires on them, proud and pale, square jaws and sterling blue eyes."!<

        >!which I couldn't help but read as a pretty obvious allusion to Nazi propaganda. With that in mind, the rest retroactively reads like allegory.!<

  I would say that the Vampire the Requiem rpg seems like a reasonably rational setting. The Ordo Dracul is one particular faction whose ethos and ambitions seems like a very good fit for the brand of rationality represented by this site.

    As a huge vampire the * setting fan, it’s totally irrational.

    Vampires have no reason to form a society, no particular reason to backstab literally everyone even when it’s not in their best interest, no reason to hide from humans, no reason not to commit diablerie constantly, no reason not to go vinculum/ghoul crazy, other than “because the writers said there are more powerful vampires than you who don’t accept these things.”

    Further, anyone with enough Dominate to rewrite memories has no reason not to just mentally subjugate everyone, including giving incontrovertible past memories of having tried to rebel in the past and failing due to the vampire in question being infallible and omnipotent or some shit.  You can rewrite people’s lives so they literally have constant evidence their whole lives of you being god.  Except it hasn’t happened because the writers didn’t think of it and it would make a less ~~interesting~~ accessible backdrop for an rpg.

    These people are supposed to be monsters.

    I love vampire, but it doesn’t make any sense.
    ```

    - u/CaseyAshford:
      ```
      I agree with you regarding the overpowered nature of Dominate but I am not sure what you are talking about regarding the points in your first paragraph. While the exact mechanics of Humanity are a bit crude, I thought that the flavor text did a decent job of showing why Vampire society has developed the way that it did and why the depicted vampires behave in such seemingly irrational ways

      To briefly address each point:

      1) Vampires are incentivized to form a society as a vampire that does not find some kind of meaning to their lives other than feeding will degenerate into a Draugr / Lose all Humanity and go crazy. The Covenants create a structure that allows Vampires to function as more than beasts continually looking for their next meal. Like all organizations they also act to perpetuate themselves once they have achieved sufficient size and power. A key part of this seeking out new vampires and pressuring them to join a faction.

      I think that Damnation City is one book that does a particularly great job of exploring the forms of vampire society. It shows some of the practical structures that are devised to manage the distribution of feeding grounds and allow for the existence of something more than a state of constant conflict. I thought that the analogy to gang competition and control of territory was very clever.

      2) The endless machinations that comprise vampire society in Vampire the Requiem is very intensive, but it really isn't that much different from the real world. My perspective is that it was well within the suspension of disbelief particularly given the corrupting nature of the Vampire powers and the manner in which Vampires were acclimated to manipulating people by the need to feed themselves.

      3) I am not sure what you mean by this. I would think that the reason why beings that prey on Humanity in the night but are extremely vulnerable during the day would place a very high priority on secrecy would be self-evident. The Vampires in Vampire the Requiem are stronger than the average human but they are not so overwhelming that they cannot be destroyed with relative ease by opponents with knowledge and preparation, superior numbers, or simple luck. The desire to avoid being hunted down and killed seems like a sensible reason for a vampire to hid their true nature and do everything in their power to make sure that their peers do the same.

      4) The mechanical punishment for Diablerie of Humanity loss may seem minor compared to the significant rewards but the flavor text does a great job of showing how Diablerie can easily lead to insanity.

      5) Using the Vinculum doesn't create a perfectly obedient slave. It instills obsessive devotion and gives the vampire a significant advantage in social combat. There are a lot of ways that the Vinculum could backfire and create a dangerous opponent. Going "vinculum/ghoul crazy" seems like it would create an unmanageable mess that would require intense management and would be at a continual risk of blowing up.

      The Chicago Fiction where Solomon Reed turns against Maxwell and the two ghoul setting books do a great job of showing that the relationship imposed by the vinculum can easily end up taking distorted forms that end up turning the victim of the vinculum against the creator of the vinculum.

        I mean at least a few of these feel like writing the Kessel Run to involve a black hole so Han Solo's stupid "parsec" boast makes sense in retrospect.

        But you're definitely more familiar with the lore than I am.

        I just genuinely believe that if there wasn't a storyteller contriving obstacles, I could break and completely restructure vampire society in my favor if I became a vampire and had a copy of v20 or blood and smoke (whichever was relevant) to reference.

        The fact that this feels, if not trivial, at least accessible - maybe not 100% guaranteed but with a non-negligible chance of working - and yet no vampire has ever done it by the time you start play, is what I have to suspend my disbelief about.
        ```

        - u/CaseyAshford:
          ```
          I must admit that I am a really big fan of Vampire the Requeim and that is shaping my argument. A certain degree of suspension of disbelief is needed for any piece of fiction but I am willing to go a bit further for this rpg simply because I really like the setting.

          I would actually be really interested in hearing how you would "Completely restructure vampire society". I can't really think of any easily exploitable flaws that would allow an otherwise normal starting vampire to achieve such absolute dominance. It seems like your ideas could be the seed for an interesting story.
          ```

            It depends heavily on what clan I'm embraced into.  If I'm a gangrel I have to start the speed run over, for instance.

            I came up with my plan for ventrue a long time ago, and forget the details, and am kind of drunk so now's not the best time, but I can tell you that one involved using dominate to create dominate machines who dominate others, recursively.  You've already acknowledged dominate is busted so maybe that's cheating.

            Also I haven't read what you're talking about regarding vinculum backfiring, so some of my plans that rely on that might not work I guess.

            Humanity is the main thing stopping you from creating a diablerie farm with the help/subjugation of a high bp vampire I guess.

            If all else fails you can firebomb elysium during a mandatory city-wide meeting, lay low when the international community comes and checks it out, and then be the only vampire in the city living fat once things calm down.

            If you can't do that, ghoul and vinculum the chief of police or the head of the local branch of a three letter agency and initiate a raid on the current leadership of the city.  If the masquerade is so important and humans are such a threat, this should work.

            I don't know, not all of them are the best ideas, but some of them would at least have been tried and would change the shape of vampire society in the area from what we're told it is.

            And I feel like I could come up with better when I'm sober.  Auspex is really strong.  Nightmare can probably be broken.

            Edit: My main point isn't that a young vampire should always be able to upset vampire society, it's that old, powerful vampires who aren't holding the idiot ball would have used the tools available to them to structure vampire society such that new vampires aren't a threat.  There would be no upward mobility, and the game wouldn't be fun.  You'd be embraced and immediately mind fucked into compliance, kind of like how all Tremere are all vinculumed to the Tremere leadership in v20, but more oppressive.

            And if they didn't, vampire society would already be upset.

            The fact that the only thing keeping a new vampire from blowing the whole masquerade wide open in a misguided form of self-sacrifice upon learning he is damned is a fear of reprisal, which has never stopped a single ideologue in the history of ever, combined with the number of vampires that have been embraced, makes the idea that the masquerade still exists a huge plot hole IMO.

              At least, there should be signs of massive previous failures. Ruins of attempts at empire. So if anything, it's _too_ rational. (Note: haven't read VtM, please disregard if there are.)

                The books kind of stress long-standing institutions and traditions.

  I think the first rational Dracula was Fred Saberhagen's [_Dracula Tape_](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDraculaTape) (1975) and its sequels. I would say it and Chelsea Quin Yarbro's _Hotel Transylvania_ (1978) a few years later really created the whole "good vampire"/"vampire protagonist" genre.

  [how to succeed in evil](https://www.goodreads.com/series/83726-how-to-succeed-in-evil) series has a 'consultation with a vampire' novel. the evil efficiency expert talks to non-rational vampires, advising them on how to do it RIGHT.

  [Sunset](https://www.amazon.com/Sunset-Book-Nightlord-Garon-Whited-ebook/dp/B00NMMPRU6) is an interesting one.

  It's about a guy who gets turned into a vampire and then tossed into another world with magic set in a medival era where he spends time wandering around as a hero before sorta accidentally-on-purpose becoming the king of a newly found kingdom.

  Despite the cliche summary, he acts very much like someone from this community where he spends time investigating his powers as a vampire and as a wizard (plus the magic to cross alternate worlds), puts serious thought into the ethics of a modern person as a king in a dark ages society, and has genuine relationships with one woman at a time instead of the standard harem.

  One issue that might put off readers is that the books are very long and the plot...sort of meanders around a little. Very often the protagonist sets out to do one thing in a subplot and ends up starting another entirely different subplot. The story always gets back to the old plots, but it's evocative of real life where events are messy and don't ever have a neat, self-contained arc or episode. I liked it, but I know it's not to everyone's taste.
  ```

  - u/quark_epoch:
    ```
    Does the world project a self-contained information structure? Or does it frequently introduce ad-hoc deus ex machinas to resolve overcomplicated plots?
    Does it appear rational?

    Meanderings are often good.

    I shall duly peruse. Thank you for your suggestion.
