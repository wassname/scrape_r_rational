## [Q]So I'm finally getting around to reading Worm... [Spoilers]

### Post:

And I don't really like it. The Slaughterhouse 9 have just left the city, and I'm not sure I really want to read any more of it. Part of it is just fatigue over the S9, the whole "Yes, I get it, these guys are the epitome of evil! Just kill them already!" thing, part of it is that Lisa is blatantly obviously misusing her power at every opportunity, I can't stand Bitch, and it seems to me that all of the most interesting characters are only bit actors (Dragon, mostly). The worldbuilding is fantastic and deep, and the antagonists (can't use the world villain in this setting, can I?) are amazing at making me want them to die horribly, but the main characters? I already know before any plotline begins that all of the Undersiders are going to survive (have so far, anyway, no spoilers in case I decide to finish), so the tension feels hollow and contrived. 

I kind of hope Amy will join just because of how much more powerful it will make Skitter, but I also hate her with a burning passion. First, she's a moron. If she could make a parasite that can fix Bonesaw's prion disease, why can't she fix all prion diseases everywhere? Hell, why can't she tweak microbiomes to fix all infectious diseases? She seems stuck in the "I need to touch people to fix them" mindset when she has demonstrated already how untrue that is. Second, the Nine were absolutely, 100% right about her stupid rules. She has elemental control over biological matter, and she uses that to fix bones? She's falling into the trap of thinking that her making one mistake ever will somehow ruin her, while she has watched her sister make potentially lethal mistakes no less than 7 times, *and then bailed her ass out.* She never experiments with her power, always staying with what she knows is *safe.* If she got permission from someone with crippling depression to experiment on curing them, and she failed? One person dies, and she knows not to do that again. If she succeeds, though, *she can begin walking through psych wards exorcising fucking demons.* She knows how unscrupulous her family is, knows that nothing she does will really have consequences, and knows that despite those things *her family is likely a net positive to the world.* Having the mindset that it is possible to always do the 100% right thing without getting your hands dirty (which isn't possible in this world) is both unbelievable from a character standpoint (where the hell did she get that idea from? Her lawyer father? Her violent sister? Her bio-dad? Heh.) and, to me, at least, goes against a core principle of rationalism: sometimes the best option is really, really *bad.* 

I'll probably still finish Worm, just because I'm curious about a few things, but I'm afraid it will be a chore. 

Your thoughts? I'm sorry if this seems too harsh, but Worm comes up a lot here and I'm just not seeing it right now.

  I always read the contrast between Taylor and Amy as a lesson in the importance of creativity.

  Taylor has the power to control bugs... it doesn't sound like much at first, it doesn't really automatically intimidate anyone, but by god when she sets her mind to it and comes up with imaginative uses for insects she is a force to be reckoned with and becomes feared/respected/successful.

  Meanwhile Amy has just been casually handed a power for which the god-tier applications are practically dime-a-dozen. But her own constraints, and failure to think creatively, limit her to acting as a glorified medic. 

  Further evidence: just about the only good ideas Amy ever has are pretty much directly inspired by or in response to Taylor. But I can't quite remember where in the story they occur so I'm going to shush in case of spoilers.

- u/Magodo:
  ```
  Worm was a work in progress less than 2 years ago and there was a point when the author rolled dice to determine the next character death, so no one has any plot armor.  

  I really liked Worm because it's a crapsack world and really, really dark. It also has excellent world building and is the closest that fiction has got to 'if superpowers really existed'.  

  Your point about Amy is one of the main reasons Worm is considered rational. IRL, I feel that this is exactly what would happen with an Amy-like character. [Minor spoilers](#s " She's adopted and doesn't feel like a part of the family and totally fucks up the only person she cares about")

  I'm not going to give spoilers, but this is due to a mistake you're making rather than the author. Worm is the kind of story where no one gets plot immunity just for the hell of it. If you think a character might die, they seriously might.  

  > I kind of hope Amy will join just because of how much more powerful it will make Skitter, but I also hate her with a burning passion. First, she's a moron.

  Congratulations, welcome to "if real people had super-powers". Yes it's frustrating to watch, but this strikes me as something that could realistically happen. Most people don't immediately think "how can I munchkin this power to god levels?", and all it takes for Amy to keep herself from her full potential is fear. Doesn't that sound pretty familiar as a way human beings actually work?

    Also probably spoiler-free: Wildbow, the author, has mentioned he literally rolls dice in some scenes to decide if characters will die as part of his writing process.

    He's even described his plans for what to do if Taylor had rolled badly and been killed by Leviathan.
    ```

    - u/Petruchio_:
      ```
      Yes! It blew my mind that he literally rolled dice for each participant in the Leviathan fight. Alot of budding plotlines die abruptly in that chaos.

            I totally forgot about that. .I think Aegis was going to be playing a serious role too, as the Ward's leader.

            - u/Kumquatodor:
              ```
              Aegis rolled bad, so Wildbow would have to use another protagonist, too.

              Common fan theory is that Weld would be that choice, but it hasn't been confirmed.

        He was originally planning Worm to be only one of an anthology-style collection set in the same universe - hence why the site is titled "parahumans" and not "worm".

        >An author being so flippant with a character that their fate is literally a dice roll is probable only in horror or perhaps horror parody. It's not something I respect for a serious dramatic piece.

        Plenty of serious dramatic pieces are also horror, so I'm not sure what your point is here.

        >What happens if every possible Skitter replacement has their number come up?

        That would be astoundly unlikely, even if every character were present for the fight, which they weren't.

        Even if it were, Wildbow runs games set in the *Worm* universe, and he's got a whole process worked out for generating new capes in a few minutes' work. I play, he does it pretty much every day.

  - u/Azkaban_Guard:
    ```
    Plus, if Amy ever did munchkin her power to the maximum, even in a positive way like creating healthier microbiomes, it would make it even more obvious that she's a potential S-Class threat waiting to happen. Every non-cape and most capes on the planet are susceptible to biological attack from someone who can make a communicable anti-prion chemical in the space of 5 minutes. If you're glad that Jack holds Bonesaw back from her full potential, imagine what could happen if someone capable of a wider range of skills with less need of resources used her power to the fullest.

    So maybe Panacea isn't living up to her name, but if I were her I'd also be steering sell away from the ambition that drives Bonesaw.
    ```

    - u/AugSphere:
      ```
      If she's so desperate to be a fucking hero, here's the easy solution. Make a virus that will:

      1. Stop ageing at physical and mental peak. Reverse the detrimental effects for those already past the peak.
      2. Cure all diseases and make affected humans highly resistant to future ones.
      3. Improve intelligence.
      4. Improve rationality.

      You could add as many buffs as you like. Since her power is bullshit arbitrary bio-kinesis every item should be achievable to some (large) degree. Give the virus a month of incubation, make it virulent, resistant to mutation and build in a kill switch. Covertly infect some schmuck in Chicago, or another city with a big international airport nearby. Your work is done. You don't even have to take credit.

      Naturally, this would cripple the conflict in the story and so it cannot be. I just wish wildbow didn't give such OP powers out at all, instead of making the recipient too mentally ill/mind-raped to use them.
      ```

      - u/Salivanth:
        ```
        It's also worth remembering that anyone who tries to improve the world becomes a prime target for the Simurgh. And the Simurgh's power clearly involves some form of future sight, given the extremely long chains of events that happen after every attack she makes.

        If Amy was the type of person who was going to do this, she would be unlikely to ever receive the chance.
        ```

        - u/AugSphere:
          ```
          Yes, simurgh is a plot fairy, we know. I've been [whinging about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3kdkiu/ffrst_fling_a_light_worm/cuzvrf6) for a while now.

  If you're finding it a chore now, I doubt that you'll find it less of a chore in later chapters. I think I finished Worm mostly because I'd already started and wanted to see things through, rather than because I was really enjoying myself. Towards the end, the length became much more of a bug than a feature (something that I think/hope is going to be fixed in editing).

  And yes, Amy has the Superman problem, which is basically that she's got an amazing power that has to be constrained by psychology rather than anything physical. I bought it, but I can see where someone would just find it frustrating and a bit out of character. I don't typically like characters holding back because they're afraid of how awesome they are, with only a few notable exceptions.
  ```

  - u/NotAHeroYet:
    ```
    I think she's foolish, but I also think amy feels much the same way you would, if you randomly became an AI.

    You've heard how much of a catastrophe an UFAI could be, right? Now imagine if you've never heard of the possibility of FAI. Every AI is a extinction event, or at least an apathetic god.

     Amy isn't quite at that level, but she grew up hearing horror stories of other people- people her power could imitate, outdo. She could be a hero without compare- but the people who're going to fix everything generally get hit by an endbringer

    [setting spoilers](#s "nilborg, who creates creatures from raw materials, and overtook a city. If amy were creative, she could outdo that easily. heartbreaker, who made everyone love him. i think you already saw amy can do that. bonesaw, who turns people into abominations that want to die. amy can do this, too. she's even got a death-touch versus humans, for lord's sakes.") ==

     there are no good overpowered characters in worm, for amelia to have as a role model, not with her powers.  she's terrified, because she's not a good person, and she doesn't think that she can be a true hero. But she thinks she could be a vilian to end all villians, a force for evil like never seen before.
    ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    > I don't typically like characters holding back because they're afraid of how awesome they are

    You mean you don't like characters being realistic?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Well, like I said, I bought it in the case of Amy, and I do have some exceptions.

      But as a general rule, I think it smacks of an author that wants to have their cake and eat it too. They want Reed Richards to be smart enough that curing HIV would be trivial, but they don't want to upset the status quo by having him actually cure HIV. So in order for Reed Richards not to be a complete monster, the writer has to invent some reason for him to decide that curing HIV is a bad thing.

      You can see this in a bunch of speculative fiction, but especially in comic books. It's a result of that tension between awesomeness and the status quo. Whenever I see it, it just stands out as being really transparent to me, so whatever arguments Superman is making about how he doesn't want to solve *real* problems always ring hollow, unless those arguments are presented in a much better form than I usually see.

      It's like if you see someone get dragged off by monsters, but you know that they're going to come back in the third act, so you just roll your eyes at it.
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        So, you're just tired of Reed Richards being useless. It can be aggravating. But there are also the cases where it is entirely desirable to reduce impact, either due to the character's instability, their own biases, high risk or uncertainty in the nature of the solution... It's basically an existential risk at that point, like the problem of Friendliness but with an inconsistent and puny human-like character at the wheel.

        I mean, you wrote the Metropolitan Man, for Zod's sake, so I know that you understand this argument. You pretty much wrote it yourself. But the cases where these arguments do not apply definitely have their realism (and enjoyability) take a hit, yes (I just think that in most cases, as with the real world, these arguments would actually apply, and that they just need to be addressed in the story).

        ^^^^^^^^^Zod. ^^^^^^^^^Teehee.

        I should reread Metropolitan Man. That was some good setting.

  Amy is terrible. I've seen a fan theory that her powers actually messed up her brain, similar to Bitch, based on - this is probably not a spoiler but maybe a very minor spoiler - the fact that her bio-dad also had arbitrary rules he followed obsessively.

  I really liked Bitch, actually. Her interlude totally turned that character around for me; she's *not* a terrible person, just struggling with a crippling inability to process social cues. I'm surprised you hate the antagonists at all, actually, given the Interlude chapters; one of the major themes of Worm is that people tend to be more sympathetic from the inside than we give them credit for. Taylor is pretty morally dubious herself.

  Amy fades in prominence after this arc, for what it's worth, and I don't think anyone with her can't-use-my-powers-clown'll-eat-me craziness shows up again. But if reading it is a chore, I'm not sure the mild genre- and status-quo-shift every couple of arcs is enough to save you.

      Consider that Amy's power is so powerful, it could completely kill a good chunk of conflict all over the world, if she decided to create 'healing biodrones' or whatever. Shards have been known to sabotage that kind of thing before.
      ```

      - u/Iconochasm:
        ```
        The shard has a connection straight into her brain is is a biokinetic.  Every time she thinks about creating a Panacea to some ailment, her shard floods her brain with chemically driven fear.  She rationalizes it as horror at the idea of benevolently mind-raping millions.  Eventually, she develops a major phobia of brain work at all.

  Worm can be a bit of a slog. And there are sections where the tension keep ratcheting up and up without relief. In that respect, Wildbow's next serial was even more extreme... to the point where I couldn't take it anymore, and I stopped reading it and haven't picked it up again.

  But Worm gets very epic at the end. I definitely felt it was worth the effort.

  You might like some of the fanfics out there such as Centotaph and Atonement much better.

  I'm sure you will like Amy's character arc a lot better.
  ```

- u/Rhamni:
  ```
  I was only slightly further than you are now before I stopped reading. Then I jumped back into it a year later and finished the whole thing. I will say this. By my standards, from where you are now there is a slight improvement and things happen faster for an arc or two, then you get drowned in a single fight that takes like three arcs and is mind numbingly boring for the most part, then things moderately improve with some cool twists and developments and we get to know some movers and shakers and then we hit the end game and holy fuck it's awesome I'm so glad I pressed on.
  ```

- u/AugSphere:
  ```
  Yup, Amy's the worst offender in the harm-by-inaction category. It's like she's put in the trolley problem where on one side you have all the people dying from easily preventable biological failure (i.e. almost all of them) and on the other there are her mental hang-ups. And she repeatedly fucking jams the switch as hard as she can to sacrifice untold millions so that she can continue to be the idiotic teenager she is.

  It's debatable how much agency she has in this of course. Her family environment and the shard mind-fuckery combine to make everything someone else's fault. That's one of the reasons I despise the simurgh+shard-control combo so much. Can't even hate the character for being a nigh-omnicidal moron, since she's basically mind-controlled into it.
  ```

  - u/NotAHeroYet:
    ```
    I think she's put in a different dilema, actually. She could hold herself back, act like she's behaving now.

    or she could let her powers lose, gamble that she's a good person, and try to save everyone. but she's probably got an accurate estimation of her power level, so... she could be a salvation event or an extinction event, and she's not confident enough in her being a good person to risk it. she fears she's the greatest villian the darkness ever had or will have, and she won't risk it in the hopes of being the greatest hero instead.
    ```

  >goes against a core principle of rationalism: sometimes the best option is really, really bad.

  ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  I just want to point that a lot of people here like Worm because of Taylor who's pretty close to being a rationalist (even if the setting doesn't always involve rational actors) and I think that Wildbow nerfed Amy herself just so she wouldn't be so ridiculously game breaking while still allowing her ability to be used in the endgame of the story.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Taylor is OK, and actually about what I would expect if a slightly smarter than average teenage girl suddenly gained superpowers. Her power upgrades through better use are certainly rational.

    During the S9 arc, I was actually hoping that Bitch would join, just so we could be rid of her by the end of the arc.
    ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      Personally Bitch was one of my favorite characters. One of the things I love about worm is that there are so many different kinds of people in it and they, and the way they interact with powers, is written realistically. Sure this means that a lot of characters aren't rational but that's how the world works. Some people could have done so much more if they were able to think rationally but that's what would actually happen if random people got powers.

      I don't remember how much has been revealed about bitch so I'll keep it light. Bitch is one of the people who has managed to munchkin their powers the most (realistically) because her power is more of a curse than a blessing. She got a superpower as a child which is harmful enough already and it turned out to be....well, that power.
      ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      >about what I would expect if a slightly smarter than average teenage girl

      I really get the feeling that you overestimate average human rationality and intelligence.
