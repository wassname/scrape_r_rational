  So far as I'm concerned, they're free to it. If this community ever needs to move somewhere else, and voat is the logical place for us to move, we can just grab /v/rationalfiction. I understand the impetus to make voat into an exact mirror of reddit, but I don't think that's going to work out well, and they're right that /v/rational is prime namespace (even if I don't think that namespace counts for much if you don't have a way to drive users).

  Let them have it. The name Rational is much more fitting for a sub about discussing rationality (like lesswrong) than only rational fiction.

  ```
  A subreddit namespace entitles one community to the trademarked use of a single common adjective?

  >Rational fiction or this sub? This sub is not. It is a placeholder to make sure /v/rational does not get picked up and used for something that is too different from what /r/Rational is.

  Really, honestly, fuck that. Domain squatting like this is completely useless. Let them have it.

  Good for them, I suppose. No reason for us to stop doing our thing here.

  Interesting. I didn't know that voat was even a thing. 

  It'll probably be too much hassle to split efforts evenly between the two subs right now, but kudos or something for looking ahead?

  I would *really* not feel comfortable migrating to Voat.

    Out of curiosity: Why?

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      There are two primary reasons not to migrate to voat, one of which is always going to be an issue, and the other which is more dealing with current events:

      /r/rational currently has 3,100 readers, and most of them wouldn't make the transition. You'd end up with a smaller community, fewer submissions, less discussion, etc.

      Voat is experiencing growth right now because of the whole /r/fatpeoplehate thing. If you have no idea what that is, you can [read about it here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/39bzdf/why_was_rfatpeoplehate_along_with_several_other/) There are two general sorts of people who are migrating. The first are the free-speech people who think this is a symptom of reddit losing its focus, spitting in the face of so-called transparency, doing exactly the sort of thing that goes against what made it the place to be in the first place, etc. The *second* sort are the people who populated subs like /r/fatpeoplehate and want to continue having a place for mockery, harassment, and ... well, hate, like it says in the name. There were about 150,000 subs of /r/fatpeoplehate, with more who frequented it but weren't subbed, and a fair amount of them went over to voat (it's the 17th largest subverse there, and from what I can tell, comprises about half the userbase). In my personal opinion, it doesn't seem like the sort of site that I would go to *right now* in the hopes of getting intelligent, thoughtful discussion, because a lot of the people you'd be talking to would be the sorts of people who take joy in mockery, harassment, etc. Not all of them, obviously, but enough. And worse, voat itself is profiting from this whole thing, which means that they're going to have a strong incentive to not upset their majority of their userbase.

  I'm the guy who registered the name. I'm mildly disinclined to losing the sub in case the reddit exodus broadens, but I cede the point that there really isn't much need for a subverse right now. I've replied to the thread and made a few posts to the subverse, but I agree we could just take a different name if it came to that. So... thanks for the heads up. And as the subverse sidebar says, if anyone from here wants to make more of an effort making it into an active sub, I'm happy to hand it over.
