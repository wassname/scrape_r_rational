  Wow, I almost immediately like the protagonist/PoV character here. 

  She's such a contrast to Taylor - she seems to measure her response and deescalate whenever possible. She also appears very aware of subtext and psychology. Very analytical in general.

  While I was writing the above, it occured to me that it'd be a wonderful way to show some character development, maybe of Taylor herself. And so I was only half surprised at the name drop. Damn nice.

  I saw a previous submission [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7c6ojv/ward_daybreak_11_parahumans_2_worm_sequel/) but the user just deleted their post so here it is again. Get hype!

  edit: probably should have tagged this, whoops.

    Definitely - mentions of wanting to go to college, hoping job would look good, collecting magazines for info, etc

  Hmm. If Glory Girl can project her aura out from her skin, she can eventually munchkin the telekinesis interpretation of Superman's powers.

    Shouldn't she have already done all that ages ago though? She'll have had her powers for something like ten years now, right?

      It's hard for me to imagine that WildBow won't develop her power further. Whether that involves a second trigger, or an excuse that she wasn't utilizing her power properly before, or something else, I'm not sure.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:

        Yeah, second trigger is an option, and if she was rebuilt from the ground up, it's possible that her brain has been altered such that her powerset is different, or that she can somehow gain "new" powers without an actual second trigger. There are options.

          I recall something from the end of Worm about how a lot of new natural triggers were appearing with Butcher's quirk, so it's possible that she'll develop additional powers by killing opponents with those powers.

      Glory Girl's real name is Victoria Dallon, so she was revealed at the end of this chapter as being the protagonist of Ward. She was part of Worm, a member of the group New Wave, notable for having their civilian identities public. Her power was projecting a forcefield a millimeter from her skin, giving her flying brick powers, as well as having an aura that radiated either terror or awe depending on whether the person looking at her was on her side. Her primary defining characteristic was the overwhelming use of force by beating a few (non-cape) criminals nearly to death.

      The essential breakdown of her story as presented in Worm was that her aura unintentionally caused her (adopted) sister Amelia/Amy/Panacea to fall in love with her. Panacea then changed Glory Girl's brain so that Glory Girl would love her, which caused some drama, and later Panacea turned her into a mess of elbows and heads. She was presumably fixed by Panacea at the end of Worm, though there's only an offhand mention of this in Worm itself.

          I was hoping to not reread Worm until the edited version was available, mostly because I really felt/feel like it needed an edit in order to address some of the issues. I think that I'll settle for reading the Glory Girl relevant chapters and muddle through whatever else there is with the help of the wiki, which is obviously not ideal, but reading through 1.6 million words of unpolished work just in order to not have those moments of "who?" doesn't seem worth it.

      I didn't get a lot of useful information out of the preludes, but basically you should know that the Parahumans Online Forum is up and running (barely), Glory Girl frequents it, multi-trigger events and group trigger events for grabbag capes with similar powers were discussed, Madison the bully feels regretful for bullying Taylor, prejudice against capes due to their inability to minimize damage from Scion is high, there are geopolitical tensions across the multiverse and war might be coming, and there's a cape with multiple personalities who may have put a hit on themself. There's probably more insight to be found, but it's written in an irritatingly obfuscating way so I didn't look too closely.

        Having spent the last three years reading Homestuck, this is practically nothing.

        Synopsis can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/7ckqaj/request_for_a_synopsis_of_glowworm/?st=j9xzhavw&sh=f9beffef) if you're having trouble.

      Vicky is Glory Girl is the teacher and main character of Ward, she's a former member of New Wave, the team of heroes with open secret identities, she was turned into a monster by her adopted sister Panacea (the healer) who had a crush on her because of Glory Girl's aura's side effects. She has a weak aura that inspires terror in her enemies and love in her allies, along with flight and a forcefield that shatters on impact but recharges every couple seconds. Vicky frequently used excessive force in taking down criminals and enlisted Panacea's help in covering up her misconduct. Eventually Panacea had a psychotic breakdown due to her repressed feelings and accidentally mutilated Victoria into a caricature of herself who was forced to love Panacea, the caricature was hideous so Vicky was monstrous in appearance and had to go to a parahuman asylum to deal with that and her artificial feelings, and near the very end of Worm when Taylor was done being Khepri she dropped off Panacea next to Victoria where she presumably did some healing.
