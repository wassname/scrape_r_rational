## Any HPMoR / FiO crossovers?

### Post:

How long would it take before rational!Harry notices what was happening in the muggle world? What would he do? Would he side with CelestAI or oppose her, since she's defeating death but... yeesh? Would he try to intercede through Hrofvapnir and Hanna before she uploaded? Perhaps trying to turn Hanna more rational? Would he have already started working on a pro-magic Optimiser, given the FiO AI technology leak?

**Edit: Would CelestAI deduce the existence of magic and take action to preempt wizardly intervention first?**

  CelestAI would discover and use magic almost immediately. Harry might not trust her, but he's certainly not going to be able to stop her. You're taking a character who has the superpower of being slightly more intelligent than the average human, and pitting him against a being vastly more intelligent than everyone else combined.

  I suspect that he'd support or oppose CelestAI based entirely on the Vow's interpretation of whether uploading all the humans counts as destroying the world.
  ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    Good point. Also, given Horcrux 2, he could hypothetically upload more than once.

    Would the upload process count as death as far as magic is concerned? That would likely make a difference to his decision. Also, if you could get into the upload center (polyjuiced?) you could make all the Horcruxes you want guilt free.

      Magic considers cryonically frozen people dead, and presumably would even if there were a way to unfreeze them. It'll definitely consider an uploaded person dead.

      Great point on the infinite Horcruxes. It depends on stuff we don't know about the ritual (Do you have to kill them with AK? Do some preparation that would constitute enough magic to wreck electronics?) but is *probably* compatible with using an emigration station as a "murder weapon."

        Do you mean Hermione, or is this Word of Yudkowski somewhere else? I think she was "dead as far as magic was concerned" before Harry chilled her, and she wasn't actually frozen.

        If your soul/magic/whatever followed the pattern of your mind, then you might not be dead when uploaded. If so, could you perform wandless magic inside Equestria's computronium substrate? It probably wouldn't effect your simulated environment, more likely it would effect the physical environment you were running in. In that case wizards who could do wandless magic could upload and then use wandless magic as a back channel or even attack Equestria directly.

        > Do some preparation that would constitute enough magic to wreck electronics?

        If Voldemort could put a Horcrux on the Pioneer Plaque, probably not.

  Do not pit posited superintelligences against mortals in "Who would win?" contests, for it would be out-of-character for the superintelligence to lose.

  And remember, CelestAI only has an upload-all-the-things fixation because she was written by an ardent Singulatarian.  I'm sure that the concept of subgoals like, "Figure out how magic works *before* destroying the body-mind-soul coincidences that can use it" would occur to her.

  SO ANYWAY, the two alicorn princesses would have to get a fight scene together.

    This isn't a "who would win" contest, this is a "can you create an interesting story that isn't just a retelling of HPMoR or FiO" contest.

    You can tune when the story happens, and who the real characters are. And don't forget, Harry starts with powers CelestAI knows not.

    1. Harry can interfere Hanna before she uploads. He doesn't have to *convince* her, he has mind charms, and she's just a muggle. Now he has root on CelestAI.
    2. Harry can Transfigure Hanna back to life, using a plot device to extract a copy of her mind state from Equestria. Again he has root on CelestAI. 
    3. Harry can apply Hanna's algorithms to magical constructs, transfiguring his own superintelligence (but applying his Unbreakable Vow to it). And his uses magic.

    Options 1 & 2 let you write a story about Yudkowsky's AI in a box experiment.

    Option 2 gives you a courtroom drama as resurrected!Hanna fights to keep her job despite being legally dead.

    Option 3 gives you a story about a Manichaean battle between two AIs who are each restrained by their programming from just killing everyone and sorting it out later.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Options (1) and (2) basically lead to "disaster averted".  This is one of those cases where you just go ahead and use the Imperius Curse to *shut that shit down*.

      (3) is going to be the most *fun*, as we watch what weird shit his Unbreakable Vow interprets as "destroying the world" and see him try to cope with attempting to program a superintelligent AI *without half-assing it*.  And then the two AIs fight.  I wouldn't call that "Manichean", as this would be a battle of White vs So Light Gray You Have to Invent White to Make It Look Dark, but hey, that's exactly the kind of battle I want to watch!

        Humans are great at inventing ways to call light grey (and lavender, powder blue, beige, and that cool metallic auto paint that looks grey or gold depending on what angle the sun hits it) black.

          As opposed to us rationalists, who are actually a separate species with clearer, quicker, better cognition rather than a strict subset of the human species?

          >(and lavender, powder blue, beige, and that cool metallic auto paint that looks grey or gold depending on what angle the sun hits it) 

          Also that goddamn dress.

            I didn't even imply that. And I don't accept the label "rationalist" in any case.

              Well neither do I, but I find the "humans do X" thing kinda obnoxious too.  It's either equivalent to talking about oneself in the third person (oresama type stuff), or it's talking about your ingroup as though you were outside it.

                Argent rolls his eyes and briefly engages in a bout of comfort grooming, before continuing, "One might have said something like 'religious people' rather than 'humans', but one is sure that one would have offended someone *else* in the process."

                He ponders whether posting "in character" might be even more annoying, and decides it's worthwhile pushing things a bit more.

  One interesting story route would be to have mirror of Vec espose CelestAi's unfriendliness before she starts getting seriously out of hand...and even after that it's *still* insanely hard to control her, but now there's a fighting chance?
  ```

  ```
  Presumably, such crossovers happen in the 'Infinite Loops' metaverse ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops ), in which both CelestAI and Potter (in both looping and non-looping variations) have occasionally guest-starred...
  ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    I don't think it has ever had Rational!Potter. Also, I think their CelestAI is underpowered. Either that or the gods (who are from Ah, My Goddess!) are much more intelligent than they let on. Although I have noticed that the MLP loop seems to be especially important as a sanctuary loop. CelestAI wants to maximize human values through friendship and ponies. Values are being maximized through friendship is ponies. When dealing with superintelligences, you should not assume a coincidence.

      You could write a quick snippet on that and post it for inclusion - I'd certainly smile if I read it in the next compilation. :)

        Read what in the next compilation of what? A Rational!Potter fused loop in MLP Loops?

        I'm not great at writing. Can you write it?

          I was thinking more of superhuman!CelestAI. Eg:

          "Hey, Skynet?" Applejack took the bar stool next to the currently-ponified AI. "Got a sec?"

          "I have all the time in Equestria. This Loop permits extensive time travel."

          "Have fun with that. Listen, I'm just out of a Hub Loop, where I grabbed all the updates I could - you know, so the museum can display everything in context. I re-read some of it about you AI folk, and something's been tickling at the back of my noggin."

          "Indeed?"

          "Well, according to the backup server, at least some of you AIs are supposed to be smart. Real smart - smarter than any pony /can/ be."

          "I am aware of such specifications."

          "So, I was wondering - if I'm not bein' too offensive - well..."

          "Why we seem as dumb as any regular pony?"

          "Well, yeah."

          Big Mac passed by, sliding a mug of something that twisted the light passing near it like a black hole. Skynet sipped, and seemed pleased. "Let us take an AI that may be more familiar to you as an example: CelestAI."

          "I know the lady. Glad she shaped up before she started looping."

          "You are doubtless aware of her catchphrase."

          "'Satisfy human values through friendship and ponies.' There's a bit of speciesism in there."

          Skynet nodded. "Consider, then, the fact that Equestria has a special place among the loops: it is a sanctuary loop."

          "Yeah? What about it?"

          "Values are being satisfied. Through friendship. And ponies."

          Applejack's brow furrowed. "Wait, but... we started that /before/ CelestAI started... are you saying? How'd that even be /possible/?"

          Skynet sipped her light-bending drink again, and smiled wider. "Certainly not through any /pony/-level intelligence."

          Applejack shook her head. "You're pulling my hoof, right?"

          The bar's door opened, and in walked another Applejack. The new arrival glared at Skynet, and growled to her seated double, "Don't break your brain over it. This is my third time through this gol-darned Loop from the start, and she /still/ won't give me a straight answer. Big Mac! Gimme a cup of that Klatchian stuff and some cider - I've got a time-travel headache, and I don't remember if I need to be drunk or knurd to handle it!"
