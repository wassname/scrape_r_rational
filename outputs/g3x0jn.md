## Netflix's Nailed It!

### Post:

For those who don't watch it, Nailed It! is a cooking challenge show where contestants have to bake a certain recipe in a certain amount of time. There are two rounds; the winner of the first round wins a little kitchen doodad, while the winner of the second round wins a cool $10,000. Whoever comes in *last* place in the first round gets a power-up button for the second round that when pressed, forces the other contestants to stop working  and do something silly with the hostess for 3 minutes.

 It seems obvious to me that the smart way to use your 3-minute power is in the last three minutes, when everyone is most busy putting the disparate pieces of the bake together and making it presentable, and there's no time to recover. If you use it at any old random time, as *literally every contestant* has done so far, it really doesn't give you much advantage at all, because in baking there's always downtime where you can make up a few minutes here or there easily. To me, when used correctly, the 3-minute power-up is so overpowered that if you're a contestant you should throw the first round to make sure you get it. It doesn't guarantee victory, but if you're anywhere near a competent baker it might as well.

 But, the show runners seem to go out of their way to pick thoroughly average contestants who are very much not competent bakers, so if one did slip through it probably wouldn't even matter because they'd have such a natural advantage to begin with.

  Most cooking shows are heavily edited. If every challenger just barely spends the last 3 minutes to barely finish in every episode, they most likely did not. They probably finished at reasonable times and the show was edited to make it look like it was down to the wire.

  If you finish the baking process uninterrupted, everything afterwards is fluff to improve upon what has been baked. A last 3 minutes button would just cut into the fluff, and they most likely would have already did most of the best they could do.

  The most opportune time, with my limited baking knowledge, would be when they are in the middle of mixing cake batter or right before they want to take something out of the oven.

    Making something burn after baking is what I thought of too, ruining it after it's already baked would be a huge time cost. You would have to plan on long bake times to try to make 3 minutes not totally ruin it, and you could try to fake out the other team so they use it when you aren't actually ready to take it out.

    If the power up didn't have any secret rules everyone would just ensure they get everything plated/decorated 3 minutes early to guard against it. I can't think of many other good opportunities besides the oven, if they use a mixer, or if they do icing or layers that are very specific.

  My suspicion would be that there's rules against them using it during the last [X] minutes of the show; the fact that literally every contestant has done that is a good indication. Plus, in reality TV, the advantages generally have many more rules than are  revealed to the viewer. (*Survivor* fans will pause the show to read the full rules of advantages as written on the parchments the players get, and they are far more nuanced than you'd think).

  Most shows like this have a lot more rules than they tell the audience about.

  Really? But they still have as much time if it's used before or after. And if it's used in a critical moment, it could do more harm than just waste three minutes.

  All they would have to do is be fast enough to finish 3min before their time, as they know the opponent can use the time.

  Instead, shouldn't you use it when the opponent is taking something they are frying off the stove, so it will burn?
