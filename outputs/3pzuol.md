  Can you briefly give our reasons for posting this story? I just wanted to know what you found rational about this before I start reading it. Thanks. ;)

    The end of the story shows two different rational choices I've rarely see elsewhere. In one, [first spoiler](#s "the protagonist does what she feels best for her love interest, even though her love interest would disagree"), and in the other, [second spoiler](#s "the other protagonist has been making at least somewhat rational decisions about how to deal with god-level power for some time.") For the time it was written, the story was even a decent deconstruction of the whole 'Master PC' micro-genre, whose protagonists tended to resemble 'Steam Engine Time''s antagonist.

    I will admit that, from the perspective of an LW reader, there's a lack of any interest in exploring Friendly/Unfriendly AI; which can probably be explained by being written before those concepts were much more than "Don't build SkyNet".

  Very NSFW. One of many stories sharing the conceit of the 'Master PC', and IMO, one of the best of them.

  This story has a prequel, '[Meeting the Master](http://www.mcstories.com/MasterPCMeeting/index.html)'.

    I'm reading the original story for context, and I have to say, it is the pinnacle of 90s high school erotica, much like the majority of ASSTR. The setting archive had a story about a nerd named 'Myron.' These people had a body image complex or something...
