## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  **Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 7: Bronze**

  Ok, week seven of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for general overview of the magic system, see [part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/). I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 6 can be found here: [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/).

  *Spoiler note*: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

  This weeks metal is bronze. As always I'm interested in what a bronze twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial. For this particular metal and a few of the ones we'll see in the future the allomantic half doesn't do much if no other allomancers exist, so on earth you'd mostly be stuck with only the feruchemic half (plus compounding).

  **Allomancy**

  Allomantically, bronze allows you to detect other allomancers that are using their power. Once you start burning bronze you can hear faint heartbeat-like pulses being emanated whenever allomancy is used.

  More powerful allomancy generates more powerful pulses and the pulses are stronger near their source. As a consequence, the range across which you can detect pulses varies strongly by how powerful the pulses are: very weak allomancy you might only be able to detect from within the same building while very powerful allomancy might be detected across an entire city. Spoilers: >!At the extreme high end we've seen one instance where pulses can carry across an entire continent, but those were caused by a literal god trying to break free and no allomancer is (or in fact can even theoretically be) powerful enough to replicate that feat!<

  The pulses corresponding to different metals being burned each have their own distinctive signature to them, things like rythm, frequency and whether the pulses feel like they're pushing or pulling are all subtly different for the different metals. With some practice bronze allomancers are able to distinguish what metal is being used, but also things like whether the pulses are strong because their source is nearby or because the source is powerful, whether the metal being burned is feruchemically charged (ie. whether the other person is compounding) and even, with a lot of practice, what the allomancer is doing exactly (ie. is a soother trying to surpress fear or anger). 

  It is also theoretically possible to detect feruchemy (and other forms of magic), but this is far more difficult than detecting allomancy and no one on Scadrial has figured out how to do it yet.

  Allomancy being used near someone burning copper is hidden from your powers (spoilers for next week, I guess), but otherwise things being in between you and your target do not interfere with your abilities.

  **Feruchemy**

  Feruchemically, bronze lets you store wakefulness. Bronze is unique among feruchemic metals in that it lets you create metalminds while sleeping, as soon as you start filling a bronze metalmind you immediately fall into a deep, dreamless sleep. When you wake up, you don't feel any more rested than before you went to sleep, instead you now have a filled bronze metalmind that you can tap from when you get sleepy.

  Tapping a bronze metalmind makes you less sleepy, more attentive and active and lets you go without sleep for longer. This is different from caffeine and other such drugs in that it allows you to stay awake indefinitely without negative consequences, provided that you have enough stored wakefulness. 

  Tapping more wakefulness than is needed to compensate for lack of sleep makes you slightly more attentive and sharp (as if you've been sleeping under ideal circumstances), but this effect has a pretty sharp cap, being extremely awake is pretty much the same as being just normally awake.
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    One of many metals I wish I could tap. Is it confirmed that storing wakefulness is all-or-nothing, i.e. you can't store 10% of your wakefulness and get slightly drowsy for a while? 

    This can also be used as a poor man's A-Cadmium, to get through a long flight, boring lecture, eternal doctor's office waiting room, etc.

    I wonder what the downsides are to just storing 100% wakefulness every night instead of falling asleep. Could you store for 8 hours, then tap 50% for the remaining 16? Nice cure for insomnia if so.
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    I forget, can Feruchemists tap metals that are infused by other Feruchemists?

    If so, you can get a sleep trade started up between the bronze Feruchemists, where some are paid to spend their time infusing bronze so the others can be awake longer. They would have a job that literally pays them to sleep, how envious.

    As for the bronze allochemists, look back at all the previous allochemist munchkin ideas. Hire bronze allochemists as guards to stop their shenanigans. For example, last week's zinc allochemists manipulating horse races by rioting fatigue? Station a few bronze allochemists at the races, detect whether anyone is burning zinc, and hunt them down.
    ```

    - u/eous:
      ```
      Ordinarily, Feruchemists can only use their own metalminds, but those who store Identity (using Aluminum) can make metalminds that others can use.
      ```

  - u/paradoxinclination:
    ```
    The only interesting trick I can think of involving allomantic bronze is to use it to transmit messages. Any two bronze mistings could communicate telepathically by turning their power on and off, using different length 'pulses' to essentially think Morse code at each other. If the average detection range for bronze is large enough, you could use a relay system and turn bronze mistings into a pseudo-telegraph.

  I posted this in the last thread, but too late to get any bites. I think it's a cool one though so I'll try again, would love to see what the hivemind can do.

  This "power" is from [*Master Zhao: The Tale of an Ordinary Time Traveler*](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/zhang_12_18/), a great story I found on the Clarkesworld podcast. You can read or listen to it at that link. It's pretty long, but well worth the read. This post obviously has some spoilers for the story, but I'll do my best to keep it to mechanics to preserve the plot. 

  You have the ability to live through projected versions of the future. At various points in your life, you diverge from "primary" reality and begin living in an alternate timeline. The alter ends when you die or when certain irreversible choices are made, at which point you are returned to a point soon after--not simultaneous with--the moment you split off.

  Three caveats make this less of a blessing than a curse. (The third is a heavy spoiler, so read the story first!)

  One: you have no way of telling that you have split off into an alter until you return to the main timeline. Generally big choices spur a change, but there is no indication of divergence until you are deposited back in the primary, all memories of your alternate life intact. 

  Two: the longer you spend in an alter, the bigger the gap between divergence and return. If you spend 3 days on a split timeline, you might return a minute after you left; 20 years on an alter deposits you 3 weeks after the divergence. Nobody notices any difference in your behavior during that "empty" time, and you have no idea who (or what) is piloting you through the gap. 

  Three: >!As time goes on, the magnitude of choice that forces a split gets smaller and smaller: at first it's "do I save my son or my daughter," then "do I move to Virginia or New Hampshire," then "do I take the promotion or the bigger raise," then "do I buy the grey shirt or the blue shirt," then "do I get up at 8am or sleep for 5 more minutes." After a few decades of living with this ability, each day in the primary timeline takes subjective years or decades to get through, spinning off dozens or hundreds of alters. Caveat Two is mitigated by experience: the amount of "empty" time per second of alter decreases with use, until you can live years in an alter and come back seconds after you left. Master Zhao refers to himself as "Zeno's time traveler."!<

  How would you go about making this power as useful as possible? Obviously memorizing a daily or weekly list of stock trends and lottery numbers would lend itself to getting rich quick, but beyond that, what do you do to maximize your own CEV (and if you're a big-time altruist, the world's CEV)? More immediately, what do you do to make sure that Caveat Three doesn't drive you insane?
  ```

  - u/CreationBlues:
    ```
    On the surface, it's not very difficult to do whatever you wanted to. Master Zhao manages to avoid a spot of bird poop just by sidestepping, so day trading stocks would be a very efficient way to make money, or any other arbitrary goal you have.

    Therefore, the problem is not achieving your goals, but rather staying sane enough you don't commit suicide. Investing in a good psychologist is very important, and you've got a bit of leeway to get it right, since you get to see how they work out. In the story, human connection is essential to maintaining sanity, so surrounding yourself with good people is a must. Finding them is not that difficult, due to, again, the ability to save scum. They betray you, you realize it, pop back to the main timeline for round 2.

    An interesting note is that each timeline fundamentally changes the future timelines. Master Zhao doesn't take advantage of it for not being a learned man, but even taking a single development from each future would eventually result in a massive divergence in future loops. Investing in mnemonic techniques might not be a bad idea.
