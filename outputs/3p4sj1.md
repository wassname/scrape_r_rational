## Beta Reader Site for Set In Stone: Follower

### Post:

Once again, I've changed how I'm moving forward with beta reader assistance.  Because Google Docs does not allow me to create a secure password protected document where I generate a password and can distribute it to individuals, I have chosen to return to a tool that I understand.  Wordpress.

Wordpress also fails to allow me to appropriately password protect beta reading documents, but I can simply delete the documents later.

This time around, the story will be split into chapters by scene, as opposed to by hook.  The edited backstory is up, and so is the first scene.

In essence, [this blog will be what gets published.](https://betareadersite.wordpress.com/)

  That doesn't make sense.

  You shouldn't need

  > to create a secure password protected document

  in Google Docs. When you first create a document, it gives you the option to share it with whoever you want through their e-mail addresses and share it with only these people. Alternately, it should allow you to create a 'shareable link' where you can PM it to only the people you want to see it. In essence, unless you are worried about needing to block someone from the document in the future, it should be fine to use Google Docs or is there some factor I'm not aware of when using Google Docs?

  EDIT: Also how will this blog stop Amazon from screaming at you for releasing the book for free somewhere on the web?

    Amazon doesn't care if the book is available elsewhere unless you put it in Kindle Unlimited.  If you're in KU they expect exclusivity, but they don't care if it *used* to be available online.  As long as he un-shared the Google Doc, it's not an issue.

  I still find the apocalyptic war between Earth and Mars unlikely and unnecessary.
