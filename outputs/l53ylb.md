  Nell's mom is the perfect example of why Paragon should be shut down.

  Anyways, it looks like the Council of the Wise got what they wanted out of Commonplace's revolution. I think Grace destroyed the only record of Christina's testimony that they didn't kill Parliament, so it's going ot be hard to fight that.

  I really like this as... not the conclusion of Wes' arc, because it's clear there's still more to come for him, but the conclusion of this part of his arc. Ana's arc has always been about the ideals Paragon claims to represent, but Wes' arc has been much more concerned with the reality of Paragon and what it's like to live as a part of that system. So as much as it sucks to see the gang split up and Tasia returning to poverty (and I really hope we haven't seen the last of her), it's very fitting that Wes returns to his old life now. It makes all his growth so much more apparent and forces him to confront things that he's thus far ignored by tunnel visioning (heh) on his goal of returning to this life. I really couldn't stand Wes at the beginning, but seeing him here makes me appreciate how much he's changed and makes me realize how much I actually like him now.

  I'm entirely unsurprised that Paragon is learning all the wrong lessons from this failed revolution. Furthering the inequality and formalizing the defacto caste system by reviving the Conclave of the Wise, eliminating all dissenting voices by nationalizing the press, going to war with the Shenti to use them as a scapegoat, etc. It's like they looked at all the conditions and practices that led to the rise of Commonplace and said "clearly we need more of this."

  On a related note, I can't help but laugh at the fact that the challenger won both of the Ebbridge Ousting fights. While Ousting is supposed to reward the best, most talented person with a Paragon education, it sure seems like that spot at Paragon is more of a punishment than a prize. Doubly so considering it comes bundled with a life as Rowyna Ebbridge's daughter, which... yeah. You'd think the fact that her "daughter" lost the Ousting both times would prompt some introspection and cause her to wonder why that happened, but just like the nation she serves, Admiral Ebbridge seems to have learned all the wrong lessons.

    On the contrary, Paragon is learning the exact right lessons from this. That the veneer of equality and democratic ideals are insufficient to keep the lower classes in line, and are ultimately more trouble than they're worth. While serving no purpose to the Epistocrat's except to make them feel better. It's in their best interest to drop the pretense and rule by force, and to expand and conquer to fuel a new golden age (for them) via pillage and exploitation.

    Remember that Rome lasted for 400 years (an extra 1000 if you count Byzantium) after it's last vestiges of republican government fell away. One of the worst things about authoritarianism and imperialism is that they actually work, and can make civilizations and the people who rule them rich and powerful. At the expense of basically everyone else.

      I wrote an over-the-top effort post in response to this where I talked at length about how imperial Rome actually addressed a lot of social and economic problems ignored during the republic period (and how Augustus was absolutely _adored_ by the plebian assembly until he abolished it), and some historical examples about how governments don't have to be egalitarian to avoid being overthrown but generally _do_ have to keep the educated classes happy with nice things... But I hit the backspace key on the page instead of the reply window and lost the whole thing, lmao.

      Here's the short(er) version.

      Ruling by force only works so long as you have most of the people who wield force on your side. Usually, this means you need the military, bureaucracy, and critical components of industry to be afforded some influence at minimum. But if you want a developed, post-industrial economy like the Principality to work, you also need the professional class to feel happy and comfortable, otherwise they'll develop class solidarity with the working class and organize them to overthrow you. 

      The big advantage Paragon has that sets it apart from real-world despotic regimes is that its ruling class all have mind control powers, but they completely squander this by excluding the majority of projectors in the first place, as we see in Ana's second chapter. This is a terrible way to do your caste system - you can't run a magocracy where you _don't let in most of the mages._ If your whole society is built on a pretense of projectors being special, and then you turn around and insist the majority live in squalor with the plebs, then for every Ana you get who'll suck up in the vain hope you'll let her into your special club, you'll get two Clementines who'd rather burn the whole thing down. Maybe it worked before a whole bunch of projection manuscripts leaked, but that genie is out of the bottle.

      In the story, Commonplace is depicted as having taken advantage of both of these, having a strong economic power base and a massive pool of projectors by drawing from these two critical groups. Even if it wants to double down on being an authoritarian nightmare-realm, the lesson Paragon needed to have learned from this whole event was to find a way to make them content. Basically: 

      - Give less talented projectors a place in your regime, even if it's not as part of the ruling class. The ones which are ambitious enough for hardcore self-improvement already have class mobility in the form of applying for Paragon. All you need is to give the ones who'd be happy with a comfortable life something to do that makes them feel better than the average humdrum, and some limited means to participate in projector society, and they'd identify with you far more than they do with them.

      - Redistribute a _little_ wealth from the Epistocrats to the professional classes, and especially the military, so that they feel more class solidarity with you than they do with the workers. Even if you can brainwash them every time they make a stink, having a developed economy depends upon stability, which depends upon an educated populace that's at least is kind of invested in the idea of the country.

      - Stop doing horrible things to your own citizens and creating populist ammunition for no reason! Like, abducting the victims of Buttercup Lodge from the capital of your _own country_ is textbook shitting-where-you-eat. Use political prisoners or slaves or something the average person won't relate to! This is _basic_ evil empire stuff, here.

      Though, this is assuming the whole government of the Principality isn't just a smash-and-grab because they know the world's about to end.

  Okay, no, Rowyna Ebbridge needs to die. Fast  and tidy. This chapter is fucked up in so many ways.

  It's cool that Wes is staying sober for at least a little longer, though.

  By the way, I really hope Max didn't actually commit suicide.

  Once, because she's an amazing character and I want to see more of her, two, because I want to know what the deal with the parallel realities is, three, because *holy shit* that would be bleak.
