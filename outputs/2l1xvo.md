  I had to drop back in time and reread the previous chapter to understand what was going on with the various rooms, but I finally got it. Clever plan; Bones is one smart lady. Also, I keep wanting to hear her say "Damnit, Albus, I'm a cop, not a botanist!"  (Or whatever.)

  I liked how you had Cedric's success at the TPC inspire Padma.  I wonder if that sort of inspiration is an effect of the spell, or was that all her? Either way is great, but I rather like the idea that it was all her. 

  Harry's great realization about how maybe past deaths could be averted took me by surprise. I mean...duh. If your goal is to destroy Death then how could that NOT include retroactive resurrections?

    In HPMOR-cannon, Harry only really gets that idea when [HPMoR ](#s "Hermione dies"). I think most people who plan to overcome death think of getting around aging and disease, and maybe backing everyone up in computers - going back in time and getting back every person who ever died is a few factors of impossibility greater.

  One of the interesting deviations from MoR is that Professor Verres is much more rational here.

    I'm inclined to agree, but I would also say that this story branch places him in situations in which he cannot gain in any way from exercising his parental irrationality. 
    I mean.. There is a war on. However brief it may end up, the whole situation with the Dementors can rightfully be viewed as war, with billions of lives at stake. Harry is one of the few people who can prevail in this war.
    Until the situation is thoroughly remedied, anyone at all could die -- including the people capable of casting True Patroni.

    That is an extremely sobering situation -- I wouldn't expect anyone to act as normal.

      That's not what I meant, and I wouldn't consider that behavior particularly irrational anyway. What I meant was this: in MoR, he's very stuck in his Hardcore Skeptic worldview, and here he seems to have adapted more or less effortlessly. Not that he understand everything, but basic MoR Prof. Verres would be having a lot more 'you turned into a cat' moments.

  Why exactly did the posts of this story skip from 17 to 98 and keep climbing up from there?

    ```
    ? They started at 81.

- u/RMcD94:
  ```
  If dementors are products of expectations how did they form initially and why do they behave the same way for those without expectations as those with, for example Harry reaction on the train in the prisoner of askaban. And what if you set up someones expectation that dementors spawn infinite gold or something

    > And what if you set up someones expectation that dementors spawn infinite gold or something

    Bwahaha.  Write a best-selling series of books where a girl falls in love with a sparkly dementor and a werewolf...
    ```

  - u/Gauntlet:
    ```
    What if Harry creates the dementors? They are the system which copies a person's soul so they can be given an immortal body in the future.

    As to why they create a sense of unease and visions of death it could be an unavoidable part of their design. Or a warning system. "This is what you will avoid". 

    Why the true patrons destroys them: if people believe they are immortal or have succeeded in obtaining immortality the dementors switch off and disappear.
