  ```
  This was the smoothest chapter of the last several. The fewest amount of typos, the prose felt good, the characters were more alive, the tensions were believable. I'm not sure what changed, but I really enjoyed the overall quality of this chapter a lot more than a few previous ones. Is this just me?

  If it isn't, what's the reason? Wasn't this chapter delayed a week? Maybe /u/nobody103 should take the extra week of editing more often. Anyway, whatever it was, I hope it continues!
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    I think it's simply due to the nature of the chapter. 100% character interaction based, which was how MoL started and went for almost 2 arcs.
    ```

    - u/PurposefulZephyr:
      ```
      Besides the focus on character interaction, it was... oddly nostalgic.

      We have Daimen finally meeting his family, having some uncomfortable truths revealed about him, and Zorian admitting that he was wrong about him.

      We have Taiven finally returning, and kind of restarting their friendship, resolving old issues between them.

      I'd say it was a somewhat special chapter, as it went back in more ways than one.
      ```

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        I'd like to think my [review](#s "There was a point where I felt like the amazing character development via time loop in the first arc wasn't happening anymore. Probably 2nd arc since Alanic and Lukav are kind of bland. But classmates and new characters are popping up again, yay! I know you said somewhere that there would be no romance, but I'm really glad you put in some mild dating scenes and interactions with the opposite gender because it really added some life to Zorian, who's been somewhat of a robot going through the motions. Especially since the scope of the story exploded and he's been thrust into the save-the-world/Cyoria burden.") in c69 begging for more time loop character development had some sway! (excerpt in spoiler)

        But judging by how fitting Taiven's date acceptance was and knowing the author loves throwing Chekhov's guns everywhere, I'm betting it was planned in advance.

        These kinds of chapters are what drew me into MoL in the first place. If I had to explain, it's probably the appeal of using a time loop in a wholesome way to gradually understand people on a level deeper than you could if you only had one chance - who hasn't fantasized about a redo for a chat, a meeting, or even whole years of life? And of course, it's been a pleasure following Zorian the sourpuss as he repairs relationships and achieves some measure of self-actualization.
        ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        Agreed. This chapter will likely stand out to me in retrospect . . 

        Then again, a lot of chapters in MoL are extremely memorable.
        ```

  - u/Aravan:
    ```
    The previous two chapters were also delayed IIRC.
    ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      The previous chapter was delayed 1 week. This one was "delayed" because the original estimate was only 2 weeks after the last chapter, and the "delay" brought it to the usual schedule of 3 weeks between chapters.
      ```

  - u/appropriate-username:
    ```
    All the chapters are good but yeah I did appreciate there being fewer typos and stuff actually happening and characters developing. Some chapters are consumed by huge battles which don't actually progress the story much because even if something is learned after, obviously most of the results of the actual battle don't carry over to the next chapter. Zorian's relationships with those around him leave an effect on him so it's something that's permanent.
    ```

  - u/notintractable:
    ```
    I think it's because the chapter didn't have as much action in it.  Truthfully,  words are not the best way to convey fights, and /u/nobody103 isn't exactly a prodigy at writing them either.  But he's pretty good at writing the SOL-like stuff.
    ```

    - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
      ```
      Huh, I’ve actually been liking his way of describing fight scenes, so far.

      In many other stories I often find myself criticising the style in which fights are being described — as well as the actual events themselves happening during the fights. Here, the underlying magical system feels well-balanced for powering fight scenes, and the actions [\(or inactions\)](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry) of the combatants aren’t deliberately made stupid for the sake of plot-railroading, etc.

      If you know any stories that manage to present even better fights than MoL does, can you please drop them as recommendations? I really like myself some good fight scenes. ._.
      ```

      - u/SevereCircle:
        ```
        I also like MoL's fight scenes.

        Worm did them well. They were a bit too frequent, but they were good. Especially the Endbringer fights.
        ```

        - u/appropriate-username:
          ```
          +1 for worm. The frequency of the fights is part of what made me like the story, since that was a part of how [mild spoiler](#s "nothing ever really got better for the protagonists throughout the whole story.") I had fun figuring out and reading about how the above would continue to be true.
          ```

      - u/Friedoobrain:
        ```
        Well it's a completely different style of fantasy but I think the best fights I've read are the ones in Joe Abercrombie's books. Both the trilogy and the standalones have really fluid fight scenes.

        In a more puply vein, I also enjoyed the fight scenes in Will Wight's Traveler's Gate series. THe rest of the writings quality is... debatable.

        Mind you none of these are rational in any way shape or form.
        ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        I second the desire for good fight scene examples. I don't like fight scenes that much, but I like seeing things done well. Lol
        ```

- u/SometimesATroll:
  ```
  Anyone else really want to know what's up with Fortov now?  There's almost certainly something up.

  Shot-in-the-dark hypothesis:  He's trying to use rituals/potions/blood magic to make himself less of a failure of a mage, causing bouts of rage as a side effect.  This resulted in his anger at Daimen (or maybe he interrupted a ritual) and the pushing of whatshername.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    I've said it quite some time ago that Zorian makes peace with his family members. So for me it's out of the question whether Fortov spills the beans some time in the future. He will. The *real* question is whether the Kazinski Daddy issue will be resolved and how.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The **__real__** question is whether  Kazinski Daddy issues are worth resolving.
      ```

      - u/bludvein:
        ```
        This. Not sure his relationship with good old dad is even worth salvaging considering his total condescension that time Zorian fell into a coma from getting mauled mentally by the aranea. Fortov might be worth reconnecting to, but the parents deserve their fate.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          I disagree in a sense. I think the father is a jerk and should be avoided in the end, however Zorian may get useful insights into his family by trying to really understand each of his family members. The rationale is, like it or not, a person is often shaped in major ways by their family. It can deepen Zorian's self-understanding and give him perspective to learn more about his parents.
          ```

        - u/Teal_Thanatos:
          ```
          I don't even remember which chapter that was from
          ```

          - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
            ```
            Chapter 035

            > Interestingly, this was the first time since he got stuck in the time loop that he had spoken to his father again. It only took a single snide comment about his 'weak, fainting son' for him to remember why. If he was lucky, this would be the last restart he had to interact with the man.

            (A while back, I made a spreadsheet that pulls every chapter into a searchable text.)
            ```

            - u/Teal_Thanatos:
              ```
              that's impressive and cool
              ```

            - u/appropriate-username:
              ```
              Why a spreadsheet? If you just want searchable text, you can just copy the HTML into word.
              ```

              - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
                ```
                True. But with a google spreadsheet, I can:

                1. Automate the copying and extraction of the HTML.
                2. Put it in the cloud, which means it's easily searchable from my phone, which is where I usually use reddit.
                3. Write formulas to bring together in one place all paragraphs containing the search term. MoL is a large document, so going all around it is more difficult than a document containing containing every paragraph with the word "father", for example.
                ```

                - u/appropriate-username:
                  ```
                  Fair enough.
                  ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        The **real, real** question is #KazinskiDadddyAsRR.
        ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    Ibery.

    But we know that Fortov's pretty terrible at alchemy, and blood magic is rare enough that it's also very unlikely. Rituals are a possibility though, I guess. Doubt it, but it's possible. Also possible that Fortov has similar expertise in alchemy to Zach's, being an expert in a few specific areas but lacking general knowledge and expertise.
    ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    This is a better hypothesis than the nothing I've come up with to explain his aberrant behavior. Definitely some kind of sketchy project would explain the unwillingness let Daimen into his dormitory.

    I'm skeptical of blood magic as it's both rare and extreme. Potions from an source, though? Maybe. Fortov may have something similar to ADHD, so his difficulties may be a deep and consuming part of his life.
    ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
    ```
    I feel like there was a minor case of [PoorCommunicationKills](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills) in this chapter in Fortov’s regard. 

    I mean, sure, it’s completely in-character for Zorian to not have a slightest clue about Fortov’s reaction, but wouldn’t he at least ask Damien to describe Fortov’s behaviour (the specific things Fortov has said, etc) a bit more?
    ```

    - u/cfusion25:
      ```
      I mean, I don't think Zorian cares. His expectations for his family is pretty much non-existent. In his mind, Fortov's actions are just confirming Zorian's mental image of him. A crappy mage with his only skill being his ability to socialize. Who has suffered living in Damien's shadow as much or more than Zorian. His hostile response probably made sense in Zorian's mind and he felt no need to pursue it. Zorian doesn't even check to make sure Fortov survives the invasion night, why would he care to check on his mental stability.
      ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      Agreed. This oversight was pretty glaring.
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    I was thinking he was Red Robe for a moment because he wanted to make sure he never interacted with Zorian. But then I realized why that made no sense at all.
    ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  Yeah, they do a lot of crazy stuff indeedy.

  Zach is the heir of the emperor's line, isn't he? 

  And it was an amazingly sweet chapter. Personally I'm not a fan of combat-heavy ones, which we are bound to have more an more as we approach the finale.
  ```

  - u/over_who:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure that he is the most direct heir, so the question is does the Sovereign's Gate stamp his soul when the loop is about to start, or are the souls of all possible heirs stamped and one is brought in on priority?
    ```

  - u/HPMOR_fan:
    ```
    Interesting idea that the Orb may be reacting to Zach because of who he is, not because of the marker. That would mean he'd be able to do it outside the loop as well.

    I agree the non-combat chapters are interesting. I do like it when more happens though. I'm waiting for them to take the Orb to the Gate. Maybe they won't need to bring all 5 keys in one restart. Also strange they didn't ask for Xvim's help with the Orb.
    ```

  - u/SevereCircle:
    ```
    I like the combat heavy ones too, there's just less to discuss about them.
    ```

  - u/TheAtomicOption:
    ```
    I really like the combat heavy ones, but these ones are good too. I'm kinda head over heals about this story in general though and have a hard time thinking of any serious criticisms.
    ```

- u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
  ```
  Firstly, great character interactions and dialogues in this chapter. And I think the recent delays were likely partially aimed to make their choices look smoother in chapters like this, and partially to prepare the scenery for Koth as a new ”unlocked area”.

  >You're fortunate you have the Taramatula family to shield you from all this while we figure out what to do.”

  They could’ve been the ones to have leaked it in the first place.

  >“Oh, so you can create a simulacrum too?” Ulanna asked casually

  And for some reason Ulanna creeps me out almost as much as [Pariston Hill](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/16/281558.jpg) did, from [HxH.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter?from=Anime.HunterXHunter)

  >You mentioned the notebooks you're carrying across restarts for Xvim and the others. As it happens, I've taken the time to talk with Xvim yesterday. 

  Also, in the possible subset of manuipulative!Damien fanfics, this could be him faking an improved attitude because of the awareness of the encroaching restart erasure. He realises that his current version will die if he doesn’t actively take the initiative to stay in Zorian’s awareness circle, so he does his best to not get pushed out of it, while he has the chance, and to build a positive reputation with Zorian.
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    Re Manipulative Daimen, I agree, however his interactions with Orissa lead me believe the personality he is showing is genuine.
    ```

    - u/serge_cell:
      ```
      Successful manipulative people are successful because their feelings almost always genuine. They develop ability to change vector of their genuine feelings in whatever direction they feel beneficial to them
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        That's a very good point. What I rather mean, however, is that his personality seems consistent. We've seen him act kind of pouty, both in front of Orissa and other Kothans (?) as well as alone with Zorian. If that was an emotional change of vector, I feel she'd have reacted differently and Zorian would have picked up on it.
        ```

  I give it a week before Zach bounces into the room, saying, "Hey Zorian! The Taramatula were totally right about all the overpowered magical guardians and deathtraps in the orb! That was awesome!"

  Every chapter I wait for the Silverlake tie in, and every chapter I end up disappointed. 

  Honestly I love these chapters with minimal plot progression, it means that we are only inching towards the end, and while the wait is harrowing, I will not complain about more Mother of Learning.

    >Honestly I love these chapters with minimal plot progression, it means that we are only inching towards the end, and while the wait is harrowing, I will not complain about more Mother of Learning.

    It's such an incredibly rare thing when that happens. The only other story I remember feeling that for was Spice and Wolf. 

    It'll be so very bittersweet when MoL ends.
    ```

    - u/cretan_bull:
      ```
      Hopefully there will be fanfiction after it ends.

      nobody103 has done an extraordinarily good job with worldbuilding and the magic system is extremely well thought out. As a fictional setting, I think MoL is unusually well suited to fanfiction or RPG campaigns.

        I'd say there's room for sequels in the same setting without time loops.

    Z&Z should show up to Silverlake holding the orb. There is no way she  would ignore that sight. And then they should trade the orb for her knowledge of dimentionalism. They generally should trade the orb for knowledge in subsequent restarts.

    Honestly though, even if Zorian returns to Silverlake with a basket of spider eggs, she's just gonna shrug and send him for some jackalope droppings or snipe beaks or something.

          You don't have to kill him, just disconnect his soul from whatever body he is currently using. He's probably basically impossible to kill, having had a thousand years to prepare defences and also having blessings from multiple gods.

  - u/TheAtomicOption:
    ```
    haha yeah I've definitely been looking forward to that too. Soul Magic in general is definitely one area where Zorian has some major levelups left to get and Silverlake was introduced as one of the people who might help with that. 

    It's pretty clear that the Silverlake arc can't be completed until Zach & Zorian figure out how to cleanly kill the grey hunter, so reading the recent chapter about them fighting it (and still losing) was pretty exciting. I'm kinda surprised they haven't figured it out yet. You'd think a high powered gun or something would let them do it. 

    Given the difficulty of and general lateness-in-the-story of getting Silverlake's help, my bet is on Silverlake being the one to *finally* provide Zorian with a way to get Soul Sight that doesn't require waiting 15 years outside the loop. Soul Sight really seems like something that any respectable archmage should get as it unlocks an *entire new branch* of rare and powerful magic.

    hehe This one will definitely have the most tension and possibly the most potential for things to go places. But longer term I really liked Raynee for the love interest.

    I keep asking myself this but how did Zorian ended up hanging out with Taiven  ? who's 2 years older, for someone as anti social as Zorian who doesn't even really know people from his class, it just seemed out of nowhere, was it ever explained ?
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Well, I don't think it's been fully explained, but it wouldn't be that hard for them to come in contact somehow during his first two years. And she apparently likes form-fitting clothes :D and was nice to him (relatively), so even Zorian wasn't going to just ignore her.

- u/MereInterest:
  ```
  There's nothing in the current chapter that points to this, but there's a theory I've been playing around with since going through a complete reread.  I haven't seen this idea floating around, and wanted to discuss it.

  Red Robe is the original time traveler, not Zach.

  This would explain why the time loop was started a month prior to the solstice, rather than at the solstice when it would be most efficient.  If the time loop were started by Red Robe, he would naturally start it early, so that he could optimize the invasion prior to the solstice and the priomordial-unleashing ritual.

  This theory isn't perfect by any means.  Quatach-Ichl seems unaware of the time loop and dismissive of Red Robe, when we see them near each other in Chapter 26.  As an expert on dimensional magic, as evidenced by his design of the Ibasan gate, I would expect him to be involved with the Sovereign Gate.  It also requires additional details to explain how Zach became attached to the time loop.
  ```

  - u/HPMOR_fan:
    ```
    I think Zach is the original but RR may have initiated it. The Gate only works with certain bloodlines, so RR needed to bring Zach into it. But since pre-loop RR is aware of this, he started each loop with the knowledge until he was able to figure out a way to duplicate the marker for himself. Zach also starts each loop in his bed which would be a strange place to start if you initiated the loop intentionally.
    ```

    - u/MereInterest:
      ```
      >The Gate only works with certain bloodlines

      Do you have a reference for this?  I remember there being a discussion that Zach has many social advantages that he can use to take better advantage of the time loop, but I don't recall there being a limitation to certain bloodlines.
      ```

      - u/over_who:
        ```
        We don't understand exactly how the gate works, but the above is heavily implied by the fact that the Sovereign Gate was in the possession of the Noveda family.
        ```

      - u/HPMOR_fan:
        ```
        No, this is my guess. I don't think there as been much said about who can use the Gate.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          Well, we know that anyone with the mark can participate in the Gate mechanism. For this reason, I don't think the Gate works purely or even partially along blood lines.
          ```

          - u/HPMOR_fan:
            ```
            But how does one get the original mark? It's intended for there to be only one marked person at a time, but it can be hacked. Maybe it doesn't work by bloodlines, but the Gate was being stored in the Noveda estate until it was sold or given away by the caretaker. That would be a pretty big coincidence if a Noveda just happened to become marked and enter the Gate after it was just taken from his family's storage.
            ```

            - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
              ```
              I don't necessarily disagree with anything you're saying except that I feel it's just as possible for people to take pride in the bloodline idea, and thus ensure an heir like Zach (if he is an heir) gets a marked applied.

              The reason why I say Zach may not necessarily be a direct heir (though I do lean in that direction) is because the Gate could have come into his family's possession in any number of ways. To give just one example, perhaps Zach's ancestors were friends with the last heir and before the last heir died, he decided to give the Gate to the Novedas rather than let the government take custody.
              ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    Unlikely, for the same reasons as mentioned repeatedly in the story. Zach never experienced a premature restart ending without his death before the early invasion (bar a few occasions where being assassinated is equally likely but unconfirmed), and he has a more complete version of the marker than Zorian has. If Red Robe had the same kind of marker, he could have easily tracked both Zorian and Zach with a similar ritual as the one Zorian learned from Alanic, and he could have immediately confirmed that there was just one new time traveler, and not the dozens of members of the Aranea colony. There would also have been essentially no reason to keep Zach as intact and free as he was, or to even include him in the time loop at all, if he wasn't related. And why would the Noveda hold an Imperial artifact like the Sovereign Gate in their treasury in the first place, if they weren't from the lineage of the First Emperor?

    The most likely scenario is the stated one. Zach is the original time traveler, who eventually encountered Red Robe. Red Robe found a way to tag along, and pressed Zach for all the information he knew about the time loop. Red Robe then removed Zach's memory of the early restarts, of all time loop-related information, as well as of any encounters he may have had with Red Robe, and placed sanctions on his mind to distract him from thinking certain things.

    Zach would have never been involved in the time loop if he weren't the original time traveler. And the reason the Imperial artifacts respond to him better than Zorian is probably because Zach's lineage traces directly to the First Emperor, which would also explain why he was the one chosen for the time loop.
    ```

    - u/MereInterest:
      ```
      Most of those depend on the particulars of how the time loop interacts with the marker, which we don't know yet.  Regarding the premature restarts, it would depend on how the loop decides that it needs to restart.  It could be either "No Marked individuals are alive." or "A Marked individual has died."  In the latter case, if Red Robe has a complete marker, either Zach's death or Red Robe's death could restart the loop, but Red Robe had not died prematurely.

      Similarly, the tracking ritual may fail due to minor issues as well.  It tracks all copies of the reference object, not all copies of the marker.  When Zorian's fragmented marker is used as the reference, it finds those fragments as part of the complete marker.  When Red Robe's complete marker is used as a reference, it does not find Zorian's fragmented marker, because it is looking for a complete copy.  This is completely untested, but would fit with how the ritual is described.

      As to why Zach exists, I could imagine him as an intentionally antagonistic creation.  That is, Red Robe creating one additional time traveler in order to throw a wrench in plans, in order to test them against unforeseen circumstances.  We know that the invaders have additional allies in summoned demons outside the loop, and so a deliberate random element is a useful thing for testing.  Alternatively, Red Robe may be a cultist-Zach who created an ensouled protagonist-simulacrum-Zach in order to take care of mundane duties.  I'm iffy on why Zach exists if Red Robe is the original, and don't have a good answer for it.

      I'm not convinced that ownership of Imperial artifacts has any major information content.  Given the Splinter Wars, I would be surprised if major artifacts weren't scattered around.

      Thank you for the critique.  I am not entirely sold on the idea of Red Robe being the original, so I wanted to get more eyes on it.  It explains the timing of the loop with the invasion, but raises other issues.
      ```

    - u/Cheese_Ninja:
      ```
      For the moment I'm still going with RR being a Veyers who is merged/possessed by a far older entity that actually had knowledge of the Gate prior to the 1 month early activation of the loops. I've been running with "a fire elemental/spirit from the result of the ritual to activate his Boranova bloodline".

      But for some reason he himself wasn't capable of gaining the original Controller marker, so had to allow Zach to be the true Controller, but still had some method of faking the marker or entering the loop.

      The timing of Veyer's disappearance is too coincidental, and the fact that despite all of Zorian and Zach's efforts, he was impossible to find means that it wasn't simple either. If he was dead or killed or soulkilled, they still probably should have been able to find some evidence unless there was heavy warding done or a pocket dimension involved.

      One of the rules the Guardian gave was that 2 Controller markers were impossible. They couldn't be given inside the loop by the normal method, only by whatever stroke of luck Zorian had with the Lich's attack. Outside the loop they could be given by either the Maker or one of its Agents, but that would delete/override the former Controller Marker.
      ```

  - u/over_who:
    ```
    My current red robe theory is that RR is actually a cultist, or at least is affiliated with them. RR is the specialist mage the invasion is using for dimensionalism, and is responsible for creating the ritual to free the primordial. However, at some point he realized that he was in a pocket dimension b/c of something Zach did. Then, he befriends Zach, and gets one of the deranged invader-aligned soul mages (either Sudomir or Quatach-Ichl) to alter his soul and give him the stamp. He wipes zach, leaving the false trails.
    ```

    - u/TheAtomicOption:
      ```
      One thing we still don't know a ton about is Soul Sight. Remember in Ch46 when Zorian first invaded the Sudomir's northern mansion? When he reached in to flip his marker's reset switch Sudomir *saw him do it* and asked what he was doing. 

      Given Red Robe's Soul Kill ability it's extremely likely that he also has Soul Sight. If his ability is strong enough, he may have been able to just *see* Zach's marker and learn enough from that to be able to join the loop.
      ```

      - u/zeropriority:
        ```
        Your theory sounds plausible to me

        As for the soul sight,a quote from chapter 026:
        >You are shielding yourself from divinations," Red Robe said in his distorted voice. "Good. At least you're smarter than that fool Zach. Can you believe that even after all these decades in the time loop he still hasn't learned how to hide himself from the most childish of locator spells? You, on the other hand, have been in the time loop for, what? Three, four years? And you already know how to shield yourself from my soul perception."
        ```

        - u/renegadeduck:
          ```
          Huh. How does he know how long Zorian has been in the time loop?

          I suppose he might have seen changes that weren't made by Zach and didn't seem to be the result the supposed Aranean loopers.
          ```

          - u/Cheese_Ninja:
            ```
            I always found that bit interesting as well, but I'm pretty sure how RR guessed the start of Zorian's inclusion into the loops. Remember how Zach was missing completely in loops 2-8? We've never had an explanation for that, so the only real options I've come up with are either (1) a mechanism of the Marker/Gate to isolate and protect the Controller after suffering soul damage or (2) someone was hiding Zach away, possibly even preventing him from waking up earlier.

            Also, RR's "soulkill" ability shouldn't be taken as proof as his prowess with soul magic/as a necromancer, since that was a loop-specific altering spell. On the other hand, his ability to create an apparent simulacra can be taken as evidence to his abilities, and his statement about soul sight (although RR may have been lying and located Zorian through other means.).
            ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Actually it'd make sense if he didn't realize it from something Zach did. What if he noticed something was off like the priests do. And because he specialized in dimensionalism he was able to form a guess. And zach's screaming I'm a time travel attracted him when he'd otherwise be more skeptical. Or if Zach's broadcasting himself as a time traveler caused an Epiphany. And RR to become interested in him.

    ```
    It's been so long since that was the hot topic, but didn't the Controller (i.e. RR) leave the loop? And shouldn't that instakill his future incarnations in the loops like with the Aranea?
    ```

    - u/notintractable:
      ```
      It's either that he gets instakilled or switches places with self in the real world.  So it leaves open the possibility!
      ```

      - u/Menolith:
        ```
        Fortov interacted with Zorian consistently at the beginning too, didn't he?

        If he were Red Robe, he'd have to put up an extremely impressive act to keep his appearances and actions unchanging across restarts. Simulacra can't get around that requirement.
        ```

    - u/TheAtomicOption:
      ```
      I don't think Fortov is RR, but ...

      I still think the "insta-kill" is more just telling the gate "don't recreate this item on the next restart". There's no reason to suspect that leaving would cause this to happen since we learned from the gate itself that the loop wasn't designed to continue operating after the user leaves. When the user leaves, their soul is copied into their outside world body. There's nothing about that process which tells us whether that would necessarily remove the original soul from the simulation. The simulation isn't expected to keep running so we're already well into areas that the original creators weren't planning for. Frankly it's a testament to the design (and they're just darn lucky) that it's "failing" gracefully enough not to just destroy them.
      ```

      - u/kuilin:
        ```
        Just destroying them would be the opposite of the machine failing its intended goal... The arguably "best" way (with respect to the creators' goals) is to halt immediately after the controller exits, regardless if other controllers are in the loop.
        ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    Holy fuck. Has Fortov bothered Zorian even once since RR left the time loop about the purple creeper salve? Zorian seems to believe that being at Imaya's is enough to discourage Fortov, but it might be because he just no longer looks for Zorian.

    Not sure if that's indicative of anything, though. Might be that Zorian's right and Fortov's just being discouraged of looking for him, might be that the changes to Cyoria with the death of the Aranea changes the events enough that Ibery no longer gets pushed down in purple creepers (can't remember if we've heard about it even once since Zorian's been back from Knyazov Dveri). But if it's no longer happening, then it could indicate a change in Fortov.
    ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    I considered this, however it doesn't seem likely to me that Fortav would push Ibery into a bush every single restart, then ask Zorian for help each time. But maybe it's all a diversion. Has he continued do this even after RR left?

    He is perhaps one of the few people at the academy that Zorian has not investigated in-depth.
    ```

    - u/notintractable:
      ```
      Well, my theory about this is that potentially the invasion needs something Ibery has, and Fortov throws her into the weeds as a distraction to get something from her.  In addition, when Zorian says he pushes her in every time, is this from his previous experience at the beginning of the story or has he actually observed this in every restart?  I doubt that Zorian would notice this event without Fortov coming to bug him.
      ```

- u/4bpp:
  ```
  > Daimen gave Zorian a meaningful look. Though Zorian didn't know for sure what he was trying to tell him, he could guess. While finding a way to operate the orb without a marker was not a priority for him and Zach, it would mean a lot for Daimen. He was probably well aware that Zorian had no intention whatsoever of revealing his abilities to Daimen outside the time loop, which would make those control spells absolutely crucial to his mission. Without them, even removing the orb from its resting place would be impossible, greatly complicating everything.

  If Zorian does not reveal his abilities to Daimen outside of the time loop, how or why would he reveal the control spells for the orb to him, and what benefit is there for Daimen-inside-the-loop (the instance which knows about Zorian's abilities, no less) to figure out the control spells?

  (I suppose this connects to a more general issue: among the people who accept the time loop at face value, why don't we see at least some instances of apathy or at least some degree of similar behavioural adjustment or suspension of long-term plans as they realise that what they are doing is entirely inconsequential?)

  GREAT chapter ! =) Really enjoyed it... was a bit worried because the last few chapter focused so much on the plot progression , and the actual character development seemed to get stuck, but now this chapter changed that again ^^ please more like it.
  The way Zorian will interact with old friends and his family after the timeloop is very important so i want to see what he will make with it. The story about Fortov and Ibery, his friendship with the almost forgotten Benisek, Taiven, Akoja (one of the most developed characters but with not much involvement in the plot is actually interesting) ,maybe even a story involving Byrn Ivarin (i doubt it), maybe another story consulting the librarian searching for books (should be very easy to get a high level pass now) etc...

  Was the whole "teach me to control the orb" thing suspicious as hell to anyone else, or is it just me? It seems that learning to control the orb is similar to learning to replicate the effect of having the marker on your soul. 

  Combined with Daimen's private time with Fortrov and Kiri (and his perpetual mind blank), the whole chapter appears like it's foreshadowing future shenanigans on his part. Daimen is definitely on my radar.

    Actually, I think teaching Daimen how to control the orb may be practice for when they need to control the sovereign gate.
    If Zorian can learn what he can control without the marker, then he can learn how to trick the Guardian to giving him "higher loop control functions" like "soul kill".

  No no no! Bad Zorian! Don't leave your simulacrum running for several times longer than advised, and definitely not in a location where it's going to be bored silly and will likely get up to no good!

  I seriously keep waiting for this simulacrum situation to blow up somehow...
  ```

  - u/nytelios:

    I'm thinking Zorian's pretty confident in his self-awareness and all the empirical evidence from his summons so far that he feels safe leaving his simulacrums to their own devices.

    lol There are clearly dates. I suspect that "won't write romance" mostly just means that any romance which happens won't become a focus of the story, and we won't be forced to read a ton of dialogue where they talk or agonize over how they feel about each other or what the other one thinks of them. 

    Which I'm super happy about because Twilight sucked. I wouldn't be surprised if there's still *some* romance in the sense that we see a date or two, and we're just told in a sentence or two about any relationship status updates there are. It'd include romance in the way that PG-13 movies include sex--it just goes to a shot outside the house with just the bedroom light on after a kiss.
    ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      Exactly. The romance is unlikely to go far, because Zorian would probably feel that it'd just be torture to develop feelings for someone and then having that person forget all their time together the next day.

      By the end of the Raynie arc, it was pretty much obvious that she'd developed feelings for him, since he'd become so reliable and a source of comfort for her. But it's very unlikely that their relationship will be explored further before the time loop ends, unless Zorian decides to actually meet with her clan.

      The romance is in an episodal format, and never becomes a primary focus. And it's perfectly fine that way.
      ```

  - u/thrawnca:

    Sorta. She didn't confess love for him, and she'd already told him years ago that he's about her only friend. But yes, it looks like that experience got her thinking about just how far he's advanced.

    She thought they were fighting side by side, protecting each other, until it turned out he was so far above her level that he'd simply sent a copy of himself to protect her. That must have been a kick in the guts. As she said, he still cares about her wellbeing, but he's so skilled it's now in a *patronizing* way.

    It takes more than just the right planar conditions to trigger the gate. It needs an absolutely huge amount of mana that's accumulated over hundreds of years for each run. Even if for some reason he wanted another go he has zero hope of recharging the gate before the alignment passes.
