  Given that he can safely stand on top of a snow bank while other people have to trudge through, I think that this:

  > Suppose that Legolas has a mass of 60 kg

  ... is not a safe assumption. From the books:

  > With that [Legolas] sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the snow.

  I'm not sure how this ability works (they're probably not *actually* lighter, since that means a hit to their shield would send them flying) but it probably accounts for some of the giant dump that Legolas is taking on the laws of physics.

    Per *The Silmarilion* and other histories, elves basically have 'ignore physics' as an at-will power.

    All of the older elves left in Middle-Earth can leave their body somewhere while they explore as 'unclothed souls', heal by imparting a measure of immortality, see the future or past, craft impossible things, etc.

    Walking on snow, or up falling stones, is clearly impossible for humans (and shitty CGI).  For an elf it's simply a matter of living more in the nonphysical world for a few moments.

      [And this is why diplomacy between primarily-physical races and primarily-magical races is so damn difficult.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves)  They think we're basically Stone Age morons, and we basically think they're arrogant sods, and really the difference is ontological.

      Of course, the physicals tend to get the better end of the bargain as their species grows up.

    A wizard did it!

    I believe it was "explained" as elves have an exceptional sense of balance, and can adjust their stance when the snow underfoot moves, so they don't leave tracks, or some other applied phlebotnium like that.

      They have mystical snowshoes.

      But seriously, they probably have a x16 multiplier to area in the pressure equation.

    ```
    Perhaps Legolas's gravitational mass is less than his inertial mass.
    ```

  ```
  Luckily Legolas pretty much wasn't in the version of "The Hobbit" I saw. It was only four hours long and could probably have lost another hour without losing anything of value.

  The laws of physics also don't apply to his eyes: https://youtu.be/Rk2izv-c_ts
