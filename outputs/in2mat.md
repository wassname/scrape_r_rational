## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Scenario:

  1. In 20 years, a 20 km wide asteroid will slam into Earth.

  2. You, and only you, have Minecraft powers (survival mode Steve).

  3. Earth is normal, and other than the interaction with your powers and constructs, has normal physics and materials.

  How do you save humanity?

    A lot of this is going to depend on how normal physics would interact with minecraft physics.

    Infinite water/lava generators are interesting. Would lava buckets be a source of infinite energy? Would water from water sources be infinite showers that just "disappear" after contact with the ground?

    The maximum speed of a Minecraft flying machine is [3.33m/s](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/redstone-discussion-and/2199884-speeds-of-various-flying-machines).  Geosynchronous orbit is 35786km up, so you can fly there in 124 days. You'll want to use geosynchronous because you can't generate much lateral speed to enter other orbits, and because orbiting anywhere else is probably going to interact horribly with minecraft physics (which I assume are Earth-referential). It'd be faster to convince a space program to give you a lift, or to switch to a conventional-physics propulsion system once you're in space and back when you near your destination, if you can manage one of those.

    Long periods in space aren't really that big of a deal because of your absurd inventory capacity. You're going to be safe from radiation, micrometeors, and air leaks because the one of the easiest materials for you to build a hull out of is a meter thick chunk of solid rock. It might be tricky to find a source of air that stacks, but you can afford to just build a large enough farm to get oxygen from plants.

    Once you have a space station, set up a cobble generator and start expanding it. Maybe invite some scientists to use it for actual science.

    A minecraft explosion can only destroy blocks in a 16x16 area centered on the explosion, so only 8 out. So make a 10-block thick crash pad where the asteroid is expected to collide with your space station (btw, guess where you're putting your space station). Hopefully colliding with minecraft blocks means the asteroid has to follow minecraft rules. Otherwise you're going to want to hit the asteroid off-center to deflect it, but you'll need an awful lot of rock to do that, and it depends on how fast the asteroid is moving.

    Make a player tnt cannon to get out of orbit, bring sheets of metal to build off of, aim for the asteroid and make another cannon, decelerate eventually with another cannon. When I get there, blow it up. Minecraft explosions either drop blocks as harmless items or destroy it entirely, so there’s little risk of this making it worse.

    The problem is inventory though, I can’t bring enough TNT with me to blow up a 20k wide asteroid. But I could bring something else, like nukes, and maybe doing that way ahead of schedule would be fine? I did some quick math and I mining out the asteroid all by myself isn’t feasible, assuming the asteroid is roughly spherical.

    Actually, if I could make a regular nuke into a Minecraft nuke, nuking the asteroid directly would also work, and is a lot less involved.

  You have the power to transfer medical issues from other people to yourself. No backsies, no offloading your issues on others. You can heal naturally if it's something you could normally heal from. So if you heal an athlete's broken arm they can compete immediately and you can go through the normal fun procedure of healing a broken arm. You can't take on injuries you can't get - if you have an amputated arm you can't then break the bones in that arm. You can de-age someone by aging yourself the same number of years. You can do partial transfers where that would make sense.

  How do you squeeze the most out of this power? It can't be transferred, copied or studied to reveal the inner workings of the cosmos. You can prove you have it, but it's magic, and science cannae contain it.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:

    Depending on how fine grained you can be in choosing what ailments you take, it could be really good. Any ailment that is temporary and can be dealt with by a healthy human would be easily treated. Low blood sugar, low blood pressure, dehydration, fever, things like that. You're not going to feel *good*, but those things absent their causes are bearable, even if you pass out. You might be able to cancel some things out, like too high and low body fat content, if those count as things you can transfer. If the magnitude of the medical issue is conserved, you could heal children extremely well. Malnutrition would be a pretty good thing to treat for people who have medical problems eating food. Transferring the diseases of people with autoimmune disorders, or the various things that suppress your immune system like cancer drugs, would be extremely helpful, since they have a weakened ability to fight off otherwise minor diseases.

    For permanent stuff, you might be able to do a lot of good if diseases don't stack with each other. Sickle cell anemia is difficult to deal with, but there aren't really degrees of it, since it's a genetic thing. At the cost of having sickle cell anemia, you could cure everyone you can get in contact with it. Similarly with blindness, deafness, or whatever essentially binary affliction you can come up with, or when an overabundance of an affliction doesn't kill you. Though doing the above would make treating the shorter lasting things harder. Deafness + tinnitus would be a way of mitigating the effects of one condition with that of another, and you could probably come up with a bunch of things like that.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Good ideas. I would say you can take on a fever without taking whatever caused the body to respond with the fever, but you could only take binary things once. Like with not breaking an amputated arm, you can't give up your sight if you're blind. It would depend on the details of how the power worked, of course. Let's say you took on somebody's flu, moving all the viruses to your body. Well... You can still fit enough more viruses inside your body to take somebody else's flu as well... Although you'd have to consider that the number of viruses/bacteria inside you does affect the severity of the infection. In reality, doctors and nurses who catch diseases from patients often have more severe cases than random infectees, because they are around the infected person longer, so there is more time for the disease to spread, and they end up with a larger invasion force.
      ```

      - u/ricree:
        ```
        Can you do partial transfers? If so, there's a lot more that could be done with it.

        Going by your virus example, for instance, you could use a partial transfer to inoculate yourself by taking progressively larger doses. As you build up an immunity, you could eventually be inoculated enough that you might be able to cure people without actually getting sick yourself. Or at least drop their current load enough that they could safely fight it off themselves. The tricky part would be balancing the amount so that your body had a strong enough response without actually developing the disease yourself.

        You could also perform load balancing on acute, lifethreatening, but recoverable injuries. If you took half of some immediate condition, that might be enough for doctors to stabilize and treat you both where it would result in death for a single person taking the entire load.

        As an aside, how does this work for something like blood loss. If you heal a person who's lost a pint of blood, does it transfer over? Do they get *your* blood, or the equivalent amount of their own blood. Does it work by volume or percent? If a toddler lost a huge amount of their blood, how badly would you suffer healing them? The relatively small amount of absolute volume it would take to restore what they lost, or would it be a proportionate amount to the body's total volume?
        ```

        - u/Rhamni:
          ```
          Yes on partial transfers. Though remember even one fully functional virus body can multiply into a full invasion before triggering an immune response if you're unlucky. Vaccines typically use crippled or non-viable versions of viruses, or even just small parts of them that are easy for the immune system to detect if the real virus should pay a visit later.

          > Do they get your blood, or the equivalent amount of their own blood.

          They get their own blood back. It's magic, and not meant to lead to situations like accidentally killing the beneficiary by making All Of Their Blood clot.

          >Does it work by volume or percent?

          We leave this as an exercise for the reader.

    Can you take on illnesses that cancel each other out?

    Like if someone's body temperature has dropped too low, and another someone's body temperature has gone too high: could you transfer both to you at the same time and so cancel them out?

    Or hypotension and hypertension?

    Or malnutrition and obesity?

    There are plenty of other medical issues that should be able to cancel each other out, since human bodies have a tendency to suffer from having too much or too little of everything. Go around finding and matching cases that cancel each other out, and you will be able to keep helping people without causing harm to yourself.

    Just need to be careful that no one ever discovers the true extent of your ability, otherwise you will likely be kidnapped and forced to de-age the powerful old people until you die from old age.

      I wonder how would that work with things like gender dysphoria.
      ```

  - u/AndHisHorse:
    ```
    How do we define "medical issue"? Does there need to be a good faith, widespread belief among qualified professionals about what constitutes an "issue"? Does it need to be recorded in a formal medical document, and if so, does that document need to be a good faith effort, or can it have a sticker on the front saying "Do not cite; for benefit of superpower only"? Could we declare deviation from some hypothetical norm an "issue"? If so, you could effectively benefit from all the best that humanity has to offer physiologically (or even psychologically, depending).
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Good faith applications only. The power is granted by an all powerful retired lawyer and DM who will respond with **terrible fire** against anyone he deems to be rules lawyering his gifts.

      While you can freely use the power to take on medical issues you will heal from in time, you will not be able to improve your body directly, only indirectly through things like fighting off diseases you took on.

      For the purpose of this power excessive tallness, patience, intelligence etc are not medical issues. You are free to take on genetic dwarfism or personality disorders.
      ```

    - u/AndHisHorse:
      ```
      Also, depending on definitions of medical issue, "I don't have the anatomy/hormone balance/etc. that corresponds to my identity (or brain structure, depending on how hard you have to medicalize it)". If it's binary (i.e. "body does not fulfill gender properly" is a singular condition), that's not so great, but if you can stack it you could perhaps attain truly massive amounts of dysphoria before perhaps taking on some sort of clinical inability to experience gender (not to imply that being agender is a medical issue, but conceivably there could be some medical issue that makes one not care about gender). If it's more nuanced, e.g. "too much testosterone/testes/male-typical fat distribution for my gender" and "too much estrogen/ovaries/female-typical fat distribution for my gender", then it makes more sense that those could cancel out, and you could match binary trans people (or non-binary trans people with roughly opposite desires) and give them what they want.

    personally, most efficient use, from emotional and happiness perspective would be to sacrifice yourself to extend the health and life of your children, by taking their injuries and health problems onto you until the day you die.   


    Assuming you have kids in your late 20s, and live until your late 60s  (taking other people disease on you would shorten your lifespan considerably), you would die leaving kids that are in their 40s but look like extremely healthy 20-somethings.  


    And since these kids (I assume 2) would never have any health problems in their childhood, they would grow to be absolute peak physical and mental specimens their genetics allow.

      I suppose it would be reasonable to take on gender dysphoria and a non-straight sexual orientation. Not because the people are bad, of course, just because it's a thing about their brain that deviates from the norm in ways that are significantly detrimental to their chances of reproduction.

      You could probably only take them on once each, though.

  For a while now I've been fussing over a "guard wish" for genies and whatnot meant to protect from bad effects and horror stories of making a wish.

  > "I wish that all wishes granted to me, including this one, will be fulfilled in such a way that if I knew all of the effects ahead of time, I would still make the wish"

  Am I missing any failure states that could give a hostile wishmaker an opportunity to harm me? Any improvements (perhaps a variant that constraints the wishmaker for all future wishes, regardless of whether they are made by me)? Alternative ways to guard?

  As I see it, most "wish gone wrong" media exists to provoke a reaction of "ooo, bet they wish they hadn't make that wish". In some cases literally, like the conclusion of Monkey's Paw. More generally, there's a moment where the audience sees how the wish was twisted and realizes that it may not have been what they actually wanted, but it does fit the wording of the wish.

  My guard here is meant to use that same reaction as a means of protection. If you knew that the bad thing was going to happen, you wouldn't have made the wish. In general, you wouldn't make the wish unless you knew that the results were a net positive. At worst, you would be left with a series of tepid disappointments that didn't give as much as you wanted, but still offered enough that you'd grudgingly accept them. Not a perfect win, but still a win.

  Some obvious issues that cropped up as I was thinking this over:

  * Can't ask to be happy with the wish, or similar, because this could easily be solved by altering your mind as part of the wish. And while that may be better than the alternative, it still leads to some pretty obvious failure states.

  * Can't ask to actually know the effects ahead of time, because this could be used as a denial of service attack against you. In theory, a genie could use that wish to cram minute details of the world's particles, in as much detail as they had access to, as long into the future as they could see, stretching out in a light cone starting from where and when you made the wish. No chance a human could begin comprehending that, so a big risk there.

  That's what I have so far. I think it's reasonably solid against most malevolent wishgranters, but I haven't put it out for others to pick over either, so it's possible I'm missing something big.

  Any thoughts?
  ```

  - u/Mowtom_:
    ```
    Knowing every effect of your wish would make you go insane from information overload, as you established.  I don't trust "insane from information overload" me to accurately determine if the wish is still good to make, so adding the layer of hypothetical doesn't help much.
    ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      My belief is that my "insane from information overload" self lacks capacity to make the wish, so the hypothetical layer would have to work in some way that's less incapacitating.

      That said, I do think you're onto something in a more general sense. This wish does have potential vulnerabilities in the hypothetical layer. Is there a way that being provided that information could change me so much that I would still make the wish after receiving it, even if it results in something I would consider bad prior to actually making it?

      Is there a way to close this loophole while still being on the lookout for subtle downsides that won't be apparent until later? Of the two, I'd consider the latter a more important threat, but ideally the guard wish would defend against both potential attacks.
      ```

    ```
    You:

    >"I wish that all wishes granted to me, including this one, will be fulfilled in such a way that if I knew all of the effects ahead of time, I would still make the wish"

    Evil Genie: Can't be done.

    You: Why? Because you only fulfill wishes in malevolent ways?

    Evil Genie: No. Even a perfectly benevolent genie cannot grant your wish. To know the effects of a wish is to know how it could be done better. Worded better. Changed for the better. Stated at a different time after different actions to maximize the benefits of the resulting butterfly effects. With only 3 wishes available, you would never settle for a sub-optimal wish when you know a different wish that is so obviously better. As a result, you would never ever make any wish that you knew the effects of ahead of time, regardless of how it is fulfilled.
    ```

    - u/General__Obvious:
      ```
      Perhaps “I wish that all wishes granted to me, including this one, will be fulfilled in such a way that if I knew all of the effects ahead of time, I would consider my utility function fulfilled to a greater extent than it was before I made the wish”?
      ```

      - u/AndHisHorse:
        ```
        I think that depends on how your utility function counts a wish. Either it doesn't count it at all, so a wish that provides net additional utility equivalent to the opposite of a dust mote in the eye but also removes a wish is valid (in which case the genie can't _on net_ harm you, but can at least waste your wishes), or it counts as its expected value, which could be so massive than nothing would be worth it.

        There's also a lot of ambiguity around "utility function"; supposing that it is a real enough thing about your mind seems just plain wrong to me, and even then it is probably quite limited. Wishing to follow your CEV would be better, again if "my utility function" is sufficiently meaningful.
        ```

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    you would be still vulnerable to "offer you cannot refuse" solutions to your wishes.  Example:  


    \- A wish for immortality might be powered by the souls of your children and grand children. You begrudingly accept, because it is still better than death in your view, but you suffer the emotional consequences

    \- reversely, you wish for your loved ones to have a very good and long life, but your life force is given to them and you drop dead. In your dying moments, you would consider it a good deal, but still, you ded.

  You can't get explosion levels of energy by filling it with concrete, and then poking a small hole, it will just stay bigger on the inside.

    Aircraft flight testing. Normally it would involve painstaking and exhaustive modeling and simulation, then extensive ground-testing, then several years of cautious flight testing. Take the F-22 for example; companies began their designs around 1981, their design proposals were submitted in 1986, then the two remaining competitors spent 50 months gradually completing all of the ground testing in preparation for the maiden flight of the prototype models which occurred in 1990. Flight testing of the first production model began in 1997, and that took eight years before they were designated as having Initial Operational Capability, though it wasn't until 2007 that they were designated as being fully operational, and even then testing continued, with one F-22 test pilot dying in a crash in 2009. In all, it took 26 years to get from concept to finished product with no test pilots dying.

    Instead of all that slow and cautious nonsense, you can just get in a prototype plane that was assembled yesterday and run dozens of tests with it per day to see how small tweaks improve or worsen performance in various high-risk aspects like carrier landing, aerial refueling, landing with a strong crosswind, etc. With you in the cockpit, designing and prototyping a new fighter, helicopter, or small private plane would likely take closer to 3-5 years instead of 2-3 decades. By yourself, you could save an aerospace company hundreds of billions of dollars.

      Great idea. Falling, shrapnel, and explosions don't really do much to high tier still mages, so testing dangerous equipment is a great use. Hell, landing equipment doesn't even need to be installed for the tests: just turn off the engines and then gradually lower the plane with still magic.

  Fortnite powers:  You can break down wood, brick/stone and metal structures with a pickax impossibly fast, even the toughest structure take a dozen well placed strikes at absolute most.  As you break them, you can store the raw materials in a pocket dimension accessible to you, around 3 tons of each type (wood, brick, metal). You can build sections of structures out of the materials in your pocket dimension, around several hundred pounds per sections, and you can place sections as fast as you can think, so long as at least part of each structure section is within arms reach.  Sections take several sections to assemble from the materials in you pocket dimension.

  Edit: To make the power a bit more Fortnite: as the sections are built of materials, the material are arranged and fused together in a way optimal for yours purposes whether that be structural strength, blocking bullets, or easy reprocessing/demolition.  Also, the center of mass and balance of the structure is redistributed in impossible ways for the purposes of optimally supporting the structure.  You can drop materials from your pocket dimension at will.

    If not, then your abilities are almost entirely for combat (as in, for collapsing structures on your enemies), since your structurally questionable buildings are too unsafe to use compared to regular buildings. Especially since you are completely unable to use one of the best building construction materials ever: concrete.

    You also can't even work as a human wrecking ball, since people expect the raw materials back, but they are now stuck in your pocket dimension unless you use them to build yet another structure that would need to be wrecked anyway. (Though if the destination for the raw materials is quite far away, you may help save on transportation costs. But not by much since you can only carry 9 tons.)

      I added an edit to my comment to split the difference a bit between reality and Fortnite.  Center of mass and center of balance are magically redistributed through the structure.  And the materials are arranged in an optimal way for your goals as they are built.  So it won’t fall over due to balance issues (like if you built a giant ramp).  I think space elevators are still out, since if the force is magically redistributed perfectly you would still run into issues with strength of the materials.

      > Especially since you are completely unable to use one of the best building construction materials ever: concrete.

      By Fortnite logic concrete counts as brick.

      > You also can't even work as a human wrecking ball, since people expect the raw materials back, 

      I edited that to since I forgot to mention you can drop materials.  Demolition or material reclamation would be valuable uses.
