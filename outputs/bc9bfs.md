    ```
    do they not know how the drow work, yet?
    ```

    - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
      ```
      Not at all. They probably should guess they have good night vision and have some weird ass power but there's that and knowing they become Naruto Murderhobo Ninjas at night.
      ```

      - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
        ```
        oh hell yeah, I'm looking forward to them finding out.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      They probably just think the Pilgrim will turn night into day.
      ```

        Nonzero chance this happens, though...

          Except...

          >It had been made clear to the Lord of Alava what the consequences of the Grey Pilgrim acting first might be, and he would not have such disaster brought upon them all.
          ```

          - u/bubby_cat2:
            ```
            It may not count as 'acting first' if he does it to save his armies from Night-drunk magic tiny war creatures?
            ```

            - u/NZPIEFACE:
              ```
              It is acting first when the only relevant players are Pilgrim and the Black Queen.
              ```

            - u/TristanTheViking:
              ```
              I still maintain that Cat is going to activate that well she's been prepping to make the Grand Alliance army invincible, thus narratively forcing the Pilgrim to intervene on *her* army's behalf. She's going to steal Gandalf's coming at the first light of the fifth day.
              ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Nope. They don't even really know its drow. I think they assume Cat has Fae bodyguards.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    >during the night

    its a great example of a character making a smart/rational move from their own PoV but being foiled by a factor they couldn't be aware of. If she didn't have drow a night attack would probably succeed

    Evil will always triumph because Good is dumb.

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      Good is used to evil being weak/challenged by comparable good guys, ever since Black and Malicia took the tower, evil has kinda been breaking the rules.
      ```

      - u/Rice_22:
        ```
        I was quoting a movie, but yes. I don't think some of the more powerful Heroes could be outwitted easily though.

  Ahh Abigail following the age old rule, Fake it till you make it

  - u/zxyiopl22:
    ```
    ~~Ciaphas Cain~~ Abigail, HERO OF THE ~~IMPERIUM~~ KINGDOM!!!
    ```

- u/u_PM_me_nihilism:
  ```
  How did they execute a cavalry charge over ground previously established to be riddled with pit traps? Even if most of the traps are caved in, that's still not going to go so well.

  Am I missing something?
  ```

  - u/boomfarmer:
    ```
    My understanding was that the summoned beasts and their mages had broken through the belt of traps and were now in the clear area between the trap belt and the palisade.
    ```

    - u/vimefer:
      ```
      This. The traps are outside artillery range.
      ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    They probably rode out of a safe path in front of the southern gate (that the crusaders don't want to take because that's where all the siege engines are at) and then turned to ride through the neutral grounds between the advancing army and trawling binders, since the pokemons were mentioned to stop chasing the goblins (who were running towards the palisades, through the minefield), and turn *to the side* to face the charge.
    ```

- u/Nic_Cage_DM:
  ```
  I wonder if the Broken Bells managed to kill Razin Tanja. If it has I bet that sets off some serious shit-flinging between the two armies and the factions within the southern army.
  ```

  - u/Locoleos:
    ```
    I hope not, Razin is shaping up well, investigating things, getting early warnings for ambushes and stuff.
    ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  I wonder if there's a Name of Reluctant General or something like that for Abigail to mantle. It would certainly fit her story (Story?) of successes which feel like failures.
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    But then she wouldn't be able to hilariously stumble into being Queen of Callow, as the Liesse Accords prohibit Named rulers.
    ```

  - u/vimefer:
    ```
    The Bumbling General. Haphazardly stumbling into tactical brilliance.
    ```

- u/Allian42:
  ```
  All according to *keikakku*

  Note: keikakku means "dumb luck"
  ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  Not sure I get how the cavalry rode through the spirits? Aren't they formed of snow and earth? Also, if the Broken Bells has anti magic armor, shouldn't Abigail or someone have known this would work? Or is this just the first time anti magic armor has been used against bound spirits?
  ```

  - u/paradoxinclination:
    ```
    >Not sure I get how the cavalry rode through the spirits? Aren't they formed of snow and earth?

    My own interpretation was that the creatures were made out of real materials held in the shape of some creature or other via magic. The knights warded armor disrupted the spells maintaining the spirits bodies, turning them back into regular clumps of snow and dirt. 

    >Or is this just the first time anti magic armor has been used against bound spirits?

    Yeah, I think this is the case. It's quite possible that Callowan knights have never before been on the opposite side of a battlefield from a Levantine binder, given that they're both Good nations with no shared borders.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Yeah, but I guess it feels a bit too convenient. I'm sure spell warded armor isn't cheap, but that's a hell of a weakness to discover at a time like this. Those cavalry must have been as surprised as anyone.
      ```

      - u/elysian_field_day:
        ```
        It seems sensible enough to me - these are callowan knights after all, they are the military elites sharpened by centuries of charging into the worst, craziest magic the praesi throw around on the battlefield. 

        I don't think anyone on the side of callow was all that surprised by this, while Abilgail's internal decision-making is somewhat warped, it is a reasonable base idea - enemy employing weird indestructible sorcery, throw the knights at it, just like callowans have dealt with that shit for centuries. I think her surprise was that she actually did \*get\* the troops she asked for, as her approach was to request a strategic asset, for tactically sound reasons, assuming she'd be denied because of seniority/lack of trust. That way she'd have her ass covered but would still fail.
