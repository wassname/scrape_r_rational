  I try to keep in mind when reading that just because something doesn’t grab my attention it doesn’t mean there is any fault in the writing, it can often just be personal taste. I’m not a big fan of Crime novels but I am a big fan of High Fantasy and irrespective of writing quality I'm going to enjoy one more than the other. On a smaller scale, in media some issues engage me more than others, and while sexual assault is just awful and a relevant topic to current society and there’s a lot of important things to say on it...it’s just not a topic that really piques my interest when it comes to fiction.


  So as I was reading the second chapter of this batch I was thinking all of this and I was also thinking “well, it’s not like the issue could take up any less screen time because it’s nuanced and needs plenty of work to do the issue justice, so if the issues is going to be tackled then unfortunately for me it needs to be explored at length”, and then I started to get more drawn in. I started getting a sinking feeling in my gut, I started mirroring (on a much much smaller scale) what Joon and Amaryllis were respectively feeling and I had that kind of character immersion that only the best writing gives you, the sort I experienced earlier in the series when Amaryllis was writing from the doomed timeline or when Fenn and Joon had their therapy session.


  You took a topic I am usually not engaged by in media and *really* made me enjoy it’s exploration and connect with a characters experience on the subject in a new way. I went from a kind of detached, almost “intellectual empathy” regarding Joon’s situation to a more visceral simulation of his turmoil. Thanks for the insight and for the vicariousness awfulness i’m feeling which feels good in it’s own weird way.

    I think because it happens in a logical chain of thought, it's easier to follow and connect with. Often authors will write scenes like this in which the characters act in ways that don't make sense, whether due to lack of skill, laziness, or attempts at drama/comedy. It's hard to empathize with characters that do things you would never do, let alone things that no one would ever do.
    ```

  I have to say outright that this was one of the most high quality management of sexual assault plot threads I've ever read. So many other works take such an immature view on it, but the clinical, cold deconstruction of the whole thing made me feel chills down my spine.

  Hot damn, this is some oof stuff.
  ```

- u/Watchful1:
  ```
  The thing I really like about this story is how well thought out the plot threads are. When Bethel was first introduced, she was antagonistic for all kinds of reasons and that was continuously demonstrated in her behavior. I kinda wondered what the point was, why was cthulhuraejepsen drawing this out rather than just fixing it. Make Bethel like everyone and play nice, use her unique powers to their fullest so the story could go on.

  But nope, the plan the entire time, all those chapters of uncomfortable interactions, was to resolve it in this really complex way that helped everyone grow as characters. It helped Valencia grow since Juniper was trusting her again to use her powers, and gives her a new plot thread of living in the relocated Bethel. It helped Amaryllis grow in her relationship with Juniper, both romantically as well as trusting each other to rely on to solve problems. It gave Bethel a whole new dimension, she does truly care about the people living in her and is willing to recognize that she's wrong and change. And obviously it adds a huge amount of depth to Juniper with a very nuanced subject.

  Not to mention that it's going to make the actual story more interesting since they don't have a super house at their immediate beck and call for the foreseeable future. I'm really interested to he ends up resolving the Locus question. I hope it's not just as getting the level 20 virtue and clicking whatever that button is.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    With regards to the locus, I think between Star Magic 100 (Edit: Assuming that's what allows portals), Horticulture 100, the Doe virtures, and maybe working with/killing Pai Shep and/or Manifest (who I think it's implied is Caldwell Gatesmith as well), there should be something to open up a portal to the bottle and establish a connection to the outside.

    Of course, the exclusion zones are pretty high level quests, killing the excluded seemed a lot more doable with Prince's, and working with them will probably take Valencia, but Valencia will (hopefully?) come back, and if Juniper matches the excluded in skill, maybe it's possible. Although it sure would be helpful to have the manual to know what benefits would apply, and if it was even worth it\^\^

    Then again, all these seem to miss the personal touch, so maybe additionally Juniper has to learn to accept the locus' way of thinking on some level and become a druid, which would make Amarillys (and probably Grak by then) into druids and get around the problem of there not being enough druids for the locus to expand...
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      With capstone virtues in play this is futile guesswork.

      Woodworking 100, anyone? (remember, Joon did have woodworking on his first sheet, before carving it out)
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I don't think it is entirely futile... After Chapter 162 I'm pretty sure Woodworking 100 would be excluded. On the other hand, Star Magic seems to deal with (extra-)dimensional spaces, which I'm guessing also includes portals, while Horticulture deals in some way with connections, plants and land, both of which are important for the locus. 

        Also, the most powerful aspects of Star Magic, Soul Magic and Horticulture probably ARE already excluded, at least that's my best guess for the City Made Manifest (aka, I think, the domain of Caldwell Gatesmith) and the lands of Pai Shep, so there exists 

        * some information on what they do, namely, portals into the soul and "fields impeccable, power absolute". 
        * a quest, and presumably a reward for ending the exclusion zones - if Juniper can break the exclusion on emporsened exclusion zones, he may be able to use the excluded aspects. Of course, there I agree, that's guesswork and a pretty big if\^\^ Much depends on how the game layer interacts with the exclusionary principle on emporsened exclusion zones... Maybe kill Captain Blue-in-the-bottle to see what the quest text says (also, killing him might help with getting Fenn back)?
        ```

    - u/BlakbirdCAWCAW:
      ```
      Caldwell is manifest?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Not verified, no, but I think there are hints... "Caldwell Gatesmith has the dubious distinction of being responsible for two exclusions. ", his quest name " ***A Door Into the Soul*** ", and in the description for the "Manifest Destiny" quest, " The exact nature of the magic that allows the immortal man named Manifest to puppet his subjects from a distance is unknown, ...", which sounds to me like Manifest uses portals to control his subjects. 

        Of course these aren't strong hints, and if Juniper got these quests from the description of two different exclusion zones, then this is all null and void, but it's never spelled out in the text how he got these particular quests. They are listed right after one another, too, which would be consistent with him getting two at once for one description of an exclusion zone. Either that, or me reading too much into things, or just a red herring\^\^
        ```

        - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
          ```
          I always figured Gatesmith got two components of gates excluded - something like, first closing gates was excluded so that he couldn't cut people with them, and then he munchkined gates in general so hard they got excluded completely

          That said, I can see where you're coming from and there isn't an author alive who doesn't take joy in hiding things in plain sight like this.
          ```

        - u/SirEvilMoustache:
          ```
          >Using gates to control people from a distance

          Now, where did I hear that before?

    - u/ShIxtan:
      ```
      I could see level 20 virtue opening up an opportunity to fix things? Like, give them an actual thread to pull on, rather than just immediately solving
      ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      Why is that necessarily a banal solution, mistake, or major literary fuckup? Solutions don't have to be proportionate to the complexity of the approach there or the effort expended. In this case, I think the lv. 20 virtue is a rather laterally elegant solution that aligns with how druids operate. I know the most recent chapters say that not everything has a moral or is commentary, but in the spirit of the "spiritual rule" of narrative, it wouldn't surprise me if Joon's effort to engage the locus is one of the oblique solutions expected from a druidic quest.

      On a side note, I've noticed a trend of /r/ comments either directly praising AW for good writing/handling of topics or "trusting" him not to make a mistake. Both give me some secondhand awkwardness, with the former making me feel like a voyeur of wholesome thoughts and the latter triggering sympathy for the veiled pressure on AW. Kinda curious why the upsurge in the former; I like to think of it as the euphoric gushing of a finicky community finally satisfied by a r!treatment of uncomfortable topics.

  ```
  > “How do you feel about her now?” asked Amaryllis.

  > “Afraid, mostly,” I said. “Hurt, confused, sick. Ashamed. I’m worried she’ll … I don’t know.”

  > Amaryllis was staring out at the sea. “When I’m finished with her there won’t be a piece bigger than a splinter.”

  Amaryllis is the best fucking friend in the whole world. Valencia's right up there with her too, especially if she really is planning to live alone inside Bethel for an indeterminate length of time. The fact that she thinks of it as her being the best Gryffindor she can be is adorable, but also... something else, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Sad, maybe? I don't really know, something about it just strikes me as being more emotionally impactful than just "adorable."

  Regarding the conversation itself... oof, Bethel. My knee-jerk reaction is to say fuck Bethel, because what she did was obviously awful and the closest she gets to recognizing that is a lovely little spot of victim blaming towards the end. However, while all of that is still true, thinking about it a bit more I do find a bit of a hope spot. 

  Most of her difficulty in recognizing the error of her actions hasn't been (from what we've seen) in recognizing that it was wrong to rape June, it was in recognizing that she DID rape June. She had a genuinely difficult time understanding that she hurt him and seemed offended by the fact that he felt threatened by her. There wasn't any malice, really. It's not that she didn't *care* about June's feelings, it's that she didn't *understand* them, while at the same time she was arrogant enough to think that she understood him better than he understood himself. She loudly declared that she would *never* hurt him, and I think she really does sincerely believe that. She doesn't *want* to hurt him and would not intentionally do so. The problem is, I think in her head that's become "I would never hurt Juniper, therefore nothing I do will ever harm Juniper." She's too arrogant to consider that her actions may not have the consequences she intends.

  Thankfully, ignorance is much easier to correct than malice. This *is* something that I think they could recover from. June and Bethel might even become friends again, and if they do they'll be much better friends than they were before. If that's going to happen, though, Bethel has a *lot* of work ahead of her. She isn't a complete sociopath, but her empathy is *seriously* underdeveloped/atrophied, and for her to fix things with Juniper that has to change.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    I think when she said she'd never hurt him she meant physically. It is clear from her character that she never took psychological pain (towards others) very seriously.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      You nailed it.
      ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    So why did she ignore the no then? What was her reason
    ```

    - u/LLJKCicero:
      ```
      I think she viewed it more as seduction than ignoring consent. Like honestly go back half a century+ in the US, and Bethel's behavior wouldn't be out of place among many, many adult men who did not think of themselves as rapists.
      ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        I think what Bethel did happens today, rape culture is prevalent still

        Besides which are we meant to think that this is normal on the hex in which case why is Amy so mad. Just tell her that she needs to get consent
        ```

        - u/LLJKCicero:
          ```
          > I think what Bethel did happens today, rape culture is prevalent still

          Absolutely, I just think it used to be much more common/accepted than now.
          ```

        - u/I_Probably_Think:
          ```
          I think Amaryllis is angry because Bethel hurt Juniper in a pretty deep way, regardless of local societal norms.
          ```

      - u/l611:
        ```
        lol, forget 50 years. marital rape is still not a crime in india(and 35 more countries).
        ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Just like juniper menioned in his flashback, if someone tells you to stop tickling them would you stop? Sex isn't the same as tickling, but to Bethel it is.
      ```

      - u/tarlton:
        ```
        It's a good comparison. When my daughter was little, we  tried to remember to always stop tickling her when she said to stop, often with a comment about it being her body... precisely because expectations about consent are learned, and we wanted her to grow up understanding that that was the treatment she should expect from others, and give to them.
        ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        Yes? Because I know what consent is?

        Does Bethel not know what consent is?

        The people who decided to move into her and raise her sentience and are responsible for her humanising and already explained consent to Val chose not to educate Bethel and then want to kill her because of their incompetence.
        ```

        - u/Argenteus_CG:
          ```
          In case you forgot, BETHEL was raped by Arthur. She knows what consent is.
          ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        Also the reason many people ignore tickling is because of cultural expectations. Why would Bethel have tickling and sex be the same culturally? If she did that suggest the imperial mores are like that and yet Amy's reaction suggests not
        ```

        - u/Dragfie:
          ```
          I'm not really sure what we are disagreeing on here, as you said its the same thing to bethel, and both are consent violations and morally wrong. I was simply using the example of tickling to show how the "lets kill her" reaction would be completely not understandable to her, even if she knew about consent. To her it probably looks like a minor infraction, even if she acknowlages she did something wrong, and as you said she has no reason not to think so.
          ```

          - u/RMcD94:
            ```
            I agree with everything you said
            ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      Maybe the extra senses?  He *says* no, bit she can *see* his arousal responses...
      ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        Humans can sense arousal.

        If Amy said that she kept having sex with him because she felt his arousal what would the reaction be?

        Clearly she still ignored him saying no, why did she ignore it? 

        Because he was aroused would suggest that she thinks that arousal is consent or doesn't know what consent is.

        Which suggests the people responsible for humanising a house have done a bad job if no one explained to her arousal doesn't mean consent.

        Even then if she thinks arousal means consent then what did she think the no was for?
        ```

        - u/Iconochasm:
          ```
          There's a lot of real life human women who don't seem to understand/believe that an erection does not equal eager consent.  Bethel is a *house*, and no one was really responsible for humanizing her, and even if someone were, "advanced civilized sex etiquette" is going to be a low-priority lesson for an apparently asexual *house*.

          >Even then if she thinks arousal means consent then what did she think the no was for?

          I think she thought he was just being a midwestern prude, saying 'no' because he was supposed to, when really he was *obviously* DTF.

          To be clear, I'm not saying Bethel didn't do anything wrong.  I'm saying it was more an error of understanding than an act of malice.
          ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          You keep saying Amy, but her nickname is Mary. I think you're letting Ward bleed over to WtC ^^

  WRT content warnings: My standard policy is not to use them for this story. On AO3, this fiction is marked "Creator Chose Not to Use Archive Warnings" and on RoyalRoad it's marked "Profanity, Gore, Sexual Content, Traumatizing Content", which was as many warning tags as they had. There was no warning for extended discussion of suicide in previous chapters, nor for discussion of sexual violence in ch 98, nor for statutory rape in 121, nor for the rather persistent and extreme levels of gore, violence, and existential horror elsewhere in the story. I've been hoping that "there are no trigger warnings" is enough, but I might put that in bigger letters in the summary, or lay out my policy there. I generally think that trigger warnings are helpful, but that they also act as spoilers, and I would rather turn away people who need trigger warnings without giving a reason than provide trigger warnings on specific chapters and/or for the work in general. (There's also the problem of providing a frame to chapters that doesn't exist within the text of the chapter itself.)

  I'll *probably* be adding a text doc that links to an exhaustive, spoilery list of stuff that happens and in which chapters, but it's low priority, and will probably be crowd-sourced, since there's a lot of story and I don't know exactly where people draw their lines.

    For trigger warnings, I think it was Wildbow who had a disclaimer saying something along the lines of "if you are worried about trigger warnings then this is not the story for you" or something to that effect, and I've always liked that phrasing. It makes it abundantly clear what you're saying about the work without giving away spoilers in regards to when and what happens.

    Forgot to comment [on the art last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c2p8sy/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_162165/erlnkhb/): wanted to agree with the general sentiment that it isn't a very marketable representation of WtC. Like /u/erwgv3g34, I also think it's got too strong of a W40K flair. But mostly I'm with /u/ashinator92 - I think detailed facial profiles should be avoided for white-bread-with-skim-milk-Joon and most-beautiful-woman-alive-for-first-person-narrator Mary, especially for the latter if the artist can't reproduce the exact rendition in your head. Your Trapper's Daughter example seems better art-wise, with the text's vague/subjective mystique. 

    Have any covers/cover mock-ups been commissioned? A few months ago, for the first book's cover, I was imagining Joon's back profile peeking out from behind one of Silmar's street corner walls ([iffy inspiration](https://previews.123rf.com/images/estradaanton/estradaanton1806/estradaanton180600157/103433797-a-picture-of-serious-bearded-man-hiding-behind-wall-and-looking-to-the-side-he-has-gun-other-two-men.jpg), can't find anything better) with the latter half of a greater umbral hound skulking down the next street with Sorian's Castle looming in the distance.

    I don't think that's what she meant. She meant that Bethel would *know* that she can't be healed, and therefore would be more restrained than with the others.

  I'm a big fan of how this arc has gone so far. Juniper's reaction to it was so muted and underwhelming in a really unsettling way that I *think* was close to reality. (I'm not an expert, so it could just be one of those cases where it's a common misconception). Thanks to the discomfort that caused me, Amaryllis absolutely furious reaction paid such big dividends. I wasn't quite cheering in my seat, reading that, but it was close.

  I also really appreciate how you didn't have anyone doubt Juniper. Not that they would've had reason to doubt his word over the evil house's, but in the current climate it's still refreshing. Pallida was the only one who seemed unconvinced, and that was on grounds of 'Well that's not *really* rape' and, while that's certainly gross, it came from Pallida. She's not exactly set up to be likeable anyway.
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    Like someone else in this thread (can't seem to find it), I actually liked and appreciated Pallida more for speaking up. Like she says, there are "morals and ideas of the moment" and in a universe and history as multicultural as Aerb, judging other cultures and their interpretations of behaviors might be too insular without a big stick in hand. Reminder that hardly anybody in our world gave two hoots about male rape until relatively recently. There was [a whole discussion of rape framing in the last thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c2p8sy/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_162165/ervjr0h/) and /u/c_a_l's argument resonated with me in that using the same word of "rape" to refer to all types of unconsented sexual activity isn't realistic. In modern Western culture (not too sure if it's the same everywhere), it's rape by most accounts, but it's still complicated and there are plenty of people who will say that's not *really* rape for all sorts of reasons.

  I'm waiting for the parallels to what Arthur did to come up.  Considering that hasn't been mentioned this far in she'll probably blame him at some point in the healing process.

    I doubt it will unless Bethel makes huge progress. Notice how upset she got with just the implication that what she did was even close to how she had been treated in the past. The Arthur thing would kick that up to 11.

    ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      This is underselling her power. The fiction makes it very clear that Val is leaving cracks on purpose. Its doesn't go into detail about what fixing things more completely would entail, but it admits that Val knows that there are words that could be said that would mend bridges. Those words may be inhumane, abusive and fundamentally opposed to the values of everyone involved, but the author isn't pretending they don't exist to justify this development, he's leading us to accept this outcome because it's what agrees with our values.
      ```

      - u/mrasiteren:
        ```
        What I got from that scene was Val could fix the issue in short term by manipulating June (maybe by getting him to soul-edit himself) but it wouldn't be a long term solution. Remember devils are not really knowledgeable with regards to creating a long term bond of mutual acceptance and respect. She is trying to help them not create a short term fix that might blow up in the future.

    ```
    It's sad that Arthur/Uther saw all his life as degenerate cycles and here the degenerate cycles are continuing as a consequence of his improprieties and Bethel's not self-aware enough to recognize her transition from victim to perpetrator.

    For all that Bethel is alien, she still has a lot of similar psychological mechanisms and preserving ego is surely one of them. That parallel seems like it'd be very destructive to her self-concept and equilibrium, and I must have a streak of schadenfreude because I want to see her reaction.

    Being capable doesn't mean doing the thing. For all we know, Joon+grpup could be *capable* of doing it *right now* without realizing it (i.e. Bethel eating the bottle). Zorisad Yosivun is a genie, so all the warnings about wording requests and interpreting the answers fully apply.

  More than anything, the last chapter made me very hopeful about Bethel's moral character at her core. At this point I'm confident she had no intention of hurting or traumatizing Juniper and she seemed pretty quick to gather why what she did had that effect, and seemed very regretful for it. Before that conversation I would have thought it plausible that things could have gone a *lot* worse, but this to me suggests Bethel is much more than a chaotic evil murderhouse.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    It wouldn't say she was regretful.

    She's showing some good signs, but her attitude overall is more "sorry she got caught" than "sorry, and will try to be better from then on" (see also, her blaming Joon for feeling upset).

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      I don't think what you say disagrees with the parent comment. After the last batch there was the potential for a truly sociopathic Bethel that becomes a threat. What the last chapter of this one shows is that she's just emotionally immature, as many people in the world are, and that doesn't excuse her or mitigate the harm she did, but it does cement moral dimensions that weren't as clear before.

  That was a tough read, but a really rewarding one. I will admit I had been worried about whether this would be handled well - but not anymore. 

  > *So, we had sex, and I pretended that I was fine with it, and I’ve been stepping on eggshells and edited my spirit, and I’ve been feeling like shit about it, and that’s why I’m not as happy as I should be about you trying to make this themed beach outing a success, and it’s why seeing you in a bikini is making me a little bit anxious instead of just horny, not that you would want that, unless for some reason you do.*

  Much like Juniper, I was a little concerned what Amaryllis' reaction would be. After this paragraph, I was on the edge of my seat wondering whether the omission of those unsaid words would mean she didn't have a good reaction.

  > “How do you feel about her now?” asked Amaryllis.

  > “Afraid, mostly,” I said. “Hurt, confused, sick. Ashamed. I’m worried she’ll … I don’t know.”

  > Amaryllis was staring out at the sea. “When I’m finished with her there won’t be a piece bigger than a splinter.”

  To see her so angry, so supportive, and so willing to prioritise this above all other concerns is deeply satisfying. Amaryllis is the fucking best. 

  > “Those are problems we’ll have to deal with,” said Amaryllis. “They’re not inconsequential.”

  I really like how she doesn't dismiss Juniper's worry about the big logistical difficulties, but rather notes them as lesser concerns.

  > “It’s going to be hard for me, knowing what I know, to doublethink around Juniper,” said Valencia. “I would rather not have to try. It was already hard not to pick up anything, before. I knew that something was wrong, really wrong, I just …” she squeezed her fists. “I didn’t want to betray trust.”

  Valencia here stands as a beautiful contrast to Bethel, as someone who had access to enormous power (in this case, social power rather than pure might), and who stopped when she was asked. 

  > “You would call it that, if it were someone else,” said Valencia.

  Damn right, and exactly what he needed to hear (obviously, because devil).

  > “I don’t have to risk my life for you,” said Valencia. “I choose to risk my life because it’s my life to do with as I please. If it could be me or someone else, I would still volunteer. That there’s no other option only simplifies things.”

  Okay, Mary and Valencia can be tied for the best.

  I am wary of saying this, but I do want to express my opinion on the subject. I *desperately* wish that rape hadn't happened. I did not particularly want to read an entire update more or less dedicated to managing the fallout of a rape. Of course, setting that bias aside, the execution was high quality as usual. I read the chapters and would even say I enjoyed them. But I would have vastly, *vastly* preferred to read an entire update about pretty much any other possible plot thread. Even another thread dedicated to Bethel being an inhuman monster fumbling her way through human interaction, as long as it wasn't about rape.

  I've just read enough rape story arcs  for a lifetime. I dunno whether that means "I read too much fiction that relies on the rape card" or "I have unusually low tolerance for the rape card" but the difference is minimal in practice. I'm tired of seeing the formula play out. The victim getting all fucked up, the support network helping them out, the perpetrator either being brought to justice or redeemed. I've seen these steps too many times for them to have any novelty, and I just don't find them interesting at all without that novelty to distract me.

  I'm still a huge fan of the story and will absolutely keep devouring every new update, but I will be extremely happy to put this arc behind us and move on to literally anything else.

      Same, the way rape was handled here is really unusual for me. I read a lot of fantasy, and while rape/threat of rape do pop up occasionally, usually it's just some variant of "look at this evil dude being really evil, doing evil things". This is true usually even with woman-authored fantasy (e.g. Wandering Inn). Nowhere close to the more subtle situation with a potentially redeemable character that has been the case here.

      It’s common in mature online fiction. Online writers (outside specific circles) are often fairly progressive and when you hang out on the internet, rape and the perception around it can become something that affects you deeply.

No matter how many stories do this kind of thing, there will always be new readers who only start thinking about it because of that specific story. As long as it isn’t handled poorly I don’t feel like it can be in too many stories. 

          With all that said, I do also think that I would be happier if this wasn’t the main focus of another bunch of chapters.

      It's interesting to think about this from the perspective we've been offered: AW writes WtC for multiple reasons but as I understand it, one of the original core goals was that the writing would be for his own personal sake. Perhaps this is a part of that, although it looks like some other readers liked the character development this arc has caused.

      Not really.

      At the end of a chapter, she says:

      >  “And you think that I’m culpable,” said Bethel. Something in the illusion had changed, subtle little differences that together **created an impression of malice**. Bethel’s eyes were more sunken, the shadows around her darker and deeper, and the incidental folds of her clothing created points, almost spikes, rather than the aesthetic curves they’d been before. Her fists weren’t quite clenched, but she was showing strain in the muscles of her hands. [...] For a moment, **Bethel seemed as though she would snap**, but that moment passed, and she relaxed. “You can undo it,” she said. “Repair it, rebuild it.” [...] “Then tell me what needs to be done,” said Bethel.

      That's not the attitude of someone feeling remorse, or wondering about what they should change about themselves. That's the attitude of a child who had her favorite toy taken away, and will say whatever she thinks people want her to say to get the toy back.

      (but yeah, "isn't capable" is maybe an hyperbole)

        That refers not only to rebuilding trust, or Joon coming to terms with the rape, but also to Bethel.

        FWIW, I think Bethel acts incredibly human in this arc. I would have been disappointed in our gracious author if Bethel had managed to jump from "The sex thing didn't turn out how I wanted it to" into "Oh my god, I'm so so sorry" within 5 minutes, without passing through "denial" and "anger".

        There's many ways to read those things. Ultimately they're what passes for "expressions" for Bethel, and she's just as if not more capable and likely to use those to obfuscate her real feelings as any human. She could also simply not have the tools to process what happened.

        &#x200B;

        She's a house trying to understand the emotional dimensions of sex with none of the built-in empathy and a perfect sensor that's telling her Juniper is enjoying it. As discussed in the batch, the bulk of the emotional impact of the event came afterwards from Joon's mind trying to process it, which is realistic, and something Bethel's psychology fundamentally opposes because she cannot see herself as an abuser due to her trauma.

  I really like how you handle this arc.

  Amaryllis reaction and dialog sounded slightly OOC for me, but I can't really put the finger on it. Part of it is that I think Amaryllis or Valencia should have brought up the "this is a tragedy" framing in 167. Part of it is that Amaryllis should take more time to digest the situation. Say,

  >“And if you tell her, so what?” asked Amaryllis. “You think that’s going to solve anything? You think that she’s going to agree, to understand that she hurt you? You think that this is going to help her grow and change as a person? Even if it did, Christ Juniper, she broke trust, and you’ve been miserable for the last three days, I can only imagine, are you -- do you think that you can keep living inside of her, knowing how much she can see, knowing that she might break trust again just because she likes to pull our strings?”

  Amaryllis dialog is laser-focused on "validate Joon's feelings". Given the Amaryllis we have seen so far, this should not be her instinctive reaction; it should be "Shit. Hug Joon, don't rush things". Instead, it is Amaryllis who argues against the more reconcillatory approach that is taken in the end. 

  On the other side, I don't really agree with Valencia not pushing back against the "punishment" and "culpability" lines in 168. We get told that she is afraid of Bethel's immediate reaction; she could have said "This is not about punishment, it is about healing" and deferred the culpability discussion to the coming weeks/months in exile. So I'd like a bit of internal monologue that explains why she chooses to open that can of worms right now.

  I do get the narrative need though, and this is a minor nit to pick in an otherwise awesome arc.

  One of the most mature takes I have seen on the subject of male abuse, I had been disgusted by all the scenes before where he gets aroused for whatever really simple reason and Bethel points it out, and this breakdown on the issues of consent has made the uncomfortable read worthwhile. What I thought was most important was reflecting how Juniper would feel shame, embarrassment, denial, then get more worked up and uncomfortable over time, and I liked that the people he was most afraid of being let down by ended up being the ones most determined to help him.  It was *precisely because* Mary and Val had been dealt a shit hand before that they got outraged about it, in contrast to Bethel having fucked up ideas on consent and feeling like a victim without realising how badly she was hurting others.   

  A lot better than Valencia or Bethel dying too. Bethel most likely spared Val because she was thinking about her conversation with Mary a few chapters ago. She does want to be a better person. Weird how merging with Ropey seems to have made her a bit more manic and unpredictable.  But realising she was abusing Joon the same way she had been abused probably struck a chord.  

   Valencia did nothing wrong in her life, ever, and I hope to see plenty of her in the future, but I suspect her woobie status will bring the wrath of the DM eventually.   More on Val - I am proud to see how shes grown from a scared child into someone who is a force to be reckoned with and a steadfast, mature friend, with or without a demon. Its insane to think she manipulated events, almost entirely without supernatural help, for Bethel to not have any hostages and Juniper to be in an environment where he could talk about what was on his mind. Then she overcomes fear to call out the deadliest being to exist outside an exclusion zone. No coincidence her name links to “Valor”.... what a Gryffindor. 

  I do think removing the final 2 truly interesting Companions from the picture will make these next few chapters blander, unless Wales has intent to expand on the current cast. Solace has been quiet and hostile since she was revived. Amaryllis is... odd, especially with her relationship to Joon. I love Grak but hes banging a 7 year old and it is fucked up. Raven and Pallida need a lot more work. The Locus however is still the OG. 

  Final note - this is the chapter I caught up on. What a fucking note. It was only yesterday I was reading Juniper’s Kaiju-murdering shenanigans, and a few days before it was Fenn’s demise.

  As much as I feel for June, I can't help but keep thinking how sorry I feel for Bethel. 

  The flashback June had about his uncle tickling him must have been intentional for how it fits so well into the situation: Bethel did an action which made June's body react in what seemed to be a positive way, just like the uncle saw him laughing when he was tickled. And both were ignoring the mental side of things, encouraged by the physical. To Bethel sex is the same as tickling, she isn't human, she doesn't know the difference and she doesn't feel it. I don't think she will ever truly understand what she did and why would she? She isn't human. 

  To her its just like she tickled June, and then suddenly he is conspiring to kill her. No wonder Val was so scared, from that perspective it must feel to her like June is betraying her. 

  The whole situation is just so tragic, like [RMcD94](https://www.reddit.com/user/RMcD94/) mentioned, Bethel is like a dog who shat on the floor and had no idea what she was doing wrong at the time, and even now to her it is just an "arbitrary rule" she broke and is being punnished rediculously harshly for something she didn't know to be wrong at the time, but would do anything to make it right anyway. And there probably isn't anything that can make it right.

Short answer:  Bethel had more than enough information to know that what she did was wrong and why.  She even had specific knowledge:  Uther raped her, she didn't like it.  

    If she is a sapient moral agent then she had more than enough life experience to have recognized that this was a bad thing to do and it's appropriate to exile her, or even to destroy her if it's judged necessary in order to protect others from her.

    If she's not sapient then there's nothing wrong with destroying her.  

    If she's sapient but not a moral agent then it's necessary to destroy her in order to protect others.

      I don't think Bethel actually cared about what Uther's sexual behavior towards her illusory projection of a person. What she didn't like was being stuffed with entads, threatened. So it's possible the parallel isn't obvious to her. (She's unaware that Joon was threatened by the implications of her power).

      It's moot though - the problem is her overall moral alignment, starting from when she used to torture and kill people (which, lest we forget, was a lot more evil than anything she is doing right now) means that she doesn't care about Joon as himself, but rather what he represents - a person who wants to live in her and care for her and love her. Ropey may have shifted this to an extent. But in general, people can improve, but I don't know if they can't go from cold blooded murderers to self aware and sensitive to others needs and respectful of consent.

  The more I think about this the more I think there's something else.

  I think Amy let her love for Joon rise.

  Think about it. Amy wouldn't say let's kill them. Any would say oh no that's horrible, something has went wrong here. Is there a memetic agent corrupting her, did we fail to teach her about consent, is an entad that we forced into her manipulating her?

  Instead Amy assumes Bethel was malicious and wants to kill her. Imagine reacting to any other part member like that.

  Grak raped you? Well somethings gone wrong there.

  Val raped her boyfriend? Well I probably didn't explain consent very well when I explained it to her (notably that she explained it to mind raped Val but never bothered to Bethel WHO IS A HOUSE) 

  Bethel raped you? Clearly she wanted to hurt you let's murder her it's the only choice.

  These chapters have made me more sympathetic for Bethel than ever before. She's a savage dog that they chose to take into their home. They chose to attempt to domesticate her. She was force to take in mind altering entads (likely the human body overwhelmed her with sensations like being mind controlled) on a job she didn't want to do (Rath). Then Bethel as a dog takes a shit in the house and Amy's first reaction is to murder the dog not considering how she was the fucking person responsible for training her. Not only that as a savage dog she can't even fucking speak to anyone because Amy wants to kill her the moment she can and everyone is incredibly hostile towards her. Plus because she is a savage dog with nukes instead of thinking of educating her they think of alpha strike. 

  I really hope to see more introspection from Amy. What they've done with Bethel is incredibly irresponsible. 

  If she wasn't house trained why did they give her more weapons? 

  Why do they act like Bethel is morally responsible instead of feeling empathy for the savage dog they have to put down because its untrainable. 

  Just really this whole thing has made me disappointed in these characters and emphasises how they'll struggle to deal with anything alien. Again a reminder that Bethel is a house.

  The best explanation for Amy being so blinkered is because she's infatuated with Joon

    I'm pretty apologetic when it comes to Bethel, but comparing her to a dog is *not* the way you should treat her.

    If you compare her to a dog, you won't live. Fair enough. So she wants to be treated like a person, therefore she *is* a person and a moral agent. 

    She has wronged at least 3 party members. She needs to own these wrongdoings and start fixing them. The good news is that she had displayed a positive dynamic in the past. The bad news, I think, her reaction in the last chapter was caused by selfishness first and genuine remorse second. Simply put she wants to be inhabitated and she realized that she's just scared away her inhabitants. It would be hard for her to reform and even harder to prove that she truly does (if she does it).

    Her litmus test, I feel, would be letting Uther go. If Joon & co were letting her live in exile after what she'd done she must let Uther go, on her own.

    I think your idea that Amaryllis/the group failed to do the 'simple' task of teaching Bethel about consent ignores the reality of the group's relationship with Bethel. 

    Bethel has been perpetrating (non-sexual) consent violations against everyone from the very beginning. Most recently not leaving Amaryllis alone to sleep when she asked for it. There are countless others but I don't have time to do a thorough re-read. I also can't remember whether anyone ever said something like "this sort of thing isn't OK" - maybe yes maybe no. If no, I can still perfectly predict Bethel's reaction as "trololol I do what I want". She is absolutely not open to point-blank moralising. I would argue that Mary and Joon have been trying pretty hard with the more roundabout moralising that she actually might deign to listen to. But clearly that wasn't enough.

    So you might suggest they should never have added her to the party in the first place. And to an extent I agree - I never liked the idea of adding in a murderous sadist with more power than the rest of the group combined who could potentially just kill or torture all of them whenever she liked. Tragic backstory or no, it certainly doesn't justify what she's done, and it doesn't make her any less dangerous or volatile. And very little since then has really changed my view there.

    However, there are mitigating factors to that decision:

    1. The game interface. It identified Bethel as a companion. The narrative consequences could be dire if they didn't take her in. And the very nature of the loyalty system suggested that she could be reformed/improve/whatever. Not to mention that up to this point, no companion has ever non-consensually harmed another/Joon while not being mind controlled. So they had a strong prior from all this that "it would be ok".
    2. The meta-narrative. They are facing stronger and stronger threats, and hope to be able to save the world from them, empty the Hells, and make reality safe, etc. and they pass up the most powerful potential member of their group they've yet encountered? All it takes is a single apocalypse that they couldn't have averted without Bethel (Mome Rath), and any concerns about the dangers of having her in the group are, in the grand scheme of things, made redundant.
    3. Actual signs of improvement. Her marriage to Ropey, which did seem to settle her a little. Sometimes actually respecting people's stated boundaries. It genuinely did seem that she was improving.

    Now in my mind, this is not an easily-forseen outcome. You have to connect all of the following: 

    * "Bethel picked up the Oberlin-dummy entad" (did anyone actually know this, or did she just do it at some point in the chaos without telling anyone? My money is on the latter)
    * "The Oberlin-dummy entad can give Bethel sexual feeling/desire" - not something at all obvious from what has been seen of it
    * "Sexual desire can overwhelm Bethel, a house with about 8000 other senses that she explicitly stated were overwhelming her before she got an entad that stopped senses being overwhelming to her"
    * "When sexual desire overwhelms Bethel, she'll want to have sex with Juniper" - okay, Mary and Joon might have been able to see this, but even then it's not totally obvious
    * "When a lustful Bethel wants to have sex with Juniper, she won't take no for an answer" - potentially forseeable, given her numerous non-sexual consent violations, but it's clear from Bethel's statements in 168 that she didn't consider his no a 'real' no, implying that she does understand she shouldn't do it if the no was 'real'. 

    I just don't think it's reasonable that anybody could have forseen this. Even if they had, I don't think targeted moralising works on Bethel, so I dispute they could have "taught her about consent", a thing the ignoring of which seems to be one of her primary pleasures. And lastly I dispute that not accepting Bethel into the group is a "safe" decision in this world and this narrative for this group. The group is not stupid, and there was not an easy answer/preventative to what happened.

    It's always interesting reading your comments, because they will reliably be contrarian.  

    Bethel in not "just a house".  She is a sapient being.  She has access to a sensorium so vast as to be effectively region-locked omniscience.  She spent decades (centuries?) with heroes and villains and normal people.  She has observed countless interactions among humans and other races.  She has a wide array of information to draw on when she needs to make moral evaluations and has undoubtedly heard hundreds of people talking about power dynamics, the feeling of love, the experience of sex, and the powerful negative reactions when those things go badly.

    Also:  Uther raped her.

    Uther forced her to create a body-simulation and have sex with him.  Afterwards, he threatened her with destruction if she ever told anyone.  She didn't like the feeling of being forced to do that.  She was afraid when he threatened her.  That's the sort of thing that makes a sensible person take care in situations where sex is involved.

    In short:  She's very smart.  She knows that being raped is unpleasant and frightening.  She has had more than enough time and data to understand human interactions.  She knew, based on her sensorium, that Joon was upset and unhappy about her proposal even if there was some arousal as well.  Despite all that, she went ahead anyway.

    Now, you can and probably will find excuses for those things.  Let me see if I can steelman them and respond:

    * Just because she's seen hundreds or thousands of people talking about power and sex and love and rape is no reason that she would have viscerally understood those things.  After all, she's a house. She doesn't have the squishy bits that make those things meaningful.

    She demonstrably did understand that being raped and threatened was unpleasant.  She should not have inflicted that unpleasantness on others.

    * She had just received a body for the first time and was overwhelmed by lust.  She was out of control and it's not her fault.

    I find this wildly unlikely, but let's roll with it.  Assume it's correct, what are the implications?  Answer:  Anytime Bethel gains access to a new feeling or experience, she may go out of control and harm one of her inhabitants.  Therefore, it is not safe to live in her or associate with her.  Furthermore, it is not safe for other people to live in her either.

    When a human rapes someone and then successfully uses the insanity defense, they don't get off scot free.  They get locked up in order to protect the rest of future society from them.  There is no way to lock Bethel up, meaning that she must be destroyed in order to protect the rest of future society from her.

    * She mistakenly thought that Joon was into it. Sexual arousal and fear can look similar.  

    That is only true for humans and their limited senses.  Bethel can literally see inside your body.  She has a level of body-reading rivaled only by Val's devil abilities.


    At the end of the day, either Bethel is a sapient being with a moral compass or she's not.  If she is then she shouldn't have done this and punishment is appropriate.  If she isn't then there's nothing wrong with destroying her.

      I really like how Bethel's personhood is not even questioned, and the entire group is not hung up on the punishment / "justice" thing. That is, the story is about healing and how to move forward from this event. 

      Punishment is fleetingly mentioned (and should be, narratively speaking, for reader's sake, since so many real life people would consider it). Different reinterpretations are explicitly non-discussed (Pallida mentions it, and is shut down by "discussing this is not productive"). Revenge fantasies are indulged (being angry and fantasizing about how to blow up bethel is not crazy). 

      And in the end, everyone acts sane so far. The victim's feelings are validated and his support group assembles. A trusted mediator is chosen. The perpetrator is not immediately cast out forever (Val: "you are still my friend"). Instead, Bethel is immediately temporarily separated, to begin the process of figuring out to what extent healing / reintegration is possible (if at all). It is acknowledged that this is a process with open end, on all sides (including the crew, Joon, and Bethel).

      This arc is not just about our crew on Aerb, it is also about how close-knit groups of people can deal with that kind of thing. After initial reservations, I am actually happy with how /u/cthulhuraejepsen traded off perceived slight OOC-ness (at least from my reading) for more real-world relevance. To me, the last two chapters were super positive in their outlook.

      /u/cthulhuraejepsen : You surely used for inspiration an amalgam of personal experience from people in your extended circle of acquaintances, half-remembered literature and explicitly remembered literature (e.g. other fics/stories/books that prompted you to mentally said "my characters would do this thing differently, but should learn from that thing", or serious blog posts or literature a la hypothetical "How anarchist communities should deal with rape: Ideals and Experiences from xyz").

        Most of the research for this chapter was in reading how these kinds of issues are dealt with by therapists, reading accounts from people who had been sexually assaulted (with a specific eye towards people who think that their sexual assault maybe wasn't, or who didn't initially characterize it as that). I don't have any specific links; most of it was either Google searches for survivor resources, or AskReddit threads. Plus I tried my best to get some perspectives from both non-Western countries and from the United States in other eras where rape and sexual assault were treated differently, just for the sake of perspective. (I love court cases for the window they give into how educated people think; [People v. Liberta](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1399209540378549726&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr) is worth a read, if you can stomach it, in part because it gives some history, some comparisons, and some links, and especially touches on equal protection.)

      >Also: Uther raped her.

      That's a blatant misrepresentation. She emphatically did not care about, nor was she particularly affected by, providing Uther with holographic force-sex - any more than the typical human would care about, say, their character in an MMORPG being raped. Uther did go on to threaten, coerce and violate her autonomy, as a consequence of how much weight he put on it, and that _was_ terrible and traumatizing in a way that's reasonably analogous. Keeping in mind that the act itself was in fact meaningless to her, the nature of the violations (Uther of her, her of Juniper) were substantially different enough that we can't just say "she knows what it's like" and be done with it. (For the record, she was explicitly unaware that Juniper was feeling fear at the moment - perhaps because several emotions are chemically similar, or because he was using multithreading to suppress outward response.)

      Further, you may be overestimating the depth of her experience of humans. While she is five hundred years old, a significant fraction of that was spent in the boundless pit, mutilating various invaders. Of the remainder, she was for a long time a severely limited intelligence, with limited or no ability to grasp the subtleties of human interactions. Then, her residents were often Penndraigs, who could hardly be role models. Hells, considering how socially regressive Aerb is as a whole, compared to the modern West, I'd sooner expect Bethel to have heard talks on "how to grit your teeth through your wedding night" than on the importance of affirmative consent.

The scene in particular is towards the end, but the beginning also has some conversation on how he forcibly added entads to her.

          >“If you speak about this to anyone, whisper so much as a word, I’ll return here and start ripping away every piece of you. I’ll smash your windows and tear up your floorboards. Your power? I’ll load you with so many entads you won’t be able to think, let alone speak. There are dark and twisted items of power, and I’ve been collecting the worst of them for quite some time, horrible things that would warp you beyond all recognition. Don’t so much as think my name, do you understand?” I didn’t know how close to the truth that actually was, since by her own admission her intellect and memory hadn’t been fully formed at that point, but he was nearly snarling. He seemed ready to launch into something else, another threat from the look on his face, but Bethel waved the image away like it was a cloud of smoke. 

          &nbsp;
          >“Strange, to me, how important the act is to mortals,” said Bethel. “It was meaningless to me, and still is, but you care more about the images I projected with one power and the force I applied with another than his threats to me, or the decades of isolation he enforced. He deprived me of purpose, he refused to be my master, and it’s the ephemeral, simulated flesh that makes you cringe in horror. No, don’t speak.”
