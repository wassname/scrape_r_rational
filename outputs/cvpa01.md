## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Two thumbs up for lintamande's [For The Taking](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809486).  I'm not sure how to describe the target audience for this story, but at least I had fun.
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:

    If you still have your list of "fics that people falsely attribute to me/my secret identities", this was on it until now.

      What?  God damn it.  People need to keep me posted about that sort of thing!

        I just read it last week, so you haven't been on (by my nomination) and off (by your comment, leading me to retract the nomination ) for long. But will do in the future.

        There is no official list. In the aftermath of HPMOR there were a great many fanfics written and people were all over the place claiming how this one was so great it must be Yours Truly.

    >There are two things everyone knows about demons. The first, of course, is that they can make anything that is made out of atoms. They can't make people - when they try they get something that breathes but does not blink, does not flinch, shows no signs of higher brain activity. Atom-for-atom indistiguishable from a human body - a delight to medical schools and people in need of organ transplants, not that you'd get a whole person made if you wanted a kidney -Â

      I think it's reasonably valid, people are mostly atoms, but we're also an evershifting pattern of energy. I'd be interested in seeing a neurosurgeon work with a demon and a precision defibrilator. I think it's fair to assume it hasn't been tried before or else hasn't been published because of how stigmatized demon contact is.

- u/Noumero:
  ```
  **Request:** Stories in which the plot happens at the protagonist's initiative.

  Instead of being forced into some kind of plotline by circumstances, the main characters are free agents that decide what goal they want to accomplish on their own, and the plot is about them pursuing it. Said goal could be anything, but I'd prefer a long-term large-scale one.

  Things that *aren't* what I'm looking for:

  * [The protagonist is trying to stop the antagonist's plot](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact).

  * The protagonist is responding to some kind of novel crisis (such as a [mass empowering event](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassSuperEmpoweringEvent) or an alien invasion).

  * The protagonist is taking advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (such as getting superpowers or being transported into a different universe). (Even if they have a choice in whether to take this opportunity, the plot is still mainly shaped by it, not by the characters' own goals.)

  * The protagonist is working for some kind of organization, and the plot is about them completing its assignments. (It's fine if they're part of an organization, but the plot is about pursuing goals *orthogonal* to the organization's. There isn't a lot of agency in a soldier following a general's orders... unless the soldier's actual goal is to rise in rank until they could implement some particular changes to military policy.)

  **Recommendations:** Science Fiction with Weird Technology

  u/Veedrac, last week you were [asking](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/csib4y/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/exf14u4/) for such stories; here's my list. Note that it's entirely possible you're already familiar with most of them.

  (Nature of technology is spoilered where appropriate.)

  * [*Quarantine*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156775.Quarantine) (78k words) by Greg Egan. >!What if the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics were correct?!<

  * [*Floornight*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2372021/chapters/5238359) (70k words) by nostalgebraist. Souls-based technology that allows to create and re-integrate parallel timelines.

  * [*Orthogonal*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/59462-orthogonal), trilogy, by Greg Egan. Set in a universe with wildly different laws of physics. >!To be precise: it functions on Riemannian geometry, not Lorentzian. See more [here](http://www.gregegan.net/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html), down the page.!<

  * [*The Light of Other Days*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/823062.The_Light_of_Other_Days) (103k), by Arthur Clarke. Easy-to-create wormholes allow surveillance of any location in the past and present.

  * [*The End of Eternity*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/509784.The_End_of_Eternity) (71k) by Isaac Asimov and [*Palimpsest*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10753368-palimpseste) (28k) by Charles Stross. Same premise: an organization abuses time-travel to control humanity's development from prehistory into deep astronomical time.

  * [*Ra*](https://qntm.org/ra) (156k) by Sam Hughes. Magic is real. >!Magic is faked via "nonlocality technology", which allows to directly store and transfer mass, energy, momentum, spin, and electrical charge. Also: simulations are abused.!<

  * [*Unsong*](https://unsongbook.com/) (240k) by Scott Alexander. I mean, it sort of fits.
  ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    [Strong Female Protagonist](http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/) is set after the superhero has defeated the Big Bad, and now she is trying to figure out what to do with her life.
    ```

  - u/sephirothrr:
    ```
    > Request: Stories in which the plot happens at the protagonist's initiative.

    Do you have examples of works of this type that you've already read?
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      Yes, but they're all with caveats.

      * Cleanest example: [*Fifty Years in the Virtuous City*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/276516
      ) (8k words).

      * [*Twig*](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) after Arc 10, as u/Juansson recommends below. It features a cognitively enhanced protagonist attempting to  >!destroy an empire from within!<. It somewhat runs contrary to my third counter-example. I think the caveat is that the "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" of having been enhanced is sufficiently general that it doesn't force the story in any particular direction.

      * [*Mr. Robot*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot), which is about a hacker attempting to orchestrate an
      economic collapse.

      * [*The Traitor Baru Cormorant*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant), whose protagonist is trying to destroy an empire from within.

      ...

      Okay, maybe what I'm actually looking for is stories about people attempting to enact large-scale social changes for ideological or egoistical reasons.
      ```

      - u/JanDis42:
        ```
        Have you read [The moon is a harsh Mistress ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16690.The_Moon_is_a_Harsh_Mistress) by Heinlein?

        It's about planning and executing an uprising on a lunar colony.
        ```

  - u/onestojan:
    ```
    > Stories in which the plot happens at the protagonist's initiative

    Try Lawrence Watt-Evans somewhat rationalist Ethshar series like [With a Single Spell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320216.With_a_Single_Spell), [The Misenchanted Sword](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/317497.The_Misenchanted_Sword), [The Unwilling Warlord](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/422225.The_Unwilling_Warlord) (they stand-alone). Although they usually start with "a call to adventure" they quickly spiral out of control.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      [Spell of the Black Dagger](https://www.ethshar.com/thespelloftheblackdagger.shtml), too!
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    You wouldn't happen to be fluent in German, would you? Eschbach's [Ausgebrannt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausgebrannt) is about a German dude who comes to the US as a temporary translator in a software project, and has a dream of staying and attaining the American citizenship, and eventually become rich on other people's money and other people's ideas (as you can see, he's not the most alturistic person).  
    The first part of the book is about him determinedly integrating himself into the company, using some almost underhandedly manipulative tactics. The story eventually sees him become a better person, but it's quite a process.

    Other than that, I can recommend [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/). The main character, Sylvester, is almost *always* working on some kind of scheme or plan, even if in the beginning he's usually reacting to something his superiors or enemies pull. His increasing ability to act on his own is one of the more important trends in the story. Towards the end he and his friends become a force with an agenda of their own.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      > You wouldn't happen to be fluent in German, would you?

      No, unfortunately. I do plan on becoming a polyglot, though, and German is near the top of my list, so... recommendation noted, thank you.

      > *Twig*

      Yep, it mostly fits. But I've already read it.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It's also available in French.
        ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    How much are you willing for these goals/plans to be changed by the events of the story?

    I can think of a couple stories that at least *start out* with a goal like that, but I can't think of any story where the character's goals don't at least change somewhat by the end of the story.

    Also: how do you feel about revenge stories (e.g. Count of Monte Cristo)?
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      >How much are you willing for these goals/plans to be changed by the events of the story?

      Depends on the nature of the change, but I'd say it's fine.

      >how do you feel about revenge stories (e.g. Count of Monte Cristo)?

      Seems a bit close to "the protagonist is trying to stop the antagonist's plot", except that the antagonist's plot has already succeeded.
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        Then the two main examples that would come to mind would be:

        Artemis Fowl (goal: gaining money), and The Dark Tower (goal: reach the eponymous location)
        ```

  - u/Tetragramm:
    ```
    The Malazan Book of the Fallen series meets your requirement. It's about a brother and sister who are trying to do the right thing, in a world where might makes right.  Maybe just the sister. It's hard to tell how much is her manipulating him vs his nature. 

    Mind, there are a lot of schemes, meddlers, and pre-cognition/causality to confuse everything. There are quite a few once in a lifetime opportunities, but they were accepted (or more likely, created) for the service of their goal, not the other way around.

- u/mkalte666:
  ```
  I am looking for stories that deal with the effect that powerful people have on their surroundings and themself. 
  How do friendships work when you can read minds passively. How does a government deal with someone that can wipe its army with a have of their hand.
  How do godlike individuals deal with normal human interactions. That kind of stuff. 

  I've seen a good bit of it in TGAB, to give an example.

  I prefer original stories, but fanfiction is fine too of course.

  Thanks for your help!

    [Strong Female Protagonist](http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/) resembles this on some level. Strong focus on social justice, very intelligently written. It wasn't written as 'rational' but there weren't really any significant holes that caught me.

  - u/BausMANGO:
    ```
    [the fall of doc future](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) is something like that

  Any recommendations for good webfic or fanfic that updates daily? I dropped "With This Ring" awhile back and I have a hole in my mornings now.
  ```

  - u/Hoophy97:
    ```
    [Chrysalis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis) (the ant one) is not even remotely a rational fiction, but it updates daily and I enjoy it. It's about a person turned into a giant ant, it morphs into a kingdom builder of sorts, except with giant ants. Light and lighthearted.

    On a not completely unrelated note, I also highly recommend the [Chrysalis](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/55v9e1/chrysalis/) from r/hfy, it's a completed story about an AI who becomes a psudo Von Neumann probe and attempts to enact revenge on the alien species which wiped out humanity. Just as before, this one is not rational either. Much more serious than the above story.
    ```

    - u/Hoophy97:
      ```
      Speaking of self replicating machinery, does anyone know of any good stories with that sort of main character besides The Bobiverse, Eve of AI, and Chrysalis? Thanks!

        ```
        [Post Human](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human/) is a good one that finished recently. It is an HFY story as well (inspired to some degree by Chrysalis, according to the author).

        Apropos of nothing, I've been enjoying your work on [Dungeon Engineer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25361/dungeon-engineer) :)
        ```

        - u/Hoophy97:

        ```
        How is the Bobiverse? It seemed interesting but I couldnt really tell much about it from the synopsis on Audible. Could I get a non-spoilery synopsis on the focus and tone of the story?
        ```

        - u/Hoophy97:
          ```
          First and foremost, itâs comedic. It explores ideas like diverging personalities and the importance of experiences in shaping who you are.
          The focus is mostly on exploration with a bit of R&D thrown in.
          ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    just out of curiosity, why did you drop "With this ring"? It's still on my daily check list, and it's one of my favorite fics.
    ```

    - u/Lightwavers:
      ```
      Not the one you replied to, but for me it left the promises in its premise. The main character stopped rationally perusing his goals, and he was overpowered enough that he just started drifting, really. Stations of canon were being done basically on a checklist, and after that the story went super meta in a way I didnât enjoy. Thatâs aside from the authorâs little hissy fit that happened after the mods banned him for a day because of transphobia displayed both within the story and as the author in the comments where he deleted everything and moved to another forum. Actually, that happened twice, but I forgot the reason for the first move.
      ```

      - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
        ```
        I think he originally moved from SB to SV because he got temp banned for a day from some very light Star Wars spoilers, as Force Awakens had just come out. He was going to miss the daily deadline, and he was supremely annoyed with the whole situation, so he just moved everything to there.
        ```

        - u/sephirothrr:
          ```
          or, less charitably, he broke explicit forum rules and then ragequit instead of accepting his punishment, something he's made quite a habit of
          ```

      - u/sephirothrr:
        ```
        To add some more information on the latter point - he was very transphobic in-universe, and when that was pointed out, he doubled down in author commentary, and was briefly suspended. Then, once he came back from his suspension, he immediately quadrupled down, and was summarily booted off the forum.
        ```

    - u/mayfid:
      ```
      During the Hero dial plotline the author went rather transphobic. It bothered me enough to drop it.
      ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    [He Who Fights With Monsters](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters) updates daily. It's not particularly rational, but I've found it good enough, and the characters and worldbuilding are excellent.
    ```

- u/DragonGod2718:
  ```
  Request please.  


  I have a taste for selfish, villainous, immoral or amoral characters. I prefer they be psychologically realistic, but I do enjoy charismatic insanity. Prefer rational fiction.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Have you tried [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/)? Sylvester is one of the most fascinating characters in all of webfiction. He's unabashedly villaneous, a mad genius despite having the memory of a goldfish, charismatic, literally toxic, and basically only cares for his group of friends - but for them he cares so much that at one point they have to make a rule that he's not allowed to sacrifice himself for them unless it saves at least two others.

    >!Towards the end of the story his drugs increasingly destroy his mind, and he goes quite mad. But it's still an enjoyable read.!<

    Some of the other people in his group are actually also good fits for your request; >!Ashton is a mushroom whose favourite color is blood red and who can use pheromone spores to influence people, Mary is literally always a wrong twitch away from murdering everyone in the room who isn't a friend, Helen is a biological experiment that has one single drive that kinda encompasses food, sex, and murder all at once!<,

    - u/DragonGod2718:

      Unless there's a critical mass of /r/rational users in a particular timezone, any time will be a bit arbitrary. There's an argument for basing everything on UTC in that case, because then it's at least predictable and consistent as the closest thing to an international "default" there is.

    Since you've probably already read that one, I'll also recommend [Girl Genius](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/). Mostly Steampunk, but has some bio-punk mixed in.

    The first episode of Love, Death and Robots has drawn comparisons to Twig before, also has [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFS2DWgijh4) rather awesome rendition as a music video.
