  That was fantastic. Tariq didn't kill his nephew; he killed his \*son\*.
  ```

- u/swaskowi:
  ```
  It'd be interesting to see Mercy in face of the flowering of those to whom mercy was rendered. Namely, Pilgrim was able to lay aside vengeance because of the consequences and suffering enacting that vengeance would bring. And I don't necessarily think he'd relapse on sight, but I'm curious how seeing either the retired prince, doing well by himself and heaven's light in the house of light, or the daughter heir, either serving admirably or reprising her father's mistakes, would make him feel, and more importantly how he thinks it ought to make him feel.

  What in the unholy fuck.

    ```
    And that is why Justice shall always be the affair of men, not gods.
    ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  So has the story ever mentioned the Princess of Orense before in the present day? Where is she during the crusade against Callow?
  ```

  - u/tavitavarus:
    ```
    It's the Prince of Orense these days. He was mentioned in the epilogue of Book 2.

    Remember the events of this chapter took place fifty years before the Tenth Crusade.
    ```

  ```
  >“I am not the murderer in this room,” the Pilgrim said. “They have nothing to fear from me.”

  you like

  are literally in the process of murder

  dude

  vigilantee justice is still murder, you aren't upholding any sanctioned law there, just doing what you want for personal reasons
  ```

  - u/CaseyAshford:
    ```
    The Pilgrim is empowered by what is widely recognized as the ultimate moral authority of the setting. In many ways he is more sanctioned than any individual that is empowered by purely moral laws.
    ```

      If the Heavens seek to impose their will, they will be made to stand before a tribunal of the People.

      A Thousand Years Of Damnation On Vile Foreign Autocrats. Long Live The Republic, Peerless Jewel Of Freedom
      ```

        ```
        If the White Knight is Cat's counterpart, then Anaxares is clearly Tariq's.
        ```

        - u/MilesSand:
          ```
          In what world is the white knight a counter to cat?

          Her counterpart is a dry season or drought.
          ```

          - u/Ardvarkeating101:
            ```
            I do not judge vs justifications only matter to the just
            ```

            ```
            dunno, while that might hamper her lakeomancy, it would make things that much easier to accidentally light on fire
            ```

            - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
              ```
              The perfect  blend of offensive power. Pure almighty destruction delivered by dropping lots of water on a small space.

              Also lighting everything on fire with demonic napalm!
              ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, this is not a "right or wrong depending on your point of view situation". The Prince had a foreign leader murdered to curb competition on his silver mines. Killing him isn't exactly the height of arbitrary vigilantism.
      ```

      - u/King_of_Men:
        ```
        That may or may not be true, but it has not been found to be so by a properly constituted Tribunal of the People. In any case the alleged act, if proven, would only be the usual corrupt jockeying of foreign autocrats; the victim being, herself, a "hereditary noble", one may reasonably question whether it was even a crime.
        ```
