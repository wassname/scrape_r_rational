  It's quest time! I take it the spell I suggested wasn't a good enough solution? Oh well, the solution chosen is better thematically anyways.

  Also well deserved verbal beat downs on murderous psychopaths are always great.

    I actually didn't know about Sequester Thoughts! I'd done a pretty big library search on spells that might have interesting interactions with memetics at the start of this but of course I didn't find that one until you mentioned it, well after I'd written a bunch of this. The perils of Pathfinder as a solution- there's always a spell, skill, or obscure feat that does it better.

  Good to see voldemort being called out on his cut rate social darwinist bullshit. his philosophy was always annoyingly bad, not that real world mass murderers and dictators were any better, so perhaps its accurate. 

  Also fun to see people making good use of the ridiculous amount of shit in the harry potter universe. (Re the ecological uselessness of the monsters, I always headcanoned that magical creatures in the harry potter verse were able to sustain themselves with magic, to at least some degree, in the same way that wizards can seemingly generate energy out of nothing with spells)

  So the concept isn't just a memetic virus that has mutated into better and better forms, but some kind of extra planar entity. Interesting, though in some ways I prefered the idea of it as an amoral nonsentient threat. 

  Speculating here, it seems like the entity is some kind of assimilating swarm, like an unfriendly ai scenario, trying to fill the universes with copies of itself? 

  Wonder why, since its seemingly from outside the "meta verse" they are operarting in, and has powers to manipulate the narrative universes, why does it have to struggle at all in conquering them? 
  Seems to be a limit on how much direct power can be exerted by it or a narrator. 

  I do like that this fiction comes with a genuinely interesting and novel metaphysics. Lots of fictions pay lipservice to the idea that beliefs can influence reality, and multiple universes, without really doing anything with them. The way this is written gives a sense that we are getting glimpses of a wider system with its own structure to it.

    Not yet, but thank you for asking!

    I'm planning on slowing down or taking a month off at the end of this arc while I move houses, and I didn't want to hold out my hat and then immediately take a break. I'll probably take the time to start one between this story and the next, whenever *that* is.
