## [RT][WP] An Advance In Time is a Fun What-if For Rationalists

### Post:

Ever dreamed of what you’d do if you were placed in the Middle Ages in a position of power? Reinventing the modern era is a much more complicated tech tree than you might think, but if you don’t want to wipe with moss forever, you might want to try. 

Oh, and the surrounding kingdoms might just want to take what you have by force. 

Think you could survive and thrive?

    An ongoing theme is the MC solving problems via figuring out technological or knowledge-based solutions to the problems at hand. Let me know if you disagree, though.

  Definitely getting echoes of A Hero's War or Release That Witch, except without magic.
