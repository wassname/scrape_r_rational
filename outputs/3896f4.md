## [BST] How would you optimize probability manipulation?

### Post:

Say that you had the ability to magically manipulate probability.  Rules are as follows:


1) You can manipulate probability to result in whatever you would like.  This takes place instantaneously (or as close as to make no difference), as soon as you will to do so.  You can affect your surroundings, but not the world outside of roughly line of sight (no summoning meteors or an empty cab in the middle of NYC)

2) You can calculate approximate relative odds by seeing or imagining the scenario.  Casinos and the stock market are traps for people having this ability, among other things.

3) Manipulating probability takes a physical toll in physical and mental exertion on an exponential scale.  Making a 50% chance come out the way you want is trivial, anything over 20% requires a major expenditure of effort.  Some users of this ability can reach 5 or 1% probability, but it risks serious injury or even death.

Within those limitations, what could you do with this power?  What further limitations might be necessary to make a compelling narrative with characters that have this ability?

  In that case, sell your services to the people who need 100% and only have 99.9%

  Inspect space launch vehicles and satalites. Work on high end process control and measurement. Verify medical test accuracy on ceos and a list actors.

    Good one!  Quality control would probably be a good way to go, and while a little suspicious, would be a lot easier to hide taking a regular salary then going to a casino.

  Given this, it seems like the best bet is to compound 50% chances. For example, the odds of a coin coming up heads are always ~50%, so I can do this as many times as I want in a row, even if the odds of flipping heads 50 times in a row are something like ~1/1,000,000,000,000,000.

  So going binary seems like the way to go, until this loophole gets closed.

  Simply seeing probabilities (without manipulating them) is almost more useful, because it would allow you a form of prescience. There probably needs to be some limitation on the time frame; if I'm looking at a television, can I see what the probabilities are for a poker game in the next room? Or better, the probability of an armed nuclear exchange, major terrorist attack, path of a hurricane, etc.?

  I don't necessarily think that you need to add in limitations to make for a compelling narrative; you just need a big enough threat.

  Probability is an abstraction, arguably even at the tiniest subatomic level that we can measure. Odds make sense in our heads - they tell stories in a satisfying way - but there isn't really a chance that a particular thing will happen. In a very real way, either it *will* happen or it *won't*. The concept of probability manipulation is as absurd as Superman picking up a whole car by lifting its bumper.

  It's one thing to change the wind or the speed of rotation and alter the result a coinflip. It's quite another to change the odds that a particular person knows your name, or that a particular product is available at a particular shop. In either of those cases even though you're *narratively* changing the present, you're *physically* changing the past.

  If changing the past is possible, then assume the character was born female. The odds that she would have been born female are roughly 50%, so it ought to be effortless to change. The male individual she changes into will be almost 100% likely to have lived an strikingly different life than she did.

  Alternately, the odds that she *was* born female is 100%, because there she is... female. So it ought to be practically impossible to change.

  Which one is easy and which one is hard?

  This sounds like a freak case, but the same thing is true about relatively bland probabilities like "What are the odds that this closet has a broom in it?"

  Speaking of which, developing perfects odds - whether you're a book maker or a meteorologist - is a matter of collecting enormous amounts of data and crunching the numbers. A magic ability could theoretically be doing exactly that, Asimov's psychohistory writ small, and it's a very powerful ability all by itself.

  Even without manipulation knowing that the ability says 80% can help you know how to bet, but you'll still be betting wrong 20% of the time.

  I am having trouble understanding the mechanism by which this world works.

  You say that if someone shot you you could manipulate the probability so he would not hit you\the hit would not be fatal.
  but also that if you were playing poker and that one of the other people has an ace you manipulation of the probability that you would get an ace would be changed.

  But these dont make sense, i mean to demonstrate the point if you are told that a new employee is going to enter the door to your office you could in theory place the probability that who will enter your office will be a man at 50%, but that would be wrong, because the person was already hired before and actually the probability is 99.999999% that the person would still be the same person which was hired and you weren't aware of until now, so how could you manipulate the probability?
  In the same sense if there is a pack of cards in a theoretical situation the probability that you would get an ace is 4/52, but in reality while you don't know it yet the cards already have a certain order.
  unless the event is based on some quantum phenomena generally the world is fairly deterministic.

  And once you go through this any kind of decision you will take with the power will by definition by arbitrary.

    You're a slider traveling through a certain space of worlds bound by your own uncertainty.

      Then how would the poker situation fit?
      Also your approach would essentially make -anything- possible based on what -I- think is possible, so if for some reason i thought that the probability of me becoming an omnipotent god is 50% i could change it to 100%.
      Or more in the context of the story, it would mean the author gets to pick any probabilities he wants because "that's what the character thinks".

  Can you inflate odds to something other than 100%?  For example, could you convert a 1% chance to a 10% chance?
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I'm, I'm guessing this is, this is working with a frequentist interpretation of probability? :s
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Seems so.  Admittedly, quantum measure seems to act irrevocably frequentist IRL, but I always wanted someone to make up this superpower *after* learning statistical mechanics and explain how to use it to go full Maxwell's Demon and circumvent the increase of entropy.
    ```

    - u/CFCrispyBacon:
      ```
      I'd be down with going full Maxwell's demon.  Another post here suggests inducing or delaying radioactive decay for a dirty bomb, which seems doable given time.  I could definitely see someone reversing entropy as a use of the power...if they could concentrate on moles of atoms interacting all at once, which seems either mechanically expensive, or requiring a LOT of imagination :).

  What about meta-application?

  You say

  >it risks serious injury or even death

  Since it's a risk and not a certanty couldn't you manipulate the probability of the after-effects of the power itself?

  I would personally safeguard the system from that kind of abuse.
  ```

  - u/CFCrispyBacon:
    ```
    Yeah, no meta-application.  I'd have it as the damage being a constant, but how much you hurt per application and how much your body can take is dependent on the individual's skill and power.  Kind of like the Dresden Files mages, who have a variety of skill and power depending on training and raw ability, but all take backlash from casting.

  Learn how to do things really well (parkour, for example) and engage it at the last minute to turn "well, that's cool, but it's only a matter of time until you land on something that doesn't like to get landed on" into "I AM THE ROOFTOP GOD, THE CONCRETE MESSIAH, WITNESS ME!".
  ```

- u/Running_Ostrich:
  ```
  You could go kinda meta with this and ask for a list of outcomes to affect in order to achieve some goal (eg. money without attracting attention or killing yourself). You generate this list by flipping coins to create a sequence of bits that you convert to text (which should have a 50% each flip).

  If you wanted to go a step further, you could ask for a list of outcomes to achieve your "best possible" (eg. CEV) world even if you don't know what it is. Though maybe it takes this a step too far if you can't visualize the outcome you want...
