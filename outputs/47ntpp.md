    Seems simple enough - we're living inside an eyeball, the strength of a bear is sexually transmitted, and the spirit animal of 'murica is coming to burn everything down.

  I have no idea what I'm looking at. Certainly not a role model for my own mind state when trying to accomplish a goal.

  Not many people here will engage you on this. The rationalist communities generally don't take kindly to anti-epistemology. I'm not exactly sure how what you've written relates to anything in the paragraph above, or how it's anti-rationalist in any way, but I suppose that might be the point?

  'Primal fiction,' using what you posted as an example, has been done elsewhere. If you're looking for rarely-coherent/surrealist/dada writing that appeals deeply on emotional and instinctual levels, I recommend you look into poetry, and probably heavy metal or other music along those lines. What you wrote did engage me somewhat on those levels, but the style in which it was presented (prose, all caps), does not lend itself to being accepted, especially here.

  You should read Howl, by Allen Ginsberg. I can only recommend Howl because it's the only other example of primally-engaging writing I can think of at the moment. You might want to be in a more motivational subgenre, though. Not all primal thoughts are about fucking tigers.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  Just a note, I think a lot of people are reading the first page of that thing and not the second.

  Your writing is pretty good.

  Trouble is... For neurotypical-esque people, rational thought (even on the level of just “common-sense skepticism”) works markedly better.

  Actually, the most important part of "getting shit done" seems to be being able to overcome executive dysfunction: procrastination, bad habits, etc.

  So, if you want to write fiction that goes against the classical paragdime of Rational Fiction (understand rules of magic, snap universe in half over knee) you might write something about a main character who Gets Shit Done™.

  Write someone who has a superhuman work ethic, incredible introspection, and lots of “skillpower”^(1). Such a person could, with relatively little epistemological prowess get a lot of shit done, though, say, politics.

  So... In essence... Write (the musical depiction of) Alexander Hamilton.

  ^(1): Term coined by Yoni Freidhoff M.D. to describe tricks that allow effective dieting — his thesis in *The Diet Fix* includes the fact that dieting by willpower is impossible.
