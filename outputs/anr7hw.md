## 12-part lecture on novel writing by Brandon Sanderson

### Post:

Just found this small channel has a 12-part lecture on novel writing by Brandon Sanderson from 2016. This should be very interesting for any aspiring authors in this sub and people that are just interested in his thoughts on the subject. Every part is roughly an hour long, so there is plenty of material. I haven't watched it completely yet, but so far it was very illuminating and has helped me a ton in deciding which elements were still missing in what I had written.

  For related viewing, the [Write About Dragons Youtube channel has Brandon Sanderson's 2013 lectures](https://www.youtube.com/user/WriteAboutDragons/featured) , and [the 2014 lectures are available courtesy of the BYU English department channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRO9W1Nmh6clZP-IAhMeMpMru7vJaW7KJ).  And [here's an unofficial mirror of the 2012 lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHlanlzaIY&list=PLSTzdBlo5WBCsSpT-dN56bwbo5ig03cgR).

  He tends to cover the same topics from year to year, and while the lectures do improve in many ways as he refines the lesson plans and addresses more details, I also find that the younger versions of Brandon tend to be a bit more sensitive to the mindset of beginner writers, in the same way that if you're trying to pass freshman calculus, a sophomore TA can sometimes be a better teacher than a tenured professor.  If you consider yourself a complete neophyte, I think there's a case to be made for going back to his older material.

  In particular, the one lecture that I constantly find myself coming back to is [Brandon Sanderson's lecture on description and viewpoint recorded from his 2010 Jordancon panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdjAuKOAGx0), and if you only have 1 hour to spend learning how to become a better writer, I can't think of a better way to spend it than watching this video.  (The video is 2 hours long, but the latter half is mostly Q&A, which is still worth watching but less essential.)  Watching this lecture as a wee undergrad is the reason I'm a professional author today, and I watch the video once every couple years just because it's such a great way to review the fundamentals of writing.

  His [2010 Jordancon lecture on plotting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZsDyyMS8G0) and [2011 Jordancon lecture on Sanderson's Second Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZQwkBFAm14) are also very good.

  Brandon Sanderson also has a weekly podcast, Writing Excuses, which he co-hosts with several other authors, including Dan Wells, Mary Robinette Kowal, and Howard Taylor, with many guest authors featuring prominently in recent seasons.  As Writing Excuses has gone on, it feels like in an effort to cover more territory they spend less time on fundamentals from a new author perspective, and more time on increasingly specific topics, and I think most of the best lessons I got from Writing Excuses came in the first 6 seasons.  (In particular, I've listened to seasons 3-5 of Writing Excuses at least three times each.)  That being said, some of the more recent episodes cover lots of interesting topics, like interviewing NASA astronauts to ask questions about things that authors get wrong about space, and other similar topics that are highly specific but nonetheless very cool (and probably very helpful to a specific audience of people).

    What do you listen to Writing Excuses on? I find the two podcast apps I use only have the most recent season

      Nowadays, when I want to go back to a specific old episode, I just use the embedded web player on the Writing Excuses website (which works just as well if you're listening from your phone); each episode has a separate post with the embedded web player and a direct link to the MP3.

      If you want to download an entire season for offline listening, probably the best way to do that would be to go to the [season archives page](https://writingexcuses.com/season001/) that lists all of the episodes for that season (including direct MP3 links), and then use a download manager to download all of the files linked on that page that have a .mp3 file extension.  From there you can transfer the MP3s to a device and media player of your choice.  For Firefox, I use the [DownThemAll](https://www.downthemall.net/) extension, and a quick Google search turned up Chrome plugins like [Batch Link Downloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/batch-link-downloader/aiahkbnnpafepcgnhhecilboebmmolnn?hl=en-US) among many other download managers that appear to accomplish the same thing.

  I haven't taken the course yet, but I recommend the notes from it (if only to see if you are interested in the content): [here (google docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpHaeK464xN2aqQm3QipYWbawuabEoCjg4HUe5CMkRo/edit) and [here](https://getoutoftherecliner.wordpress.com/2016/10/18/brandon-sanderson-318r-1/).

    Holy fuck that is a ton of effort you put into that. Props to you for sharing. I was contemplating going back and doing screenshots of his whiteboard drawings as a memory aid.

      I'm glad you like it, but I can't take credit! I am yet to take the course ;) I did some digging and apparently /u/chandlerjbirch is the [author](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/41uon1/brandon_sanderson_writing_lectures/cz5bgko/). As for the second notes, you can check the author's [about page](https://getoutoftherecliner.wordpress.com/about/). Kudos to them both!

  I started the first lectures half a year ago and forgot about it. It's a great ressource.

      That's more a flaw of the notes than of the lecture itself, or at least not of the lectures I've been watching (the 2016 ones linked in this post). He doesn't really outline 2/3 as a rule, and goes into quite a bit of detail about what he means by the three traits, and how he recommends they should be used. I'm not sure myself where the 2/3 thing came from, so it's either something he said in an earlier version of the class that he later went back on, or an incorrect interpretation by the person taking notes. 

      Korra was probably something *he* didn't mention, and instead something a student mentioned, because he tends to ask the class for examples of things he's talking about. It's quite possible he hasn't seen the show and just went along with it.

      Also important to mention, because the notes don't make it clear enough, that he's very emphatic about his recommendations not being hard-and-fast rules. He says in pretty much every video that people should just try stuff and then drop it if it doesn't work well for their particular writing style.
