  He should start some sort of large scale public program to fulfil some of these goals. Hire a number of local civilians to repair broken windows, repaint places, educate people, vaccinate people, provide cheap healthcare, lots of vaguely beneficial things. These people should be equipped with radios and make frequent reports to a hub somewhere. They can interview mentally ill people (for jobs), search out for metahumans, serve as targets for criminal activity you can intervene in and such.

  You should also have your research team look into night vision scopes for guns, and see if they can devise something suitable. Get some military grade smoke grenades. Research some sort of stun weapon if possible- perhaps using drugs, electricity, gas clouds. To take in dangerous criminals safely. Look into getting some heavy military weaponry for superman level enemies. Do some research on dyes and other chemicals- do any of them have some sort of depressive or hypnotic or sleep effect?

  You should also start a major radio tower research program. Perhaps there's some way to convert images into radio waves and vice versa? Perhaps some sort of switchboard to allow fast communication across the city? Start building some radio towers to improve coordination and have the research team try out some technologies in each. You should be like the ninja, in the shadows, with perfect information, knowing all, intervening where necessary against foes. 

  Perhaps devise some sort of sky scanning group. Use radio waves and light telescopes and such to scan the skies. Nothing too expensive, just something to protect against fliers like superman. Perhaps devise some sort of light or radio based rain/ cloud detector so activities can be planned around the weather.

  When fighting against foes you may be injured and be infected. Start a major research program where you test a variety of chemicals for activity against infection. Dyes, chemicals, whatever. Grow many disease cultures and test whatever you can find against them. Plants too, every chemical possible. Do some material sciences, see if materials can be made that resist bullets and knives better. Flexible ones.

  It might also be worth seeing if there are any chemicals that could be causing this rise in insanity. I heard that tetraethyllead is being introduced in a lot of car engines. Seems like madness to me. We've known since roman times that it drives people insane. Have my scientists do animal testing on a host of natural compounds used in cars and other things to see if any seem to drive them insane.

  Electronics is another area we should prioritize. For example, vacuum tubes, a major components of radios. They're pretty expensive and have a fairly short life. Have my team do some experiments on each, see if we can develop improvements, look for ways to better integrate them into radio towers. Batteries too. We need to be more connected than anyone else, any advances in electronics would be great.

  Forensic sciences would be good. Get together some chemicals, metallurgists and such and have them work together to devise new techniques for tracking crimes, detecting poisons, finding where bullets came from, reading finger prints. Is there some element that is unique to each person? Encourage them to take samples and see if there are some ways of finding people from what remains they leave at a crime scene. Hair analysis, skin analysis, chemical analysis of the body.

  A lot of this work will require maths and careful statistics. If there's an outbreak of insanity we need to track where it is. Hire some statisticians and mathematicians and such to track various problems in the city. Perhaps try to develop some more powerful arithrometer, mechanical or otherwise. Ideally I'd like to be able to take radio data from throughout the city and display it on some sort of screen in a graphical manner that would let me track various situations, and perform maths on it as necessary.

  Sorry for the sparse updates, folks, but me and /u/CubicZirconium are students and distracted by studenty things. Pace should pick up considerably as we properly enter the Summer.
