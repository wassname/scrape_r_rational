  So… has Dr. Fuji forgotten about Mewtwo, or does he consider the Master Ball more heinous, or is that the April Fools joke?

  If it's not a joke this may relate to Leaf's research.

    The Master Ball catches anything without fail. For the games, we tend to use it on Legendaries only. For narrative purposes, if the possessor succeeds in catching a legendary, they instantly wield incredible power.

      I wonder if it’s powerful enough to be used to capture people without doing the brain-scramble thing.
      ```

      - u/sibswagl:
        ```
        I think it has to be more than just removing that limitation. Humanballs (heh) would be very easy to abuse, but there are also a lot of legitimate uses.

        My theory is that the Master Ball is *really damn good* at the sort of training/loyality induction/brainwashing normal pokeballs do.
        ```

    - u/Electric999999:
      ```
      Isn't that good news though, they can finally do something about Legendaries.  

      Sure there's issues regarding who gets to use it, but it's fundamentally a great invention.
      ```

      - u/partner555:
        ```
        Yes, but like you said, the issue is with what comes after. If only one faction has a legendary, they'll instantly wield incredible power over everybody else. That's going to cause so many issues in the immediate short-term and perhaps long-term as well.

        The only way to stop all the bad things from happening is for every major faction to have legendaries of their own. MAD will then be in place and they'll keep each other in check, but until the political landscape shifts into that new equilibrium, there'll be trouble with only one faction wielding that incredible power.
        ```

  - u/newstorkcity:
    ```
    I don’t understand why the masterball would be considered more heinous, given that they already catch Pokémon all the time. Maybe because of the potential to catch legendaries, which could be very dangerous in the hands of a person?
    ```

    - u/sibswagl:
      ```
      Could be an interesting philosophical discussion. Blue's on the "we need to capture legendaries (and maybe give them out to establish a MAD status quo)" side; maybe Fuji is on the "capturing even a single legendary is a terrible idea" side.
      ```

      - u/DavidGretzschel:
        ```
        The "capturing even a single legendary is a terrible idea" side doesn't make too much sense to me. Because it essentially is a "don't defend yourself against threat"-side.  
        If you're worried about the power equilibrium, simply kill the captured legendary afterwards.
        ```

        - u/Redditor76394:
          ```
          I think the real concern is trusting the human to use the legendary for the benefit for humankind. For all of their strength and destructive power, wild legendaries attack infrequently. A human wielding a legendary could decide to take over a country and become a king or emperor. Who could stop them? No one has ever successfully beaten a legendary so far, let alone one given strategy by humans.
          ```

          - u/DavidGretzschel:
            ```
            &#x200B;

            >No one has ever successfully beaten a legendary so far, let alone one given strategy by humans.

            Surge killed Kyogre by feeding it a Magnezone, didn't he?  
            Well, it was a team effort, but I like the idea that this was a delayed killing blow.

            &#x200B;

            > A human wielding a legendary could decide to take over a country and become a king or emperor. Who could stop them?

            I think that's what psychic warlords were back in the day. Close to the same argument could be made against the invention of the Pokéball.  
            Chemical warfare with smogmog, area denial with grimers. Firebombing with Charizards.  
            That hasn't happened, because the people on this world are no less creative, but far more reasonable. Don't think that would change. Thanks to Red's mass proliferation of Abras, you won't have much fun playing tyrant, anyway.

            The threat that I see with killing/catching legendaries, is unintended consequences. Their origin is not natural evolution.  
            This implies Eldritch intelligent intent.  
            Waking up Groudon woke up the aquarium fish, this woke up Rayquaza. And those Regi-things.  
            Killing a legendary or catching it, apparently incurs "divine" retribution.

            The risk in overthrowing the status quo lies in "What comes next?".  
            There are right and wrong answers, but not obvious ones.

            Perhaps you should catch a legendary ASAP, to have a fighting chance of all the ones, that will awaken soon.
            ```

            - u/RemarkableYou7310:
              ```
              Were Groupon and Kyogre killed? I mean were the killS ensured?
              ```

              - u/DavidGretzschel:
                ```
                Presumably known or assumed, but discussed only off-screen.  
                Feel that's missing from the story.  
                Like... after the fight, I want to know whether Kyogre and Groudon is dead. If there are corpses.  
                But then again... the author doesn't want to talk about where the legendaries fly off to, when they're not currently creating disaster.  
                Like, what's Zapdos' off-season like?  
                Wherever they are, they'd bring disaster, but they have to be somewhere at all times.  
                This should be both highly plot-relevant, but I guess it's better to only write this, when you need to, to not constrain your plot space prematurely.  
                Guess that's in the nature of a serial.
                ```

    - u/WankSocrates:
      ```
      My theory is the "master" in "masterball" is far more literal in this case - what it does is take the conditioning to the logical extreme and strip/block the sentience and individuality off a Pokemon caught by it, making them a perfect, flawlessly obedient killing machine but one trapped inside its own head so to speak.

      Higher capture-rates are replaced in this world by Pokeballs having capacity limits(?) and I believe it was at least implied during the Karen Intermission chapter that an Ultraball could snag a legendary, it's just so insanely, suicidally dangerous that nobody's survived the attempt.

      ... Huh, on that note, is it mentioned anywhere how big Zapdos actually is in this?
      ```

      - u/Ready-Dragonfly925:
        ```
        So it was meant for MewTwo?
        ```

      - u/Duck__Quack:
        ```
        If it differs from the canon 1.6m, I'm not aware of it. That's about the size of a cassowary, and a good bit shorter than an ostrich.

        My guess is that an Ultra Ball has the highest range lock-on cone, which is why Karen used one. It's just, as you mention,  suicidally difficult to get close enough to the death turkey to catch it.
        ```

        - u/RemarkableYou7310:
          ```
          It is heavily implied to be much bigger. At least that's the vibe I got as the bird could be seen from a fair bit of distance away. Though I don't remember any specifications.
          ```

          - u/gamerpenguin:
            ```
            It probably is bigger, but it could just be added visibility from a steady continuously moving lightning ball around it
            ```

      - u/DavidGretzschel:
        ```
        The conditioning already turns wild, willful animals and turns them into obedient, cuddly pets that yearn for your approval.  
        That will however fight to the death to protect you.  
        They already are perfect, flawless, obedient killing machines for "humans", in general.

        I figured that this was an early design choice and nothing fundamental to the tech at all.  
        Why would it be difficult to condition pokémon for obedience to the trainer but without any regard for humans in general?  
        Figured that the renegades we see (apart from the wheedle trainer, who raised it out of her ball) would just use pokéball tech with different conditioning, already.
        ```

        - u/WankSocrates:
          ```
          >They already are perfect, flawless, obedient killing machines

          They're not, though. Blue's Shiftry is the best example we've seen of how the Pokeball conditioning tech isn't a guarantee. Even caught and conditioned that thing was still vicious and specifically called out by Brock's second(?) as a Pokemon which was only barely under control.

          Another is the Squirtle/Tortodile injury incident. "When their blood's up" were Blue's words for how they can and do ignore commands to stop in the heat of the moment.

          The main thing existing conditioning does is make targeting humans unacceptable. Other than that, a lot of bets are off. A ball that strips away all that instinct and makes them into biological robots is both monstrous and plausibly something someone would want to develop here.

          It's just my theory, I could be *way* off the mark, but it seems to fit with what information we have about the setting and mechanics of things.

          Edit: and an obvious point - conditioning != training. The Master Ball might also be intended to imprint sets of commands, conditioned Pokemon still need to be trained properly. This might be designed to bypass that issue.
          ```

          - u/DavidGretzschel:
            ```
            Well fair enough, it is not perfect.

            But it's a lot closer to perfection than what we get for animals.  
            I don't see how being even more perfect would be considerably more extreme by any standard that values the original mind state of the creature.  
            I can't help but seeing the current conditioning being already extreme, because I'm anchored by real world standards.

            Reminds me of Leaf being shocked at Bill's solution of simply copy-pasting an individual species-mind for a whole population to quick-pacify them. It's not that I can't appreciate the technical distinctions, but they aren't too interesting to me.  
            Don't value animal mindstates as an inherent good, at all.

            Oh well, maybe it's another Leaf-concern.
            ```

    - u/CarVac:
      ```
      True.

      I wonder what will be the explanation for the difficulty in mass production—or will there be plenty supply available what with the advanced fabrication technology?
      ```

      - u/newstorkcity:
        ```
        Interesting point about supply. Perhaps the heinousness and the method of production are related? I could see why Mr. Fuji would think it is terrible if you have to, idk, sacrifice a virgin during a new moon to create a masterball.
        ```

        - u/sibswagl:
          ```
          Or perhaps the Master Ball interacts with sentients in some way? I'm assuming it's more complex than just "captures humans with no drawbacks", because that sounds incredibly useful. A high possibility for abuse, of course, but I'm not sure I'd describe it as "heinous".

          My theory is that the Master Ball removes the "brain dead" limitation and is *really damn good* at the sort of training/loyality induction/brainwashing normal pokeballs do.
          ```

          - u/DavidGretzschel:
            ```
            But the brainwashing is already perfect.  
            It turns wigglytuff from a predator into a cuddly pillow.  
            And makes all fliers carry you on your back.  
            We can't even make horses rideable reliably, when that's not done at a young age. Even then, many horses will only be ridden by riders they trust. Horses have been bred for that exact purpose for millenia.

            And our wild horses are not in the habit of fuck-off hyberbeaming you like a Dragonite, when you look at them the wrong way.

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    My impression is that Mewtwo *is* the friend he’s worrying about; not only could it be a huge problem by allowing [anyone?] to capture legendaries, it would also threaten the safety/independence of Mewtwo.
    ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    I initially read it as suggesting the process of research was heinous--that they slaughtered/tortured/etc. Pokemon to create it, or that they experimented on humans for some reason.

    After reading some of the other comments, though, I'm leaning towards the same way atomic physicists talked about the Manhattan Project. They knew the concentration of power was going to have moral implications, that the cat was out of the bag, and that their employer was actively planning to deploy it.
    ```

    - u/CarVac:

      I feel like heinous might be a misleading word choice then.

      A bomb deployed as a deterrent isn't heinous; using it on civilians is heinous.

  Hello! I guess this might be a little weird to ask, but, I was wondering if you have any advice on how you expand the pokemon locations when you're writing?

  I'm trying to write a pokemon fic myself which was heavily inspired by how this story treated places like Cerulean City and made them feel like places I'd love to visit, so I've been trying to draw on that similar sort of way of expanding the cities into the pokemon world that lived in everyone's heads when we first played the games, but I don't think I have the hang of it yet.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I try to draw inspiration from real cities, personally. What do "tourist cities" have that make them "touristy?" What do coastal cities "feel like?" Then I think about what flavor of the city is in the region, what the "story" behind it is, the same way "New York" or "Paris" or "Miami" or "Tokyo" or "San Francisco" and so on all have cultural feelings wrapped around them, particularly different cities within the same region/state (like, San Francisco vs Los Angeles). And finally I just spend some time "walking" the city in my head, deliberately imagining the sorts of things I'd see in a city within the pokemon world, the sorts of stores that would exist to cater to trainers, coordinators, the sorts of media that would be on display, etc.

    You might also find other inspiration available in the anime or manga, but I haven't used it, personally.

        If I may interject as a bystander....  As you likely know, Kanto and the other in-game regions are modelled after real-world locations.  Similarly, the various towns and localities also correspond to real locations.  So, you might find it worthwhile to do some light research on, for example, Tsuchiura City, the real-world version of Cerulean City, and see if anything about it inspires you.

  ```
  I predict that the horribleness of the Master Ball is that it bumps up the capture rate by wiping the mind of the pokemon, and then programs them with the bare minimum to function and execute attacks. But it's like commanding a zombie with no initiative outside of your orders.

  After all, people have been working on improving capture tech to transport humans. Why not go in the reverse direction and induce the same thing that happens to humans in pokemon as well so you can be certain they won't resist the capture?

      ```
      Yes there are justified uses when talking about the Legendaries. However the problem is that the power is so easily abusable by people grabbing strong Pokemon without being trained or vetted by experienced Pokemon trainers. And that's not even getting into the Renegades who can't be trusted with any strong Pokemon.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Can't people already do that? In this story, it doesn't look like a pokemon can resist the capture the way they can in the anime/games.

  Ooh! It's been a long time since I've seen the "masterballs are evil" trope. Last time was when I read Latias' Journey/Brave New World, where the Masterballs were all portals to the same hell-like pocket dimension ruled over by the evil glitch pokemon MissingNo.

  Can't wait to see your take on it.

  Also I'm curious how Team Plasma will react. Speaking of Team Plasma, do they know of Leaf's plan for permanently saving humankind from the threat of wild pokemon attacks so that humans will no longer hate/fear pokemon? Do they know her plan requires humans to catch 'em all?

  And does *Blue* know of Leaf's plan? I feel like with his whole #WhatComesNext thing he'd ought to be collabing with her. Giovanni obviously knows Leaf has a plan to permanently end the threat of wild pokemon attacks that doesn't require a FOOMed Mewtwo, even if he doesn't know what it is. And it was Giovanni who gave Blue the idea for #WhatComesNext to begin with. Collabing with Leaf on her project feels like a no-brainer.

  Also, Leaf's plan would involve catching *a LOT* of wild pokemon, which would be a boon for pokemon research including Red's. And the sooner her plan succeeds, the sooner they can convince Giovanni that humankind doesn't need a FOOMed Mewtwo to survive.

  Honestly at this point Leaf's plan ought to be the highest priority thing for all the main characters, with the Silph investigation only being the second-highest priority.

  I love the detail of Unown being simple enough to factor out common data and identify which parts predict their size/weight/shape.

  It also seems that Hidden Power isn't understood. I suppose that justifies the name, but it makes me think someone is going to figure out how to get an Unown to fight, possibly as a downstream consequence of Red's Other research. Is Secret Power a move in this setting?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    It's funny because, as you said, the name gave a good excuse to have it not be known, but also the latest Pokemon games actually deleted a bunch of moves, including Hidden Power... which leaves Unown without any! 

    (Unown aren't in Sword/Shield yet, of course, so it's not a huge deal that the move doesn't exist (though it does have implications for the competitive scene), but once they're in the next game I expect it'll be back in the games again)
    ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  I was actually thinking about the master ball a few chapters ago, and what a 100% catch rate ball would be in this universe. My guess is it has longer range and faster lock-on time, meaning you just have to point and catch - no throwing necessary. The thing is, it seems like that would kind of ruin the story. Sure, maybe it needs rare or expensive materials, but if a company can make one then a country could make dozens. Almost every legendary is caught within a few months, and it just seems like an anticlimax. You could shift to politicking about how you use the caught gods, but it would feel kind of strange tonally. 

  This made me dismiss the idea. But now it's being brought up, so I'm guessing there's more of an interesting story to tell here than i thought.

    I read after some revisions had already taken place--it's unusual for me to wait any amount of time on the 1st! As a result I noticed things that are a little subtler than usual, though:

    1) but I'm definitely going to buy some stronger pokemon to round out my belt with other strong pokemon."

    Strong pokemon thing gets a bit repetitive; this could probably end at "my belt."

    2) and there are some other pokemon that can naturally use Psychic or Ghost type attacks but not Psychic ones, or vice versa… you've been measuring two different things?"

    I think "Psychic or Ghost" here should just be Ghost?

    3) "Oh, yes, I'm sorry I've lost all my manners… come in, come in out of the cold…"

    "I'm sorry I've lost all my manners" here reads like an apology specifically about having lost his manners, which could be it? But if the sorry is about leaving them out there, and the manners are an explanation, a comma after sorry would probably be preferable.

    4) Minoru how did you end up here?

    Comma after Minoru.

    Another great chapter, thanks!

  > "I can't do telekinesis. Like, at all. I've merged with a dozen different psychic pokemon and even a couple other people as they used their own, and I'm just not able to do it." He sets the rock down and takes another chip. "The thing is, most ghosts can't either unless you use a TM on them."

  I wonder what would happen if Red merged with a pokemon, then used a telekinesis TM on it while merged. Or are TMs applied to a pokemon while it is in a pokeball?
  ```

  - u/ForMyWork:
    ```
    Actually, this brings up an interesting question about merging in general with a TM being given, particularly with psychics, or indeed ghosts with the seperation possibility between them. Though, I do seem to have the impression they are done in the ball.  Obviously hard to merge with that, but it would certainly be something I'd be interested in reading about him trying if it is possible to learn a TM outside the ball. Maybe something to bring up with Bill or Oak.
    ```

    - u/Chosen_Pun:
      ```
      In OoTS, TMs involve hacking the pokémon's data while digitized to "install" the technique, and, in some cases, physically rearrange the pokémon's organs to give them new capabilities entirely - the canon extreme case being Rhyhorn's Flamethrower. I don't believe it's possible to psychically merge with the pokèmon while this process takes place.
      ```

- u/Luminous_Lead:
  ```
  "If ghosts and psychics are just different concentrations of a pair of phenomenon... and there are some other pokemon that can naturally use Psychic or Ghost type attacks but not Psychic ones, or vice versa… "

  This sentence feels a bit ambiguous for me.

    Fixed, thanks!
