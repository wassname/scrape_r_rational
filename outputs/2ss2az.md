  Her dad is so laid-back about the whole torture thing that he's kind of creeping me out.

    It makes me wonder if something's up. Maybe the drow did something or being resurrected by the God of Death did?

      Would I do such a thing?
      ```

        Yes, you would. :) However I've got the feeling that Suze is holding the idiot ball on this one. Given her boosted Int score she should be more cunning.

          Well, if I *were* planning something that heinous, I would probably respond by saying something about "just getting over a mental breakdown", or...ah...oh, "one level higher" (that's always a good one around here), or maybe "Jesus, just enjoy the ~~movie~~ book and say ten MST3K mantras and have a nice lie-down". (Well, ok, maybe not that last one. (*))

          Of course, I am absolutely categorically NOT, I repeat NOT, planning anything that heinous as far as you know for sure. 


          (*) I've been watching a bit too much of the ridiculously funny and VERY foul-mouthed (NSFW) "zero punctuation" channel on YouTube and apparently I'm channeling Yahtzee. Sorry about that.

      Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking. His behavior definitely hints at something fucked-up going on.
      ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Yeah, about that, I'm pretty confident that there's something going on there. Maybe some intervention from the Drow Priestess who would be motivated to ensure that Suze was receiving the 'best' advice.

  Although I really, really enjoyed part one of Two Year Emperor, these most recent chapters are constantly reminding me of the line "So, I told you that story so I could tell you this one."  I'm finding Suze's story a lot more compelling than Jake's.

  Keep up the good work!

  I had a feeling that there was a *secret* behind the identity of the fortune teller.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Heh. I didn't think I was being that subtle, but maybe I was. [The fortune teller ](#s "wasn't Herrún"). Actually, [she was ](#s "Loki -- he does that whole gender-bending thing, you know. Even gave birth a couple times.")

  ```
  Man, I can't see a not-tarot-card-deck reading in fiction these days without wondering what Persona or Stand that card would be associated with.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    For the unenlightened, this means...?
    ```

    - u/Drazelic:
      ```
      Stands are from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, whole Personas are from... Persona. Basically, both are sets of themed superpowers embodied in spirit guardians, designed to counterbalance each other, one power per card per wielder. They're part of sort of a subgenre of story setups where the protagonist gets a power and then is told that X other people in the world also got different unique powers and now they have to fighht to the death because reasons- very Highlander-esque.

      Generally, works in this slightly nebulous genre have powersets which tend to be slightly more unique than regular comicbook characters. For example, one character in JJBA basically has the power to turn anything he touches into a time-delayed explosive. Another character can attack your reflection in a mirror, inflicting damage to you without being near you. The appeal of the genre lies partially in how the protagonist works their way around such seemingly OP powers with tricks and clever utilization of their own card, which is partially why I was reminded of the genre.

  Just commenting to let you know it's being read, lovely chapter.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Thank you, much appreciated.

  This is one of those things that depends on interpretation, but I always thought that for a handy haversack: "each [pocket] is like a bag of holding" would mean that it responds similarly to portable holes.

  You might be able to place a bag of holding in a handy haversack. Rope trick states that "It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one." But, bags of holding are nondimensional rather than extradimensional.

  Anyway, aside from rules lawyering, I enjoyed this chapter, I think the pace is picking up again and you're back into the swing of things.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    My interpretation has always been that the rules say "if you put a Bag of Holding in a Portable Hole...."  They do *not* say "if you put something that works like a Bag of Holding in a Portable Hole...."

    I did this for Grǫfhamr as well -- the whole place is made of Portable Holes, but the Landguard walked in with their Handy Haversacks no problem.  Albrecht hadn't even *heard* of Bags of Holding or their bad interaction with PHs; he was appalled that anyone would invent such a thing.
