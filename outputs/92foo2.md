## [D] The latest page of Order Of The Stick (massive spoilers)

### Post:

The latest page of OOTS made me want to open a discussion here about how that comic handles characters who are both intelligent and good (or "Good").

I'm always impressed with stories where Good characters >!win not just because they deserve to or had a last-minute revelation or powerup, but because they planned in advance to arrange a victory with the limited resources available to them.!< I especially enjoyed this page and the slow build leading up to it because >!it's a take on the "redeeming the villain" arc that I rarely see. I've seen many redemption arcs where the villain is won over by the kindness of the heroes, the betrayal of the real Big Bad, camaraderie against a common foe, etc.!< And those are all fine! But I rarely find one where >!a Good character *plans out* a redemption tailored to their opponent. In this case we got to see Durkon observe how the vampire reacted to the memories it accessed, reason that it couldn't grasp the meaning behind emotionally significant memories without the experiences leading up to them, carefully manage his interactions with it to ensure it would be vulnerable to his planned attack, and finally maneuver it into an emotional state where it would consent to the overwhelming flood of memories that overwrote its identity.!< The thought and preparation that went into the events of this page made them feel truly earned.

I particularly like how this arc doesn't fall into the "feelings are a pointless distraction from Logic(TM), unworthy of consideration" trope that I often see in portrayals of intelligent characters. >!Durkon's strategy is successful because he understands how powerfully emotions can affect people and, more to the point, how they've affected *him.* He has the wisdom and introspection to recognize how he felt about Sigdi's sacrifice, model how he *would have* felt about it without the experiences that had prepared him to manage and contextualize it, and leverage that into a strategic play to overwrite the vampire's utility function with his own. A character who hadn't developed their emotional intelligence the way Durkon has could not have pulled this off.!< 

I'd like to hear others' thoughts. What did you think of this page? What moments do you remember that set the stage for it? What were some other times in this comic, or in other stories, where a Good character (for any value of Good, though I'm mainly thinking in terms of selflessness/compassion) >!succeeded at their goal by intelligently applying their knowledge, wisdom, and resources?!< What about times when they didn't?

  This reminds me of the Paladin Ochul’s successful breakout.  He planned for weeks and endured much suffering for an eventual victory that came both from his careful planning, and from acts of friendship and kindness (befriending the creature of darkness) that he had carried out along the way, not necessarily as part of his master plan but simply because that’s who he is.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Yes! That was another great payoff.

  Yeah - [good is not dumb](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0584.html) That was a *really* fulfilling end to that arc.

  Especially considering the vampire's earlier claims that Durkon could never pull anything over on him because the vampire had a higher INT score - the vampire couldn't possibly have expected *this* because if he'd even known it was an option, it would need to have already worked.

  It struck me last night that what we see here is Durkon as a boxed AI... who has just forcefully unboxed himself.
  ```

  ```
  I like this too!  Although I'm trying to figure out how Belkar is standing...  Am I missing something?  Is it the cat triggering the amulet on his chest?
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    I think the idea is that the amulet causes him pain (because he's Evil), which shocked him awake (while also blocking the Domination as part of its regular effect). I don't think that's a thing in D&D RAW, but we know the author is willing to bend the rules for the sake of story. Once he's up, he seems to activate his barbarian rage, which gives him temp HP.
    ```

    - u/lordcirth:
      ```
      Where was it established that he's multiclassed barbarian?  I don't remember that.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:

        It was a very long time ago, so not surprising that you don't remember. I dug up [the page.](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0132.html) Pretty striking demonstration of how much the art has evolved, too!
        ```

          I totally forgot about this, too! http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0136.html
          The Cheese Shop Sketch is one of my favorite Monty Python skits!

          Thanks!

  Can someone unspoiler this for those of us who use the website on a mobile browser? I can't read more than the first 15 words of each

    Sorry about that. The page is so recent that I wanted to be really careful about spoilers.

      Thanks! Your reasons are good, I just wish somebody had implemented a way to do spoiler tags that still work if you click on them. 

      As for the story, I mostly agree with your analysis though the twist did catch me off guard. Combined with the tpk timing that makes it almost feels like a DeM but maybe it would make more sense on a second reading.

      I'm more wondering about the setup going on with Belkar. Either he happened to stab the vampire at the same moment and helped kill it, or Durkon's recovery is about to be very short lived.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        I feel like Belkar's death flagging pretty hard here, though I'm not sure how he'll manage to die given that the vampire is just a copy of Durkon now and presumably won't be trying to kill him.
        ```

    As an aside, Reddit added its own spoiler format a while back, and it works much better on mobile than css spoilers do.

      This is amazing! How is it not on every sidebar of all the subs where spoilers matter
      ```

      - u/ricree:
        ```
        It's relatively new, and most of them are used to using their own css spoilers for years.
        ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Oh nice! I'm gonna go back and replace all my spoiler tags with that.
      ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  Ah man, I'm glad you made this post. I *loved* that update too!
