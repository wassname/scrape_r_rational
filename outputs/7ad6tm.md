## What's going on with Marked for Death?

### Post:

So I mostly follow MfD for the storyline, only really dipping into the comments around it to see reactions to the chapters as they come out - I don't typically follow along with all the planning and discussion that goes on in between chapters.

As far as I can tell, seems like during the Chuunin Exams the authors decided the plan wasn't good enough/would get everyone killed, so they're rolling back to before that incident?

Does that about sum it up, or is there some other reason it's been just omakes and interludes for the last few weeks that I'm not understanding?

  No, that's not quite right.

  MfD was originally running on a custom-made RPG system (how dice are rolled, how skills work, etc). This system had a number of flaws and went through a rework a while back.

  The upcoming battle revealed that the system's cognitive load on the QMs was too high, so the quest is on hiatus while they figure out which system to switch to and what house rules are needed to make it fit MfD.

    To add to this:

    * The old system was math-heavy in a bad way (i.e. raising things to the 0.65th power)
    * Location in battle was pretty ad-hoc.
    * There was no easy way to test if ninjutsu/etc. were balanced.

    All combined, even setting up, let alone running the battle would have been a full-time job.

    Also,

    MfD's SOP is that if the MC dies, the thread will re-roll (or riot =).  Hazou was not expected to survive this long.

      Those factors combined sound like the solution lies not in picking a simpler system (though that could *sidestep* the problems), but rather in moving (at least for battles) from a pen-and-paper system to a computerized simulation. I.e., build a (simple, probably non-graphical) game engine to do the game's math for you.

      This would then let you test rules-balance by 1. coming up with various scenarios that "should" be balanced, 2. programming them into the engine, 3. playing them out numerous times, and 4. calculating win ratios; and then adjusting the rules until the win-ratios for things that "should" be balanced are actually balanced.

      (Of course, this is a lot easier if you also throw in an AI player that can automate step 3, but that's a much larger can of worms than just a turn-based knockback-and-wounds tracker.)

        Are you saying, we should have a MfD videogame? :D

        Somewhat relevant (-ish; also sorry for the self-link):

And how tinkering with various variables (e.g. spell travel speed, required time for complete Apparition, possible frequency of multiple Apparitions for an ”average” wizard, etc) would be changing the general outcomes in various scenarios (e.g. a group of NPCs fighting against another, a group fighting against a unit, a group chasing after another, etc).

        I'm pretty sure that attempts to do so have been made, but I think they've failed.

          They have not failed. They were in the process of being made at the time that the QMs decided to move away from the system.

    This on its own is a fascinating short story about the RPG community.

    Ah, okay. Thanks for the clarification!

      We're having fun at least with the interludes, and we're getting a more fleshed out setting from them, but even some of the most patient among us are getting a bit stir-crazy.

      If you're curious about what forms the new system might take, the three main contenders were HERO, Mutants & Masterminds, and Dresden Files RPG.  M&M was the one they were going for until a little while ago where they shifted more towards DFRPG, and it's likely that in the next week or two they'll get a preliminary draft of the rules for the new system up so that the playerbase can figure out how to break it and in so doing inform the QMs what still needs to be fixed.

          How can it be filler if we're the ones writing it? ;>

        As a lurker, I'm having a great time. I knew Kei/Nara was a great idea but I had no idea it could be this good.
