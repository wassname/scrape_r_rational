## [BST] Designing a Constitution?

### Post:

Mad Queen Bunny has been getting involved in war and politics. As the result of one short war's surrender terms, a post-American city-state is about to get a new constitution.

With all the lessons that have been learned through the Enlightenment to the present day, up to and including this subreddit's focus on rationality... what items would it be worth nudging the constitutional committee towards adopting? President, cabinet, executive committee? Unification or separation of powers? First-past-the-post, preferential voting, liquid democracy, transferable proxy vote? Unicameral, bicameral, x-cameral legislature? Constitutionally separate branch of government to avoid partisan gerrymandering of electoral districts? Which rights should be explicitly mentioned in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Appointed or elected judiciary, and either way, by who?

(Mad Queen Bunny has her own long-term projects to deal with, and isn't particularly interested in taking over administrating the city; especially without, at the very least, a believable referendum/plebiscite. She mostly wants the city to have sufficiently developed political institutions for the city's governance to leave her alone, such as by having particular people who can be blamed for acts of war; though she'd be happy if the city's economy and society developed to the point where its people could work on similar anti-extinction-risk projects as her own.)

  Some simple optimizations for typical democracies:

  * Voting uses a preference rank and any Condorcet method for counting, because why wouldn't you.

  * Line-item veto decreases pork and gets rid of the ability to hold good laws hostage (seems to be a net improvement, requires separation of powers).

  * Laws should be required to have metrics by which they'll be judged, a goal defined with those metrics, and an expiration date for when they'll go away if they miss the goal.

  * Budgets are particularly contentious and could be defined automatically (ie: taxes adjust to fit the budget always unless the legislature passes a "we need deficit spending this year" law manually.)  Putting this into the constitution would make it harder to fiddle with.

  * Political parties are inevitable so you should take advantage of them in your system.

    As someone who's been part of an effort to get ranked-choice voting used by our city, the reasons seem to boil down to:

    * It's difficult to understand, and a voter education scheme would cost money.
    * It's difficult to count (or manually recount) the votes.
    * It requires money for upgrading the existing voting machines.
    * There are a lot of different voting schemes to choose from.
    * It's fairly opaque to the voters.

    (These range from reasonable to frustratingly stupid.)

    On the scale of a city-state, political parties are much less inevitable. Neighborhood groups take most of the tribalist pressure, not broad position-on-everything coaltions.

  Prediction markets playing a major role in deciding policy would probably be my first item. 

  (That, or appointing Robin Hanson king, which effectively accomplishes the same.)

    I would consider a country with Robin Hanson as ruler an existential threat to be nuked as soon as possible. The man appears to have self-modified to no longer value anything resembling standard human values.

      That's an extreme enough position about someone I've never heard of that I'm now curious to know what you mean.  Quick google searches don't make him seem particularly scary. Mind giving a 30 second explanation?

        The summary is that he is an economist who looked at the conflicts between what people value and what economic principles value and decided that the economics was correct and it was the people who were in error. The place this is most obvious is in [Poor Folks Do Smile](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/poor-folks-do-smile.html), where, as Scott Alexander says, "he envisions a grim Malthusian future of slavery and privation for humanity and then soundly endorses it."

        If I recall correctly the Defense Professor in HPMOR is based, in part, on Robin Hanson and Michael Vassar.

  The constitution of the United States was based a lot on things such as the Magna Carta and the government it outlines was inspired by the Roman Republic. Now, that's not the only thing that shaped the document. Consider the 3rd Amendment.

  >No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.

  This was added in more from then recent memory of colonial homeowners forced to shelter British soldiers. It was a pressing issue that the then new government wish to abstain from. 

  My suggestion is to think hard about your setting's history and what the lives of those writing this new constitution were like leading up to that moment. Find what the beliefs, thoughts, and feelings of the writers are at the time of penning this document and you'll see what would fit.

  One feature I would include is the ability for some official to split bills before they are voted on.
