    you're doing Humanities work ulyssess. Any plans to update your list?

      I think that's all of them.  The thread has been dead for a couple months by now, so I probably won't update it.

      /u/hackerkiba posted one of his other stores, [The Scattering](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3za74i/nubsg_the_scattering_background_rtff/), which is a nBSG AU story that tries to make more sense of the universe.

- u/rationalidurr:
  ```
  Fantastic so far, no idiot balls, no incompetent people, no conflict ball, a bit strong on mutual understanding but still excellent in terms of culture to culture contact. 

  I think this can be qualified as a bit of [MK], for mass producing and chemical compound combination. AND HOLY SHIT a character that immediately assumes the low power of material reconfiguration to be a superpowered weapon, FUCK YES VIGILANCE.

  And maybe a little bit of [RST] for teacher that is always i nlesson mode.

  Kiba seems to like contact stories.

  Man, I always love finding first contact fiction.

  WOW. I just read all of it, and it's amazing. Eagerly awaiting next posts! (but judging from update date, I guess not anytime soon :( )
