## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Hey everyone,

  I recently put together a primer on the planning fallacy that goes over the research and 3 debiasing techniques. 

  If you're at all interested in cognitive science and planning, you might want to check it out:

  [Link here](https://medium.com/@owenshen/planning-101-techniques-and-research-9bfff1a01abd#.iqa412kf4) on Medium.

  In total, the research + images took me about 23 hours, which was quite a lot for a project like this!

    Thanks, this is very helpful

    Well,  how long did you think it would take?  :D

      My original estimate was between 10-20 hrs, so not that off, I guess.

  Does anyone know an affordable way to get a second undergrad or Master's degree in statistics?  I'm pretty sure one of my PhD applications for the year was a dud, and the other was probably an accidental dud due to preferring students from their own country.

  I feel pretty stranded on pursuing the path I actually wanted without a proper Bayesian stats, probabilistic graphical models, and cog-sci background, as opposed to self-study.

    Eh, IDK that a degree in a relevant field is all that necessary for a strong PhD application if you're good on other measures (like the personal interest of a prospective PI, a strong GitHub profile, etc. Did you see my post on [PhD Program admissions criteria](https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/11/07/grad-school-admissions-criteria/) a few days back?). I'm ABD in a solid program(s) (top 3 or top 15 in the US, depending) doing, well, Bayesian graphical modeling, in a sense, and I had no relevant experience when I was accepted.

    Otherwise, a few Master's programs *are* funded (through RAs or TAs) but many are not. You could probably find a cheap one. You could also go to a less prestigious place for a PhD, Master out, chill in industry for a bit, and then reapply for a PhD elsewhere, but that's super-duper skeevy and highly frowned upon and may hurt you ultimately. 

    For a second undergrad, getting something from whatever state you have residency in would probably be the cheapest, especially if you can transfer credits from your first degree (or from some CC?). There are tons of scholarships and financial assistance programs that could help, but otherwise you'd have to take out a small-ish loan and best live pretty frugally (or work on the side -- relevant work, especially, would catapult your ultimate PhD app significantly). Dunno how undergrad financial aid works if you've already been through once (or if there are age cutoffs, etc.), but lotsa schools cover demonstrated financial need, at least your first time around. Apply to a bunch of places -- sometimes you can stack 10 smaller, niche scholarships atop one another, which is pretty groovy.

    I hear going abroad to study can be pretty cheap, too, but maybe not for international students?

    Why'd you only apply to two programs? What's your undergrad in?

      I saw your post, but I think I fucked-up:

      * I did get interest from a potential PI at one school.  However, it turns out their admissions tend to be nationalistic: they don't like foreigners (like me, from south of their border).

      * I forgot to talk to the potential PI I fanboy over at the other school, although I did mention him in my Statement of Intent.  Or rather, I spent my time preparing my application, having panic attacks, and trying to get my GREs rescheduled -- rather than talking to the PI like I should have.  I also think I'm just straight-up underprepared for this institution, since it is kinda the best in the world.

      * I seriously could not get my MSc advisor to write a fucking recommendation letter on-deadline.  He sent one in a month and a half late.  Goddamnit.

      >Why'd you only apply to two programs? What's your undergrad in?

      Because at the time I figured, hey, I have a nice stable job, why apply to extra programs when I really only want to work in one or two specific labs?  Now I... *don't* have a nice stable job, and feel like I should have done more to make sure I can get into PhD school.  My undergrad and preexisting research Master's (with a small, B-grade-conference publication) are in Computer Science.  Both are from decent institutions, but merely top-20 (undergrad: top 20 in USA, grad: top 20 in world) rather than #1.

      The PhD programs I'm applying to are in a Brain and Cognitive Sciences department, and a Computer Science department to work with a professor cross-listed between CS and Statistics on probabilistic learning.  The former sends out its interview invitations at the end of January, and I didn't get one.  The latter sends admissions decisions in mid-February through March.

      In related news, I got reviews for my research paper in cog-sci a couple weeks ago.  One review withdrew their review, the editor says it's almost definitely a reject, and the other reviewer wants major revisions.  Some of their advice is useful, though!

  I heard that 1984 has suffered a resurgence in popularity in response to the current political climate, so I decided to check it out in the hope I might learn something useful. Now that I'm finished, I really don't know what I can take from the experience. The worldbuilding and psychology of the characters was so alien to me that I can barely imagine how it applies to the real world or the implications it has for rationality.

  I was specifically looking for insight into the ideology of authoritarianism and how social and psychological forces can lead to its rise. The book was instead about living under the ultimate totalitarian state and the psychology it forces it's citizens to adopt for the sole purpose of controlling them through fear and pain. I didn't get what I wanted or anything I thought I didn't already know.

  Is there anyplace I could get the insight I'm looking for? It's possible I've already learned all I need about this topic from The Righteous Mind, my favorite sociology book that everyone should read, but I'd rather that not be the case since I don't think my current knowledge is helping me to preserve liberal democracy in the face of populism that rejects rationality. I'm holding out for some answer to my question that makes me less cynical and depressed about politics than I am now.

    Important takeaways are about nationalism and the way that language can be employed to control populations.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      It's not the book's fault that I found those themes unwhelming, the novel is so old and influential that the messages have been analyzed and reinterpreted by nearly every political satire since then, but I'm still disappointed that the message about nationalism feels rote and somewhat undercut by the rest of the worldbuilding when compared to real history and modern social science.

      Newspeak is one of the few ideas that I haven't seen explored in greater detail elsewhere, but I still don't understand what special insight it grants beyond the basics of information control and propaganda. The book's dystopia was groundbreaking for its time and is still respectable for taking the idea as dark and depression as any novel could while still resonating with political issues at the time, but it just didn't do anything for me that other stories haven't.

        Oh, I see. I thought that you were saying that you couldn't see what there was to be gotten out of the book *in general.* I would agree that its lessons have (at least mostly) entered into the public consciousness, at least in potential (whether the public consciousness has *learned* those lessons is another matter entirely, but I don't think that the points are actually that unfamiliar to most Westerners today).

    I'm not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for, but have you read [Animal Farm](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100011.txt)?

    I think most of it has already wormed its way into the collective extelligence, but perhaps it will nonetheless interest you...

  I've got a bit problem with video games. My brain gets too fixated on them, and I hate the way that feels. 

  The worst way that I sometimes deal with this is going full Akrasic, and deciding "I just need to *finish* the game, and then I'll be free." This recently resulted in me powering through 20+ hours of a game. 

  The worst part is I'll be thinking "I am not enjoying myself" whilst I do this. Completely ridiculous.

  I'm trying to teach myself to catch that initial "I don't actually want to do this" and amplify it as much as possible. I bathe in this feeling and then don't do the bad thing, instead of ignoring it and jumping into the thing.

  ___________

  A month - 2 days ago I _swore_ not to play games for a month. Two weeks ago I decided this was a terrible idea, and wondered if I should keep it or not. After some thought I decided that I should do my best to fulfill my promises, as that's a useful identity to have.

    I've got this same thing. It most recently struck me while I was playing HOI4, a WWII grand strategy game. I decided to use Cold Turkey to block the game until March so that it would become fresh for me again, and I've used Cold Turkey to block websites and games on other occasions. 

    I also set a series of alarms on my computer to pop up and tell me to ask myself whether I'm enjoying what I'm doing.

  Weekly Monday Update

  ---

  Story is still plugging along, the first chapter should be done by the end of the week and the Pokemon Renegades Engine's feature list is still being worked out.

  ---

  I was meditating on one of ScottAlexander's articles a while ago, and he said something that kind of stuck with me. He was talking about how he always felt bad as a psychiatrist when people had an injury that wouldn't let them work, and those people were in some mode of depression or suicidal thoughts. When trying to get them to not commit suicide, he mentions that he feels bad saying "Think about those that care about you" ie "Think of the affect it would have if you commit suicide. You're being selfish"

  The intellectual problem trying to be addressed in a lot of those suicidal thoughts is the belief that you have no value and whatnot. From there, one of the problems of depression is an incorrect self-worth-appraisal. It's not just that you're a burden on people, it's also often that you're not contributing either, or don't feel like you are contributing.
  And if you rely on the "think about how your death would affect others" approach, what you're telling yourself or the other person, or they may see it this way, is that they have no intrinsic value to bring to the table, so they need to rely on others for their self-valuations, and I think that is wrong.

  I don't have a proper response for it though, but my suggestion is to find something positive you can bring to the table and contribute from there. Then you can say "I did x thing" and "I can't let go because of project Y". You or the other person might not be able to get out from under the "I'm a net-loss financially" thought pattern, but it does help to direct your mind. And if you're able to run personal projects, and such, I predict that it will help you to come to terms somewhat with your problems that's the root of your depression (assuming there are any ofc)

    > If you don't care about mild spoilers, a background premise to the film is that [spoiler](#s " a researcher has discovered a pharmaceutical that allows rapid cellular regeneration. Essentially, it's portrayed as fast healing for injuries.")

    > [I'm curious](#s " how someone should best handle the introduction of such a thing into the world, either specific to this example or how in general someone should go about doing it. While definitely a useful discovery, it would have massive ramifications and potentially lead to either domestic/global disruption (e.g., global population spike, criminals are no longer afraid of death, risk-seeking behavior on the rise, states would regard this as a huge upset in balance of power, short-term uproar while supply of the pharmaceutical is limited as regulatory approval is sought / production ramps up.")

    > [And](#s " is it even possible to restrict the spread of the product? Espionage and pressure virtually guarantee that you can't maintain sole proprietorship of the product. Can you realistically maintain any control over the product have it's introduced; basically, is your only choice here whether to destroy the research or to let it be released (or alternatively, whether the roll-out will be fast or slow by mechanisms such as making it open-source or pricing schemes.")

          It's always necessary. In Markdown syntax, the quotes surround what's supposed to be the title of the link that appears when you hover over it. Spoiler tags (ab)use the markdown syntax to display the title text of the (non)link inline. Without a properly formed link pointing to `#s` and a proper link title, it won't interpret it properly.

    I really like this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes rational stories about solving a puzzle, though I always thought the reveal as to why the characters were put through the puzzle was one of the weaker parts. It was still presented very well and had the intended dramatic impact, but I do think it's a bit silly when you take an objective look at the plot and what the puzzle actually accomplished. It's about the journey more than the destination.

    SPOILERS AHEAD

    As for your question, even just selling the product like normal would be a restriction on who gets it and, ultimately, what impact it will have on the world. It's something that *will* save lives and should not be suppressed, but since it will also change the world the company wanted someone to help make the hard moral choices that will come up. 

    I don't think it's just about creating a strategic plan, but also having to deal with people who will use the product to pursue an agenda, righteous or not. Some will want it publicly released, some will want it regulated, some will want to profit from it, some will want it banned, and some will want it to be exclusively for certain people whom they trust.
