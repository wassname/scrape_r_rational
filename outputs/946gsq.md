  Dread Emperor Traitorous is my favorite character in this whole damn series

    I'm fond of Dread Emperor Irritant the Oddly Successful.

    Although Traitorous is great too.

  Man, the banter is *on point* this chapter.

  My only hope is that Cat's last card is a Queen of Blades since we've already had a Paige of Cups.

  Yussss!  Looks like the All According To formula is gonna get followed.  Can't wait to see how this mess works out.

  Also, loved the musing on the Augur.  For a character who has zero screentime, she looms quite large.

    > “Woe, Cordelia,” the Augur said. “Woe to the north and to the south. Sit and listen, before it is too late.”

      She had another scene or two before this too as I remember her and Cordelia conversing.

  Give me a moment to ponder how I ended up reading a story about assassination, betrayal and world domination with Yaketi Sax as background music.

  You know, I really like this plan. Most of Catherine's ploys have revolved around politicking or grand battles so far, with lots of perspectives and interludes in between. Following what is essentially a heist with just the Woe & Akua is a nice change of pace.

  Anyone else think the bit with the cards is more than just a plan?  Shuffling some of them up before distributing them could make for a plan so chaotic it couldn't be predicted: the plan only forms as they learn what card they have.

  Set up a series of tasks that could be performed by multiple members of the Woe, and have some cards be conditional (like the card Cat had about "go find Archer if you don't have the Thief of Stars") to let some of the cards essentially inform each other.

  You wind up with a plan with many "points of failure," but with conditionals you could have built in contingencies against failure.

  Obviously some tasks are limited to a few members, but this theory would explain why the plan wasn't "have Hierophant set fire to the building;" it was not certain that he would be present.

    I think she playing a Role. There are plenty of stories where a character is a part of a plan they do not know and slowly learns how it all fits together like a detective story. Only instead of being a pawn or unwitting third party she is also the mastermind of the plan. Basically she gets the benefits of making a plan with the added condition that she also has to learn the plan, which she can only do by successfully progressing the steps. Thus Fate makes sure she can progress until all is revealed because not learning what the actual plot was is practically unheard of in stories. 

    Archer and Akua act like the controller and hidden dagger respectively, meaning they have someone to nudge the story in the right course and another one to be the hidden trump card that wins the day. And Cat has basically told herself with the first rune that Akua is the controller and Archer the trump, but it's actually opposite which means everything has to succeed for that reveal. Thus she has weight on her success in every single part of the endeavor and even if something fails she has to get her memories back the way she planned it. So she has to come to the finishing stretch where the hidden dagger twist will give her weight to kill Malicia/The Simulacrum.

      Reminds me of that cliché in movies/books where if the plan is explained to the viewer directly before it is carried out, then the plan will fail. However, if the plan is being explained to the viewer *as* it’s being carried out then it will succeed

      EDIT: Just saw that the comment right below me has a link to that specific trope (Unspoken Plan Guarantee)

  I... what the hell *is* their plan? This arc keeps getting weirder and more confusing.

    Well, let's piece together what we know.

    Malicia is presumed to be in Keter to negotiate with The Dead King. Cat's negotiations cannot win over hers, so they choose to find Malicia, assassinate her, and usurp her bargaining power. They have a number of problems to overcome. First, where is Malicia? In Chapter 37, the crew figures out she's in a neighboring palace set aside for visitors, called The Threefold Reflection:

    >There were five in whole, forming a circle interrupted by the same  number of avenues going into the city-fortress. The Silent Palace, our  own, was slightly to the left of the gates into the Hall.  
    >  
    >“Which one?” I asked.  
    >  
    >Indrani jabbed her finger onto the parchment. Slightly to the right, on the opposite side of the black stone spire.  
    >  
    >“The Threefold Reflection,” I said.

    The first problem is that the palace has some wizardly bullshit at work making navigating it a pain:

    > “The place is… unsettling,” Archer said, grabbing the seat across from  me. “The layout is wrong. Hallways lead where they shouldn’t: I went  through the same threshold twice and ended up in different places both  times. I’d call it a maze, but you can map out a maze. There’s wizardly  bullshit at play here I think might rule that out.” 

    The second issue is that it's defended by a Revenant, a necromanced dead Named. When Cat meets Edward VII, he reveals this, though not the name of the Named who now guards The Threefold Reflection (which is a pyramid shape):

    >“So there’s a former Named guarding all five palaces,” I said.  
    >  
    >“Indeed,” he agreed. “Though the Abomination changes the watchers at a  whim. The Bloody Sword once kept vigil over the **that unpleasant pyramid**  beyond the Garden, but has since been replaced. Other than I, the only  one who has remained for more than a century is **the Thief of Stars.**”

    This conversation reveals a third problem. Not only does a Named Revenant guard Malicia's temporary abode, one guards the Woe's as well. This is the Thief of Stars, which Cat notes with a chill, they haven't even seen yet.

    > So we’d had a heroine with a talent for discretion breathing down our  neck the entire time without a single one of us noticing. Lovely. This  assassination plot was already getting off to a great start. 

    So those are the problems the Woe face: they need to take out the Thief of Stars so she can't sound an alarm when they make their move; they need to find out who the Named in charge of The Threefold Reflection is and counter it; they need to navigate the pyramid, and they need to kill Malicia once they get to her.

    The plan to do this isn't revealed (because revealing a plan means it's doomed to fail, [according to tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee)). But we can assume some things:

    The Woe discover that one of the Revenants is Named Skein, and another is Named Spellblade. Per chapter 38:

    >***Skein****.* ***Thief of*** *–* that was probably meant to be a star, but I  wasn’t exactly an artist. Shoddy work, Past Catherine, you could have  asked Hakram for help. And, to end it, ***Spellblade****.*

    We don't know how they discovered this, but it sounds like they did a first run, got caught by Skein's prophetic powers right away, and then retooled the plan to try and bypass the seer's foresight by executing a plan hidden even to themselves.

    > That did explain why apparently whatever the plan was it had to be kept  secret even from us. Maybe they could only predict through conscious  decisions? 

    The plan thus far seems to be this:

    * The details of the plan are forgotten by the Woe to avoid Skein's ability to predict their movements. Or at least they are forgotten by Adjutant, Thief, Hierophant, and Cat herself. Cat has some cards hidden in black ice that open at later points to guide them forward, with one still remaining.
    * To counter the Thief of Stars, Cat gathers the Woe together, ices the room to reveal her, and then had Thief ~~Yoink!~~ **Hold** her in her pocket dimension of stolen booty.
    * Archer and Akua are away elsewhere doing... something. Presumably they are either meant to counter one of the other problems, find more information, or run interference. My guess is that Akua is working on the enchantments of The Threefold Reflection, being an awesome magic user, while Archer is probably going to counter Spellblade, being an awesome fighter. 
    * The remaining members of the Woe set fire to their own palace, which pulls away the patrols that would otherwise see them entering The Threefold Reflection, as well as giving them an excuse to leave their palace together and head to another one for temporary accommodations. 
    * Thief leaves right after, likely to work another angle like Akua and Archer.
    * The remaining members enter The Threefold Reflection, which has three gates. While it only mentions Hakram and Cat splitting up to enter through different gates, presumably Masego will take the last one. My guess here is that The Threefold Reflection, besides having non-Euclidean magicky bullshit going on (which Akua will be trying to counter), probably is three different versions of the palace overlapped. By each of the Woe taking separate gates, the odds are one of them will get to Malicia. Narrative says it's Cat, but we'll have to see. No idea what the plan is to take her out once there, but I'm guessing the last card Cat has will help with it.

    I think that's about it... any clearer?

  ```
  I'm not getting how this plan actually could work. It seems more implausible the longer it goes, and it's even pointed out.
  ```

- u/efd731:
  ```
  i just want it on record that the plan is that there actually is no plan at all, they've just given  themselves random tasks and busy work to appear like there's a plot afoot and then when malicia the master planner "figures out" their plan and pre-emptively ambushes or attacks them before they can pull it off, that was all according to plan and then they all gang up on her outside the dead kings protection somehow.
  ```
