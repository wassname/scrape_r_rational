  Reading this one chapter at a time can be painful sometimes. This was a good one, but I want more. I'm waiting on reading the 3rd novel for the same reason. Don't want to start it then get drip fed.

  Excited for speedtest. I wonder if there will ever be an opportunity for Speedtest 2.0 on a planet they don't mind truly destroying.

    I understand. I wish I could put out chapters up to my standards as fast as I used to. Flicker does get opportunities for more tests of her abilities in Maker's Ark. Since you haven't started it yet I won't spoil it for you 8-)

  Flicker starts to move on.

  Chaser and Jonathan appear in [Cat Fight](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/123437156356/vignette-cat-fight)

  The gelato shop in Florence is Vivoli. It had very good gelato in 1985, and probably still does 8-)

  Okay my previous complaint of everything coming to a head is withdrawn; this isn't a sidestory it's a full background prequel.

  I am still looking forward to (things I like in makers ark): >!flickers spear, and the war against the homewell things that think of humanity and demons as bugs nesting in a rotting everett branch, and more transhumanist lessons from *Learning is about to occur*!< but I'm really enjoying this.

    It didn't start out that way.  I used to think authors talking about how their short story involuntarily turned into a novella were exaggerating, but once it was clear to me how the chronology had to work, it worked best in a single story 8-).
    And I haven't forgotten about Maker's Ark, it's still percolating along in the background (it's mostly the "meanwhile on Earth" stuff causing the problem) and there are parts of Princess that are foreshadowing.

      Yeah, I see the one character you are foreshadowing and the (spoilery pun): >!table full of!< WMDs in Chekhov's armory he can become.
