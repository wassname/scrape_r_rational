## A dream about suicide in a multiverse [RT] [FF] (Time Braid)

### Post:

I had an interesting dream about the Naruto fanfiction "Time Braid". First I need to explain a few bits about the premise. Obviously, the following is a huge spoiler so beware.

In the fic, the protagonist Sakura has several alternative personalities living inside her head. At one point a demonic personality is added who then takes over her body and tries to corrupt the original personalty. This demonic personality is convinced that this (corrupting Sakura) is her mission and that she will be tortured for all eternity should she fail. Problem is that corrupting Sakura turns out to incredibly difficult. There are also angels in this fiction and Sakura is much closer to ascend to angel status than to be corrupted. The demonic personality is pretty much immortal but at one point in the fic, she comments that if Sakura were to become an angel, her own (demonic) mind would be reduced to a vegetable in the process.  
Reading this, I was thinking "Well that's the solution then, isn't it? A way to kill yourself so you don't have to suffer for all eternity. If you can't corrupt her, then you should put all your efforts into making the original Sakura ascend."  
When I went to sleep that night I had a fascinating and detailed dream about it. I played the role of demon Sakura and with single minded purpose worked to help Sakura ascend. It was terrifying, because I knew I was doing the exact polar opposite of what I was told to do. If my bosses decided to check in on my progress they would realize that I had betrayed them and send me to hell immediately.  
Finally, we fulfilled all the necessary requirements and were standing before the gates of heaven, ready to ascend. In the dream I had to go into some kind of room were my mind would be purged. I wasted a few precious seconds to turn to my partner, the other Sakura, and gave her a big hug before I stepped forward. I readied myself to become nonexistent. There was a bright flash and... I was still there. Something had gone wrong.  
Suddenly and with eerie certainty I realized what had happened. The Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics was correct, the universe splits into all possible next states constantly. In almost all universes I had indeed died but there was a tiny chance that the mind purging would fail. It didn't really matter how small the chance was, it only mattered that it was there. And for the same reason that I was born on a habitable planet, my consciousness ended up in a universe where the process had failed. Despair came over me. Suicide wasn't an option after all and I already had betrayed my mission. There was no saving me now.  
But then the other Sakura burst through the door and told me with a beaming smile that, apparently, my personality wasn't all that bad for a demon, which is why enough of my mind survived the mind purging and the forces of heaven decided to offer protection from my punishment in hell. At this point I woke up.

This was one of the best dreams I have ever had. Note that I hadn't had the idea before, that suicide might be subjectively impossible in a multiverse. In hindsight, the reason I was unable to die in my dream was probably just that I couldn't imagine what being dead would be like.
Sorry for any awkward English.

  Ahh, are we talking about dreams?

  This morning, I had a dream where I was at a magic school. I remember knowing that the magic was roughly elemental-based, but I don't think there was ever a really good explanation. I remember that the air/lightbender people were followed around by giant Strange-and-Norrell-style tunnels of turbulent light, stretching to the heavens, and someone joked about how this impeded their ability to sneak away from their parents. Anyway.

  I was in the science classroom -- which just so happened to be my real-life biology classroom from high school -- and a guy brought in a magical object. Now, magical objects are Discovered, not Invented; while not Rare, they are Unusual and require Certain Masterie. Ahem. Specifically, it was a dark sphere, like a black crystal ball, and when you touched it, it shot out a beam of light opposite your fingertip.

  "Shot out" is a bit of a strange word. It more ... refracted the light, in an odd sort of loose, scattered pattern, like ... well, a lot like light scattered through a window in my old childhood house.

  Anyway, when you focused the light -- which was done by only touching the sphere with one fingertip (it came with a stand, although I was holding it, so it was a bit cumbersome) -- it deposited a button-sized diamond at where the light hit the wall. It would materialize and fall to the floor. I remember I was standing in the hall of my high-school while the dude was in the classroom spinning all this mumbo-jumbo about how he could hear the colors of the light, etc. And I gave the first few gems to the passers-by, because I recognized them as quite expensive, and I was in a charitable mood. But then I timed the orb and realized it deposited them at a rate of 1 jewel every 10 seconds, and we should stockpile the jewels so as to not flood the market.

  So thanks, /r/rational. You've ruined my fantasy dreams with your rational economics. *stews in corner, looking for diamonds around bedroom*

  I love the degree of functionality your brain managed to retain inside a dream. For me it’s often hard to recall intrinsic patterns of thought \ analysis when I am dreaming, similar to how it’s hard to read something inside a dream.

  >Despair came over me. Suicide wasn't an option after all and I already had betrayed my mission.

  Just because there was some small chance of your plan going wrong in that case wouldn’t mean that any plan for suicide would have a small chance of failure, though. You’d just have to kill yourself [with a gun with six loaded chambers out of six,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50V3eA2YYFI) not n-1 out of n.

  Have you read [Transdimensional Brain Chip](http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/) and [Qualia the Purple?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia_the_Purple) If no, I think you’d enjoy them.

  Also, please use more paragraph breaks in future.

    Not too far in yet but Transdimensional Brain Chip is pretty cool!  
    It's good that it got interesting quickly because when I saw the art I was like "mkay, I'm gonna give this 5 strips max".

    Added paragraphs breaks.

    Yeah, I was pretty proud of myself too, actually.

    > You’d just have to kill yourself with a gun with six loaded chambers out of six, not n-1 out of n.

    The question is if such a gun can ever be build.

    I have read Qualia the purple, never heard of Transdimensional Brain Chip.

    Could still fail. The gun could jam, the bullets could all be duds or blanks, the firing pin could have been left out when the gun was assembled, someone could interrupt you, you could pass out / have a non-fatal stroke / etc.

      I think he was referring to a metaphorical gun. But yes, you are right that such a perfectly foolproof gun would be hard to invent.
      ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        Since it's possible for every atom of the gun to suddenly move six meters in a random direction due to quantum fluctuations... I'd say impossible.
        ```

        ```
        To the point where once you actually achieve that it could well turn out that you are in a universe where the laws of physics are just different enough to still preserve a flaw in the supposedly perfect suicide tool. An example would be that extracts your mind from the simulated world in which you presided up to that moment.

  That's so sweet. :) I got a little misty reading that.

  You may want to read [Permutation City](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156784.Permutation_City), [The Ultimate Finale of the Meta Mega Crossover](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover), and [The Clarity of Darkness](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/264090/1/the-clarity-of-darkness/the-clarity-of-darkness) (cw: ponies). I don't think there's anything explicitly about quantum/Tegmark/anthropic immortality in them except for The Clarity of Darkness, however.
