## Rational Inkheart?

### Post:

I feel like this series would be GREAT for a rational rewrite, but I haven't come across any. Are there some out there, or does it just not exist?

What would be your take on it?

How long before you ruled the world, if you had access to that power?

  If I'm not mistaken, you can basically bring anything what so ever into existence simply by writing it and reading it aloud, right? So about five minutes, give or take.

    There are limitations.

    Without finding the book again to check, I'm pretty sure that size seems to be limited to about a car, advanced technology seems impossible/impractical, and the accuracy of an object seems dependent on both the reader's concentration and the verisimilitude of the text. 

    (Any or all of this may be wrong, it's been years since I read this book)

      Fuck that, infinite photons. Energy crisis, solved.

        Along with such problems as the unfortunate tendency of the sun to rise each morning and the paucity of cislunar black holes...

      Additionally, I'm pretty sure that what counts as a "story" is not unlimited. Maybe the writers were all just being prissy, but they frequently insisted that they couldn't write just anything they wanted into a story, and that it had to fit well with the world they were creating.
      ```

        I'd think that falls under verisimilitude, however it is a good thing to point out on it's own.
