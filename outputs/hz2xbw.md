  Well would you look at that. Possibly exploitable political factions among the Blin. Shame we never bothered to learn Blinnish, or we wouldn't have to go into this blind!

  Yes, I am bitter.

    Hey, we can have Zelda go learn blinnish from those captives now! And also... actually, maybe we should release them? I mean, learn from the first, but... dunno what the blin culture is like, but maybe that one guy can spin things hard enough...

    And when could we have done that? This is the day after Zelda returned from her diplomatic trip to see Shesan. Fi can't learn a language in a day. We would have had to not  go talk to Shesan. And talking to her gained us a lot so it's not clear that learning Blin earlier would have worth the opportunity cost.

  I like Taetus' proposal of marrying a noble and leaving him in power in the shadows. I don't see how marrying Link would be useful, though, as we need him off adventuring and kicking ass (I guess Taetus doesn't realize that)

  **Announcement**:

  There will be no voting. The next chapter will proceed from the [previous plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/hs0zuy/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/fyad8fa/).

  Taetus has been successfully marked (cost to be included in the VP ledger at the end of the next chapter).

  Zelda has sent for Lensa. She hasn’t arrived back at her estate yet, but when she gets there (another 1-2 days), Zelda’s message will be passed along. The earliest she can expect to see Lensa is 4+ days from now.

  A number of Blin have been captured as per Zelda’s orders, and are being held at Southaven—a fishing outpost on the shores of Lake Hylia that has been repurposed for military use, about a day’s ride south of Castletown.

  Link & co have been urged by Zelda to continue on to the graveyard and return at the soonest opportunity. The next chapter will detail the results of the party’s (mis)adventures.

  Thanks for another awesome update. Very exciting (if terrifying) stuff in there.
