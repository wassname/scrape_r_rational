I don't know how many folks here have managed to work all the way through *The New Humans* backlog, but I'm excited to share the last chapter of *This Hollow Season*, our third volume. Turned out more topical than I expected, *mostly* by accident.

Me and my editor William Rave are both eager for any input or critque on this chapter and the rest of the third volume, and we look forward to beginning work on the fourth and last volume: *The Utopians*.

But first, an intermission... it's us-speak for "interlude".

  Great story, looking forward to Myriad ruling a city.

    What could possibly go wrong?

    Technically she's calling herself Symphony right now. But yes, should be... *fun*.
