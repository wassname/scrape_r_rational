## Fallout Equestria: Rational Expectations

### Post:

**Chapter One: Mostly Dead**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It was a dimly lit chamber that I'd quickly made my way to. Large and small pipes, grey or bronze, ran along several walls and the ceiling lit by small arcane gems that let off some harsh light. One side of the room was dedicated solely to alternating panels and terminals, each indicator and computer pair connected to a different maintenance system. I made my way to the leftmost system control and looked down at what there was to see.

Alarm lights and indicators placed upon the control panel in front of me were flashing and flickering in varying intensities of red, the universal sign of "Something has totally fucked up." I was very worried, and the reasons were twofold. One, I was absolutely not the pony who should be responsible for the implications of this small metal panel. Not even close. The order of succession for those most capable of fixing this dammed problem had me *far* from the top, which did not bode well for the 30 or so ponies who should've been woken before me. Two, it didn't bode well for the *other* 300 ponies whose lives depended on what those indicators said.

I paused and held my gaze on one particular indicator for several seconds, watching the needle on the meter almost imperceptibly begin dropping as another red light came on.

"Shit," I mumbled under my breathe, "That's the main coolant storage tank." My thoughts began racing and I slid over to the nearest computer terminal to get more useful information, and more importantly, *help.* I tapped my hooves along the keys as quickly as I could, entering commands into the machine. What I needed quickly came up on the screen in bright, green text:

    Main coolant levels at 98% capacity.
    Pressure at 988 psi and dropping. 
    Projected time until failure of critical systems: 4 days.

*That is not good.*

*And that is a hell of an understatement.*

*Definitely time for help,* I thought. I asked the computer to start emergency wakeup procedures on everypony capable of it, and got the worst response I could imagine:

    Emergency protocols already in effect.
    All available personnel are present.
    WARNING: widespread failure of Arcane gemstones maintaining chronic stasis.
    functional gemstones: 1/200 WARNING BENEATH SAFETY THRESHOLD
    
*I was the only one.*

*Of all the ponies that made it into storage, I was the only one who had a time gem that'd kept me re-animatable.* 

The news that I had no one to help me, no team of mechanical experts to fix everything, left me feeling like I'd been hit by a train. I slumped to the ground, petrified for a moment.

*They're all going to die if I can't find a way to save them.*

...

*Alright, so how do I save them?*

I stood back onto my four legs and faced the computer. *I had to determine the cause of this, one way or another.* I began typing. *Is it a leak somewhere?* The computer took my command and began running some diagnostic tests on the piping system. *Or maybe some of the coolant gems have stopped working?* I typed some more and the computer indicated that it had begun some additional tests on the gem banks.

I took some slow breathes as the programs ran, hoping that there was a simple solution to all this...

To be continued?

This was a quick sketch of ideas I've had sitting in my head for a bit, and I want to know, is it any good? does this short post leave you wanting more? Is this a story you want me to resolve?

any critique welcome.

  This so far matches the pattern of an engaging story.

  I would certainly read past this point in the story if more of it was written.

    Awesome :D

    For this comment alone, I'm glad I got off my procrastinating ass for the hour it took to actually *make* something decent.

    Thank you.

      Well, you're not even a dozen paragraphs in and already threatening to kill 330 people.  Good show.

        Sounds about on par for the Equestrian Wasteland.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Why do people enjoy nuking a kids' sugar-bowl setting into tiny pieces of slag?
          ```

          - u/PeridexisErrant:
            ```
            Because the setting is *terrifying* if the power of being a kids show lifts for a few minutes? Because people fundamentally prefer reading about bad things happening to people who aren't too much like us? Because the sugarbowl has been done well enough by the source material? 

            I'd lean towards a combination of one and three.
            ```

              >Because the setting is terrifying if the power of being a kids show lifts for a few minutes?

              Yeah, that's the fun part!  They've literally got portals to Greek Hell in their backyard and half the life-forms around are at least *Legend of Zelda*-level monsters that will kill you or mind-rape you without a second thought.

              Then you nuke everything and it's just another survivalist shithole.
              ```

            For me the grimdark can be cathartic to read, can't say for sure *why* though.

            As for writing it, though, I think the rampant instability and violent potential of powerful magical development combined with an insufficiently savvy society makes for great explorations of game theory and rationalism. I mean, imagine If every major field of study had a nuke level discovery being made, *all at the same time,* and that all of them were heavily balanced in the direction of offense. A magical universe is *terrifying*.

            ```
            I think its the same feeling that has us hope for a crash at a NASCAR race, that people watched public executions for, and that drove the popularity of Roman gladiatorial matches.
