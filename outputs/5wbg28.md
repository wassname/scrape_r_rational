## [D] Sunday Writing Skills Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow /r/rational fans...

* Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)?

* How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

* Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

* Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

* Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

  [Probably normal not necessarily r! fiction question]

  Interested in what people think about the use of adverbs when it comes to writing character dialogue.

  I've noticed Yudkowsky, for example, is happy with using lots of varied words and descriptions to get his points across.

  For me, though, I've been focusing on only using said, with the focus being on actual word choice and other details to convey information.

  I'm interested to know, not what people think is "better" (for some arbitrary metric), but which they *enjoy* reading more: lots of varied verbs for speaking + adjectives or sparser verbs (mainly "saids") and little to no adjectives.
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    I'm loathe to say what I'd enjoy reading more because people are bad at predicting what they enjoy. My first thought is that I'd prefer just "he said" "she said" because it lets me focus on the dialogue. I mean, take this example:

    > "I can't believe I ever loved you!" He said furiously.

    The adverb isn't really helpful, since context will help you figure out whether the speaker is furious or not. (Potential preceding lines: "I don't think minorities are people", or "I love pineapple on pizza!")

    Changing the verb to "he spat" would probably be the best way, since you can't really spit dialogue anything but furiously. 

    At the end of the day, I think both are acceptable, unless the adverbs are constant and become distracting. During talky scenes, dialogue is meant to be front and centre and the tags are just meant to emphasise it. Especially if you overuse a particular tag.

    So, do whatever you prefer to write.
    ```

    ```
    As /u/MagicWeasel (correctly) stated, people are generally not very good at predicting what they enjoy. This being the case, I'm going to give you my thoughts, not as a *reader*, but as a *writer*:

    My philosophy for writing prose is to try to write the same way I talk (minus all of the disfluencies, breaks, and various other assorted grammatical errors that occur over the course of ordinary speech). This is particularly useful, I find, when writing in the first-person, since it really helps to convey the feeling that a *person* is talking, rather than some omniscient third-person narrator (though I tend to write the same way even then, so maybe it's just a stylistic quirk). Because I'm used to explaining things to other people in real life, I tend to try to insert as much information as possible in my writing; this means, among other things, profuse usage of both adverbs and other forms of description. (Especially similes and metaphors.) As an example of this, consider the following line of dialogue (credit and apologies to /u/MagicWeasel, since I'll be using your example to make nearly the exact opposite point that you used it to make):

    > "I can't believe I ever loved you!" he said.

    The above is perfectly acceptable, but it's simply not the way I'd write; nor is it, I suspect, what would affect me the most were I reading the above line in the context of a story. Adding a single adverb, like so,

    > "I can't believe I ever loved you!" he said furiously.

    still doesn't feel like it conveys enough information (and worse yet, what little information it *does* convey could have been inferred from context, making it redundant). So, here are a couple of examples of what I might write instead:

    > "I can't believe I ever loved you," he said, but despite the anger apparent in his words, both his expression and his tone were calm and controlled, almost as if he were simply discussing the weather.

    Or, alternatively:

    > "I can't believe I ever loved you!" he snarled, his face twisted into an ugly rictus of rage. It was not a flattering look; indeed, it made him seem quite unhinged, like a patient who had just broken out of a psychiatric ward.

    Here, have another one:

    > "I can't believe I ever loved you," he positively *hissed*, his eyes narrowed. In place of the affection that had graced his features mere hours earlier, now there was a coldness that seemed to spread to the rest of the room, making the very air itself feel chilly.

    Anyway, I think you get the point by now. Basically, while it's true that the *gist* of a character's mood can usually be inferred from context, there is still quite a bit of additional information to be gleaned by being more descriptive. Obviously, YMMV; I'm aware, for instance, that there are people who prefer a more spartan approach--who simply want the bare facts of what happened laid out before them, with minimal decoration and/or embellishment. That's also an acceptable way of doing things, even though it's one I personally feel less at home with.

    What you *definitely* want to avoid, however, is falling into the uncanny valley: not descriptive enough to appease someone like me, but possessing just enough useless details to irritate someone like /u/MagicWeasel. Single-use adverbs without any accompanying text (such as the "he said furiously" example given above) generally fall into this region, since they don't really provide *any* additional information that couldn't have been inferred from context, serving only to bloat the text. In other words, if you're going to provide additional information, make sure that the information you give is actually *useful* and not redundant. And if you *do* decide to go down that route, don't be afraid of going overboard--after all, you've already committed to being as descriptive as possible, and going only halfway is an excellent way to fall into the aforementioned uncanny valley.

    Well, that was my 2 cents. Do with it what you will.

      Thanks for both you and /u/MagicWeasel for the responses!

      I think that perhaps when reading I, to some extent, like reading the extended descriptions you describe, but there's also a part of me that just wants the dialogue, all the other adverbs, verbs, etc. be damned.

      And I think it's that side that I'd like to cater to for my own writing, I think.

      But Yudkowsky, as an example, does use a lot of the extended descriptions. And that's fine; I like it too.
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        I think the extended descriptions are absolutely great for hard-hitting sentences like "I can't believe I ever loved you", because they're important and you want to ensure that your intention with that line is communicated to the reader, or perhaps emphasise the emotional impact. 

        But you could use that same line and have the intention pretty clear without any extra bells and whistles. Let's go back to my pineapple pizza example...

        > "I really love how we have this silly tradition of coming to this pizza place on our wedding anniversary." Amy remarked.

        > "I know. It doesn't look like much but it's still excellent. Just like me!" 

        > "Ha! You're not so bad!" 

        > "Did you want to get the usual? Vegetarian with extra pineapple?"

        > "Actually, honey... I think it's time I told you. On our first date, when I told you I loved pineapple on pizza, I was lying. I think it's disgusting and I am *not* spending our third wedding anniversary trying to choke that stuff down."

        > "Really?" Tom laughed. "Eight years and you're telling me now?"

        > "I wanted to impress you and then it seemed like the lie had gone on so long that it was awkward...." 

        > "So, you're being serious?"

        > "Not only do I not like pineapple on pizza, but after the amount of pineapple pizzas I've had to eat, I don't think I like pineapple on *anything* anymore."

        > "I can't believe I ever loved you."

        > "Oh shut up. We can get it with extra olives instead."

        > "Actually, Amy, there's something I've been meaning to tell you..."
        ```

    I'm personally rather against using adverbs, since they tend to be overused a lot and even if you go out of your way to avoid them, you'll probably still have a couple left somewhere.

    Adverbs add extra information, but they do it in a boring way. It's generally more impactful if the reader infers stuff rather than having it spelled out for them ('Show, don't Tell' basically), so descriptions and metaphors are generally much better to use.

    It's fine to not use said *all* the time, but it's one of those really useful words that you can repeat a bunch without the reader noticing (like pronouns and names, a lot of newer writers - especially in fanfiction - often try to avoid reusing 'said', which makes for a not very good reading experience).

    When you avoid using the staples 'said(/asked/answered)', it should be rare. That way, you keep a lot of the impact. If everyone's always shouting/whispering/screaming/sobbing/etc., then no-one is. If you feel like your dialogue has become repetitive and boring, you can also drop the dialogue tag altogether and just imply the speaker.

    Compare:

    >"This is the worst day of my life," he sobbed despairingly.

    >"This is the worst day of my life." He closed his eyes and sank back into his chair, a cliff finally eroded into nothingness by the ceaseless pounding of the waves.

    The second one is kinda purple, but it's much more vivid. In general, you'll either not want to go into massive detail about a person's reactions in dialogue, and just imply it with what they say for the most part:

    >"I had one beer at most!"

    >"Charles told me something *very* different, you know," Sarah said, smiling.

    >"Charles needs to learn to keep his goddamn mouth shut."

    Change 'smiling' for 'frowning', and that's all you need to do to vary the tone. Any long metaphors and descriptions and adverbs are unnecessary.

    Or you'll want to linger, painting a comprehensive picture of a person before the next line of dialogue falls into place (see the earlier example). This is for when you want to be rather more precise in describing the characters, because it's either a key moment for the reader (in terms of understanding the character) or a key moment for the character (in terms of developing).

      Thanks! This was also a helpful perspective.

  So, my question this week is about "point of view" in third person stories. You know, lines like this:

  > “That doesn’t make it okay.” Red stared at him; why did he always do that? Primp and preen himself when they were having important conversations?

  .

  > Red tried not to cringe; his master? Her Italian really was bad.  Then again, his wasn’t much better.  “Yes. My boss needs one to put his things in.”

  Or even internal monologue:

  > After a few months, Red had begun to adjust. The days were long but mercifully growing shorter, and were punctuated by trips into the town to abate the boredom. Especially on days like today, when William had fed on him recently, and he felt no desire to sleep. It was lonely when the sun was up. He'd made a habit of reading the paper and drinking coffee at the local cafe each morning. Even when he needed to sleep a full eight hours, he could never stay asleep past ten, regardless of how late into the morning he stayed up with William. He wondered if he would grow out of it. Perhaps, after enough time, he would be a creature of the night, though in a less literal sense than William was.

  >That line of thinking drew his mind to the future. He was pretty certain he loved William... but was this all he would have? A couple of glasses of coffee, some pleasantries with some villager who couldn't begin to understand the details of his life, and then returning home to read until sunset?


  My story started out as third person but told entirely from the human character's PoV, because the other character is a 1500 year old vampire and thus a bit difficult to write, since I am not a 1500 year old vampire, and while I have ideas about how they think and act (hence writing a supernatural romance story about one), I don't think I'd be able to properly cover it in writing.

  I realised that there are some times when the vampire PoV is useful, but I'm worried that switching inconsistently would annoy the reader. In particular, the story is going to be 90% human PoV, but the first chapter is going to be vampire PoV. Another scene about halfway through is going to be vampire PoV too, and I will probably write one of the very last scenes in vampire PoV. Ther rest will be human PoV.

  Is this "false advertising"? (In other words, would a reader have an expectation that the entire story is vampire PoV and then feel disappointed when it features very minimally?). 

  I'm reading a rotating PoV story at the moment and it switches PoV every chapter, and I find myself only wanting to read one of the PoVs and wishing all the other chapters were in that PoV. I think that's what's made me worried about putting vampire PoV scenes in my story. 

  Also, is it confusing to put PoV dialogue tags/etc for the vampire in human-PoV chapters? Specifically, in situations where the human doesn't have any way of knowing the vampire's state of mind? For example, I have a "he lied" here and there.

  Here's another scene, to show how they get mixed:

  > “But you can’t enslave people. It’s not right.” Red said, finally. 

  > “It is the way these things are done.” He said simply, threading the laces onto his shoes. 

  > “That doesn’t make it okay.” Red stared at him; why did he always do that? Primp and preen himself when they were having important conversations?

  > William paused. He was still not used to the subtleties of the human mind, despite being so close to one for so long. But it was clear that this was a sensitive issue for Red, even if everything seemed clear to him. “Some things are beyond your understanding, my dear.”

  > “I don’t have to be a thousand years old-” Red started; William seemed to flinch, “-to know that it’s wrong to keep another person, to not let them have free will. We’ve thought wars for that!”

  > “I fought a war for you.” William replied flatly, his voice firm but not overly loud. He pulled his shoes on.

  > “That’s not…” Red hesitated; he was grateful for everything that William had done, but this whole situation was frustrating. Worse still was the horror that was boiling up in him, that perhaps William was worse than he could have expected, that all those little things he wrote off as misunderstandings, as vampire codewords, as mistranslations, that they were real. That William actually thought that way. “That’s not relevant here! And it’s not…”  Red sighed heavily, trying to pull himself together. “I appreciate all you’ve done. I do. But you are talking about slavery. You can’t really be okay with that. What if… what if it was me? My free will? You would be okay with that?” 

  Bonus question: that last paragraph, Red starts and stops speaking three times. Should I be formatting it differently?
