## Let's Start the Read Through!

### Post:

A few weeks ago, /u/19283123 posted a [suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2w6lhw/qedu_should_we_start_community_readthrough_on/) to have a community read through with *Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid* winning as the most popular request.

I plan on starting next Monday with the first post on discussing the first chapter of GEB, or the **Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering** as well as it's dialogue **Three-Part Invention**.

Unless there is significant disagreement, I will be posting every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 5:00 PM (Pacific Time) discussing the latest chapter of GEB with a two or three day grace period to give enough time to read the upcoming chapter.

EDIT #3: A few people who have previously read GEB have commented on /r/GEB that this schedule is a little aggressively quick and we will be likely to lose many readers as we approach the end of Part 1. I have taken this advice into consideration and adjusted the dates to reflect a switch to two chapters per week starting with **Chapter VII: The Propositional Calculus** on April 2nd. The two chapters week will be a Monday and Thursday schedule. Also, I removed the link to a .pdf download for the book when someone commented that it was very likely to be an illegal reproduction.

EDIT #2: I have decided to change the planned posting time from 5:00 PM (Pacific Time) to 1:00 PM (Pacific Time), because several people have requested an earlier time slot. In addition, since so many people had trouble accessing the Google Calendar (I probably screwed up somewhere), I made a list with a date for each chapter:

      That's a link to google calendar in general. That link doesn't take us to *your* google calendar.

  Not good for europeans like me.

    Neither for GMT+2'ers like me.

    Seconded. This would be way too late for me, especially on weekdays

  Just curious, what's are the similarities and difference between this and hofstaders newer book, I Am A Strange Loop?

- u/saurik:

  You are linking to an illegal reproduction of this book (and one that you said on another thread said even has weird grammar errors, which to me makes it even worse to do that). The author once said this:

  > Hello -- Sorry, there's no electronic version of GEB, nor will there be one. I don't like e-books! But I do hope you have a good time reading GEB. All the best to you and your co-readers. -- Douglas Hofstadter.
  ```

  OK, I'll play, but I'll have to rely on my memory of the book because I don't have time to read it all again. I've read it a few times and kinda, sorta, almost felt like I understood most of it. I'm looking forward to reading other comments and contributing when I can.

  I'd like to participate, but I live in the UK. This would be midnight or 1 in the morning for me, depending on whether this is on daylight saving time. Could it be done any earlier? Say 2:00 PM?

  [Here's a calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=sbb8kfqbi5h2tiitp48cav939k%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles) for the readthrough.

  EDIT: There seem to be issues here; separating Prelude into it's own section instead of grouping it with Chapter 10 like all the other dialogues seems wrong.

  Cool, I'll get started.
  ```

- u/Darth_Hobbes:
  ```
  I'll try to catch up with you guys in a week after my finals are over.

- u/JulianHyde:
  ```
  In case anyone's interested, there's also an [MIT course on GEB](http://ocw.mit.edu/high-school/humanities-and-social-sciences/godel-escher-bach) available free online.

  Thank you very much for arranging this!
