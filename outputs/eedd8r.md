  All right, Rachel seems to have segfaulted into the Crayak/Ellimist database. That last scene...I'm not sure what exactly it means, but those definitely aren't Rachel's memories, Rachel had no idea that Ax is Helium now.

  Note that she hears Marco speak in ten voices, and there's a bunch of morph clones of him running around. Also note that Cassie is in that scene, and if dead Rachel is still in the cloud to be downloaded, it implies that Cassie is, too. It might be that she stumbled into the area where *everyone's* memories are being stored. Certainly seems to have done a number on her, either way.

    My guess at translating Rachel's mid-stroke thoughts:

    > Try but numb hand up bump cube at least, more face word Ante, Garrett, head spin floor burning blur blur blur gaussian?

    "Try to demorph the hand that's holding the cube first. Ugh, why is my face demorphing first? I see Ante and Garrett. If I'm gonna die I need to at least get the cube out of this morph."

    > calm

    "Okay, I think I did it."

    > CALM?  CALM?

    "OKAY?? I'm still dying!"

    > Mouth.  Face.  Hand.  Eyes.  Verb?  Hurts—

    "Demorphing these parts. Ow."

    >Ante “okay, g̴̠̈r̶̲̊â̵͜b̵͜͠ ̴̺̚h̵̰͠é̷ͅr̸̦̀—”
    >Garrett touch wait cube cube cube

    "Garrett's reaching for me. *Gotta demorph that cube.*

    > “Got it r̴͇̽a̵̖̤͛̄̚c̷̘͍̥͒̾̓h̷̼͈͝e̷̡͙̅l̶̨̺̼̋͒̌”

    "Got it, Rachel."

    > Spinning black
    > no

    Sleepy time.

    ***

    That's probably the most optimistic interpretation possible; it means Garrett's alive and they have the cube. In the context of what the avatar said, "The whole point is for you to be put in situations where your decisions are philosophically relevant...", it's interesting that this vision involves V3 offering the kids some kind of choice, with the boys all agreeing and Cassie trying to stop them.

  Well, fuck. Telor sacrificed themself. Wow.

  I was *not* expecting that. At least part of them is preserved through Terra, but still. Wow.

  And WTF is up with Rachel. Just like, WTF. Immune to prophecy, weird with the Chee, and somehow getting memories from both the past of this timeline and apparently some sort of alternate timeline... Is that a scene from canon?

  I'd like to point out that Rachel shouldn't know that she'd "never see Cassie again" since she doesn't know that all the cassie morph-holders died, but considering how much she seems to know things she shouldn't like Ax->Helium that might actually be intentional.

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    > Well, fuck. Telor sacrificed themself. Wow.

    Allegedly sacrificed itself.

    Also, half of Telor is in resistance custody, plus a chunk of it was split into Terra, so at most it sacrificed a chunk of itself.

  Girl, you have some serious self-esteem issues.

  > I frowned.  It was hard to be sure, but the outlets looked different—weren’t the usual two-lines-and-a-half-moon-face that I was used to.  Each spot was its own circular depression, with two tiny round holes spaced about an inch apart, and there was a large, old-fashioned switch at the end—

  For those wondering, [this](https://static.fnac-static.com/multimedia/Images/8A/8A/63/7B/8086410-1505-1540-1/tsp20180425104612/Multiprise-electrique-6-prises-1-50m-blanche.jpg#c2d90e88-7b68-4392-9734-645d8bfbfaf5) is likely what Rachel is staring at.

  The description lacks a mention of the ground connector, though (the small metal stick on each socket).

  > I’d read somewhere that chess grandmasters are more likely to lose to a total novice than to, like, a chess blue belt, because the novices violate rules and expectations that are so fundamental and basic that the grandmasters have no way to anticipate them, no experience coping with them.

  I get the simile Rachel is making, but that's not actually true.

  Novices in chess make very similar mistakes, that are very easy to capitalize on (eg they get their queen out too early, and put it in a position where it can easily be taken), and they are very bad at capitalizing on any mistake a grandmaster might make.

  Also, chess is a game where the first ~10 few moves are extremely important and essentially determine how the rest of the game will go; a novice player will either do mostly random moves (eg getting the knights out before the pawns, moving non-central pawns first) or mirror their opponents moves, while the grandmaster will be building a strong position that will give them a lot of offensive possibilities.

  > But there was also the way that she seemed to have caught feelings for Marco

  Don't you dare question that ship, past!Rachel! Why, future!Rachel knew what she was doing and her relationship with Marco was totally valid and not unhealthy at all!

  > “So there you go,” he said bitterly.  “Two months and four hundred sixty-one Euros.  How much you want to bet the plans aren’t even real?”

  Oh, so it's a future distant enough that NASA has put seismic sensors on the moon, but the Euro hasn't collapsed yet? That miiiight age poorly.

  (kidding; I'm not saying the Euro is doomed to collapse next financial crisis; but it's a possibility)

    > totally valid and not unhealthy at all!

    I do think that there *are* possible Rachel/Marco relationships within this universe that are valid and healthy, tho.  Like, CouteauBleu did not imply otherwise, but I wanted to clarify for third parties watching.

    AFAIK, the seismic sensors are reasonably likely in the quite near future:

    > In early 2018, NASA a new program called the Development and Advancement of Lunar Instrumentation (DALI).[11] The goal of DALI is to fund potential instruments so that they reach a technology readiness level of 6, meaning the instruments could be proposed for flight opportunities as early as 2023 and would not require significant technology development.

    No joke, though.

    Just like "parkour" is a new thing because it combines ancient elements in a particular, specific way, but all of the pieces of parkour have existed forever ...

    ... so too is "goal factoring" not reeeeaaaalllly a discovery or an invention, as much as it's just a crystallization or a recombination.  But the true Platonic ideal that lies *underneath* goal factoring is *hella* a guerilla warfare skill.

  fantastic chapter, thanks for writing!

  I'm not totally sure but I think that last bit is Rachel finally getting really fucked up from the seizures?

  No idea about that last flashback either but since Cassie is there, I think it might have to do with the alternate universes thing hinted at in the last chapter. There was also a flashback in the middle I didn't recognize at all (and found nothing when searching for it), the one about cutting off her arm.

  Another great chapter. This one felt like it's own little movie, kinda Bourne-ish haha. Love that Rachel immediately works the problem upon waking up in an unfamiliar environment.

  Curious about the seisure visions. I checked, and it doesn't look like old Rachel died in morph or anything like that, so I don't think it's purely morph tech behaving strangely. Plus the whole future vision at the end kinda rules that out.

  Poor opsec on Tobias's part with the whole Koskinen thing, though I'm not sure what else he could have done. Good thing Koskinen underestimated them. I'm curious whether morph clones maintain the ability to blow up the cube.

  Sorry the writeup is so brief, I just caught up on the new updates, need time to process. I may have more feedback to feed the beast later.

  And finally, wrong chapter but too late for the original thread, the Marco death scene in chapter 37 legitimately made me cry. So good onya TK17

  Here's a fun thought: could a Yeerk infest someone without their knowing it?

  Either

  1. By destroying some of their memories before exiting the brain, or

  2. By creeping into their head as they slept, then staying dormant, not taking any actions, only observing.

  Of course, 2 would likely be comparable to paralysis. Humans don't have the willpower for it. But Yeerks might, particularly if specialized for such a role when created by their source pool.

  Given the seizure, it's clear something is wrong with Rachel. This is probably an overambitious guess, but I wonder if this is not a true Rachel, but a Rachel constructed from interactions other Animorphs have had in their heads with her. That would explain the regular intrusion of imagined voices onto her inner monologue - particularly Marco. Perhaps the Ellimist is unable to model her in any other way, and he is responsible for this? Typically he would massage the resurrected backups to work better than they ought to, but for Rachel he cannot?

  We really need an explanation for why the Chee can't see Rachel properly. And that has to involve either time travel, the Ellimist or Crayak meddling, or something beyond even those two. The last is my favorite. Some intrinsic weakness in the simulation process they use, that is then propagated to Chee-tech based on theirs? A choice of one participant to hide their own actions from their future self?

  > Contempt, or compassion.  Disdain, or admiration.  I could feel the choice inside of me, the two potential paths, two blueprints of two very different Rachels, one impatient and cynical, the other empathetic and forgiving.  I could be the sort of person who looked at Ante and saw only his naïveté, his insufficiency, his overall meaninglessness in the grand scheme of things—

  > Or I could see the other thing.

  > Porque no los dos?

  > No.  I wasn’t strong enough.

  Good job anticipating my objection, TK.

  > And then I realized that I was thinking—that I was thinking, the now-Rachel, the Rachel who was demorphing, who was right now in the middle of a seizure-vision, I’d never come awake during one before—

  Does Z-space exist outside normal spacetime? We could get some [Borges](https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1936-borges-ahistoryofeternity.pdf) situations going here.

  No idea about the last scene's meaning. Maybe something to do with how Visser exists across z-space now? Some kind of Ms. Frizzle shenanigans where the Animorphs go the the Elemental Plane of Z to battle him in his own domain?
  ```

  - u/ALowVerus:
    ```
    I'm curious to see whether that type of intra-Z-plane combat is feasible. The concept of direction and distance seems alien to the Z-plane, as there are numerous simultaneous Z-plane users that never seem to have spacial overlap problems. The Z-space virus at least seems to have formalized a rule that you dont hit your targets in Z-space itself, you destabilize the targets that link to Z-space, using Z-space as a vector. That, at least, sticks to Z-space as a dimensionless void, not a place where you can directly physically find and whack people.
    ```

    - u/hyphenomicon:
      ```
      In the source material I believe that there was some incident where two objects in z-space interacted... [here it is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decision_(novel\)).

      And hey!

      > Just as the Animorphs volunteer for the mission, Marco disappears, causing a panic among Ax, Jake, and Cassie. After explaining their problem to the Andalites, the Andalite scientists theorize that the Animorphs' unexplained disappearances are the result of a "snapback" effect, meaning that when the Animorphs disappear, they are reappearing either on Earth or in Z-Space, the latter possibility causing fear among Ax, Jake, and Cassie.

      Seems relevant.

        I'm not sure if I'm remembering this right, but I thought there was a plot in the source where, while morphed as flies, the control link was severed, and the stored bodymass woke up in z-space shortly before being picked up *a la* hitchhiker's guide by a passing ship with a z-space ftl system.

    > By destroying some of their memories before exiting the brain, or

    My intent as author is that the first would be very difficult—a Yeerk piloting the brain is like a human operating a Mac or driving a car; some operations are very easy and others extremely difficult.  It's much easier for a Yeerk to simply physically injure someone than to remove a specific memory.  I'd expect removing a specific memory to be near-impossible (or like the sort of skill that Phillipe Petit has; a Yeerk could plausibly spend many many years perfecting the skill in a single brain, or something).

    I believe the second would be hard because there's pain and damage when a Yeerk crawls in, but let's say the person was drugged or blackout drunk—then yeah, I think the combination of their ability to soothe away the pain signals without the person ever knowing that they *should* be in pain, plus just lurking quietly in the brain, ought to do it.

    I also think it's possible to have something like a very small shard of Yeerk in your head, that will trigger a simple action given a simple stimulus, but is otherwise essentially undetectable (except by something like cancer-sniffing dog).
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:

      Also, given that most humans were infected with a Kandrona-producing virus, you don't really need these kinds of tricks because you can just have the yeerk be in control 24/7.

          Unless the morpher has a complete access to all "software" that controls the construct and was a part of it at the moment of acquiring - just because the construct doesn't know doesn't mean the morpher won't. (But maybe there was something in the story contradicting that...)

  In reading this chapter all I could think about was that information leak. Something is wrong with the interface.

  I wonder if Seerow ever even considered the resurrection/cloning use case. If he didn't, there could be all sorts of bugs and issues there. And where there's bugs, there's an opening for bad actors to exploit those bugs and potentially crack the system open.

  People are worried about privacy breaches if Google's databases got hacked. Imagine getting access to the mind of every past and present Morpher AND everyone they've ever acquired... That is some dangerous data.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    > I wonder if Seerow ever even considered the resurrection/cloning use case.

    This is personal headcanon, even though I'm the author (fic deliberately left open to alternate interpretations here), but imo he absolutely did not consider it, in part because of time pressure, and in part because his thoughts were still deeply influenced by the Andalite conception of the Path, making this somewhat unthinkable.
    ```

    - u/death_au:
      ```
      Now that I think about it more, he probably never even considered the use case of interrogating the minds of the aquirees.

      Actually, he probably did, as the Morpher has to put in some effort to wake up and access the aquired mind, as opposed to what I imagine a yeerk would experience by default. But he wasn't particularly mindful of data security considering how simple it seems to bypass.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Headcanon here is that initial passes on the morphing technology had a mind constantly screaming in agony under the layer of control, and Seerow was like, "Hmmm, that's annoying.  ~mute~"
        ```

        - u/FenrirW0lf:
          ```
          Wouldn't that spook Seerow pretty hard though, since he'd have direct evidence that he's violating the Path's prohibition against duplicating sentient minds? Or was his thought process divergent enough that he was able to rationalize it away?
          ```

          - u/death_au:
            ```
            He built in a thing that suppresses the sentient mind. He probably figured that solved the issue, without thinking about the fact that the mind could be un-suppressed.

            His rationalisation was probably along the likes of "the mind is suppressed, therefore not conscious, therefore not sentient". Or he just considered it as leftover neurochemical processes and not as true sentience.
            ```

          - u/TK17Studios:

            Yeah.  I don't as-yet imagine we'll see much of Seerow (he's kind of like Grindelwald or Godric in HPMOR; trying to hint that he has a fully fleshed out backstory but not actually likely to put it on screen).  But I conceive of him as extremely driven and extremely tunnel-visioned in a way that makes him look a lot like Riddle on the outside.

  Wait, 2023 as in the future? I'm confused. Apart from general "I feel like I would have noticed that by now", I have a memory of Marco giving the price of Bitcoin at a time that was past when that chapter was published. And I don't think several years have passed in-universe. Am I misremembering?

  > “There was this guest speaker from America—she was meeting with some bigwig in Estonia and came up for the day as a personal favor to Mr. Sotala.  She had these mental techniques, little step-by-step algorithms to help you think through your plans, figure out what you really want and how best to get it, avoid pitfalls, stuff like that.  It was funny—she kept calling the pitfalls ‘failure modes.’  We had to translate for the little ones.”

  I read this as Julia Galef? And Kaj Sotala.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Marco gave a price for Bitcoin that sounds like it's in the past, but it wasn't actually dated and there may have been a downturn.  By locking in a specific day of the week to a specific date on the calendar, I sharply limited the set of years in which r!Animorphs could possibly be set; thus far we've only seen about six (continuous) months on camera.

    Female guest speakers from America who are meeting with Jaan Tallinn and are competent to give a talk on goal factoring are likely [Julia Galef, Anna Salamon, Kenzi Amodei, Elizabeth Garrett, or __________ who appears sometime between now and then].  I guess it's distantly possible that they could be describing someone like Catherine Olsson or Cat Lavigne or Brienne Yudkowsky. Kaj Sotala is, afaik, uniquely identified (though he's not a high school teacher in a small suburb).

  Minor suggestion here (and I feel bad making a nitpick when I've never found the time to sit down and express my effusive praise for the story), but this part:

  "And so I’d followed Dr. Koskinen into another room and laid my hands on a strange girl’s arm, acquiring her.  Then I’d dressed myself in clothes from the lost and found and followed him down to his car."

  jars the attentive reader because it sounds like she gets dressed and gets in the car, where she's in morph, immediately following the acquisition - without waiting hours for the technology to make its first analysis. You do seem to have taken this into account when you give a five-hour timeframe later, but in the moment it seems like a continuity error.
  ```

  - u/Bay_Ridge_Bob:
    ```
    Since I went back to check Elfangor's wording, I noticed something - he credits the speed of subsequent acquisitions to the shared ancestry of life on Earth, which implies alien species would not be so quick to process. It seems a fair-enough theory to assume having acquired anything provides some partial speed advantage, which makes it plausible Jake was able to morph his dog quickly enough for a shower to be a natural cover and not a 13 year old running the house at midnight. It does seem to still be an issue with the Marcos in the monster mash, where they swap to their first native morph with such speed and urgency the Marco already demorphed and available to cover them gets left behind to watch himself die. Hahah, sorry to treat the story like some kind of adversarial puzzle! I'm just kind of obsessed with it... I'll find the time someday to write some paragraphs about why

I really wanted to think that maybe V1 was coerced into giving up those codes she was talking about last chapter, but if that was the case why wouldn’t the Animorphs take credit for it? That would be a major moral boost and Marco would know humanity would need it. 

  Also is Rachel all the way stroked out or can she recover? Don’t do Rachel like that man, that’s fucked up.

  When this fic decides to be snarky at canon, boy it does not hold back. I really think that's what's missed the most if you haven't read the source material -- all those moments where r!Animorphs is just completely vicious about something that was, tbh, kind stupid in the original. Visser 3's Disney-andalite reveal was another moment like that, that stood out for how pointed it was. I really like those moments, but they're also slightly jarring. 

  Other things I appreciate in this fic: the text is fully inside the perspective of the protagonist. I really think this is something that divides the okay fiction from the great fiction, and I think this fic does it excellently. The positioning of the flashbacks to match demorphing and the end sequence where you're inside the perspective of her stroke really drive it home, this chapter. It might sound like a simple, entry-level thing, but I think it's harder than it looks, and a lot of fiction, even serious published paper fiction, will slip into author perspective at times. It also centres character thought processes, which is something I enjoy in rationalfic.

    Man, a lot of it is trying to be tongue-in-cheek, not vicious.  Whoops.

    > harder than it looks

    <3 for the compliment; it's particularly tough trying to think my way into so many characters, many of whom are very very different from me.  I'm glad it's working.

  A slower, more laid back chapter! I like that we get some perspective on what the rest of the world has been doing in response to all the chaos.

  One of the most unique things about this fic is how the characters periodically get reset to previous versions, completely undoing the character development that happened since. I'm not sure how I feel about this. On the one hand, this means there are real, permanent consequences when things go wrong. On the other hand, it's frustrating as a reader having things constantly undone. In this chapter there's a nice balance because Rachel is getting memories from her other self, and is able to see the path that she would have walked down and deliberately steer herself in a different direction. I've never seen that kind of dynamic explored in fiction before in quite this way, and it's really cool, but still frustrating.

  The way Rachel is getting these memories doesn't quite make sense to me. I get that when she demorphs, there's something about the residual yeerk tissue still in her brain that is transferring information as it slowly dies. But why is she getting her own memories? I assume that you get the memories of the person who morphed into you and stayed past the time limit. But this version of Rachel came from a cancer patient morphing her, right? Why wouldn't she get the cancer patient's memories? I guess there's just some information leak from other versions of herself in the morphing tech's storage system, somehow. (So then couldn't she get the memories of any morpher from any time and place?)

  > There's exactly one review of this story on Goodreads that's longer than  a sentence!  It comes from user Mark and features many memorable  sentences like "the author uses this as a vehicle to mine others'  notstalgia for their own self-indulgence and misses what made the  originals so appealing" and "themes of loss, dehumanization, and the  morality of war aren't really carried over" and "the other changes are  just fine, I guess, but don't really serve any purpose in my  opinion...at best, they make the main characters somewhat  one-dimensional" 

  Well, I strongly disagree with this reviewer, of course. I suppose people who aren't familiar with rationalist tropes tend to have these sorts of problems with rational fics, but I think the worldbuilding here is genius and awesome. I do think that this fic *feels* very different from the originals. When I started reading this, I went back and reread some of the original Animorphs books, and I could barely get through them because the characters were so immature and anti-rationalist by comparison. The major themes of loss, dehumanization, and the morality of war *do* carry over, I think, but in an incredibly weird and unique way that only a rationalist fanfiction of the already weird Animorphs could possibly have done. Everything about mind sharing / voluntary controllers / character resets / character cloning makes complete sense in-universe and is also completely unique in fiction (to this extent), as far as I'm aware.

  > “Rachel—will you be going to school with Ante?” 

  Can't believe she's going back after what happened last time she went to school, but oh well, I guess the risk is much lower this time.

  > “‘Act now,’” the anchor repeated.  “‘Act now.  If all has gone according  to plan, Telor’s sacrifice has bought humanity temporary military  supremacy within this system.  In addition to the destruction of the  mothership and three of its remaining Bug fighters, we estimate an  eighty-five percent chance that Visser Three himself has been rendered  temporarily ineffective, and a fifteen percent chance that he has been  eliminated outright. 

  Nice - the Animorphs aren't the only "main characters" at play in this war. Though I wouldn't bet on Visser 3 being made ineffective.

  >The cube can transfer the morphing power to five individuals every  thirteen seconds!  Twenty people a minute, a thousand people an hour, a  hundred and fifty thousand per week!  You could have given every soldier  in Finland this power, in the months you’ve kept it to yourself!”  
  >  
  >“We’ve kept it safe from the *Yeerks,”* I snarled

  I mean, he's not wrong - they could recruit so many more people than what they've done. They really should step up their mass-recruiting game again - not to a thousand people per hour, for security reasons, but still, a new auxiliary Animorphs team every few days would be nice, like what they were doing before the TPK.

  > *The walls seemed to shimmer, to flex—changing colors, changing  shape, one moment flat unpolished metal, the next smooth beige plastic.   There were lights, shifting and flickering—beeps and clicks, radio  voices—a viewscreen like the one on the starship Enterprise, showing—* ....  
  >  
  > *‹Yes, or no,› thundered the voice of the Visser, from where he  stood, surrounded by Marines all pointing their guns at him—no, he was  on the viewscreen—both?* 

  Okay, wow, what on *earth* is this vision, because it's definitely not something that happened \[yet\]. A flash forward? A memory from an alternate timeline? Visser One mentioned time travel previously, so I'm guessing this has something to do with time travel and with the divergence point between the Reckoning universe and the original. But beyond that I have *no clue* where this plot is going.

    That was one of the two "absolutely must accomplish" goals of the chapter (the other will be clear later but I can't comment on it here).

    > it's really cool, but still frustrating

    Sssssssorry; fwiw pretty soon people will be wishing we could go back to lingering

    > I guess there's just some information leak from other versions of herself in the morphing tech's storage system, somehow.

    > Let it goooooo

    Ya know, maybe I should give up and watch Frozen just to avoid *accidentally* triggering these sorts of things.

    > Nice - the Animorphs aren't the only "main characters" at play in this war.

    This was an important subgoal of the chapter; I started counting up all of the open threads, and all of the allegedly-pretty-agentic individuals and groups that would Very Much Be Trying To Get A Handle On Things, and realized that a downtime chapter would be a good moment to show off what that looks like from the helpless outside.

    > I mean, he's not wrong

    It's interesting, seeing various people react to the Koskinen-Rachel fight (in comments and stuff too, not primarily here).  My intention was to have them both have *really really solid points,* while remaining in disagreement.

    Rachel getting visions like that is weird, and we don't know why that's happening but it's safe to assume that it's related to Rachel's general weirdness. She wasn't part of the Ellimist's prophecy, she isn't seen as a namable person by the Chee, etc.

    Memory injection happening during demorph has happened before, every timestop/Ellimist interaction has been through that. The morphing tech moves the mind from meat to some sort of Z-space emulator (and puts the body in stasis) and unmorphing involves moving that mindstate back into the meat brain.

  With all the other subtle nods to canon (Marco cutting off Helium as he tries to explain Hork-Bajir linguistics a couple chapters ago <3), there's one I've been looking out for: Rachel makes a critical choice that could sway the E/C game. Throughout the later books in canon, Rachel has a standing offer from Crayak: Immortality, awesome power, and eternity as Crayak's right-hand girl, and all she has to do is kill Jake. Given that the game is supposed to be about setting up situations where important events hinge on the kids' choices, and that if she hadn't talked Ante back from the brink the cube would likely be lost (no one to translate Finnish for Garret-morph at the bank), I wonder if the whole "which kind of person do I want to be?" sequence was meant to be a parallel to that?
