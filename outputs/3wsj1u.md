## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  What do people here do? From what I remember of the last time we had a survey, the average age of /r/rational was somewhere in the twenties. And of course we're all nerds even by the standards of Reddit.

  So are you a student? Do you work for a living? In either case, is it in a field related to rationality or writing? Are there any full-time authors in the subreddit (living the dream)?

    I'm a software engineer, which has been my job for about six years now. I'm planning to be a stay-at-home dad in the near future, probably with some software/web contract work on the side and downtime devoted to writing and editing (more of the latter than the former). I'm 29 years old, white, and male, if you want demographics. I live in the northern half of the Midwest.

    Twenty year-old college student double-majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I'm planning on going to graduate school for cognitive science research since I'm more interested in studying brains than trying to recreate a brain out of silicon.

    Shockingly, cognitive science is helping me to learn more about AI related stuff than actual computer science classes on AI. It's probably due to the fact that I'm taking specialized classes which overlaps my two majors, but *still*.

    Hopefully cognitive science will allow me to better practice rationality skills, but with the publish-or-perish problems in academia, I kinda doubt it.

    I don't really have any interest in being a full-time writer, but I still want to try writing a book at some point.

      GOFAI ("Good Old-Fashioned AI") sucked, but most classes labeled "AI" are still about GOFAI rather than about ways brains can actually work.

        I know right?!? Cognitive science's where I first learned about neural nets and Bayes nets, and how to actually program them. In AI classes, we keep spending time on how to represent logical systems and do inference and deductive algorithms which nearly anyone can tell, after a few months, are mostly useless for real-world tasks. Stuff which uses probabilities in some way to represent uncertainty, such as mixture models, are the way to go.

        What are they doing spending an entire *year* on AI methodology from the 1990s or earlier? That's a fourth of my college years and I want to just freaking skip ahead to the cutting-edge research already!!! And no, I don't think I actually need that much of a grounding in the basics to get the more relevant stuff. My teacher basically admitted the same thing.

        For all I know it might be different in the really advanced classes, but it's taking so long to get there and I'm finding cognitive science research to be so fascinating that I've decided to not continue with computer science research in grad school.

    Early 30s, live in the midwest, engineering professor working in a branch of applied math. 

    One might expect this to be a job that trains rationality skills, but, largely due to the publish-or-perish pressures of the job, I'm finding that not to be the case at all; if anything, my job trains you to make superficially plausible arguments which pass sanity checks from reviewers skimming your work.

    - u/None:

      I'd love to know how you do that, actually.  I've got one more thesis chapter to publish and another, more theoretical piece of research that's languished for years because I suck at phrasing and writing things to superficially make it past reviewers.

    My degrees are in EE / robotics, but I graduated during the dawn of the WWW and followed the money (engineering is the art of converting knowledge into cash) so I do software as a job. I'm a named inventor on several smart phone patents  (predating the iPhone by nearly a decade, no product was released. .. too expensive at the time)  I've also done physical and computer security, now I'm mainly dealing with scaling non-technical problems. Then again, aren't we all?

    I'm a graduate student studying machine learning and statistics -- basically, data science. I am currently subsisting off of my reseach assistantship. I have heard rationality described as "data science as a world view" so I suppose what I'm doing is extremely relevant to rationality.

    I'm a data analyst for a large software company. Ideally this job is very close to rationality. In practice it's closer to debate club in that you're preparing arguments to sway, not engaging in a dialectic. 

    It's scary how bad at knowledge and uncertainty large organizations are. And willfully so. But that means there's lots of room for improvement and that responsible data analysts can do some good.

    I'm a 26 year old software engineer in silicon valley. I work for a living and live comfortably, but I don't do anything in a field related to rationality or writing. I'd recommend this sort of living to anyone who is comfortable doing it. The hours and pay are good, and we need programmers for the foreseeable future.

    I'm definitely a nerd by most measures, but compared to my peers and friends in this area, I'm one of the less nerdy people I know. People are pretty nerdy around here, it's really great.

  What do people here think of 

  https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/antidepressants-taken-during-pregnancy-increase-risk-of-autism-by-87-percent

  http://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20140827/do-antidepressants-in-pregnancy-raise-risks-for-mental-woes-in-kids

  These are two studies that appear to reach opposite conclusions on whether antidepressants cause autism after controlling for level of depression.  The first of these was frontpage at reddit today.


  I know someone on antidepressants who is considering having a baby. I wonder how much of an effort she should make to go off them.
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    The study seems to single out SSRIs in particular, but the fact that taking *any* antidepressants had a negative effect makes me suspicious.

    They have a large number of different mechanisms, some acting on entirely different neurotransmitters (e.g. NRIs, tricyclics, MAOIs), and if they all have a similar result then perhaps it is the condition being treated that causes the result (or, alternatively, it applies to a larger class of psychoactive drugs than just antidepressants).

    That said, I have no medical background and can't critique it from that perspective. I just get suspicious when somebody finds an effect which is at an unusual level of specificity (in this case, singling out antidepressants vs. all psychoactive drugs vs. specific classes of antidepressant).
