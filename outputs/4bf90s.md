  We had exhausted the possibility of encountering any uncontacted civilization on this Earth. Alas, there's nothing more exotic than the oriental. No lost civilization or big grand mysteries.

  But what if we made Earth bigger? Ginormously big that uncontacted civilization became possible!

  Big enough for parallel histories to play side-by-side until contact in the 21st century or later.

  That's the idea behind this world.

  Kiba, I didn't know you posted here.

  Reminds me of The City from [Blame!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame!) (an important work of the cyberpunk genre) except less obviously malicious. It's got Builder and Safeguard analogues, Megastructure as well. 

  I always did love Blame!.

  I think the framing device is not as transparent as you intended it to be.

  Dyson spheres are not very massive for their size, because they're mostly made of empty space. Even dissassembling the star for matter (repeating typo: "matters"; matter is uncountable, like water) only makes it very slightly more thick. Why do the narrators think it is dense? What, is it solid? I don't know. Why don't they know the size of a black hole as massive as their lower bound for the anomalosphere? (Typo: "assuming that the object is made of only ordinary *sphere*")

  How much of the ΑΔ09γ habitat is habitable? "There are places" where it is habitable implies that there are places where it s not, so it's confusing when you then say "all of the sphere" is habitable. I'm also still confused by the mass thing from earlier,so I don't know if you mean the surface or the volume.

  (Typo: "transportations"; transportation is also uncountable.)

  Cubes: Woah, woah, slow down! Warp-trains get three sentences of reasoning and explanation, but reality bending devices only get "they're square"? What exactly does "reality manipulation" mean? Force walls? Matter creation? FTL? Non-euclidean geometry? Time travel? Rewriting the laws of physics so that quarks no longer bond? Are there different cubes for different tasks, or can any cube do anything? Are they safe to be around, or are they sealed behind sheiding to power things from afar? Do they affect the area around them, or can they select a target? If it's an area effect, can they manipulate reality so that the rest of the world sees the cube at the position of the target? How do our narrators even know what they are, if they don't know what they do? Are they just trusting the Assisstant?

  Who cares who built the extrasphere and why? Okay, anthropologists and stuff, I guess. Nerds. No, the important question is: How can I build my own? The Assissistant apparently isn't *too* shy about explaining Cubes and such, and those will revolutionize multiversal society! Evidently, it also explained how to turn a Dyson sphere into a Bessler sphere like this one. We're gonna be rich!

  I have no idea how Matryoshka Super-Earth 10374 is related to the larger exotic megastructure. Is it embedded in the shell in a protected cavity? Is it floating freely in the empty spact where the star was? What does the "ceiling" look like from the outside, as our narrators would see it? Does the planet have contact with the larger structure, or is the ceiling impenetrable to them?

  (Typo: "hallow")

  The planet takes up the largest part of your post, so I assume that's the setting that you're actually interested in, right? And the ceiling is impenetrable, and the humans are barely industrialized? If that's true, is there a point to the rest of this "sphere" stuff at all? Why don't you just say, "There's an Earth that's bigger than Jupiter. It has layers. No space travel. It works because magic."?

  ```
  What exactly do you want us to take a look at? I'm not sure that this has even reached "bare bones" status; about the only thing we know about the inhabitants is that a very small number of them are human, and these humans have industrialized.
  ```
