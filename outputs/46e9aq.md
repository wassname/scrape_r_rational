## [META][D] Animorphs: The Reckoning for best rational fic (and some thoughts on the genre)

### Post:

[Animorphs: The Reckoning](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning) may in fact be the best existing rational fic.  Or it may not be.  It doesn't really matter, and as The Reckoning is incomplete it is of course too early to judge, but I really like this fic and would like to take a moment to write (in, I realize, a somewhat disorganized and unconvincing manner) why I like it so much.  Hopefully I can convince a people here to read along if anyone isn't already doing so, which would make this post no less long but a bit less pointless.

**A Note About Rational Fiction**

HPMOR is my "favorite" rational fic and in some ways my "favorite" book.  It's so awesome!  I grew up with it and it had a substantial effect on who I am today.  However at the same time it is imperfect and in some ways not even that good.  I certainly wouldn't recommend it to everyone (meaning here nerds and SFF fans).  A lot of stuff in HPMOR that led to the creation of a community and genre are harmful when looking at the fic just as a piece of fiction.  The Metropolitan Man, on the other hand, I can safely recommend to most people.  It is a tight, well written fic that clearly comes from a rationalist millieu, but doesn't spend a lot of time proselytizing.  There are some ways in which The Metropolitan Man is "better" than HPMOR.  It was a step forward for the genre, and if ratfic grows (which I hope it will in the interest of [raising the sanity waterline](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1e/raising_the_sanity_waterline/) and because I like to read it) then I think it will probably be through the writing of fic generally more like The Metropolitan Man than like Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.  **I think that Animorphs: The Reckoning is, right now, the pinnacle of rational fiction.**  It is an example of "mature rational fic" in the way that The Metropolitan Man is, and I think it is another step forward for the genre.
 
**A Few Quick Points on the General Quality of Animorphs: The Reckoning**

* On a technical level the writing is very good, competitive for best in the field.  The prose remains compelling during arguments, action scenes, and long internal monologues.

* The stakes are high and immediately clear.  Bad things are allowed to happen.

* It is entirely readable without knowledge of canon (at least, I have none and have greatly enjoyed the story).

* It does a great job of balancing a huge world/universe and the sense that the actions of the characters are meaningful.

* Everything that happens is a step forward in the plot which moves at a steady, confident pace without sacrificing characterization or becoming static in tone or the amount of tension.

**What the Story Does Differently**

It is not the only rational fic that uses multiple perspectives, but it is the most extreme and I think uses them to the best effect.  It cycles through 6 (I think?) central characters, all with well developed perspectives and their own competencies.  These characters are all intelligent in their own ways; each one one is thoughtful, proactive, and demonstrates a style and degree of "rationality".  Each one is allowed to be right and to make mistakes. There are characters with whom I empathize the most, but I can totally see others having a different experience.  Further, through this variety of perspectives the story avoids the trap of having a "standard male rationalist hero", the transhumanist, utilitarian genius who enters a world and changes everything.  It allows for the inclusion of munchkining, obvious consequentialist correctness, leadership/charisma, and plenty of moments of awesome without creating a somewhat embarrassing ubermensch power fantasy.  I'm not sure I ever read any fic that totally falls into this trap (beyond perhaps HPMOR), but it's refreshing to read something that avoids it so handily.  

Another way this story is different is that the Animorphs have, in all honesty, kind of a lame power.  Turning into animals is a lot less potent than being a wizard or a magic ninja or being able to loop through time.  But this is actually a huge benefit to the story!  The situation seems more desperate, even futile, than that of any other rational fic I've read (imagine The Metropolitan Man if Superman was already evil), and the munchkining becomes even more satisfying when the power is so limited in scope.

**I Don't Have a Conclusion**

Anyway, if you are in this sub and and you haven't checked this out, I think you probably should.  It's on a hiatus at the moment but there are [87,000 words](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning) just waiting for you to read and enjoy.

Thoughts?  Other "best rational fic" contenders?  Anyone else dislike the current formulation of rational vs. rationalist fiction and think we can do better?

  I should note that while I am deeply honored/flattered, I'm also intensely interested in people's *critical* feedback, particularly if anyone has some that they've simply never bothered to offer before.  The next round of chapters starts going up on March 1st, and I'm hoping for it to be an improvement over the previous.

    ```
    In chapter 1, Elfangor gives a Andalite-Chronicles-compliant timeline for Alloran's capture. In chapter 10, Cassie remembers it as "the yeerks started the war by abducting Alloran", which I guess is an idea you came up with after writing chapter 1.

    Also, I had a really long and interesting rant about the way you treated the yeerks' personalities and the way you seemed to be planning ahead for your story, but Ctrl+W ate it. Since I'm too tired to write it all again, I'll sum it up: thinking up all the details of the morphing cube technology and the leeran biology in advance is cool. Doing the same with the yeerk psychology instead of defaulting to the early canon "supervillain henchman" personality would be cool too. Also, it had the word Xx_Ellimist_xX.

    And while we're dumping things raw from my sleepy brain: the thing in early canon where Chees abudcted yeerks and submitted then to reverse controlling was super creepy and at odds with them being actual pacifists. Why the hell did you keep it? Actually, why do you draw from early canon that much? A lot of the concepts Applegate introduced became cooler after she revisited them, so working with their first version seems a bit odd.

      > the thing in early canon where Chees abudcted yeerks and submitted then to reverse controlling was super creepy and at odds with them being actual pacifists.

      Depends on how you define pacifism, and maybe even aggression. The Chee probably consider pacifism to be nonviolence. Keeping a Yeerk captive but fed probably qualifies as nonviolent for them, especially considering that it might be naive for us to expect that our ethical codes would fully overlap. Maybe the Pemalites had a different theory of looking at things.
      ```

    - u/Sancdar:
      ```
      How different is having a housepet, which the Chee heartily endorse, from having a yeerk kept confined, fed, and oblivious to its imprisonment?
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        That... makes a disturbing amount of sense.
        ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Alloran: Correct, I changed things between Ch. 1 and Ch. 10.  I think it makes much, much more sense for Alloran's Fall to have been the opening move of the war, and will clean up the confusion on a later pass.  Currently, I think it's actually sort of realistically neat that people get details confused, but it's bad writing and will be clarified so that the *reader* doesn't get confused (or think *I'm* confused).

      Yeerks' personalities: We've seen extremely little of the Yeerk culture thus far (one open exchange with a Controller, plus Esplin who is a known aberration).  I have done the same level of thinking for the Yeerks, and I think you have pleasant surprises ahead of you for the depth and nuance of what's going on with the Yeerk species as a whole.  Your complaint is a good reminder that I could have seeded these things sooner, and that I should start including bits of detail ASAP.

      The Chee: There's got to be *some* way for them to interact directly with the Yeerks, or the whole deal about them being worthwhile to the Animorphs by being informants falls apart.  It's already curtailed by V3's discovery of their true nature, but—well—tbh, I just didn't question the whole reverse Controller thing?  Which is weird, since I was questioning just about everything else.  I dunno.  Maybe I'm status-quo-biasing myself into this opinion, but I think it's an interesting compromise already.  Like, they've got to have some sort of programming loophole which doesn't recognize infestation as violence, or they'd be compelled to put a stop to it, right?  Something like, Yeerks maintain their hosts, so their hosts tend to brush their teeth and exercise and eat right, so the Chee involuntarily categorize it as acceptable or something.  So there's something screwy with their programming already, and having that allow for them to hold Yeerks in stasis or hypnosis or whatever seems legit.  Yell at me if I'm being lame, though.

      I generally draw from very early and very late canon because those felt like the parts that were most considered.  Like, the ghostwritten books with Atlantis and the starfish and the ant morphing into a human—that stuff's just straight-up insane.  Early canon (with reasonable tweaks) is the story I wanted to tell.

      Xx_Ellimist_xX?  Does that mean "don't include the Ellimist"?  If so, sorry—Ellimist is in, and important.  I will go ahead and say that I'd like for this to be a story about the Animorphs, and not a story in which none of the characters matter because it's secretly all between God and Satan.  This is a hard balance to strike in a rational fic, because Ellimist is ... well, *God*.  But I think I've got the right structures into place to make it happen.

      Thank you for putting forth actual criticism!  I found it useful, and I'm grateful.  Summary: 1) Yeah, I screwed up, 2) I agree; look forward to it, 3) Hmm, good point; I'm initially tending to make no changes but I want to mull it over.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        We know that "Ellimist" is not his real name, but rather a pseudonym he took when playing the local equivalent of Spore. A lot of pseudonyms in the real world of the real reality are not merely composed of an invented word, but instead have added formatting, like Xx_[your name]_xX or [your handle]_42, etc... So I found it amusing to imagine that Toomin's pseudonym would be something like XoOo_Ellimist_oOoX and mention it offhandedly.

        I tend to think that the range of books between book 13 (the one with escaped Hork Bajiirs) and the first ghostwritten books (up to book 30, the one where Marco tries to kill Visser 1 on a mountain) are the sweet spot. Before that, Applegate was still figuring things out. After that, the stories really started to become gimmicky and repetitive. Also, the Chronicles. They are all awesome and I'm squeeing every time I see a reference to them in the fic.

        Finally, for the first point : I disagree, this is not an error Elfangor would make. This is like someone saying "Yeah, the Nazis started invading Poland in 1941 as part of operation Barbarossa", right after the end of the war. People wouldn't make this confusion, let alone military officers.

    I wish you hadn't let the Chee exist. I like the idea of the Animorphs being totally alone. I also kind of hate the Chee anyways. Maybe you should kill off all the Chee soon? And all dogs on planet Earth too, as deific punishment for the Chee having existed earlier. Remember that being extremely mean to characters for no reason is the best tool of any writer. The Chee are way too OP. The animorphs shouldn't get access to any technology that they don't earn.

    Maybe it would be helpful for you to consider the question, if this *were* going to end up as a futile tragedy, what would happen? Then you can take aspects of the tragedy story and put them into the actual story, regardless of whether or not the real story ends up being entirely tragic. I want the Animorphs to win, but I feel like you have been holding back a bit too much.

    I think we arguably need more Yeerk characters other than Visser 3, like a prominent mook or spy chief or something. He feels too much like a one man operation at the moment. He needs advisors or something. If he doesn't interact with anyone besides Alloran, his character becomes predictable and stagnant. I enjoy how smart he is, but he seemingly has almost no personality besides that, which is disappointing.

      Chee are an important piece of the chess game/puzzle.  I'll be honest—I never really considered removing them, and if I had, I might have decided to do so.  But they were one of those pieces I viewed as "something to fix/figure out/solve" rather than just removing.

      +1 to the "get more Yeerks into the picture."
      ```

  - u/TimTravel:
    ```
    I like that the yeerks get an intelligence upgrade also but if both sides are equally intelligent and one side has far greater resources and there's no plot armor then it's going to be one-sided. One possible solution is a bizarre ethical/religious system the yeerks constrain themselves to, but I haven't thought that idea through. It may or may not make for a good story. There has to be something the good guys have that the bad guys don't or there isn't a story. So far it's been good but if you just faithfully play it out where one side is heavily advantaged then that side will win.

    I realize that it's completely possible you thought of this already and it just hasn't been revealed yet. I'm just mentioning it as a concern going forward.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, one of the advantage the yeerks would have in your average rational fic is that they're assumed to be the Empire: the leaders are ruthless and evil, the minions are loyal, and there is no bureaucracy or counter-productive rituals slowing them down.

      Which leads me to wonder what the counterfactual story would look like: a story where the Yeerks Empire has a massive technological and logistical advantage over the animorphs, but is slowed down by their complex system of government, or their rivaling churches? Food for thought.

      EDIT: Before anyone answers "but Visser 1 and Visser 3 do fight", I'd say that doesn't really count: most of the vissers we see are cooperating with the empire and with each other. We don't see V1 sabotaging the shark factory to hinder V4's progresses on Leeran. We don't see the Animorphs winning battles thanks to the disruptive efforts of the Peace Movement. No minion ever goes "Well, I failed this mission. Guess it's time to organize Visser 3's assassination before he figures it out!".

  One specific thing I would like to remark upon regarding the Reckoning is that I really enjoy seeing the viewpoints, on both sides, of people thinking through a situation in what appears to be a rather logical, reasonable way... and ending up with totally wrong conclusions. And then we have people who are actually smart who are shown not just somehow magically reaching the correct conclusions, but instead detecting that something is wrong with their wrong conclusions, picking at the problem and coming up with better options.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Personally, I really like 'Animorphs; the Reckoning' to, particularly the characterizations of Marco and Jake and how they think. I just like in a different way than HPMOR. I think people liked HPMOR because it was written about a fandom where the average reader could spot a thousand little things in canon that, if properly explored, could have ended the plot. 
  Animorphs was something I read and didn't really have any misgivings about logic wise (unlike Harry Potter), so this fic didn't really give me the joy of seeing some of my criticisms of canon fulfilled like HPMOR did. Instead it simply made more the story more realistic, and gave every character a fully functioning brain and personality- exactly what rational fiction should do.

    Huh, it was different for me.  I see that as something that draws readers, but not one of the main reasons to enjoy it.  I feel like that is a main appeal to readers who won't read any other rational fic.

  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  I really agree with the part about the "standard rationalist hero". A common point in a lot of SI fics and rational fics is that the world feels warped because they treat 'being right' the way most stories treat 'winning fights': you're only allowed to do it if you're a protagonist. HP:MoR had this problem (the only one who consistently gets things right is Tom Riddle, and characters like Amelia Bones or Hermione are only allowed to compensate in their own domain of expertise). With this Ring also has something similar, where the protagonist notices at some point that he started to think of himself as the only person who can possibly take a good initiative in the whole universe.

  On the other hand, the Metropolitain Man is really balanced: Lex Luthor, Lois Lane and (briefly) Superman are all allowed to have different, opposed opinions and argue them in compelling ways. This is something that MoR also does, but MM goes one step further and allows these three characters (as well as side characters like the cops or Mercy) to have insights of their own, being level 2 intelligent instead of level 1, using Yudowsky's words. Luthor can imagine compelling arguments to stop Superman (the last BvS trailer gives me hope we might see something similar with Batman's motivations), Lois Lane can think about the ways Superman should do more for other people, Superman can understand these critics and point out the hypocrisy in people demanding he saves the world instead of doing it themselves.

  Anyway, my point was, The Reckoning does something even more awesome: it gives us 5+ separate viewpoint characters, all with level 2 intelligence, all with both common sense and imagination, and their own domain of expertise. And then, they bicker. All. The. Friggin. Time. Awesome.

  EDIT FROM 7 MONTHS LATER: Boy was I wrong about Batman V Superman.

  I disagree. The Reckoning is nicely written, and the worldbuilding looks interesting so far. However, the protagonists just fail too hard at rationality for my tastes. The protagonists are stupid, then the enemy is clever, and then the protagonists get saved by dumb luck / divine intervention.

  Consider: The obvious plan of action for the protagonists would be:

  1. Recruit smart and mature people into their resistance
  2. Whatever they and their new recruits can come up with

  Obvious way of recruiting would be to send one (Marco?) to move across the country and probably never return. The recruiter would have free pick among non-prominent sciency people. By demonstrating morphing he could convinve any science-minded rational person that his story is sufficiently plausible and the stakes are sufficiently high. This also solves funding (every recruit will give his full net worth), and moral considerations (nonexisting because of high stakes). 

  Meh, now I want to read a fic where exactly this happens.

    You're neglecting the fact that these are fourteen-year-olds who've had basically ONE WEEK thus far to adapt to the realities of an alien invasion, much of which was spent under time pressure of one form or another.  A story in which they were *that* on-the-ball from the get-go would be unrealistic and boring, falling square into the ubermensch wish fulfillment fantasy hole that some people are criticizing HPMOR for.

    The fact that it strikes you as the obvious move means that it's clearly something that's going to occur to the protagonists before very long unless I'm not doing my job.  But personally I think I'm *already* pushing it on the realism axis, when it comes to how quickly I've let them start breaking their mental boundaries and thinking outside the box.

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Searching for more competent people to take the weight of responsibility off ones shoulders seems like the most obvious move to me for any kid that didn't grow up with trust issues. Like, why *does* Jake think that he should even be making the decision whether to inform the Army or not? For Tobias it makes sense because authority has never made his life easier, Cassie seems to have off-loaded decision making more than partially on the others and shouldn't feel as much of an urge to do it further and Rachel characterization is more of a do instead of think anyway. But for reluctant leader Jake and straight man Marco it is rather weird. Especially since not only is "everything is horrible and we need help" a natural reaction but you have already shown Jake, Marco and Cassie think along such lines on screen.

      But I'd prefer if you explored Jake and Marco's behavior regarding this more deeply instead of having them just suddenly decide to look for help as if they'd just not thought of it till now.

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Eh.  May be a bit of a mistake on my part, as a writer.  But honestly, I think it's pretty realistic for them to have only now reached the decision.  They were reacting-reacting-reacting for the first few days, with no real time to reach out.  Then Jake was comatose and Marco was wrecked, while Cassie was PTSD'ing and missing.  Now's really the first chance they've had to convince themselves it's a good move.

  Can you elaborate?

  While I like Metropolitan Man a lot, it lacks the sheer awesomeness of HPMOR.
  ```

  - u/4t0m:
    ```
    I totally agree that HPMOR is more "awesome".  When I say that I expect (even hope) that future ratfic will look more like Metropolitan Man, I don't mean that it will not be awesome (though it may be hard to be as awesome as HPMOR).  

    Basically my view is that HPMOR created a community/genre, and to do that it basically had to convince (at least some) readers that, for example, death is bad and rationality is important.  Because it was meant as an educational work, there's also a lot of references to studies and explicit teaching moments.  I think that these things tend to make HPMOR worse as a work of literature.  

    What future ratfic can do that HPMOR didn't or couldn't include things like:

    * Just having a rational character and assuming that the audience is on board

    * Showing fun/interesting/rational thought processes but excluding descriptions of specific studies

    * Focusing on just one aspect of rationality

    * Having a more focused plot / less "fluff'

    * Probably more... :/

    It isn't that the above things automatically make potential future stuff better than HPMOR, but future stuff will lack a lot of restrictions that HPMOR had as result of the things it was trying to accomplish.

    HPMOR was really, *really* preachy, and that turns a lot of people off. It also can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or serious. I mean, comedies can be serious, and serious stories can be comedic, but HPMOR took this to extremes. There's also the fact that none of the children are believable as children.

          How so? I havn't known a lot of ten year olds, since having been one, but none of the characters struck me as unbelievable. Harry had another soul in him, and he was home-schooled by intelligent people. Hermione was schooled in a similar way, and she seemed to show the childishness one should expect from an ordinary soul. Draco's development was accelerated in exactly the way I'd expect the ideological and political antigens in his environment to have pushed him - humans have always had innate talents for callousness and deceit, and he had a very good teacher.

          And the other kids seemed about as dull as they should.
