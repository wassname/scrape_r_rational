  I'm looking for LitRPG/Xianxia/any other kind of progression worlds where the high levels are actually smarter than the low levels.

  As in, these types of novels often have intelligence stats, or claim that each breakthrough or level up makes the person better all-around. Yet despite the high levels allegedly having "superhuman intelligence", they are still as dumb as any low level. The only difference the "intelligence" stat seems to make is that the person is somehow able to understand magic/rune/Daos/etc. better, or that they can think "faster" (but somehow only do so while in combat).

  This is an especially glaring problem with the protagonist. You can read through hundreds of chapters of level ups and breakthroughs and dumping thousands of points into intelligence, yet the protagonists are still the exact same dumbos as they were at the start! Their vocabularies don't improve, they remain romantically dense, they continue to take reckless risks without proper planning, they don't develop any more cynical worldviews, they don't grow bored with events always unfolding exactly as predicted, they don't properly investigate any mysteries with advanced statistical analysis or anything! There is no sign of improved intelligence anywhere!

  &#x200B;

  So yeah, I'm looking for anything that breaks the pattern and shows an actual intelligence gap between high and low levels.

    The Worm fanfic [A Bad Name](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/) does this with its main protagonist, who starts out pretty damn stupid, but then gets a Gamer style power and decides to get his life together once he gets out of the 'too stupid to realize he should do something about his low Int/Wis/Luck' trap.

    [Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lilijoy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy) is a good example of characters' intelligence increasing with each level of 'cultivation'.

    The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world. An AI overlord set limits on what types of technology humans are allowed to use. The remainder of human civilization is heavily focused on using nanomachines to improve their minds and bodies and to interface with the elaborate virtual reality world that the AI maintains.

    The main character starts as a barely sentient young girl until an accident kickstarts the nanomachines in her head. From then on, her mind develops rapidly throughout her struggle to escape those who want to control her. In my opinion this story is great for this sub because both the protagonist and her enemies are portrayed as realistically intelligent, and the progression of that intellect is fascinating to see.

      I've been enjoying this so far. The setting is interesting, though for what I've read so far (partway through book 2) they haven't directly interacted much with it (>!such as the Corp!<) beyond it being described in the story.  
      Though, I don't particularly care for the narrative and in-universe obsession with cycles/yin-yang/'paradoxes', and most of that fell kinda flat for me.

        >Though, I don't particularly care for the narrative and in-universe obsession with cycles/yin-yang/'paradoxes', and most of that fell kinda flat for me.

        I agree, those parts struck me as pseudo-profundity, but I took it as a sign of the characters' (at the time) still limited intelligence. For example, at one point the MC muses on zen-like paradox stuff and feels extremely proud of her progress, but she still couldn't tell the difference between 'things that sound profound' and 'things that are actually important'. Later on she realizes that the zen-styled programming of the nanite cultivation is just an affectation of their programmer and is ultimately meaningless.

        Each chapter is portrayed from the limited understanding of the characters, and some of them are more likely to view the world through a warping lens of spirituality. Some characters claim to have a better understanding of the Overlord AI's ultimate goal (part of which is the 'cycles/paradoxes' you allude to), but no character thus far is able to understand or convey the true breadth of the AI's plan, just like how no character can give the MC a full understanding of the "rules" the AI put forth for the world.

  [Magical Girl Gunslinger](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48402/magical-girl-gunslinger) has your typical dark-themed magical girl story with a LitRPG mechanic.

  Only thing is that the story is *really* good. The writer nails down the "typical plot" with very solid writing and very good character arcs. Can't go too deep into detail but I generally like how the forces that chooses who becomes a "Magical Girls" are actively trying to find people that you actually want to have these powers. Brave, good-natured, and generally nice people. But these people still have to deal with the realities of being in a constant war with aliens. The writer creates a very realistic behaviors on how good-natured people deal with the horrors of violence and death.

  All in all, I'm also recommending it because it made me tear up in 22 chapters which is something I don't normally do. So anything that gets me to that level of emotion is a instant rec for me.

  [Virtuous Sons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia) is back and I consider it one of the best things on royal road. It was on hiatus for a bit, but it's been updating again.

  The idea here is that Greek Philosopher's cultivate virtue through philosophy and debate, but there's more to cultivation than that. We follow two young cultivators who form the emotional core of the story as they seek their own desires unraveling mysteries of the world and cultivation. The core friendship is the bedrock of the story and you get two very different takes on the same story as it progresses with alternating points of view. We get real historic figures like Caesar, Alexander the Great, Archimedes exist in the history of the world as cultivators and there are a lot of references to greek mythology.

  The writing is excellent, with a heavy focus on show don't tell, the pacing is never a problem as we jump from scene to scene instead of spending time from getting from scene to scene. The way cultivation works follows some obvious rules, but not everything is as straightforward as my level is higher than yours which means you don't get Deus Ex Cultivation Breakthrough's as the climax. There are a lot of mysteries to unravel and the localisation of cultivation exists outside Greece - Romans have a different form of cultivation that was brought from it's culture. If this was set in the US, the cultivators would be businessmen and making money would be the same as cultivating virtue. It's just a fantastic read and absolutely elevates the xianxia genre by stripping the concept to it's fundamentals and building anew to create a truly unique story.

  Something I’ve recently found is [To the Far Shore](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50836/to-the-far-shore). 

  It’s described as post apocalyptic Oregon Trail, but it’s more post-post-post-post (you get the idea) apocalypse. Kind of like Worlds Without Number’s setting, if any of you are familiar with that TTRPG. I don’t know if it’s rational, as I’m not very far in it, but Mazelton, our MC is pretty consistent to his characterization as it’s described. I think the part that most would enjoy is the worldbuilding which I’m failing to come up with good examples for. 


  Again I’m not sure if it qualifies as rational as I’m not very far along, but it’s definitely worth your read in my opinion.

  So I watched *Avatar* (the James Cameron movie) because they did a re-release in the leadup to the sequel, and I still can't get over how completely uninterested this movie is in being anything other than a special effects demo reel. But I'm not here to shit on a movie that's over a decade old, I'm here to ask if there's anything that does this movie but *not* dumb.

  Because there are actually a couple of interesting worldbuilding crumbs here. Why are the Na'vi the only four-limbed creatures on a planet full of hexapod animals? Why do the Na'vi have a ritual for moving someone's "soul" from one body to another that works on humans? What the fuck does Unobtanium do other than "sell for $20 million", and why is it worth going to a planet of space elves that want to murder you to get it?

  So is there anything that will give me some version of "what if *Avatar*, but the answers to any of those questions are anything other than 'James Cameron needed it for the plot'"? Because I see the potential for a really interesting science fiction story there.
  ```

  - u/surt2:
    ```
    While the basic plotline of *Avatar* is pretty uninteresting, a lot of the background worldbuilding is really well done. Notably, the interstellar vessel at the start of the movie, the ISV Venturestar, is a very plausible design, [as detailed here](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/slowerlight3.php#avatar), and though I'm not personally knowledgable in the area, my understanding is that the [Na'vi language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%CA%BCvi_language) is seen as one of the best fictional conlangs.

    As for the unobtanium, it's again, pretty well thought out. Unobtabium is supposed to be a room-temperature superconductor, though it's unclear whether it's an alloy, a new element (presumably on the island of stability), a different phase of an existing element (something like metallic hydrogen), or something else entirely. Regardless, this explains the floating islands as well. Pandora is supposed to be a super-earth sized moon orbiting a gas giant, which means that it's going to have pretty strong, volatile magnetic fields. In places where these fields intersect with veins of unobtanium, the unobtanium is going to get [flux pinned](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_pinning), and if the magnetic field shifts in the right way, lifted into the air. These formations certainly wouldn't be very stable, but they are at least possible. 

    The abundance of unobtabium also means that it's incorporated into the native biology, allowing plants to quickly transmit signals across the entire planet through the local equivalent of [mycorrhizal networks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network). Once that planetwide network existed, it would have been immensely advantageous for any animals to be able to tap into it, which is where you get the weird hair-tentacle-usb things. As for why it can transfer a *human* consciousness into a Pandoran animal, that's harder to explain. Maybe the Pandoran mycorrhizal network was able to piggyback off of the preexisting cybernetic connections that the humans used to connect to their Avatars?

    Looking back on this post, I realize it looks like I'm defending the movie pretty ardently, and I want to make it clear that I'm not. *Avatar*, as a whole, is a pretty mediocre movie in my opinion. It's just that, as you pointed out, there are some *really* interesting worldbuilding seeds in the background. Over the years, I've come across various behind-the-scenes material which show elements of the setting that were developed by really smart people, and, on their own, could support interesting, rational stories. As they're used in *Avatar*, however, they're just throwaway pieces of technobabble used to half-justify the fantastical elements of a derivative, soft sci-fi Hollywood blockbuster.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Man, the most depressing part about *Avatar* behind the scenes worldbuilding lore is that they apparently came up with a ton of unique tribal music for the natives that was never used. They apparently had all sorts of music experts sample strange instruments and indigenous musical traditions worldwide to come up with some truly unique and alien sounds, but in the end they scraped it all for a much more generic soundtrack so people wouldn't be weirded out.

      While I do respect the filmmakers' work in providing background, they also called the important substance "Unobtainium", which is only a step above the calling the thing your characters are fighting over "The MacGuffin"; Ultimately it's an excuse for why Humans and 
      Na'vi are fighting at all.
      ```

      - u/lo4952:

        I fucking loved that they called it Unobtanium. Like, we all know it's just a background justification, and so the they spend exactly as much time and effort on it as it deserves, and then move on to cool alien landscapes and giant flying dino-monsters. It's a great conservation of the narrative, not wasting time on something that would have never mattered to begin with.

          On the one hand, I agree that the substance really doesn't matter, but on the other hand, the name "unobtanium" was kind of jarring and reminds you that you are watching a movie. It feels like 30 minutes brainstorming some pseudo-scientific sounding name would have been worth it.

    I still remember (from watching once, a decade ago) how this far-future society went to enormous expense to import or build onsite this mass of ineffectual military hardware to half-protect their precious personnel from the world full of extremely homicidal wildlife.

Did nobody study the actual defensive needs of their colonial expeditionary force or what?

    Avatar is basically Dances with Wolves, which was a popular movie in the 80s. It set up the outsider savior (fine, white savior) plotline that has fueled a lot of movies and TV show throwaway plots. ("They're going to shut down our community center!") So if you liked the bones of the plot, go watch Dances with Wolves. If you're interested in the sci-fi trappings, then perhaps Dune (the books, I guess) might be a reasonable choice, as the nature of the unobtanium (spice) in the world goes pretty deep, and the local native scientificomagic rituals also feature prominently.

    Edit: Also Last Samurai is a decent film with the general plot outline.

      ```
      All of the ones I mentioned are set in space. *The Martian*, as the name suggests, takes place on Mars, specifically on the 3rd crewed mission. *Artemis* takes place in a larger scale lunar colony. Giving too much info on *Project Hail Mary* would be a bit of a spoiler, but suffice it to say that it takes place in a relatively small (think Skylab-sized) spacecraft. *Eyes Turned Skywards* describes a world in which NASA continued using Apollo-derived hardware, rather than investing in the space shuttle, leading to, among othet things, a sustained human presence on the moon. *Boldly Going* describes a world in which NASA built an incredibly large and abitious space station in the 80's.

      I would also reccomend Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy (the individual books are titled Red, Green, and Blue Mars respectively), which starts with a large mission sending 100 people on a one-way trip to colonize Mars, and follows the planet's development for over 100 years until it becomes a post-scarcity space utopia.

        *Lighting Up the Dark* and *Obito-sensei* are really compelling AUs framed with the main plot. 
        I'd say they count.

        Which leaves, of course, *The Waves Arisen*, which was my first introduction to Naruto fanfiction. And really to the fandom as a whole. It's odd, and sets up its own puzzle for success, but is such a good batshit crazy reimagining of the setting that I want to give it credit.

  "Gay Communist Utopia Wish Fulfilment, If You're Into It", wrote my first one-star reviewer.

  Quill & Still is a slow-paced slice of life story about civics, Gods, village life, and alchemy. (The Quill part will come in eventually. It hasn't yet.) It features a burned-out 39-year-old process biochemist who runs into Artemis in the forest and winds up getting a ride to another world.

  It is technically a litRPG, but it's very much not focused on that aspect or on the progression aspect.

  It is not, in fact, communist (syndicalist capitalism with an emphasis on resilience and the long view? maybe). But it is very queer (not just gay) and compared to our world it's firmly utopian.

      Doesn't sound that unlikely, I've read some Jesuit texts on how the natives lived and how their societies worked and accounts and they were very kind. They saw it as abhorrent that the white men would let people starve or be homeless and not help them.

        As the comment above you pointed out (sort of tangentially), it depends on scale. At much above Dunbar's number, this simply breaks down.

        While I don't always agree with him, I very much like this Nassim Taleb quote:

        >With my family, I’m a communist. With my close friends, I’m a socialist. At the state level of politics, I’m a Democrat. At higher levels, I’m a Republican, and at the federal levels, I’m a Libertarian.

        It doesn't really work if you think about what the real politics are of some of these groups, but I think it accurately conveys the realities of cooperation with increasingly large groups of people. 

        The point is, it's very easy to be caring and selfless with small, isolated groups of people. It gets increasingly difficult to do so without being taken advantage of as the number of individuals and interconnectedness grows larger.

        I haven't read the story being discussed here, but if the community is very small, then it's probably perfectly realistic. If it's large, then yeah, there better be some _reason_ that it's able to operate in the way described when we consistently see failures to do so in the real world.

      Kelly's only in her forties! ^_^

      But... yeah. I think a lot of people have been having that reaction. (Some of those people get very angry at me in the RR comments.) It... says something a bit terrible, that we struggle so much to accept the idea of a community that cares.

        Because unbounded selflessness is incredibly vulnerable to malignant actors, and it only takes a few to destroy or exploit the hell out of such a society or force them to develop norms against it (e.g. reputation or honor based systems, or capitalism, or religion, etc.).

        Think of those as an immune system against cancer/defectors. A society that had no defense against such would naturally be weird or unrealistic (baring say, AI overlords or gods a la Culture). We all have an instinct on how things work socially based on this system.

    I'll second the recommendation, despite dropping the story ("slow-paced slice of life" is *very* accurate).  

    It reminds me of [Level 3 Intelligent Characters](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent), but it's a Level 3 Utopian Society instead.  For example the "habit of grace" (ch. 7) is something you can do *right now* to improve your life and society as a whole.

    Will check it out solely based on this & the amazing call out of the review 😂🤷🏼‍♂️. The uplift bug bit me recently so I’m doubly interested in utopia’s.

      I have genuinely considered using that review title as a logline. I got probably ~20 readers by posting a screenshot of that review on a dozen different web serial Discords, and by the time the review got deleted it was at about 2 upvotes / 73 downvotes.

      The best part: the reviewer edited in a line at the top of the review saying "Why all the downvotes? What facts did I get wrong?" or something along those lines.

        Getting brigade downvoted for sharing your honest subjective opinion on a story must be quite confusing and unpleasant, I'd imagine.

          I've nearly given up on the fight to preserve internet voting as "useful contributions to conversation" as opposed to "think I like/dislike". Especially in larger internet communities, the norm is nearly impossible to preserve. Anonymous voting makes it too easy to angry-vote (downvoting things you don't like seems like a bigger problem than upvoting things you do like to me)

          As a response to /u/Ratvar who has baselessly accused me and then blocked me to prevent me from responding: its a sad day if trans-desisting and being a Georgist is now considered a transphobic alt-right position. 

          Dig through my comment history all you want, I have nothing to hide. 

          For the record I have not read the review in question, but clearly it's an accurate enough review if the author was using it to promote the story!
