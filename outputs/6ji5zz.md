  Here's a question: do you plan on explaining how the weapons are built and how they work? 

  They obviously wouldn't be possible to construct in a real world, bar some hypothetical technology from the far future. Both here and in canon, Ruby says that she created her weapon herself, and apparently so did everyone at Signal. Which is breaking my mind every time I read a RWBY fanfiction.

  I read first two chapters of your fic and skimmed the rest, but I don't see anything like that. It seems like you are taking the same approach as DaystarEld in Pokemon: Origin of Species, where you are taking the tech for granted and work your way up from there. Which is reasonable considering how broken RWBY world is, but still. Actual mechanics of it might be interesting to read.

  Maybe something like limited Tinker powers from Worm, or maybe advanced 3D printers with a selection of already designed weapon parts that can be used like Legos?
