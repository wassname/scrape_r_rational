  Fascinating tale, would love to read others of its liking (or continuation if there will be, although it reads like a one-off)

  Edit: never heard of Baccano before, didn't even realize it was based off that

    It is. Though this isn't really my "thing", I'd been looking for a short one-off concept, as a way of giving a little back. 

    Unfortunately for anyone curious, there is at present no legal way to stream/view "Baccano!" in the United States.

      Hi, /r/Baccano mod here. Klein is right; there's no legal way to _stream_ Baccano!...but there _is_ for at least viewing it: if you have Netflix and live in the USA, you can still [rent the DVDs](https://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Baccano/70204951) via their rental service. Also never hurts to check one's local libraries.

      Anyway... I found this post since I track the 'baccano' keyword on Reddit, sorry to intrude. I also write Baccano! fanfiction (I share both on AO3 and FF, though AO3 is where the fandom is more active and you're more likely to receive comments) so I'll try to leave a review soon. 

      *Also, a fair bit of the best/A-tier Baccano! fanfiction is _only_ on AO3, never been published to FFN. AO3's formatting is superior too, if you're looking for something less limiting. 

      (From a quick cursory glance-over, it sounds like this is entirely based on the anime with no knowledge of the light novels? Obviously a lot of it is a direct blow-by-blow of episode 7, quoted directly in many instances, but also: he's referring to the other alchemists – like Elmer and Fermet – as if he barely knows them, which doesn't make sense. Plus, the thing about his wife and child...he has a living descendant in 2001. And also "which is how I ended up on the AA in the first place..." That's simply not true.)

      (Obviously it's fine if you've never read the light novels ~~you should though, they're great~~, I'm just verifying that's the case).

        You are welcome to cross-post it, if you think they would enjoy it. As for AO3, FF had the shortest wait time. It was about getting it up.

        But you are right, it's just the show plus whatever I could glean from the wiki. When details are unclear, you have to make them up, as well as changing a few things to match the conceit of the rational genre.

        I did assume that his living descendant was born after 1711. Is that not the case? (Not saying their names was a conceit both for the brevity of the format, and as a deliberate characterization choice)

        Always nice to have an "expert" chime in!
