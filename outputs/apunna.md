## What Piece of Rational Fiction can I submit to my book club?

### Post:

I'm part of a book club at my local nerd social club. (we get together and play MtG, DnD or WoD RPGs I run an anime night Tuesdays, there's a board game night saturdays, that's the sort of audience we're talking about) Each month after discussing the last book we pull a name from a hat and they choose the next book.

&#x200B;

I'm very fond of rational fiction and have been itching to discuss one as part of the club so last month I submitted Blindsight. I had just read it based on it's inclusion in [this anthology of rational fiction](http://ratficonline.website/)and it's published so other members of my group can get a physical or audiobook copy.

&#x200B;

Now, their reception of this story wasn't great but that's not really an issue we've read through some much more hated books. However, what really struck me was how little I had really noticed the shortcomings of this story as rational fiction. People raised questions about the opaque motivation of the characters and the scientific accuracy of the protagonist's behavior. (the clinical evidence has never suggested having a lobe removed would lead to the seemingly autism-spectrum behavior of the protag) They pointed out how much of the science seemed jammed in sideways instead of a natural part of the story, and by the end I felt my opinion shift on Blindsight and while it had some interesting philosophy in there I don't consider it a very good example of rational fiction to have presented to them.

&#x200B;

So basically I think I can do better. What would you recommend I suggest next time my name gets pulled from the hat? It must be of a reasonable length. Past books have had audiobooks of 12-20 hours at most so most of the better ratfics I've read could be submitted only as the first portion. I would also need to overcome the obstacle of printed copies and audio versions for those who prefer those formats. (though not strictly requirements I would feel slightly rude submitting a book that did not have a printed version and I would inconvenience the 3 most skeptical readers in the club by submitting a book with no audio version so while tricky I'd also like to avoid that)

&#x200B;

Because of these requirements I've considered HPMoR, and handing out self-printed copies of the first several chapters (I prepared a full printed version for a friend of mine a few years ago). For the audiobook readers I could point them to the podcast. The issue though is that I'm finding it difficult to find a reasonable section of the first part of the story that has some point to reading only that part. I'm also not at all convinced it's the best example of rational fiction I could offer.

&#x200B;

I really want to submit Worth the Candle more than anything. Maybe it's just because I've read it the most recently but I think it's the most compelling and well written ratfic I could suggest and the RPG style setting fits really well with my audience.  However, it would be troublesome to provide a print copy and as far as I know an audiobook isn't even on the horizon (yet).

&#x200B;

So considering all these things what does /r/rational think would be the best choice of ratfic I can suggest?

  Imo metropolitan man is the quintessential rational fic. It is true to the cannon world while reimagining the consequences of characters acting rationally.  It's a nearly perfect short story.
  ```

  - u/chlorinecrown:
    ```
    Metropolitan Man would be about 200 pages printed. I think monsters like Worm or WtC have skewed our definition of "short story"
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      Heh, yeah maybe. Webfiction in general I think. Hpmor is way longer than a typical book.
      ```

  Stuff by Ted Chiang tends to be a good introduction. Maybe Exhalation? Short story, still interesting.
  ```

  - u/LaughingMan42:
    ```
    [This](https://www.amazon.com/Exhalation-Stories-Ted-Chiang-ebook/dp/B07GD46PQZ)? a collection of short stories to be released this May?

      Oh cool, second collection! Didn't know that was coming out.

      No though, that collection is just named for one of the stories in it, "Exhalation." Legit copy here: http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/

      His first collection was "Stories of Your Life And Others":

  As someone that has never read it, this sounds like a bizarre nitpick. Like complaining that hpmor has magic in it. Surely thats a conceit of the setting? Please tell me Im wrong.
  ```

  - u/HarmlessHealer:
    ```
    HPMOR is fantasy, whereas Blindsight is supposedly hard scifi. Complaining about scientific accuracy is *exactly* the sort of nitpick I would expect from the hard scifi audience.

  You can try reading some of the short stories by Scott Alexander:

  [Ars Longa, Vita Brevis](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/09/ars-longa-vita-brevis/)

  [â€¦And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/)

  Or maybe try the second half of [Chapter 39](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/39/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality) of HPMOR. It a discussion between Harry and Dumbledore about death and immortality. It's one of my favorite parts in the book; it can be read as a standalone and it doesn't spoil anything in the story though you do need to have read the canon books.

  Surprised *The Martian* hasn't been recommended, since it's pretty commonly considered to be a very mainstream but rational story. It's also an easy read, which I value personally.

  If violent sex stuff is OK, *The Metamorphisis of Prime Intellect* is interesting, and about AI safety (but very much a fantasy). But there's no audiobook, though there's a paperback as well as kindle. 

  It depends on your crowd though: it seems you're getting a lot of recommendations for fanfic. Do you think fanfic would go down well with your crowd? Based on the demographic, it seems... probably?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Can't speak to other stuff, but Metropolitan Man is usually easy to recommend to people who don't like fanfiction, since it's not a huge jump to say that pretty much all Superman stories are already fanfiction. Metropolitan Man is just slightly less official than the comics and movies.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    *The Metamorphisis of Prime Intellect* was incredibly gripping. Thank you for the recommendation.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Glad you enjoyed it! The *Passages in the Void* series by the same author is also extremely good (but very different).
      ```

- u/t3tsubo:
  ```
  Metropolitan Man or alexanderwales' other shorter stories are all good.
  ```

  - u/LaughingMan42:
    ```
    I think Metropolitan Man could be a good choice. There's even an audio version in the HPMoR Podcast.
    ```

    - u/TheStevenZubinator:
      ```
      The same podcast that did the audiobook for MoR also did Metropolitan Man. :)

  Definitely don't do WTC or HPMOR.

  Have you read A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court? I think it qualifies as a member of the genre.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Seconded, /u/laughingman42. Both of them rely heavily on playing the genre tropes.

    Connecticut Yankee by Mark Twain and The Mysterious Island (by Jules Verne) are perfect examples of the genre from classic literature
    ```

  - u/LaughingMan42:
    ```
    I have not read that one. I'll pick it up and see if I want to consider throwing it in.
    ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    How well does it hold up to today's standards of plot hole avoidance?
    ```

    - u/hyphenomicon:
      ```
      The ending makes the earlier parts of the book a giant plot hole. It severely breaks tone. However, it's also kind of neat IMO on a thematic level. It's like an irrational rejoinder to overconfidence in rationality, sort of.

      Everything before that is fine in terms of plot holes. Its other big limitation is that the main character is too competent to be entirely interesting as a person, so the main joy is watching what he does, not observing who he is.

  Worth the Candle is really long, and incomplete...

  My book club is about to do Three Worlds Collide, which is really short, and I expect will provoke a lot of discussion.
  ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    >Three Worlds Collide,

    Oof, that's certainly a bold choice.
    ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    True story: I gave my partner "Three Worlds Collide" to read as "homework" before our first date so we'd have something to discuss. That was more than six years ago.
    ```

    - u/mcgruntman:
      ```
      Bold!
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        Probably less bold when his profile described him as a rationalist... I will have to see if I can get screenshots of the c9nvo

        EDIT: nope, even though I have stuff in my OKC inbox from way earlier, it seems to have been lost to the ages.

  The first eight arcs of Worm could work. It comes out to a reasonable length and works pretty well as a self-contained book, and has an audiobook. Maybe not the sort of rationalist book you're looking for, but it's probably the rational-adjacent book with the most popular appeal.
  ```

  - u/LaughingMan42:
    ```
    I have read worm but it's not quite the introduction to ratfic I'm going for. The audiobook is also pretty poor quality, though I admit I'm going to be hard pressed to find any really quintessential ratfic with an solid audiobook.
    ```

- u/Fresh_C:

  Worth The Candle would get my vote if it wasn't for the desire to have an audiobook version. Also it's unfinished, so I don't know if that would be an issue for your group or not (though I'm assuming it wouldn't be since you yourself brought it up).

  If you require an audiobook to exist of it, then you could read Worm. ([Audiobook project here]( http://audioworm.rein-online.org/)). Though if you haven't read it, it's not rationalist fiction so much as just a rational setting where almost nothing feels contrived or out of place. The main characters are for the most part just regular smart people, not uber-rationalists. They're still very clever though, and even when you don't agree with their decisions you never feel like they're holding the idiot ball.
  ```

  - u/LaughingMan42:
    ```
    I've read Worm and have no intention to inflict that on my group :p 

    More seriously the audiobook project is very hard to understand sometimes and I don't think it's good enough to offer up as a real audiobook for the story. I also think Worm is best around the middle, and, again, it's not the first choice for an example of rational fiction. I might bring it up at some point down the line though.

  ["The Cambist and Lord Iron" by Daniel Abraham](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/) is about solving malicious riddles with the power of understanding real-world economics. It's rationalist-adjacent, short, funny, and quite good

  ["Wave Amplitude" by Van Peer](https://vanpeerblog.wordpress.com/wave-amplitude/) is about economics too, but more macroscopic.

  Unsong? It's less than 100k words total, I think. OTOH, it's basically a-rational fiction.
  ```

  - u/LunarTulip:
    ```
    Unsong is a lot less short than you think it is. About 235k words, according to the counter I just ran it through.
    ```

  - u/TrebarTilonai:
    ```
    Unsong is definitely a niche read. I would never recommend it to a group, but it's a FANTASTIC piece of literature for certain individuals. It's very well-written and gets very deep in terms of being able to piece together what's going on. Lots and lots and lots of references to Jewish Kaballah and computer programming, so if you like both of those topics you will probably enjoy the story itself. If one or both of those topics goes unappreciated, the story will probably get a "meh".
    ```

    - u/I_Probably_Think:
      ```
      It might also get a "Meh. Meh meh meh meh meh meh meh."
      ```

      - u/TrebarTilonai:
        ```
        Nice
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I didn't care about the programming, and while Kabbalah was interesting it wasn't what caught my attention; I cared more about the humor and philosophy, and those are much more universal things. It's more niche than most rational fics, but maybe less niche than it might seem.
      ```

  - u/LaughingMan42:
    ```
    I really enjoyed Unsong but it's not quite what I want to offer up to my book club.
    ```

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  Once you decide on a book and your book club is through with it, I'd be curious as to what their conclusions end up being.
  ```

  - u/LaughingMan42:
    ```
    I'll be sure to report back then. We meet up once a month, and there's about a dozen other people so it would be a few months before my name gets pulled again.
    ```

- u/erwgv3g34:
  ```
  Book 1 of _Methods_, [_Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres and the Methods of Rationality_](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rjl20/hpmor/0c10d2e8b6bd68e88fd2fc6e6b233140917e7314/out/hpmor-1.pdf) is made up of chapters 1-21 (with the non-canonical chapter 11 optionally excluded). It is not quite as self-contained as _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_, but it at least reaches an emotional stopping point (Book 1 ends with a wistful scene of Harry writing a letter home after his eventful first week at Hogwarts). If your group likes it, you can add Book 2, [_Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres and the Professor's Games_](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rjl20/hpmor/0c10d2e8b6bd68e88fd2fc6e6b233140917e7314/out/hpmor-2.pdf), next month, and so on until you do all six.

  Alternatively, you could try Book I of _Worth the Candle_ (chapters 1-14, covering the "tutorial"). As you mention, it doesn't have an audiobook version, but TTS programs have gotten really good at making decent audiobooks on demand, and it would be a great fit for a tabletop RPG group. Again, if your group likes it, can add the other books later.

  My recommendation: Do all of _Methods_ first, to give _Worth the Candle_ as much time to progress as possible.

  RE: The print book readers, are they also opposed to reading on an e-ink reader? Because epub, mobi, and PDF versions of both works exist.
