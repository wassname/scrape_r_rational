## [Challenge Companion] Spooky

### Post:

**tl:dr; this is the companion thread for [the biweekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9t68lt/biweekly_challenge_spooky/), post ideas, recommendations, or general thoughts below.**

There's an interesting distinction to be made between "spooky" and "scary", namely that "spooky" encompasses a lot of things that borrow the iconography of "scary". At least some of this is done to make scary things palatable to small children, who frighten easily; it would be hard to sell Halloween paraphernalia like cookies, candy, costumes, etc. if you're frightening away your primary consumer.

(Now that I think about it, this prompt also has a bit of overlap with ["Monster Mash"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/67zt5y/biweekly_challenge_monster_mash/) from a year and a half ago.)
