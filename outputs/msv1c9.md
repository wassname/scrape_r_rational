## The Boros Bachelor - A D&D Ravnica webnovel

### Post:

Hello! Someone suggested your community would be a good place for the webnovel my husband and are are writing on Royal Road. While it is based on a D&D campaign set in the Magic: the Gathering plane Ravnica, the story does follow rationality. Please offer feedback if you have any! 

Our goal is to produce a realistic and rational story set in a fictional world. The story is a vehicle for addressing many kinds of social issues through the more comfortable lenses of fiction. New chapters twice weekly!

  Would it happen to/will it deal with the other guilds? It’s a neat setting that I haven’t read any other stories in.

  Also Batman -> Rocman is pretty funny.

    Yes, all ten guilds are featured in various interactions throughout! Ravnica is such a diverse setting, so many groups and people with unique motivations. 

    Haha, thanks, glad you like it!
