  The discussion toward the end (where both hosts talked about appreciating film more for its craft than the rationality of its plot) reminded me of a previous discussion on this subreddit about [when the needs of the medium outweigh the needs of the rational](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ai2xuc/when_the_needs_of_the_medium_outweigh_the_needs/).

  An example of this can be see in *Murder, She Wrote*, where Cabot Cove, despite being a small town with a population of only a few thousand people, somehow has enough murders for Angela Lansbury to solve a new murder mystery every week -- and since the series ran for over 200 episodes, the murder rate per capita is by far the highest in the world.  The worldbuilding implications of this are never discussed, for reasons that should be fairly obvious.  (Similarly, there are lots of cartoon/comic characters who have stayed the same age for decades, without ever attempting to have some in-world explanation for why this is the case.)

  There's a certain amount of "genre-savvy" that media tends to expect from its viewers. On a certain level, the audience understands that when there's yet another murder in Cabot Cove, this has more to do with the fact that we're watching a procedural crime show, rather than any of the socioeconomic factors we'd normally associate with violent crime.  Likewise, [there's a twist in a scene near the end of Captain America Winter Soldier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JlySl0Z6cQ) that "works" mainly because >!we know this is a spy thriller movie, and characters having perfect disguises that allow them to infiltrate organizations is just the kind of thing that happens in spy movies.  The movie doesn't really need to go to great lengths to establish that this disguise technology exists or how it works because movies like Mission Impossible already exist in the cultural consciousness.!<  Ditto for anything that invokes "zombies" or "vampires": we already take it for granted that vampires  drink blood (and might have a certain susceptibility to holy water and crucifixes) without having to be given a rational explanation for why this is the case.  (Some vampire stories will give us some backstory or mythos about Cain and Abel or whatever to explain why things are the way they are, but plenty are willing to just skip to the part where our heroes attempt to dispatch a vampire using one of the routinely-accepted methods.)

  On a more general level, "laws of scriptwriting" are generally more salient than laws of physics.  Solving conflicts in a way that meshes with the themes of the story being told often leaves us more satisfied than if every conflict is resolved simply by having the characters think their way to a solution.  It's cool that in [at the end of  Guardians of the Galaxy vol 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQcFJ2KYjmU), the Guardians win against the bad guy by >!standing next to each other hand holding hands, because what more thematically-appropriate way to end a story about the power of friendship?!<   The fact that this "works" is established not through some carefully-constructed worldbuilding, but through the visual language of cinema (the scene does a great job of showing that >!the power of the stone, while too much for Starlord to handle alone, can be spread between multiple people who are willing to join hands!<) and the fact that, on a certain subconscious level, everything leading up to this moment in the film has primed us to expect a climax where the Guardians >!defeat the bad guy by standing together as one!<, and when that happens in the most literal way possible, it just feels *right*.

    And, even when Jessica Fletcher travels away from Cabot Cove, the murders seem to follow her.

    My personal headcanon is that >!she's some kind of underworld cleaner, who protects her "friends" by coercing other potential suspects into confessing to the crimes her associates have committed.!<

    That said, I don't disagree with the theory of the post in general; there's certain sacrifices to realism that you can make in the name of dramatization, like "sound in space" or "helmets that illuminate a pilot's face" or Iron Man being able to slam into the ground in a superhero pose at terminal velocity, with his suit somehow protecting him from it.

    At the same time, I think that you have to use unrealistic tropes carefully, even if they're common within a genre, because they can undermine what you're trying to do.  If your character is able to walk off being shot, and 99.9% of the bullets aimed at them aren't hitting the character anyway, then, when you try to add tension by putting your character under fire, you don't get the same sense of tension that you would in a story where the good guys can actually get hit and killed by bullets.

      Heh, conservation of momentum has never been a thing in superhero universes, and I think there's been some handwaving about Iron Man's suit using reactionless thrusters (which would presumably have a secondary use of letting him not actually be subject to the effects of sudden acceleration...)

      *Monk* at least set its stories in a city with a large enough population to actually have a lot of murders, although he can't seem to travel anywhere without finding a murder there, too. Sharona spends an episode saying he must be jinxed, but at the end decides it's the other way around: fate brings him places where murders are going to happen so they won't go unsolved.

      Even Agatha Christie got asked how there could be so many murders in the unnamed small town Miss Marple lived in, and she answered something along the lines of "Don't underestimate how much evil can be lurking in small towns."

        one thing that bugged about later seasons of *Monk* was that it seemed like almost every episode was of the form "Monk is doing something in his personal life and happens to stumble across a murder" rather than just starting out with the police investigation of a murder.

    Apropos the latest Chili chapters, I'm inclined to think of it as a case of "simple minds in a complex world", or to twist your phrase - "the needs of the *average* outweigh the needs of the rational." 

    According to one view, stories "[allow people to see patterns where there is chaos, meaning where there is randomness](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/the-psychological-comforts-of-storytelling/381964/)." As such, you could say storytelling is the subjective signalling of order from chaos; it follows that the simpler the signal, the more likely it will reach its target. So irrationality would just be a side effect of toning down the signal to more effectively penetrate the collection of heuristics that people are comprised of. Yet no two signals penetrate the same way. So counterintuitively, for the detail-oriented audience with many running heuristics, the signal turns into a lock and key metaphor: it needs to preemptively account for all the filters that scrutinize or distort the signal. The hard part then is optimally tuning the signal so it feels *right* to the maximum amount of people (by definition, the middle of the bell curve). Thus some people will always be left out, victims of standard deviation.

  [Rational Fiction as Narrative Focus](http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2020/05/rational-fiction-as-narrative-focus.html) is a blog post that I mentioned in the podcast and hurriedly finished today, as I'd sort of forgotten about it. Hopefully it's still illuminating (we talk about some of the things that it contains within it)

  I just want to say that I disagree that cinemasins has gotten worse.

  [They were never any good to begin with.](https://youtu.be/BA9LwE20YK8)

  Edit:    
  I find the Rational gerne is ultimately about maintaining stakes.  
  It's about making sure the object level is taken care of, so that the stakes can be maintained.   

  The fact that a reader wont be punished for thinking about details and what would otherwise be handwaving. Means that they never leave the secondary world of the fiction, and as such their experience is maintained.  

  Playing "fair" with everything in the story, means that the stakes will never suffer from a reader noticing contraindications. As the promise of the medium means that if someone notices something like that, they can simply wait for the story to resolve.


  A contrasting example would be The Dark Knight Rises.   
  The movie goes to lengths to isolate Gotham from the rest of the world, the take everything from Batman, and then abducts him and places him on the other side of the world in the middle of nowhere.

  After Bruce gets out of the pit, the movie considers the challenge overcome, and if you are invested in the rest of what the movie has set up, then you will be punished for caring.

  Apologies for the click-bait title :) Hope everyone's staying safe!
