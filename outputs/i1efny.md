 Either read this chapter or play *Psychonauts* again.

(Doing both would be nice)

  Hey there, started reading this and got to the end of book one. Started picking up on the hints but desperately didn't want them to be true.

  I'd really like to keep reading, but I'm just completely sickened by the concepts involved. I'm fully asking if anyone would mind spoiling the second book for me, to see if I could stomach still reading it.

    Hi, the author here. I apologize if any of my writing upset you, but I am flattered you finished book one.

     \>! !< >! So, author here. Breakdown of the second book. The kids slowly realise just how horrible the Institute is over the course of the volume, and eventually come to rebel after Lawrence secretly murders a student for having powers he doesn't approve of, which drives Zywie away, and leads to her reporting Lawrence to Tim Valour. The kids straight up take over the school, but some are killed during a government raid, with the rest being scattered to the winds. The third book covers them figuring out what to do, and eventually building a new community. Just noting, we do actually see a depiction of a "Married Day". It's not explicit, but I would consider it disturbing. If you want to skip it, it's chapter Twenty-Four. !<

      Oh dang, thanks for the reply.

      I read some more, had to skip the marriage day chapter... Aaaaand the nazi one. Mostly in it to see Lawrence get his comeuppance now.

      Thanks for a gripping story, even if I can't stomach all of it. Too much actual holocaust and rape happening right now for me to be comfortable reading fiction about it.

        I'm glad you have it a try. If it's any comfort, book 4 will be a lot more triumphant, and book 3 is much lighter on what I'd consider traumatizing content. It's basically an adventure story, that one. Heavy at times, but still, lighter.
