  I like that you found a believable way to work 17 and 18 into things. I watched a lot more Dragonball Z than Dragonball (and I don't think I'm alone in that) so it's nice to see some familiar faces here, especially when I wasn't expecting them to show up for a VERY long time.

  I'm... less excited about Roshi starting to play a larger role. I really hate the "haha, he's such a pervert, how funny!" thing. Seriously, the man is a pedophile and an unrepentant sexual predator, none of that is funny. I'm glad you're tamping down on that trope a great deal, but I think his presence will always be something that I at best *tolerate*. That's not your fault, the source material is to blame on that one.

    TBF I was pretty okay with Roshi's shtick in the OG Dragon Ball, insofar as, tasteless as it was, he was at least mostly the Wile E. Coyote of sexual assault - he'd just get owned every time in new ways. Still, not exactly the peak of humour, so I've toned that down as you said. In DBZ that whole side of him gets sidelined a bit (well, really, his entire character does). The latest Super episode that focused on him at Tenshinan's dojo was *the worst* though.

    Still, I'm just trying to sideline that aspect entirely, but obviously Roshi is kind of important to the Piccolo arc, and at this point he *is* one of the strongest people on Earth, so it's unavoidable that he plays a role. I'll just try to keep it tame.

    About 17 and 18, Lapis and Lazuli are indeed their canon human names (if you didn't know), and my headcanon is that in the original story when Gero kind of went completely off the deep end after the destruction of the RR he used them to experiment, possibly keeping them in some kind of stasis/preserved condition for a few years, to account for the discrepancy in their age (they don't look much older than 20-ish in canon after all).

  >Lapis looked quickly at his watch. "I'm seventeen, and she's eighteen" he said

  LOL, ominous.

  I wonder if we'll get a timeline divergence where Nappa and Vegeta get to meet them when they first come to Earth...

  *Nappa*: Oh look at these two dolls, aren't hyooman cute little things ?

  *Vegeta*: Ha, they don't even register on the scouter. Just how pathetic can they be ?

  *Lapis*: Hey sis, how about we play 'encounter of the third Newton's Law' with the aliens ?

  *Lazuli*: Sure. You rock, I roll.

    *16*: Stop fighting. I am sure we can find something we all have in common!

    *Vegeta*: Like what, rust bucket?

    *16*: How about a fun good old session of killing Goku?

    *Vegeta*: ...I don't know who this Goku is, but it sounds punchable.

  Bulma, do I need to remember you that--

  This should be:
  Bulma, do I need to remind you that--

  Similarly: "You don't need to remember me" should be: "You don't need to remind me."

  "As for your bodyguards, since they are intentioned" should be "As for your bodyguards, since they are intended"

    > but even he had picked up on how little his new schoolmate hated hearing criticism against the master.

    Should presumably be "how much [he] hated" or "how little [he] liked".

  I just want to post and say that this is probably my favorite ongoing series here on /r/rational. It's a shame it doesn't get as much attention as other stuff posted here, but it does not go unnoticed.

    Thanks! Well, can't say much about it except to spread the word I guess if you get the chance :). It's already the most popular on FF.net in the Dragon Ball section - but that's a bit cheating since the DBZ one is really where it's at, and I won't get there for a while (I do plan eventually to split it and make the later arcs a sequel, though probably without a pause or anything).

  Great chapter, I've been waiting for it so long.

  Love the Bulma/Gero interactions and I hope there will be more of them, and more of science/lab stuff.

  I have only one suggestion - the fragment with "The device was a electrostimulator......" in my opinion should be few chapters earlier. You just introduced this 'ki knob device' and Bulma just used it to show of for Gero in the same chapter. This feels a bit rushed. 

  I'd also like to see a bit more of inner workings of Red Ribbon and maybe some kind of fight between mundane soldiers and some ki warrior (Piccolo spawn or anything)

    I thought it might be a bit too rushed, unfortunately it's a balancing game between introducing detail and moving the plot at a brisk enough pace. I don't like writing massive infodump chapters - they feel boring to *me*, first and foremost, which then slows my work down.

    I guess I could have introduced it somewhere before the summer party chapter. The notion was already there before the Tenkaichi - the bench that broke Bulma's arm - it's just that now it's made portable. I feel like the technological pieces were all already there, in theory, the data gathered from the Tenkaichi was the only real missing piece, so I didn't think it needed to be justified too much.

    Never considered it really XD. I've got a job and don't care to make money off this (in fact, I think it'd make my legal position more questionable, since it's fanfiction...). But thanks for the thought :D.
