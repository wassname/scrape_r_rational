  **tl;dr:**  
  \- *Premise:* Most adventurers get quests from questgivers, because questgivers are guaranteed to provide good rewards, while killing random monsters in the countryside is not.  
  \- *Problem:* Not all questgivers are honest with adventurers who approach them. Some questgivers are being paid by third parties to send adventurers to their dooms.  
  \- *Solution:* Set up a Bard College to gather ratings for questgivers, via surveys. An adventuring bard can use [a quick Sending spell](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Sending) to request the ratings of a questgiver, and use those ratings to decide whether or not his party should accept a quest from that person.

    Great, except you used dandwiki.  Friends don't let friends use dandwiki, home of badly labeled houserules with no clear warning and no quality control. Use d20srd instead.

    Message is a little low range though. However, there are some great long distance communications options, and ways to make cell phones in 3.5e D&D.  My favorite is the spell Whispering Sand in the book Sandstorm.  I especially like using it on Shapesand, also in Sandstorm, to make an Omnitool.

  That was beautiful.

  A small problem with this: *Sending* is a 4th level *spell* for Clerics and 5th for arcane casters, meaning you actually have to be PC level 7 or 9 to be able to do those Spells--which counts as mid-level. Additionally, *Sending* cannot be learned by Bards.

  Otherwise, seems like a great idea. One might even homebrew Sending to be a lower-level Bard spell to support it.
