  hadnt this series been dropped? because the author found jesus or something?

    ```
    Indeed. An ironic twist for a rational author.
    ```

    - u/Slinkinator:
      ```
      Well, if rational authors were expected to be rational, then wouldn't we expect them to expend their effort doing something other than writing fiction for this su Reddit?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Huh. I did not expect to see the "rational = utility optimizing robot" fallacy get so many upvotes in this sub.
        ```

          ```
          What's bad about utility optimization, if said optimization is done ethically?
          ```

            Nothing at all, but idea that someone rational must be someone who uses literally all their "free time" doing things that have the \*maximum\* ethical impact isn't just unrealistic but I think a harmful norm to propagate, insofar as it make people feel guilty for being human enough to want time for things like, say, writing/reading fiction. Self care is an important part of doing good.

        I don't see why we would expect that. There are lots of sets of values such that writing fiction for this subreddit would be an excellent way to fulfill them; a writer might enjoy the writing process and then want to spread the product around in case other people enjoy reading it, or they might enjoy accumulating a fanbase and find this subreddit to be a good place to do so, or they might have some Ideological Point they want to make and find writing fiction-of-interest-to-this-subreddit to be a good way to do so (*cough* HPMOR *cough*), or many other things. Am I missing something regarding why we wouldn't expect those reasons to apply to people who write things which end up posted here?
        ```

        I don't get why sacrificing oneself for the good of humanity is some kind of mega-rational move that everyone rational must immediately take upon awakening.

        If this is ruled out then self-gratification becomes inherently permissible, in which case I dunno why writing wouldn't count as part of that.

        Even under the assumption that writing a web novel is a waste of time (and I don't think it is),  you can be rational and lazy/unproductive, one does not imply lack of the other
        ```

  - u/LimeDog:
    ```
    That's what I thought too.
    ```

- u/Roxolan:
  ```
  Why is "this work is now on goodreads" post-worthy? GR doesn't inherently provide any value, does it?
  ```

  - u/orenmn:
    ```
    By GR you mean goodreads?I don't know whether this is post-worthy, but goodreads is for some people (me included) the place of their to-read list, and also a way to (roughly) check what others think about a story before starting to read it.

    E.g., if it gets a crazy average of 4.7 from 500 people, then maybe more  people would be more inclined to give it a try..

    Also, I now see someone has already marked it as "to-read"! (I believe they are probably going to enjoy it, so I count it as a good thing)
