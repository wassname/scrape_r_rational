## Recommending Non-Fiction

### Post:

On [RationalReads](http://rationalreads.com/#/), there are quite a number of interesting works posted already (63 so far to be exact). But there are only two stories that can be considered Non-Fiction.

Do you guys have anything to recommend that is Non-Fiction and either has some rational elements or would interest readers of Rational Fiction?

Here's a List of Non-Fiction accepted so far:

* LessWrong by Eliezer Yudkowsky

* Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Richard Hofstadter

EDIT: This is a list of books that I'm tentatively thinking about adding:

* Probability Theory: The Logic of Science by E.T. Jaynes

* Into The Jungle: Great Adventures in the Search for Evolution by Sean B. Carrol

* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell

* Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman

* Judgement Under Uncertainty by Daniel Kahneman

* The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane
(replaced The 48 Laws of Power, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli)

* The Art of War by Sun Tzu

* Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! by Richard Feynman

* The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat: And Other Clinical Tales by Oliver Sacks

* The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language by Steven Pinker

* Language In Thought And Action by S.I. Hayakawa

* Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, by Richards Heuer

* The Strategy of Conflict, by Thomas Schelling

* Micromotives and Macrobehavior by Thomas Schelling

* The Self Made Tapestry: Pattern Formation in Nature by Philip Ball

* Robot's Rebellion by Keith Stanovich

* Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength by Roy Baumeister

* Why the West Rules--For Now by Ian Morris

* War! What is it Good For? by Ian Morris

* Society of Mind by Marvin Minsky

* Foundations of Cognitive Psychology: Core Readings by Daniel J. Levitin

* This Explains Everything: Deep, Beautiful, and Elegant Theories of How the World Works (Edge Question Series) by John Brockman

I'll be choosing strongly in favor of the non-fiction multiple people comment on.

EDIT: I plan on adding all of these books to RationalReads this Saturday. So there's only a few more days to argue for or against some of the books on this list.

### Comments:

- u/None:
  ```
  Wouldn't it just be better to read actual science and math textbooks, or to ask someone who *has* which precise popularizations they'd recommend?
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    True and I would recommend that for people who are learning about a specific subject. But I think that people who go to RationalReads are more interested in *interesting* books that relate to cognitive science (how we think) or decision making (what habits to cultivate) with strong elements of rationality.

    In this precise context, it's very unlike you'll find anyone who can recommend things relating directly to rationality. Remember that rationality is an extremely narrow range of cognitive science and there is very little about direct applications to every-day life.

      >True and I would recommend that for people who are learning about a specific subject.

      Well, it's just that even the most perfect possible decision-making algorithm still needs actual *knowledge* to work with.  Besides which, I don't see how you can avoid trying to learn a bunch of math and science if you want to understand cognitive science or decision-making.
      ```

- u/Khaos1125:
  ```
  I'd recommend

  1. The Strategy of Conflict, by Thomas Schelling
  2. Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, by Richards Heuer
  ```

  - u/chaosmosis:
    ```
    I second the recommendation for Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, and I've already recommended The Strategy of Conflict in my own comment. Good choices.
    ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  I'm honestly surprised "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman hasn't been mentioned yet. It's probably the single most *useful* book on cognitive psych and mental biases I've ever read.
  ```

- u/somnicule:
  ```
  Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!
  ```

- u/raymestalez:
  ```
  - Paul Graham's essays and his book "Hackers and Painters".

  - Autobiographies by Feynman, Mitnick, Abagnale, Wozniak, Tesla.

  - "On Intelligence" by Jeff Hawkins
  - "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking
  - The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins

  - The 48 Laws of Power, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli.

  - "Serious Creativity" by Edward De Bono 

  [I'll add more as I remember]
  ```

  - u/micaeked:
    ```
    As a counterpoint, I wouldn't recommend A Brief History of Time. It basically reads like a list of conclusions without any of the supporting evidence. I couldn't just internalize the results without knowing why it was these specific results and not others. 

    In other words, my understanding of how reality works was not improved, which was my goal in reading that book.
    ```

- u/qznc:
  ```
  Having read the [first three chapters](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf) of E. T. Jaynes "Probability Theory: The Logic of Science" ([amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521592712/qid=1055853130/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-5027289-6942223?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)), the rest is on my toread list. LessWrong [describes](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ua/the_level_above_mine/) him as a "thousand-year-old vampire".
  ```

- u/sweeneyrod:
  ```
  The sequences take lots of their content from Language In Thought And Action by S.I. Hayakawa.
  ```

- u/rogueman999:
  ```
  Something by Roy Baumeister (I'm tempted to say "everything", but it's not practical). 

  Keith Stanovich, at least Robot's Rebellion. 

  Marvin Minsky, Society of Mind

  Hayakawa is good, but is a bit dated. I'm also very tempted to add Herbert Simon to the list but it's the same. They were waay ahead of their time, but half a century is half a century. 

  Many people here probably read Jared Diamond - I'm also recommending Ian Morris as a newer, arguably better alternative. (Why the West Rules etc).

  If the format is acceptable, [Foundations of Cognitive Psychology](http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Cognitive-Psychology-Core-Readings/dp/0262621592) is awesome.

  Nicholas Nassim Taleb - the whole pack, probably starting with Anti-fragile.
