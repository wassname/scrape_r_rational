  One thing that any story needs is a sense of urgency. I've been sluggish about establishing that, but we're finally there.

    I could have read the wacky adventures of the good dog in Ankh Morpork forever.

      Oh, we aren't done with Hellsport yet.  Have no fear.

      EDIT:  Note that the chapter contains a Chekov's portal gem.
