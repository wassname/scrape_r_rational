  Nice to see the beginnings of The Tallheart Fanclub. Looks like it’ll really have a lot of potential, with lots of people, and more importantly, lots of people each fulfilling different roles, and with Rain’s Earth views and ideas(rpg party knowledge), I’m expecting a lot out of them. Perhaps we’ll finally see some advancement and growth, Rain has literally been blueballed out of blues for so long.

  Given how exponentially stronger Rain gets once he passes the level 25 threshold and gets the very important skills, I wonder if the plot will really start ramping up from here along with the group’s strength. Delve is good, but I’m really just chomping at the bit for some real improvement.

    Patreon spoiler as of chapter 118:

    >!He hasn't so much as seen a blue, nor is there any reason to think that he'll find one in the next 2-3 chapters. They are in a lair but haven't actually run into anything to fight yet and at the pace Delve moves it's likely to be at least 2 chapters before they do. Also, the lair is level 11 or so, meaning unlikely to spawn a level 25 blue. Also also, if he does find one he's planning to capture it, drag it outside, and let the group decide what to do with it.!<

    If you reply to this, please remember to use spoilers as appropriate.

      What's the probability distribution for the level of a blue in a dungeon of level n again? Sorry, I can't remember how it worked.

        There's also the issue where Blues of n level are stronger than regular mobs of n level.

        It makes it really hard for you to kill higher level blues, than the level of your party.

        Looking forward to see how the overcome it, if ever.

          Especially when we already saw how scary the level 11? Razorspine was. Even an adventurer 7 levels higher and with some incredibly overpowered armor could barely do anything to it, and it took multiple adventurers to just barely take it down. Jesus Christ, how the hell are they gonna handle stronger blues?

          Makes me feel like Carten is gonna be groomed for the purposes of tanking. He’s already dual-wielding shields, you can’t scream tank any louder than that set up, and he’s an oddity in dual wielding shields, something I think nobody else does. Or is foolish enough to do. Also helps that he’s quite a malleable and agreeable fellow.

          With Carten the tank, Tallheart the smith(and mascot of The Tallheart Fanclub), Rain as the support, and Ameliah filling out any role necessary, along with Awakened of many other roles and merchants and potion makers, (and Dozer!) I’m pretty confident in their chances, they have the making of a great group and a potential to really do something great.

          Now if the story would finally move along though, I don’t know how many more dead weeks I can handle before they finally get to the good stuff. It’s been 3,000 years...

            The Razorspine was level 15 not level 11.

            ```
            Rain's a support though, it's not surprising that he had trouble fighting a monster head on. If you had someone with a Rain-tier build that was offensively inclined, that fight probably would have been much easier.

    Forming a company in of itself is real improvement.
    ```

- u/IncendiaVeneficus:
  ```
  Can someone explain the Doylist reason for Kettel? I feel like we're about to embark on another two chapters that will accomplish nothing. I liked the Ameliah section though. It's cool to show off the power of her build's ability to specialize in whatever is needed.

    Its very slow character growth for side characters.  

    Read a week at a time, the story is glacially slow with an almost circular plot.  Read all at once, you actually get to see side characters grow a little bit, which offers contrast to Rain's (slightly faster) glacially slow pace of growth.

    (aka, the author really needs an editor to cut the chaff)
    ```

  - u/CorneliusPhi:
    ```
    Yeah this seems like a setup for a 1 to 2 chapter arc that will do nothing for the story
    ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    The author is paid via patreon.  You don't need to hunt Doylist reasons for sprawl with that incentive structure. It is the natural state of things when the author is paid the same for every update, whether or not it moves the plot forward.

  ```
  > The ancestor of the Guild and the Watch was called the Majistraal Ascensi Guildum. Sounds vaguely Latin. Coincidence?? Ancient Roman isekaied through time? Possible thermae connection? Todo: investigate bathing technology.   

  I didn't expect a **[Thermae Romae](https://myanimelist.net/manga/20647/Thermae_Romae)** reference here. Or anywhere, really, it's pretty obscure.

  ```
  The Amehlia section seemed boring and useless, did I miss anything relevant by skipping it?

    ```
    Ameliah was thinking ahead to how the group would stay safe while travelling. She is practicing with earth magic so that she will be able to create temporary walls to sleep within at night.

      Thanks!

        ```
        Also a little bit just to show off her class and the fact that she's put in the time to have multiple builds leveled to 10.
