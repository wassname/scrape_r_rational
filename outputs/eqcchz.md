To celebrate, the first book in the series – [Six Sacred Swords](https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Swords-Weapons-Wielders-Book-ebook/dp/B07NKBSZGF/) – is on sale for on the [US Kindle store](https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Swords-Weapons-Wielders-Book-ebook/dp/B07NKBSZGF/) and [UK Kindle store](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sacred-Swords-Weapons-Wielders-Book-ebook/dp/B07NKBSZGF/). (Unfortunately, those are the only regions covered by Kindle Countdown Deals. If you’re somewhere else, sorry. ;\_;)

These books might not be quite as geared toward /r/rational as my Arcane Ascension books, but they still have hard magic and a good amount of lateral thinking for problem solving. I think some /r/rational readers would enjoy just seeing the diversity of magical powers and how different people use them in unusual ways.

[Six Sacred Swords](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NKBSZGF/) follows Keras Selyrian, a talented swordsman who begins a journey to seek out the titular Six Sacred Swords. It's a lighthearted adventure story, with a lot of nods to various classic games from the NES, SNES, and Playstation eras, especially *The Legend of Zelda*, *Dragon Quest*, *Ys*, and *Final Fantasy*. You might enjoy it if you're in the mood for talking swords, bibliophile dragons, and a lot of accidentally breaking traps and puzzles. The audio book version can be found [here](https://www.audible.com/pd/Six-Sacred-Swords-Audiobook/1772309117), narrated by the fantastic Nick Podehl!

This series takes place in the same universe as my *War of Broken Mirrors* and *Arcane Ascension* books.

Chronologically, the books follow this order:

· [*The War of Broken Mirrors*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/171610-the-war-of-broken-mirrors)

· [*Weapons and Wielders*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/257210-weapons-and-wielders)

· [*Arcane Ascension*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/201441-arcane-ascension)

Notably, the frame story for this book (meaning the Prologue, Interlude, and Epilogue) takes place much later than the main story, and after the second book of [*Arcane Ascension*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/201441-arcane-ascension). Reading those other books isn’t required to understand this one, but it may be beneficial to get everything possible out of the story.

Next, I’d like to mention something important about the style of this particular book.

*Diamantine* is designed to set the foundation for plot and character arcs and for several books to come, and this means that by necessity, there will be a number of elements introduced in this book that aren’t resolved by the end. This is intentional, but it may not work for all readers. If you prefer stories that feel self-contained, you may be best waiting for at least one more book to come out to read them back to back.

Thanks, everyone, and I hope you love the books!

Best,

\-Andrew

  Off topic I'm sorry, but if you have the time you should check out some historical combat youtube channels like scholagladiatoria, chadiversity, hema in general etc. I feel like your books would be right up my alley but I couldn't enjoy arcane ascension because of the combat. 

  &#x200B;

  A bit more realism would go a long way, I get it it's supposed to be fantasy and just fun and cool but my suspension of disbelief can only go so far.
  ```

  - u/Salaris:

    I have watched videos like those, and I've been doing LARP and SCA style combat myself. My combat isn't written to be realistic. It's written with JRPG/anime physics and pacing.

    This is a big part of why you see things like length dialogues in the middle of combat, swords cutting through armor, etc.

    I write what I enjoy reading. I find realistic combat scenes uninteresting in written form.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      Fair enough. I guess I'm just not the target audience then, while I enjoy anime combat and frequently watch anime, in written form that combat style bothers me..

      It's somewhat interesting, maybe we differ in how we visualize / interpret written content, to me that's IRL, to others it might be anime or a format where their suspension of disbelief is lower.

      PS. Have you seen Delve ? The most recent chapter has a fantastic realistic physics combat scene between very powerful individuals, like they can run faster than sound individuals, you may find it interesting. 
      I loved it..
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        That's perfectly fair, and even I have specific anime style things that bother me. For example, I get irritated when I see people parrying greatsword with kunai in Naruto and that reach is seemingly never a factor for taijutsu and kenjustu. I think everyone has specific things they like and dislike seeing in combat scenes.

        I generally visualize even anime style combat as looking "real", just operating under different rules. If you've seen movies like The Storm Riders or TV shows like Once Upon a Time at Lingjian Mountain, that's roughly how I picture book combat for more anime style books like mine or Cradle looking.

        Yes, I'm a reader for Delve, but I haven't read the latest chapter yet. Thus far, I visualize the setting as being more like a Western MMO, as opposed to something like a JRPG. I'll have to check the recent chapter to see what you mean.

  Hey I bought your first book because of this post, was not aware of it, and I'm enjoying it. I just wanted to let you know that posts like this do work.

  I enjoyed this book. It felt more similar to the Cradle books than to Arcane Ascension, which isn't a bad thing. Lots of cool characters doing their own crazy overpowered awesome things. (I like the Arcane Ascension books a little more, this is just to say that it was fun in a different way)

  I felt a bit ridiculous that it took me a while to recognise >!Professor Meltlake!<

  This is a very minor point - far less important than the book being very enjoyable - but it did have several spelling and grammar mistakes. I don't know anything about how the self-publishing process works, so I don't know how easy it would be to improve your process for catching those.

    Yeah, I agree. This series in general is more of a fun action-adventure, rather than the slower pace and heavy world building focus of Arcane Ascension. I enjoy both reading and writing both styles and I'll continue doing more of both. =D

    > I felt a bit ridiculous that it took me a while to recognise

    You're actually the first person who has mentioned this so far, and you're correct.

    > This is a very minor point - far less important than the book being very enjoyable - but it did have several spelling and grammar mistakes. I don't know anything about how the self-publishing process works, so I don't know how easy it would be to improve your process for catching those.

    This is largely a consequence of me adding additional content right down to the wire, including after my editing passes on the book were completed. I did this because one of my last-minute beta readers pointed out some things that felt missing from the manuscript, and I agreed. Unfortunately, I also have a delivery date to get it to my audio book publisher, and I didn't have enough time for another whole editing pass before that.

    So, I chose to make the additions, knowing that I would likely be adding mistakes. I had a couple beta readers go over the new content, and did a couple passes myself, but that clearly wasn't sufficient.

    (To give you an idea, the largest and last new section was >!the entire opening ceremonies scene!<, which is why that section has far more errors than the rest of the manuscript.)

    For the moment, I'm collecting and rapidly fixing errors people find using the typo thread her: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimbersCourt/comments/eqbv8h/diamantine_typo_thread/

    When I get around to Arcane Ascension 3, I intend to give myself roughly twice as much editing time, and I'm going to try to avoid making any last minute changes like I did on this one.

      Sounds like you have it under control, then. I'm sure I got more enjoyment out of the new passages than I did minor surprise from a few typos!

      I was thinking about why I liked this book more than Six Sacred Swords (which was still fun), and I think it might be because the tournament scenes allow us to follow so many more characters than just the main few, and a large part of the fun in a series like this one is seeing various characters do their own crazy-powerful awesome things.

      Is there any chance that we'll get to hear from some of the other major characters at some point, either in a multiple point-of-view book, or short stories or something?

      > You're actually the first person who has mentioned this so far, and you're correct. 

      If I recall correctly, she melted a lake in a duel... if it so happens that that duel took place in a certain tournament, then I'm looking forward to seeing it!

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        I think the larger cast and longer length both made the book more engaging than SSS was in most respects. It's a lot more work to write something like this or SAM, though.

        I definitely *want* to tell more stories with other characters from the series, it's just a matter of balancing my time.

        As for that last part...no comment. =)
        ```

        - u/Penumbra_Penguin:
          ```
          Well, you're definitely on the list of authors whose next book I look forward to and buy immediately, so I'm sure I will enjoy whatever is next. Thanks for your responses and books!
          ```

          - u/Salaris:
            ```
            You're welcome, and take care!
