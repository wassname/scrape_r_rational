## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  So I've watched some let's plays of danganronpa and I found it a very interesting concept. I mean, what would you do in the situation? For those who don't know, the basic rules are as shown:

  Rule #1: People may reside only within the building. Leaving this area is an unacceptable use of time.

  Rule #2: "Nighttime" is from 10 pm to 7 am. Some areas are off-limits at night.

  Rule #3: Sleeping anywhere other than the dormitory will be punished accordingly.

  Rule #4: With minimal restrictions, you are free to explore the building at your discretion.

  Rule #5: Violence against "Monokuma" (the one trapping you there) is strictly prohibited, as is destruction of surveillance cameras.

  Rule #6: Anyone who kills a fellow person and becomes "blackened" will be able to leave, unless they are discovered.

  Rule #7: Additional school regulations may be added if necessary.

  Rule #8: Once a murder takes place, a trial will begin shortly thereafter, with time given for gathering evidence. Participation is mandatory for all surviving persons.

  Rule #9: If the guilty party is exposed during the trial, they alone will be executed.

  Rule #10: If the guilty party is not exposed, they alone will be able to leave, and all remaining persons will be executed.

  Rule #11: Lending your "e-Handbook" (which has the list of rule, is necessary to enter certain areas, and holds evidence that is discovered) to another person is strictly prohibited.

  Rule #12: The guilty party may only kill a maximum of two people.

  Rule #13: Attempting to break into locked rooms is strictly prohibited.

  If any of these rules are broken, the rule breaker is executed.

  So my question is this: what is the rational method for surviving (or escaping)? Everything is provided for, but you have to go to the cafeteria to get food, for example. In this case, let's say you are trapped with 15 others, all around your age, with a 50/50 gender split.
  ```

    ```
    Designate a scapegoat, have all the others participate in the murder and be silent during the trial.  Difficult to maintain cooperation, but seems to yield minimum casualties.  Ideally the scapegoat is a volunteer.
    ```

    - u/m0le:
      ```
      Further to this, have the scapegoat destroy all surveillance in the area where the murder happens, and have the conspirators vote to blame the scapegoat for their own murder, exonerating them all.

      Once out, return with police to stop anyone else being sucked into this scenario.
      ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    The correct move is to find the person setting this up and murder the hell out of them. 
    If you buy into the game, then the winning move is public suicide. One murder, one correctly identified suspect, maximum number of survivors, noone living with guilt.
    ```

    - u/Pandomy:
      ```
      > If you buy into the game, then the winning move is public suicide. One murder, one correctly identified suspect, maximum number of survivors, noone living with guilt.

      I don't think a successful trial necessarily means everyone who is not the murderer gets to leave. In your proposed situation, after the trial is done, the only thing that's changed is that there is one less person.
      ```

  - u/Pandomy:
    ```
    > Rule #9: If the guilty party is exposed during the trial, they alone will be executed.

    > Rule #10: If the guilty party is not exposed, they alone will be able to leave, and all remaining persons will be executed.

    How is "exposed" defined? Ironclad evidence? Sufficient evidence to convince the Monokuma? A 2/3 majority vote of everyone who's not dead?
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    I'm curious, what happens if you correctly identify every murderer, until you are the only one left alive despite not having murdered anyone? Are you then free to go?

    Also, what happens if someone physically prevents me from entering the dormitory? Would I then be forced to sleep outside and get punished for breaking rule #3?
    ```

  - u/itaibn0:
    ```
    I can think of three classes of scenarios describing how you end up in this situation. The first is that you are unexpectedly kidnapped by the crazy person running this and they appear to be running things with conventional technology. The second is that you are unexpectedly forced into this situation by an apparently supernatural force. In both of these cases you do not have a strong reason to believe that the rules that are handed to you will actually be followed by Monokuma. That rule #7 is explicitly written to allow Monokuma to change the rules only gives more reason to not expect them to be obeyed by Monokuma. In particular, although within the rules of the game rule #10 is the only way to escape alive, there is no way for you to witness somebody else successfully apply it. Attempting to take advantage of it yourself is a big risk with a small chance of success, so I don't recommend it.

    Instead, I believe the best option is simply to try and survive, wait to be rescued, and covertly seek opportunities to escape. Unless I underestimate how much peoples' character changes in extreme situations, I don't expect anybody to murder anybody else for years, and you have a decent chance of living out the rest of your natural lifespan, during which time there are lots of chances of new development: Monokuma changing the rules in cruel and arbitrary ways, being rescued, someone discovering a way to escape.

    The third scenario for how you end up in this situation is that some world developments lead to you recognize situations analogous this one as things that actually happen from time to time and to become confident that in situations like this the rules will actually be followed as stated. In that case the same evidence that convinces you the rules will be followed should also give useful information on what to expect to happen in this sort of situation. More details on this evidence is necessary to give advice.

  What would you do with the 4D vision from *Spaceland* by Rudy Rucker?

  Imagine a Flatlander with an eyestalk extending into the third dimension, allowing him to look down and see inside nearby objects. This power is the same, but a dimension higher. Objects get increasingly squashed by perspective as they get farther away, and need to have a significant volume to be seen (so words on a page or images on a screen could be too thin to make out clearly.
  ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    Well, one non-obvious use of it is for prospecting.  With this 4D vision I should be able to see everything that's in the ground around me, and that means I can go to a mine and point out where to find all the valuable materials.

    Additionally, with enough training I might be able to tell the difference between healthy flesh and a cancerous tumour, which means I could warn people well before it becomes a major problem.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The problem with 4d vision is we don't have it. Each eye gives us a 2 dimensional image of a 3 dimensional universe. An eyestalk in the 4th dimension would have to have a 3d retina. Now try imagining having a 3d retina, where you could look at an image of a human being inside and out, seeing all cross-sections at the same time. How to do this? Maybe you could send to the optic nerve all the cross sections in a grid, and eventually the brain will figure it out, in a similar way to how if you put on [goggles](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/12/improbable-research-seeing-upside-down) that turn everything upside down, you get used to it, and then everything looks upside down when the goggles are removed.

    I can envision a pair of goggles with a 4 dimensional component, that show cross-sections when you put them on. How long it would take to get used to that, I don't know.

      I mean, technically, yes. But given OP's description, I think it's safe to assume this is one of those cases where you have all the secondary powers that make the primary ability function.

Just enough to see and ignore 3D physical effects if he wanted to.

  ```
  You have gained the supernatural ability to move objects with your mind, a.k.a. telekinesis. The accuracy/strength/dexterity/sensitivity/etc. of your telekinesis is exactly the same as if you are using your hand to move objects.

  However! This ability is defective: it nullifies itself whenever someone else detects it. So if someone sees you levitating stuff, that stuff stops levitating. If someone hears you telekinetically bashing an object against the wall, your telekinetic grip on that object is released. If someone feels you telekinetically trying to move them, that telekinetic force is dispelled.  If someone so much as thinks "Hey you're doing magic!" your telekinetic magic is immediately nullified (until they stop thinking it).

  How do you exploit this ability?
  ```

  - u/Nickoalas:
    ```
    How quickly is it dispelled after the person feels it? Because if they feel it first I can hit them hard and fast.
    Otherwise I'd exploit it like normal telekinesis except sneaky, with the added benefit of being able to alert me if I'm being observed.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      > How quickly is it dispelled after the person feels it?

      Immediately. As in, the moment you so much as apply a tiny bit of force on someone's body, your telekinetic powers are instantaneously and completely nullified.

      > with the added benefit of being able to alert me if I'm being observed.

      Interesting, it would indeed be helpful for sneaking around undetected.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        You could still hurt someone by accelerating an object from behind and releasing it from your telekinesis before it hits them so that it just keeps going on pure intertia.

        That's actually how I'd use that power in general (unless I'm manipulating tiny stuff): Don't try to hold things but just grab them quickly and throw them where you want them to go.

And then in the final movie, he basically lets Smith infect him, and then the Machines somehow use that to delete every instance of Smith? But it kills Neo in the process.") The Matrix is not a very rational universe. Someday, I'd like to get off my ass and work on a Matrix rational fiction, where humans are used for computing power, not god damn batteries, and are fed geothermal algae instead of liquified dead people like some kind of perpetual motion machine.
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        Using humans for processing has its own problems, especially if the humans need to be basically unaffected and not become suspicious of the matrix.           
        You could potentially grow your own custom neural material, but using existing humans to do computing for you, without them knowing or being any worse for the wear is rather implausible.           
        Of course the whole matrix premise in general is based on the implausible idea that human minds would somehow be able to reject a paradise simulation (if you're considering a fanfic I assume you've seen the animatrix) and you'd really need to bend over backwards to come up with reasons for them to keep unwitting humans in an ancestor simulation.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          I haven't seen the animatrix. But I've read the wiki page on what happened before the movies.

          I've decided that the processing part is basically an unconscious hijack of the brain. Most of the time, the brain is processing what the Matrix wants it to process. (Bitcoin mining, anyone?) A small percentage of the time, the brain is processing virtual senses and making memories and doing what's natural. The consequence of this is that time in the Matrix is slower than it is in the real world. This also *might* allow the possibility for someone, either by hacking or being the One or something, to realize how shitty the Matrix's framerate is and learn how to dodge bullets. Although that might require the passage of Matrix time to be like, .1% of realtime? So maybe, not dodge bullets, but at least dodge fists and other stuff. Even at 10% realtime, humans would live for hundreds if not thousands of real years, hooked up to the Matrix, and experience a 80 year lifetime. Also, after Neo's spent a few days in there trying to find the Oracle, when he comes out of it it's already Christmas.

          Why is the Matrix a simulation of the 21st century and not losing your virginity with your soulmate 24/7? Either for historical purposes, or so they can torture those who didn't assist in creating the Machines. Or both.

          Why are there humans outside of the Matrix? Because there was a malfunction, or a robot human sympathizer helped them out, or somebody found an exploit, broke the laws of physics, and managed to wake himself up before an AI detected his hacking and shut his brain down. Or maybe there's something else going on that I will come up with later that's more interesting than the whole The One fiasco for gorrilla glueing the issue of humans randomly waking up.

          Oh and in my Matrix universe, the Machines darkened the sky. Which is cool for them, because they designed it to *actually capture all the solar energy for them*, instead of just darkening the Sun to kill everything.

          That was hard. Maybe I should write a rational Terminator instead.
          ```

          - u/vakusdrake:
            ```
            Having humans actually spend most their time does processing for the machines that they're not aware of is actually pretty clever. However human brains aren't very versatile general purpose computers so what it makes sense to use them for is going to be pretty limited. So during the periods you don't remember the machines ought to have you doing some sort of task that humans are far better at than the presumably stupid AI (if they weren't dumb intelligence explosion would wreck your setting).                           
            Also it's unclear what exactly you mean by the time dilation, but it can't be a general slowdown of the brain because human brains just don't have the ability to run at slower speeds (again they're not versatile in the same ways as computers) so people will have to be either prevented from remembering what happens when they're used by the machines (anterograde amnesia) or memory wiped.            
            Admittedly this could be cool because it could possibly mean that people could in theory remembering the other level of the simulation where the AI's force them to work on various problems and potentially forcefully alter their mind to make them more efficient (also this sort of thing would mean the AI would want to likely select for extremely clever humans for efficiencies sake).

            >Why is the Matrix a simulation of the 21st century and not losing your virginity with your soulmate 24/7? Either for historical purposes, or so they can torture those who didn't assist in creating the Machines. Or both.

            Historical purposes doesn't really make any sense (if they're human enough to care about running ancestor sims that doesn't fit well with them being inferior to humans in the ways that stop intelligence explosions and keep humans useful). As for punishment that would require a bizzare level of spitefulness once you get past the first generation of people who were alive before the machine uprising. However even if you accept that, using the current world as a punishment is weird. Since the suffering is sort of weirdly stratified and semi-random and again what would lead one to decide that this particular era just happens to be the best for that or really any purpose other than ancestor sim?             
            That's sort of the main issue, if they care enough about us to even let us have a sim in the first place then it's hard to imagine a criterion by which this particular era would be ideal.

            >That was hard. Maybe I should write a rational Terminator instead.

            Oh man terminator is even worse, you'd get something of an idea for how reading _Branches on the Tree of Time_. But yeah having straight up time travel (without heavy restrictions that would conflict with the premise) makes things absurdly complicated.               
            That is sort of the issue with settings that are so massively non-rationalist to begin with, getting something sensible out means leaving out most distinguishing features of the original in many cases (hell i'm not even sure branches on the tree of time ever explained why after they beat the AI, shit doesn't keep coming back from the future since it's not like there's a limit on range).

  You *somehow* stumble across a magic spell, one you can teach to others, one that allows for portals. Portals that you can power from the  electrical power grid, but there are caveats:

  1. Portals are always created in pairs. They don’t need to be attached to anything. 
  2. The creation of a portal costs significantly more energy than keeping it open. 
  3. More distance being covered increases energy demands exponentially ( E ≈ 4/3 x π x distance^3 ). Yes, that formula is intentional, because
  4. Portals act like two opposite points on the surface of a sphere, and traversing matter/information takes a random path between those points. 
  5. The space between portals can be filled with anything you want, the portals don’t care, they remain open, unless
  6. Another portal is opened up between the two existing ones.
  7. These sphere’s are forcefully terminated when overlapping with another portal pair’s sphere. 
  8. Disruption of a sphere leads to currently traversing information/matter being semi-uniformly distributed on a molecular level across the sphere’s real world coordinates.
  9. Traversal of portals takes no subjective time. 
  10. Assume energy cannot be generated ex nihilo this way, there’s no harnessing of potential energy or other shenanigans.
  11. Also assume that you can only traverse a portal at certain speeds or whatever physics would be necessary 

  Sure, if you can arrange it well you could dispose of all kinds of things this way, but what would this allow for on larger, geopolitical scales?

    How do portals to different gravity wells work, such as our moon, another planet or the sun? Also, depending on how gravitons are transmitted, this kills everyone.

  Munchkin this: You have a pocket computer, a magical device that shrinks a 1980s supercomputer into a tiny thin square. 

  Somehow, the basic operation of it -- acquiring and running and interacting with computer programs -- is easy and known to you. The programs on it can magically talk to pocket computers that other people have. Your total computational power and storage is bounded at, lets say, something like 1.5 Gflops and 24Gb of storage, give or take an order of magnitude. There are databases of common facts accessible by it. 

  How do you end up *thinking better*? Ignore all the easy everyday ways it'd make life simpler. How does having this with you help *you* level up and do better at life? What can you *calculate* that will lead you to better outcomes?

  Edit: I also asked in the Friday off-topic thread (it's off the topic of writing/stories, at least) and have [reported some preliminary results](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6j1r84/d_friday_offtopic_thread/djg9h6u/). 

  I also found a few words that better describe the problem: how can you use the pocket computer as a *mental prosthesis*? How does a supercomputer always in your pocket help as a mind-extension tool? If there are habits of thought that help you win, which habits of device-usage would help in the same way?

    There are three things that this pocket computer can do for me.

    It can *run calculations*.

    It can *access information*.

    It can *talk to other people's computers*.

    The only real issue, then, is proper indexing and defining goals. Let us say, for example, that I have Goal X (say, um... "eradicate malaria"). Then, I want to find a way to accomplish Goal X. Now, ideally, I should have access to a number of pre-determined plans for accomplishing a variety of X's, in some publicly accessible database. However, for some X's (such as "eradicate malaria") there is no pre-determined plan because it has not been done before. In this case, if I wish to accomplish my goal, I need to talk to a relevant expert. Can my pocket computer find and identify an expert in malaria eradication, ideally one who would be willing to help in such an endeavour?
    ```

    - u/-main:
      ```
      I think so far we're doing better at info and communications than calculation. Then again, maybe those are just more available - I can tell when my phone has put me in contact with someone or stored data for me, but the math behind animating and drawing the interface, or using the radios, is less visible. 

       You can definitely research malaria charities and experts, on your phone. But you can also research malaria charities from a library or a desktop computer... not much is gained by having a *pocket* computer on you constantly. For long term planning in general, desktops and libraries dominate cellphones. 

      A online database of strategies for common tasks could be helpful. (WikiHow?) I'll take a look and see what I can find and/or think about making and running it myself. 

      Alternatively, a real expert-finding app for networking might be helpful (LinkedIn?). 

      Still, that feels like offloading my thinking to others (which can be good, but slightly misses the point of the exercise) rather than the phone helping me think better. How could it help you achieve expertise, if no one had ever looked at malaria before? 

      I'm confused and I need to find better words for this. I don't think I'm communicating the concept I have very well. Some of my confusion is in the word 'thinking' -- if I break things down into memory, communication, research, understanding, planning, calculating, and awareness of time, then it becomes obvious that it actually is helpful. 

      Other mental tasks, like analysis (rootclaim?), imagination, decision, empathy, creation, it seems less helpful.

        Ah. Hmmm. If you're looking for ways in which the portable nature of such a device dominates... I think that applications that make use of the GPS will be the most useful.

          You're right that spacial/position sensors are a huge advantage of cellphones, enabling kinds of usege that you just can't do with a desktop. I'll go add 'never get lost' or 'certainty of current location' to my list of current advantages that it gives me, which *is* actually an improvement over a paper map or a map on my desktop computer. 

          But I was thinking along the lines of having that computing power available *in the moment*.

          The idea is this: if there are habits of thought that help you win, are there habits of device-usage that would help in the same way? A tool you always have on you can become a mental prosthetic to a greater degree than a bulky machine stored at home.

            Hmmm. Always available, yes, but *using* it often takes attention - you have to look at the screen and tap at it - which means that most uses are things that you need at least a quiet moment for.

            An exception to that is when the phone interacts with you audibly ("In. Five hundred metres. Turn. Left.") which doesn't steal too much attention away from most tasks. Perhaps this can be leveraged to have the phone act as a kind of limited PA ("Taking current traffic unto account. To reach your. Dental. Appointment. On time. You should leave. Within the next. Fifteen. Minutes.").

            Basically a schedule manager.

And in fact people made apps for Google Glass that you couldn't run on a cellphone because of that, like that lady who streamed her PoV live to the internet and tried to croudsource appropriate social interaction from Mechanical Turk. So maybe the really helpful interactions *would* need a neural interface... 

              Reminders about appointments fall under helping with time-sense. But I should do it more: even though I now run my schedule with an appointments diary, I should still set up my phone beep at me for important things.

                Neural interface could be good, but we don't need to go *that* far. What we need is an interface that doesn't take your full attention away from everything else.

                Another way to accomplish this is an entirely sound-based interface. (Sight has to be focused in a direction - sound can be heard no matter where it is, so it's a better sense to interface with when the person's attention is elsewhere). But there's two halves to an interface; having the phone talk to you is easy. Ideally, you still have to provide input to the phone. Now, for something like a GPS system, the input is provided (through an attention-stealing eye/touch interface) almost entirely at the start of the journey; and then audio output is provided until the destination is reached.

                One solution to applications that need on-the-spot input without stealing attention is an audio-only input. Modern phones are halfway there - I can tap on the bar at the bottom of my phone, drag, and input a voice query prefaced with "OK Google" to get a Google-search response. Now I just need to be able to turn that on without looking at my phone.

                (Mind you, the direct neural interface would be more useful than a pure-audio one. But not, I think, *that* much more useful - the pure-audio interface has the look of something with a fair degree of untapped potential)
                ```
