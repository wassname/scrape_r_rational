  My first thought was that I can’t get used to a heroic Akua, but then I realized she’d just be doing good things sarcastically, most likely while talking about how much she’d rather be summoning demons - I now fully support this.
  ```

  - u/magna-terra:
    ```
    why summon demons, when you can put your binding skill to use on the more dangerous beings, angels?
    ```

    - u/TristanTheViking:
      ```
      This was all just a prequel to the greatest story of all. Wait until Cat gets her hands on a BMX bike.

  The Ubua heroic turn is even better then I thought it might be. And, concurrently with that, its a FANTASTIC story. Evil villain that doesn't really believe in good but follows the praxis of it to see if it works, snarking the whole way?  I know that the names are grooves worn in creation but I feel like in a world that runs on metaphor, novel arcs have to give you a little more metaphysical juice. So excited to see where this goes.

    I'd like to see the choirs trying to decide what to do with her. "Do you want her? How about you? Name? Name anyone?"
    ```

      ```
      Hey, Contrition, this is your area, right?

      "Uh... no, no we've got other plans. Secret plans! We can't tell you, they're secret. But important. Very important!"

      Ok. Judgement?

      "We already have one. We only ever have one at a time."

      Endurance?

      "She's a mage. We don't take mages. We prefer our heroes to be humble peasant boys with swords who don't ask too many questions."

      Mercy? She's got the whole 'sacrifices for the greater good thing' already, and you wouldn't have to teach her healing.

      "She isn't nice enough. She wouldn't be able to fake being a kind girl who wants everyone to get along. Everyone would see the ruthless fixer beneath the surface. We prefer our heroes to look sad when they massacre a bunch of civilians."

      Alright...Compassion?

      "Hah. Hah hah hah hah hah. Oh. You were serious. Hehhehheh. No."
      ```

        Is there a Choir of Hilarity?
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          If the Gods Above are based on Christianity (which it seems to be), the common perception of the Christian afterlife is based on Dante, who borrowed heavily from Classical Mythology...

          I guess what I'm trying to say here is that there may be a Choir of Fitting/Ironic Punishment (Retribution?).  And I think that Akua serving that Choir would both suit her situation (enslaved to rebuild the country she almost destroyed) as well as her temperament.
          ```

          - u/Empiricist_or_not:
            ```
            Choir of Schadenfreude/The Kindly Ones: Yup she's one of ours.
            ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      If she just Binds an angel and has it anoint her, I'm going to laugh, loud. I hope Catherine turns it all on its head and has her join Hanno's heroic band.
      ```

      - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
        ```
        Hanno: “I’m a hero, why the hell do I have a Treacherous lieutenant?”
        ```

        - u/PrettyDecentSort:
          ```
          Heroes have treacherous lieutenants all the time. Half of them get redeemed through the power of friendship and the other half turn into the villain of the next arc.
          ```

          - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
            ```
            Ah, but not *this* Treacherous Lieutenant

            “No Akua we cannot set our enemy’s blood on fire! I don’t care if it *is* more efficient and “sends a message””
            ```

        - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
          ```
          I really want to see this happen good lord
          ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  Oh shit... we were sent in an entirely wrong direction about the plot!

  How could I forget, EE is the master of hiding important things in plain sight all the while redirecting us elsewhere.

  All this time we argued about whether Winter would Devour the night or the other way around, but Catherine doesn't work like that! Either way is *bad* because it's playing *into* the narrative, *into* the story.

  Cat breaks stories!

  And so, we come upon the foreshadowing set up that the sisters are two beings in one body? soul? anyway, there's two of them. And Catherine's now found, perhaps, the "good" sister of the two!

  Catherine wants to be mortal again, but she doesn't want to lose all the powers and ties that come with being the Sovereign of Moonless nights. Some of us thought that **Akua** of all people was going to inherit the mantle (seriously?). But now we have another option! Talk with Antonike, find out what she wants, and help her take control of the night. I assume because of her background as a sage, she will have a better time controlling the alienation.

  Her request is likely going to be the salvation of her people, which Cat can definitely help with. And so the *real* sixth ranger enters the Woe, reducing Akua's role, maybe enough that she can try for her redemption and subsequent destruction.
  ```

  - u/Rheklr:
    ```
    There is an interesting parallel between the sisters and Cat/Ubua - one is magical while the other goes to war. 

    I wonder if this is foreshadowing?
    ```

  - u/Ezreon:
    ```
    With Rumena as snarky butler to her ancient wizard!
    ```

- u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
  ```
  Ubuu changing sides is absolutely fantastic. The symmetry of a villain rising from a traditionally Good country that is controlled by villains, and a hero rising from a country traditionally Evil who is personally controlled by a -lowercase V- villian. 


  Circles within circles.
  ```

  - u/razorfloss:
    ```
    Don't forget the so called hero will be sarcastic about it the entire way. It will be glorious
    ```

    - u/magna-terra:
      ```
      flogging, really? thats the best torture you could think of?"
      ```

      - u/ATRDCI:
        ```
        To say flogging is passe would be an understatement.  Watching this is like seeing a newly appointed member of the court incorrectly doising last year's poison.
        ```

  ```
  On one hand, Akua being Best Girl again. If she earns a Name on that, the banter with Vivienne is going to be glorious. "See Thief, you did a terrible job of staying a Hero, I did a terrible job of staying a Villain. In the end, we ARE walking the same path, don't mind the direction."

  On the other hand, we still don't know what happened to Archer.

  Alicia Keys' song Karma has the lyrics 

  >What goes around, comes around, What goes up, must come down 
  >
  >Now who's dying, desiring to come back to me

  Which surprisingly fits all that's happening in the past two chapters.

  Love this!

  The idea of Akua loving and trying to be better is a fascinating idea and shows that Akua might still be trapped in the stories that Cat cuts through with gusto. 

  Too bad, it's a great dream. I suspect she is pushing Cat to win so Akua can usurp the mantle that she now has a stronger attachment to.

  The option I think would be the most fun is for cat to walk out of here with her new Name finally solidified and two new aspects, Night and Winter, that are less continent-breaking and suitably confusing for her foes. Or even just finally gaining a full Name. Godslayer is starting to seem appropriate.

  I think the other sister taking over Night/Winter as a new goddess is better than Sve doing so, but it feels waaay too narratively easy. Like Cat shreds the story to victory, but somehow the "obviously" dark sister who seems nice ends up in power? I think those excited about this idea already forgot the lesson we just learned (again)...our amazing writer is sneaky and tricksy like the hobbitses!

  I am filled with tension over these last few chapters. I dearly love Cat and seeing her soul ripped out, ripped open, and then devoured while she watched has me emotional 😭
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    The thing about a name like godslayer is that neither above or below is EVER going to back it, that's the kind of name you build yourself.
    ```

    - u/TaltosDreamer:
      ```
      *points at all of Cat's shenanigans...Godslayer

      I thought a Name is a kind of groove worn in reality? I agree that neither direction is likely to support a name like that, but Cat seems to be wearing grooves into reality left and right. 

      I am honestly surprised we haven't seen more new Names popping up around her just because of the way she messes with reality.
      ```

      - u/PrettyDecentSort:
        ```
        > Cat seems to be wearing grooves into reality left and right.

        How many times have we told Cat to take off her cleats before walking on Creation's nice wood floors?
        ```

      - u/havoc_mayhem:
        ```
        New names? Like Hierophant and Adjutant?
        ```

        - u/Empiricist_or_not:
          ```
          Don't forget she made Thief Regent triggering whatever is going on with the royal locks of Viviann's breakdown.
          ```

          - u/havoc_mayhem:
            ```
            Was that a Warbreaker reference?
            ```

        - u/TaltosDreamer:
          ```
          I think Hierophant is an old and uncommon name. I believe his parents would have been considerably more interested if it were brand new, and more knowledgeable about how tough it would be to keep him prisoner if it were recently used/known. 

          Adjutant on the other hand seems unknown. Everyone was blown away that he had a name and based on my understanding of his culture in aeons past, it doesnt seem to be a Name they would have had. If I recall correctly, Warlock mentioned that he wanted to study Adjutant as well.

          Since Cat breaks stories and narratives like she does, it makes sense to me that Names would be weird around her. Old/New ones appearing and existing names sometimes reacting oddly.

          I wonder if reality itself is demanding change. All this stratified good/evil looks like it is heading for Arcadia's fate...stagnation. With reality being the "dynamic" part of the universe, Cat might be a result. Ripping up the things that are too unable to change. Not even Winter, with all it's power, froze her entirely and her influence has clearly affected Akua as well.
          ```

- u/morgf:
  ```
  Did we ever find out what Cat asked Akua to do at the end of Chapter 72?

  > “I need you to do something for me,” I said.
  > 
  > She turned to face me completely. In Masego that would have been a notice I had his full attention, but with her I always had that. Even when she pretended otherwise.
  > 
  > “I had role given in the battle to come,” Akua said.
  > 
  > “I know,” I said. “But this is more important.”
  > 
  > “And what exactly do you need of me, dearest?” she asked.
  > 
  > There were a lot of ways I could have answered her. Some true, others euphemisms or a hundred different shades of flippant. It’d helped me over the years, the quips. Allowed me to make it a joke or a game, anything but a reality so often ugly. But if I was to let the monster off her leash, then she should be given her due.
  > 
  > “Folly,” I said.
  > 
  > Akua Sahelian smiled, and in that smile lay the promise of things great and terrible to behold.
  ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    > There’s no walking back the Folly

    My read is that Folly is still in play, and Akua hasn't triggered it yet.
    ```

- u/ConnorF42:
  ```
  Quick question not worth a separate post: I am on book 3 (not reading any of the comments here to avoid spoilers), does it seem like Book 4 is about to wrap up? And the series is intended to be 5 books right?
  ```

  - u/razorfloss:
    ```
    Looking more like 7 the author is splitting this book into 2 parts because it is longer than they expected
    ```

    - u/ConnorF42:
      ```
      Oh, interesting. So 7 comes from original Book 4 being split into 4 and 5, and assuming Book 5 is also going to run long and get split? No complaints here as long as it continues to be good.
      ```

      - u/Empiricist_or_not:
        ```
        FYSA no spoilers opinions are highly divided on book 4, and that is all dependent on a  rapidly approaching crescendo (as in probably monday or next friday by my guess, then  we enter falling action and denouncement).
        ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      Honestly, when it comes to Web novel authors estimates for the length of their series, I tend to just double their first estimate and stick to that.
      ```
