This is the funniest fanfic I've ever read, and it's finished, and it features some very clever bits of rational thinking. For example, Potter figured out a way to become immune to the imperious curse, and another method for beating love potions. He has a knack for accomplishing impossible goals by thinking outside the box. While the main character is insane and does some very silly things, he is insane in predictable ways, not just because being stupid is required to keep the plot moving, and the story has a great deal of internal consistency.

  This is brilliant.

  Shit, this was fantastic. I finished it in one sitting, and now I want more Harrymort. Or aspiring-Dark-Lord Hermione (which the author makes a surprisingly good case for, using only canon plot pieces, too). Or Bellaginny. Or Rose Weasley ([epilogue](#s "guaranteed HPJEV-Quirrell relationship with Harry")), or even Gilderoy Potter. Seriously. Just ... more.

  On that note, insightful quote from [the TVT page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/SeventhHorcrux):

  >Voldemort is like the old person who doesn't understand computers at all, but knows that sometimes viruses cause them problems, so if something goes wrong with his computer he assumes it has a virus. Except the computers are people and the virus is love.

  Inspired fic. Thanks for sharing, /u/INeedAUsernameToo!

  I can't make any progress on this. I keep having to stop every other sentence to regain composure.

  Edit: I especially love the Alternate Character Interpretation of Lockhart. “I think we both know that there won’t be any more Lockharts. He was the bravest man I ever knew.”

    Part of what made that great is that, of course, Lockhart was still an incompetent buffoon. Harrymort just couldn't figure that out.

  From the third sentence:

  >Bellatrix crouched at my feet, sneaking glances and occasionally emitting dreamy sighs – exactly the sort of behavior that caused me to turn myself into a nose-less snake.

  I already know this is going to be good.

  While I am unsure if I would call this rational, that was a hilarious read

    Yeah, I was debating back and forth about whether this fic could really be called rational. On the one hand, it has some really devious bits of munchkinry. On the other hand the main character is insane, which isn't rational at all.

    In the end I posted it because while Harry isn't really rational, he looks at the world from a radically unique viewpoint. The fact that he imperioused himself means that he believes everything he says. His total inability to understand love or normal human interaction causes him to see things that everyone else misses. He exemplifies poor decisions well executed. He isn't really evil, so much as too clever for his own good while being totally lacking in empathy and foresight.

    I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think that exploring unusual ways of thinking and viewing the world is useful and relevant to this subreddit, and this fic has a viewpoint I haven't seen in any other piece of fiction. It features unique and interesting thinking, so it belongs here. 

    And of course, it's really funny.

      Harrymort understands love *perfectly*: it sets things on fire.

  One of the funniest HP fanfics I've ever read. Up there with A Black Comedy and Oh God Not Again!

  Is there any way to extract an .epub or .mobi version of stories from the spacebattles forums? I like to read fics offline, and it seems that recently many people keep suggesting stories that are listed only in spacebattles forum.

  I really enjoyed this fic. Although it wasn't rational, the author clearly put a lot of thought into it, and it was hilarious. I got lots of entertainment out of it. There were unique perspectives and I can say I'm glad this was posted. I will not downvote, even though I downvote off-topic non-rational fics I don't like. I'm horribly inconsistent this way.

  Thanks for sharing. I'm only a few paragraphs in and I can already tell that I will enjoy it thoroughly. A few of the quips read sort of Douglas Adams-y, which is quite lovely.
