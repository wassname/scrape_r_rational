  Thanks for another great chapter! I want to congratulate you on something kind of vague: your mood. Pokemon fanfics tend to veer towards hyper dark and gritty in an attempt at drama and realism, or they tend to be a little too optimistic. You strike a balance that is very readable and feels like a very reasonable interpretation of the games. (Okay, I'm having a hard time describing this exactly and hope it makes sense. It's just that I have read a lot of Pokemon fanfic in my day, and your mood seems unique in a positive way.)

    Thank you.  I definitely understand what you mean as I've been turned off by a lot of pokemon fanfic because of this very reason, and the only one I've been able to really enjoy has been Game of Champions, despite its super dark tone. If you have any other recommendations that you feel hits the "mood" right, I'd be happy to hear them :)

  Hey guys, welcome back! First a quick thanks to everyone that's been supporting me on Patreon. I've updated the reward levels, and have gotten enough pledges to start working on my website, and I'm excited to share it with you all when it's done. It'll be a great place to consolidate all my writing and projects, and will include pokemon related things like a FAQ that brings together all the most commonly asked and many private questions about the story's world that I haven't had a chance to answer through the narrative yet.

  Second, I was glad to hear how many people enjoyed the last chapter. It was one of the shining waypoints I've had in my mind for the story for over a year now, and it was good to finally put it on paper, so to speak. Rest assured that it isn't the last we'll see of Mew 2.351, and thanks again for the patience you all have for the story's update schedule. I'm as eager as anyone to share the rest of what I have in mind with you all.

  Thanks for reading, and final note for those following the games... Sun and Moon hype! I'm excited to see what changes they'll bring to the world.

    Speaking of Sun and Moon, people have posited that in the chinese title art there's a [Burst](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Burst) [Heart](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Sun_Version_logo_Ch-tc.png), which may be indicating a new mechanic. I also wanted to bring this to your attention as an author if you weren't already aware of it.

    Regardless, excellent chapter as always!
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Wow, that would be quite a shift for the games to take. I know the anime has been flirting with it, what with Ash and his Greninja doing some weird merging thing. It would also be completely batshit to try to rationalize XD Thanks for pointing that out, not sure whether to be excited or not!
      ```

      - u/Cariyaga:
        ```
        Yeah, I'm excited for it in the games myself. It'd be neat to be able to walk around as your pokemon in the overworld, haha. I can't remember if you've ever said anything on the subject, is mega evolution a thing in the story (or is that spoilers)?
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          Mega Evolution is a thing that I don't think will ever be explored in the scope of the story: I keep having ideas for side stories that I have to cut just to keep the already bloated and super long main narrative from being even longer.

          Who knows, maybe when this is finished and is super popular enough some sequel series might spin off from it and cover those topics. For now though it'll have to stay theoretical.
          ```

          - u/Cariyaga:
            ```
            Hmm. So then, it does exist in the world, just the main characters won't have chance or cause to explore its use?

            That's good to know.
            ```

- u/Cifems:
  ```
  So... pichu's Timid, huh. 

  Are plans to bring the Nature mechanic into your story?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Not as an official, hardwired connection between "stats" and personality, but as a subtle correlational relationship, it's been hypothesized by competitive battlers.
    ```

  Great chapter! 

  I really like your idea for a capture montage, that was an interesting and fun way to go about it without the crazy amount of danger that's usually involved with getting new pokemon.

  Out of curiosity, what do trainers in your universe do when they get more than six pokemon? Do they just keep their best trained 'mon with them or do they carry everything?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thanks, glad you liked it! Usually they keep their best trained pokemon, but other than convenience of carrying ability there's no enforced limit. I always thought that was a silly limitation, and clearly a gaming conceit.
    ```

    - u/TheLeo3314:
      ```
      Cool. Yeah, it makes sense as an in game limitation but other than maybe throwing out the wrong ball by accident in a tight situation there really isn't much reason to not have every resource available.
      ```

      - u/TheThorgram:
        ```
        Now I'm imagining trainers carrying a little SSD in a durable weatherproof case for long term, portable storage of Pokemon.

        "Oh no my main flying type just died and I'm stuck on a mountain, better get the backup bird out"

        I can totally imagine limitations and downsides to this system, as well as lore reasons why this might not work. But the idea just popped into my head.

  "polishing his pokeballs"

  Maybe it's just because I'm in theatre school, but, phrasing?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Nope, definitely not just because of that ;) It gets hard not to wince a bit at the unfortunate phrasing for things like "grabs his pokeballs" or "checks his balls."  Maybe I'll change this instance to "cleans"...
    ```

  Typo thread here!

    When Red first brought her out at the training rooms, Pichu *ent* (should be sent) sparks wildly...

      Fixed!

      > I can't see the traffic it's getting, but there are no comments yet.

      Looks fine to me. Traffic and comments are separate.

      Zubat is listed many times, thats the joke.

      I agree "and ekans" is a typo, should be "an ekans".
      ```

    - u/DaystarEld:

      See /u/DerSaidin's comment :) Last one fixed!

    You misspelled Fuchsia as "Fuschia". 

    Think "fuch-sia".

    From two chapters ago:

    Should be shiftry I think?

      Fixed, thanks! Can't believe I missed that.

    He wonders if Ranger Matt *would* (should be will, as it will happen in the future) see it and note the name *that's* (unecessary, sentence functions just as well without it) on it.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Fixed, thanks!

  I can't believe I forgot about the new chapter! 

  Another good chapter and I have to say I'm glad they seem to have decided against going through the mountain. I'm not sure I could read a whole other chapter about running from zubat. 

  The wigglytuff scenario was another example of the hazards of the Pokemon world that make this fic so interesting. Really sets it apart from the usual fics where it's just the occasional battle against a wild Pokemon.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thanks, glad you enjoyed it! Now that you mention it a chapter of running from zubat sounds hilarious... No, no, bad Daystar! Stick to the plot!
