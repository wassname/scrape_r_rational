  Kind of funny, but a series of updates should be able to push even a low prior around, especially if the evidence is as ~~weird~~ strong as not having a reflection.

  Even if most young men don’t have prostate cancer, if multiple independently derived tests come back positive for it in your 20s, you might want to get treated for prostate cancer.

    True for most things, though the priors for being a blood-drinking, physics-breaking, sun-fearing monster should maybe be a bit lower than that. Like, I'd personally check myself into a mental hospital before I started biting people for their delicious red juice. But maybe that's just me.
    ```

    - u/Chimerasame:

      I feel like being absent in a mirror would be huge enough to at least make me want to take steps before committing myself to a facility like that. If I'm actually a vampire, being imprisoned somewhere they might, yknow, make me go for a walk in the sun with the therapy group... might be pretty bad.

      There are a few people to whom I'd feel safe looking in a mirror with and asking what they notice. If other people start agreeing I don't have a reflection, that's a big dent in the 'caused by mental illness' theory (since it'd mean I'd have to be hallucinating all their reactions?)

      Do religious symbols burn me? If so, can check -- wood cross, wood block, metal cross, metal tool. This can also be independently observed -- does the burning follow the shape, and not the material?

      I can see not being able to tell if you keep it to yourself, but like being open to a couple other people and getting corroborations could be at least enough to tell, "whatever the issue is, it's not something which would be solved by any conventional means like a mental hospital"... and probably just continue behaving like the best mix of my existing ethics and my new cravings. I'd \*hope\* I could subsist on blood not harvested from killing real humans...
      ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        Presumably whatever schizophrenia you've got can simulate all those things. If you expect to be burned then you'll feel like you're burning
        ```

        - u/Chimerasame:
          ```
          I get the "feeling" thing, but that's why I'm saying I'd include other people too. They can \*see\* burns. They can apply a cross-or-other-shape to a part of my skin where I'm not even looking, and I have few enough nerve endings that I can't feel what shape it is. They could observe whether it burns my skin or not.

          I don't doubt it's remotely conceivable that I could suddenly develop a high degree of some hallucination-causing disorder, but if I can't trust my senses' interpretation of the trustworthy people close to me giving me feedback about what they're seeing about me, why would I trust my senses' interpretation of the people at a mental hospital?

          How about this, me and a loved one schedule a consultation meeting at some third-party institution that would be objective in a way equivalent to how a mental institution would be, and we include \*them\* in the tests, and gauge \*their\* responses. This is risky because if I'm a vampire it outs me, but at least it should satisfy the notion of... "simulation, if it is that, is sufficiently detailed that a mental hospital would likely not break it either".

          (Or at least, "simulation, if it is that, is sufficiently intent on me believing it, including fabricating entire situations with other people, that it would likely not \_let\_ me go to a mental hospital to break myself of it, i.e. if i try, it would just keep working in there, or it would direct me to a hallucination of a mental hospital")
          ```

          - u/RMcD94:
            ```
            The best point against the delusion is definitely that if it is that powerful then you can't be sure about mental institutions.

            So then you might as well do what you want
            ```

          Ultimately all we are is brains that receive external input, and really, if we start having reason to doubt those inputs, we have nothing to hang onto. Pretty much any physics-defying observed outcome will have a lower prior probability in our mind than simply "I'm in a coma and dreaming all of this". The funny thing is, of course, our prior that the world *ought* to obey physics is rooted in our *previous* experience, and it's not like we have a 100% sure way to know that was real and not the actual illusion... see the Matrix proposed scene in HPMOR. "There is no such thing as a real physics book. The world doesn't run on math."

          But that's why you get a bunch of similarly sized holy symbols and non-holy symbols that are made of the same material, jumble them up, and then feel them out blindly. If you could successfully separate out crosses from other shapes by simply touching them (let's say with one finger to avoid actually being able to feel out the whole shape) then that's pretty significant evidence.
          ```

      - u/meterion:
        ```
        I think you'd be able to tell if you're a vampire with extremely high confidence without anyone finding out by exploiting the mirror thing. Either that, or be confident that you are delusional on a fundamental level and probably can't even trust yourself to call for help.

        Basically, all you need to do is find a random number generator online that you can use on your phone, then look into a mirror with the phone placed behind your head so you can see it through your head. Use the RNG (preferably at least 10 digits long) and write it down, then take a screenshot of the site and a photo of your result. Now all you need to do is find someone to ask if they're the same number.
        ```

        - u/BoojumG:
          ```
          I wouldn't trust this procedure unless someone else observed the entire process, and at that point they might as well just independently verify what's happening with the reflection. If the danger is that I'm delusional about what I see in a mirror, I can't trust my own memory or judgment that I'm sticking to this procedure carefully either.
          ```

          - u/meterion:
            ```
            That's a fair conclusion, but at that point I think any test independent or not becomes pointless because if you can't trust your immediate perception of what you are doing to not cheat at the test, then I don't think you can rightly trust yourself that you'll properly hear the conclusion of whoever you brought in, or that you even brought anyone at all and aren't drooling on the ground.
            ```

      ```
      If I have a delusion that’s so complete that it even consistently defines “winning” and “losing” in the sense that Lesswrong uses the terms - so complete that I can’t even detect knock-on effects of being wrong - that’s the world I’m living in now.  It’s as real as anything.

      In any other case I believe I can test the truth out of the delusion, or at least realize that there’s no consistent hypothesis other than being deluded, and it’ll have strong support instead of just being some sort of waterline below which any weirder belief is less likely than it.

      Having dealt with some issues of perception myself, it doesn’t leave you sure.  It leaves you panicked and confused, lashing out.  There’s a whole lot of evidence beyond “this isn’t what I used to believe, but so hard that I mUsT bE cRaZy”

      If you calmly and methodically prove something “impossible”, you’re probably not crazy.  There’s something else going on.  That’s just not how mental illness works.

      I think EY’s insistance that you should question your own sanity even when you’re not deeply confused comes from a lack of familiarity with real mental illness.

      His Dark Lords of the Matrix that can give you fully immersive, consistent delusions where you can prove something that’s actually wrong, experience consistent knock-on effects all the way down the chain, and be fully unconfused about it?

      They’re less likely to be real than vampires.

      Your brain coincidentally acting like that without it being painstakingly and intentionally set up, just by random chance, when there’s no precedent for that sort of mental illness?  Every neuron independently being exactly setup wrong to create a fully realized and consistent world of perception that isn’t real and suggests exactly everything you expect from reality, plus vampires, without leaving you with the confusion and panic that comes with getting the conflicting and confusing perceptual input of schizophrenia?

      Probably also less likely than vampires.

        I've gone back and forth on this one. Having any psychotic break that gives you clear symptoms you can and are able to test isn't how any mental disorder I know of works, so I'm guessing it's basically impossible. You could try to add in drugs and PTSD from the neck bite but I don't think that helps. So is it more impossible you've developed an extreme novel mental disorder or that some nutjob biting you has turned you into a supernatural creature?

        We have plenty of examples of people 100% disconnected from reality by mental disorders and absolutely nothing supporting vampires so insanity is more likely. The most probable cause to me is that you're in a coma from the bite/attack and that influenced you to dream about being a vampire. The most dangerous case is that you're awake with this all consuming mental disorder, and if you let yourself act on any of it you're going to eventually be drinking blood.

        - u/lolbifrons:

          The thing is, the people who believe they’re vampires and act like it aren’t exactly investigating their situation with rigor.

          I suspect if they genuinely, with well-practiced rational techniques, attempted to investigate the nature of their situation, there would be clues that they’re wrong that even they could pick up on.

          Their delusion prevents them from doing that.  It prevents them from feeling the need to do that.

          What it doesn’t do is give them a consistently wrong, convincing and unconfusing world when they try.  It plays off easy biases and uncertainty and tendency to conveniently ignore contradicting perceptions.

        - u/NasalJack:
          ```
          I think yes, I'd be more likely to think I'm a vampire than that I'm suffering from a mental illness that doesn't appear to have any affect on my regular cognitive functioning beyond altering my perceptions seemingly exclusively to make it seem to myself like I'm a vampire.

  I don't understand how this is rational. There's a point at which he's still incredibly sceptical, but the probability of being a vampire multiplied by the penalty of turning to ash is higher than the penalty of looking stupid covering yourself up from the sun.

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    To be fair, by the point you're outside and being dissolved by the sun it's a little late to finally realize that it kills you, especially since the sun being deadly to vampires is a very modern invention. In older stories, like Dracula, the sun merely reduces his powers. Plus this is a comedy strip so.

      The mirror would've been enough. I'd have put a piece of paper on the wall behind me and then stood entirely in front of the mirror and seen if it was reflected. Then changed the angle to make sure it wasn't reflecting off something else, first. Then tried the same with a painstakingly polished flat object to make sure that it's actually a mirror…

      Because confusion suggests something's wrong.

        If that sort of thing actually worked, then as a new vampire, I would have ordered or made sunglasses with small pieces of a mirror attached to the bottom half of the lens on the side facing my eyes. That way, when walking around I can see directly behind myself at all times.

        The death rates of vampires are particularly high within the first century you know!

        At that point I would've gone to a mental hospital, assuming brain damage before vampire. Human vision fills in and cuts out a lot of stuff already.

          So would I. But, just in case, I would take precautions whilst getting myself there. If my ability to reason is impaired, I'm taking as many precautions as possible.

              Though, seriously. How does no reflection work? Honestly, I'd probably just order lasers online and sit around running experiments and posting them online until I'd proven it inconsistent (and therefore almost certainly the result of a delusion) or figured out the rules.

  The "am I actually a monster or just crazy" angle though applied to someone who is using statistical reasoning to assess the answer could be positively gripping. It'd still be a weird, dry movie, something like "Primer" with very little mainstream appeal, but it'd make for one hell of an intimate, claustrophobic psychological thriller/horror.

  This kinda reminds me of when that guy came on the subreddit (I think in one of the Worth the Candle comment threads) and talked about cognitohazards (or something along the lines of that word; I can never remember which is which). They talked about how one existed that actually hurt, and was PMing it to people who asked. (An example of a mildly annoying one is that you're now consciously breathing, blinking, and aware of where your tongue is in your mouth.)

  Someone said something like rationalists would kill themselves over a real anomalous cognitohazard because they'd all try to see its effects, like touching a stove to see if it's hot.

  It wouldn't go like that. In a world where vampires existed, there would be abundant historic evidence for vampires, and a victim would correspondingly assign more likelihood to that explanation. It would be practically impossible to keep vampires a secret for centuries.
