  Hopefully next time Forwin's first thought in this situation is "Am I willing to stake my life on the assumption that this person is a complete moron?".

  Sometimes people are just stupid, but it's worth being *really* sure they're stupid if you're gambling with your life.

    Exactly. Sometimes the enemy isn't as stupid as he seems.
    ```

  Even before he was introduced to the true probabilities, Forwin should at least have realised that after revealing one goblet, the corporal's odds jumped to a minimum of 50/50. Not worth staking your life on.
  ```

- u/AugSphere:
  ```
  Wait, best of ten? Surely you must mean some odd number like nine or eleven?

  Liked it overall, though.

    An odd number would make more sense to avoid a draw, wouldn't it.
    Hmm. Thanks.
    ```

      I've always thought that "best of X" was a strange way to specify the format. "First to (X+1)/2 victories" seems way more obvious. Best-or-three becomes "first to reach two victories", best-of-five "first to three" and so on. It's functionally closer to how the games are usually played as well. Most of the time a "best of X" series doesn't actually involve X games, but rather goes on until one side accumulates enough victories.
      ```

  He'd have a 7.7% chance of losing if his 2/3 estimate was correct, which increases to a 12.2% chance if they play a single round tiebreaker in the event of a 5-5 tie. 

  That's like playing Russian roulette with 1 bullet and 13 chambers (or 8 chambers).

  I suppose that this is roughly in line with what "almost certainly" typically means.

  > But Forwin *couldn’t* lose, could he? The odds of the corporal guessing the correct goblet was only one in three, and the corporal would almost certainly lose to those odds if the game was played ten times in a row.
  ```

    I realise this isn't the point of the discussion, but I'm still curious how you got the 7.7% chance.

    I'm getting 14.5% by evaluating the survival function of the negative binomial distro (for five successes with 2/3 success chance) at 4.
    ```

    - u/keeper52:
      ```
      It's 14.5% for best out of 9 (or first to 5), and 12.2% for best out of 11 (or first to 6).

      7.7% is the chance of losing 6 or more out of 10 rounds. There is also a 13.7% chance of a 5-5 tie, which could count as a push where no one loses or could be broken by playing one more round (which makes the game equivalent to best out of 11 or first to 6).
      ```

      - u/AugSphere:
        ```
        It's awesome that neither of us was actually wrong and we were just working with different scenarios. It also handily demonstrates my point that "best of ten" is a very ambiguous way to specify the format.
        ```

  ```
  That was fun, I'd definitely read more in this setting/style.
  ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  Well done! This would make for a fun event in an RPG :) Hope to see more from you, if you do others like this! (or even not)
  ```

  - u/VanPeer:
    ```
    Thanks for the encouragement. That keeps me writing.
    ```

- u/AugSphere:

  Now that everyone has overcome the hurdle of Monty Hall, the next step is to achieve intuitive understanding of the [sock dresser](https://arbital.com/p/sockdresser_search/) and unravel the [mysteries of hope](https://www.gwern.net/docs/statistics/1994-falk).
  ```

  - u/VanPeer:
    ```
    Thanks for the links. I'm intrigued.
