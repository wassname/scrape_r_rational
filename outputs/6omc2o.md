## Any recomended audio books?

### Post:

I do a lot of driving and the radio stations are pretty bad so I was wondering if anyone had any audio book recomendations.
Iv'e allready read/lisend to HPMOR. Obviously any rational audio books are best but any other ideas would be good too.
Thanks

  Have you read/listened to Metropolitan Man? The same person who did HPMOR's podcast did it it too:

  Also, its author Alexander Wales and I have recommended maybe 20 audio books throughout our podcast:

  http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/

  If you click on any given episode starting from 10, you'll probably find an audio book recommendation at the bottom of the page, with an explanation of why it's recommended at the end of the episode in like the last 3 minutes (in the later ones I started putting transcripts of the recommendations onto the webpage).

  One of my personal favorites is The Dresden Files, an urban fantasy series which is narrated exceptionally well by James Marsters. The story develops some great world building, magic systems, and characters as it goes, each book pretty much always getting better than the last.  Storm Front is the first book, if you want to check it out :)

  Worm is fairly rational, and the podcast version is done and free.

    Thanks for the advice, just finished listening to the worm audio book and thoroughly enjoyed it, and the timings great with the 2nd story in the series starting up

      Well damn, it sure feels nice when someone likes my recommendation. Thanks for getting back to me.

  What genres do you like? I mean I could recommend a whole bunch of fantasy only for it to turn out that's not your cup of tea. First thing that jumps to mind is a sci-fi book called UBIK by Phillip k Dick
  ```

  - u/BadSpeiling:
    ```
    Both fantasy and scifi are good
    ```

      In no particular order:

      Lord of light - roger Zalazny 

      Sci-fi intertwined with Hinduism. 


      Dune - Frank Herbert 

      Definite classic, hard sci-fi. 


      Nine princess in amber - Roger Zelazny

      Fantasy, the audio book are just great, with sound effects and everything. 


      Enders Game - Orson Scott Card

      First place in sci-fi top 100, terrible movie. 


      The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy - Douglas Adams 

      Sort of anti-rational sci-fi, very funny. 



      The quantum thief - Hannu Rajaniemi

      Transhumanist sci-fi, unpronounceable author. 


      And if you've got half a year of your life to throw around, I'd recommend the wheel of time series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. It is truly an epic, and one of the best series I've read to date. But with fourteen thick books in the series quite a commitment.

  Basically any commercially published book nowadays is also available in audio, so looking through an old rational-books recommendation thread should work. My personal first recommendation for traditionally published ratfic is always Blindsight, by Peter Watts.

  Starship Troopers. It's a magnitude above the movie and manages to portray the society well without coming across as propaganda *or* parody. It also gets geeky detailed a few times, and I really like it. It's the only thing I've read/listened to that managed to make power armour sound interesting and realistic.

  Also the narrator for the audiobook is *so* good.

    I listened to this and loved it, thanks for the recomendation
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      That's great!

  ```
  If you're not too picky about vocal quality, you can use a text-to-speech program on a text file and get any ebook as an audio book.

  This is what I do for the vast majority of text I consume.
