  Serious question: can someone explain to me what it is that people hate so much about the Shino / Hinata pairing? I have literally lost count of the number of snotty reviews and FFN messages I've gotten since this story started, all of which boil down to "this better not be S/H or I'm not going to read it!"

  EDIT:  I was bored, so I went back and counted.  Something like 3% of the reviews are some version of 'I hate the ShinoHina!!1!1!!'  There's a whole bunch more that are polite but address the same issue -- asking if that's what it's going to be, saying that they were hoping for "NaruHina", saying that they aren't fond of "ShinoHina", or whatever.  I didn't count the ones in PM, of which there have been a bunch.

  And then, of course, there's the guy who wrote to say "I just want to know where you're going with this?"  *blink*  That's like saying "hey, can you tell me what the last page will be?"

    Just...man, just ignore it. You read too much fan fiction, and *things* happen to you. I read a book the other day. It was refreshing, like champagne after a month of swigging moonshine. *Don't let it get to you. Those people have been swilling strange and terrible things through their brains.*

      Thanks. :>

      It doesn't bother me that much, but it does utterly baffle me. I was hoping that maybe there was an actual reason for it, aside from "I have inflexible tastes and expect them to be catered to!"

        No, that's likely the answer. They have a specific pairing in their head and get grumpy when a fanfic sets the characters up in another manner. Personally, I don't really care about pairings, beyond them being well written. If the relationship is developed naturally and written well, I'll read and enjoy the thing, regardless of the characters being paired.

        It's a Green vs Blue situation. 

        Pairings online are like politics or sports teams, and so are *spiders* in a very significant way. Whole sites will support one or another, argue for thousands of posts that 'X should be with Y because Z', and write enormous counterarguments based on any number of different reasons to support their own position.

        And like politics and sports, they snipe each other. They snipe constantly. Anytime anything shows up in the series itself that favors one over another (say before a relationship is resolved) they argue over what it means and attack the worse off side.

        The trope term is [**Ship to Ship Combat**](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat), and it's a real thing.

        As such, many supporters of X pairing (usually a portmanteau of the two names of the characters, Naruto and Hinata pairings are colloquially called 'NaruHina' for example) are used to people who write or express a desire for another pairing being direct ideological opponents, who would love to attack them. They therefore preemptively lash out. 

        It's a **lot** like politics actually. And of course, some of them are insecure, and identify with their position as a major facet of their personality, and so they attack even harder and quicker at any perceived threat.

        I feel like there's a sociology study to be had here, but I've yet to secure funding.

          *laugh* I don't know where I would use that, but do you mind if I use it?

    Naruto x Hinata is the second-most popular pairing after NarutoSasuke, so putting Hinata, Naruto, and Shino on a team and then pairing HinataShino is like tricking people.

    And the people you're tricking are on the internet. And crazy.

  Nice little chat between Kurama and Naruto, and it was interesting to see the prison is shaped differently to canon. Glad you didn't use the 'kit' thing common in fanfic, or make the Biiju female or something.

  And we also got the reveal of what 'the plan' finally is, between the two non-hospitalized Genin and Anko. Seems the idea is for the teacher to be so harsh in training the students for them to attempt defection, presumably in a ploy. As a side-effect it's likely going to beat any problematic habits out of Hinata.

  ...I begin to suspect Hinata and Shino are forming a romantic relationship, actually. A crush, certainly.

  Longest chapter yet; enjoy.

- u/Cariyaga:

  Oh, I quite enjoyed this. I especially enjoyed Kurama's characterization. I've always rather enjoyed the role he plays in Naruto fanfiction, especially in a less antagonistic role. Hopefully we'll see more of him!
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Absolutely!  He's too much fun not to.  I was already [reading up on him](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kurama) and noticed something that I haven't seen alluded to in fanfiction before, so I'm very excited about getting to (maybe) be the first to use it.  [Specifically, it's ](#s "something I'm not going to reveal yet. ;>")

      Personally, I've always been confused that Kurama doesn't have 25 Charisma. You'd think a Thousand-Year Old Fox would be a bit more... *clever* at getting what it wants from its host.

      (Or just at getting the host to let it out of the box. Maybe the seal uses some of the bijuu's own power to run a communication-result simulator, and block any thought-messages from the guest that would lead to the host releasing the guest?)

  Yay, more Shino x Hinata :)

  Great scenes with Anko feigning callous indifference. She finally has the excuse to take the gloves off.

  And Naruto/Kyuubi was way better than what I remember from the anime when they first meet -- the Fox is actually an interesting character. Lots of posturing and so on, but they manage to haggle their way down to a position of mutual respect, and I guess Naruto's superpower of getting people to like him is coming in handy.

    Thank you.

    Writing the Anko scenes was almost physically painful.  She hates doing this, and it's hurting her emotionally about as much as it's hurting Hinata.  Next chapter, her first scene will be her crying herself to sleep.

    Kurama, on the other hand, I loved writing.  Big Tough Nasty, but utterly baffled at this little monkey-thing that wants to be friends?  That was so much fun.  Don't worry, there will definitely be more of him...just like there will be at least a little more of Hashimoto.  I'll be a little sorry when Naruto gets out of the hospital and I don't have an excuse to put Hashimoto on stage, but it's time to get Naruto back in the action.

  For what it's worth personally at least the kurama scene was breaking my suspension of disbelief\characterization\rationality.
  its too much effort to break it into which part specifically, but it just seemed awkward to me..

  it might not be too important as long as it will be stay consistent in the future, and the chapter generally was still an interesting read, but it felt somewhat forced..
  like it sometimes feels when a fanfic wants a character to behave in a certain way and is hurrying there, so the transition between the pure cannon and fiction is not as smooth. anyhow as i mentioned its too much effort to be more introspective then this to point what specifically felt odd to me, hope this helps, or maybe it only felt that way to me so you can ignore it..

    I'm afraid "something was wrong" actually doesn't help; if you can figure it out, please let me know what you thought was wrong.

      I would agree. It was... trite, for lack of a better word. Kurama totally failed to impress me as the ancient demigod he's supposed to be -- this chapter, the very first time we meet him, makes him sound whiny and insecure. Stuff like word choice and the simple fact that his attitude turns on a dime. Naruto does *one* nice thing and the creature wants to be buddies?

      You came close with the "I'll be trapped for a hundred years; you'll just be dead" line, but every other piece of dialogue was predictable. Your version of Neklos in tTYE was scary, but Kurama is kinda lame.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Hm. Okay, I can understand what you're seeing. Thanks for the tip; I'll see what I can do in future scenes.
        ```

  Wait, Naruto's treewalking stunt actually did significant damage to Kyuubi?  *What?*  Either my mental image of the exponential cost of treewalking was way off, or the chakra that techniques take is weirdly balanced, because I was not picturing that treewalk taking massively more chakra than an overcharged bijudama.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I've actually got a mathematical definiton for all the chakra things that I've used so far; it lets me keep track of who can do what and how often. 

    Yes, the amount of chakra that trick used was *absurd*.  The Bijuu are immensely powerful, but there are still limits. When you stray into 10 digits, even the Nine-Tails needs to stop and reconsider his life choices. 

    EDIT: fixed incorrect counting of digits.

  ```
  How come Hinata didn't spot Anko before they arrived back at the cottage? I thought she was keeping the Byakugan on at all times while they were in Sound, or was I mistaken about that? I would have expected either her or Shino to detect Anko's presence first and at least attempt to come up with a plan to get into the cottage without being detected.
