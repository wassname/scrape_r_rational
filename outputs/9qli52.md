  I enjoyed the chapter.  I just wonder how everyone thinks Delphic was able to surveil the interior of the holdout building if there weren't monitoring devices he could have theoretically suborned.

  It feels like his direct and continued assistance in this matter could have been a significant flaw in his concealment.  Pointing out their location, sure, he could have traced them there any number of ways.  Views on the interior?

  I think the average chapter length in this sub has me spoiled. I feel like Delphic chapters are a lot shorter than I want them to be.

    Writing is *tough*. Between finding the right words, keeping a good pace, researching, and staying consistant, it can take a lot of time getting chapters out.

  ```
  Anyone else think that LL is working an angle here, and that the earlier plot was a red herring to make delphic think that he'd foiled them? IMO she's trying to pin all the blame thats about to be thrown on to delphic or something like that.
