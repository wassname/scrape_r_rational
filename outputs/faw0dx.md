## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  [Baldur's Gate 3 gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrIxrFqSbHQ) has been revealed yesterday and some part of the fandom is bummed it is Turn Based instead of Real Time with Pause like the original games. What is your preference in this regard with RPGs where each of the party members have dozens of skills and spells? Should a video game try to simulate the tabletop game its system is based on or rather go its own way?

  Also, when are we gonna get the LitRPG: The Game where an average nerdy teen, who memorized Wikipedia and also deeply knowledgeable in medieval war strategy and siege engine construction, gets stranded on a gritty fantasy world desperately in need of a saver, filled with extremely beautiful women of every kind, each of whom find him irresistible in their own unique way?

    As a fan of the Infinity Engine games (BG1&2, PS:T, IWD) and Larian's games, I think this is a good change.

    We've got a variety of Real-Time-With-Pause and none of them have great combat.  Since Divinity Original Sin 2 (Larian's previous game) came out, we've seen a number of high profile isometric RPGs in the form of Pillars of Eternity 2, Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Torment:Tides of Numenara, and Tyranny.  None of them have good combat.  Pillars2 is probably the best of the bunch, and it's RTWP combat isn't even as good as the turn based mode they slapped onto it after launch.  

    The original series really doesn't capture D&D and frankly *can't* capture 5e, where combat is drastically more complex than 2nd edition.  Infinity Engine Baldur's Gate games aren't exactly interactive either.  They involve right clicking on an enemy and occasionally casting a spell... or pausing at the end of every turn anyways and effectively turning it into a turn based game manually.  

    5e has a lot more stuff.  Every class has multiple special actions to do each round, and you need to control multiple characters.  There's no way to do that with RTWP (unless you invest heavily into AI and allow the player to program it, eg Dragon Age Origins).  Even simple things like having an archer do a fall back action while shooting the enemy are practically infeasible without turn-based combat.  

    I copying the tabletop is not important to me.  I think turn based is the better solution for the system entirely regardless of it being accurate to the tabletop, and it's just a bonus that it's also accurate to the tabletop.
    ```

    - u/the_terran:
      ```
      Well, what are some turn-based games with good combat then? My concern with turn based is that combat will take too long when there are a lot of enemies and frankly be immersion-breaking. How would a fight with dozens of enemies work without turning into a slog?

      \>Every class has multiple special actions to do each round, and you need to control multiple characters. There's no way to do that with RTWP

      How is this any different than BG2? Can't Larian take any liberties when adapting 5e? They cut and modified a lot of AD&D stuff when making the original games.
      ```

      - u/xachariah:
        ```
        Larian's own Divinity Original Sin 2 is the gold standard of turn based games.  Presumably their success with that game is *why* they were tapped for Baldur's Gate 3.  If we're branching outside of cRPGs, then top current turn based combat games are probably XCOM2/Battletech/SlaytheSpire/IntotheBreach/40k:Mechanicus(sorta), none of which could be even remotely adapted to D&D.  

        Regarding time, D&D is very decisive.  Even BG1&2.  A single successful sleep spell will just *end* a combat.  Larian is very well suited to this, because they're one of the few teams that allow you to actually decide combats this way.  In D:OS2, you can run into a number of combats that you're allowed to trivialize if you have a particular build that works well.  Meanwhile they don't force you into trash encounters; every combat is a lethal one to some kind of build.  Contrast to Pillars of Eternity 2 or Pathfinder Kingmaker, where they both toss in a bunch of minor encounters as well as make most nontrivial fights involve golem/elemental-magicimmune-bullshit monsters so that you're forced to slog through.  (I would also like to note that all of those successful turn based games are generally also very decisive as well.)

        As for dozens of combatants, neither D&D nor turn based isn't particularly well suited for large combats, so the simple answer is that you either don't or you use AOE.  Frozen Synapse can pull it off in a turn based system, but that's not a great plan.  

        -----

        First, it's different than BG2 in that by midgame every character will by using multiple abilities per turn and moving, and they'll all be making meaningful combat decisions.  In BG2, each character can basically stand still and cast once a round most of the time.  

        Second, even BG2 fell apart as a real-time-with-pause game.  Its combat is not great.  In any sort of non-trivial encounter you *have* to automatically pause as soon as combat starts.  Then you automatically pause every time you finish a spell.  Then you automatically pause whenever you're hit with a spell or ability.  Then you automatically pause whenever a target dies so you can retarget.  

        That's just turn based with extra steps.

    I don't have a problem with the combat, but I am pretty wary of the weird past tense "summary" dialogue that they've gone with.
    ```

    - u/the_terran:
      ```
      I was hoping them to be placeholders but apparently they are Larian's gimmick. I will try to look over them unless they are the shitty generic dialogue everywhere:

      1. Correct answer that progresses plot
      2. Same as 1 but with snark
      3. Start combat
      ```

      - u/legendofdrag:
        ```
        I *think* the intention is to better represent a tabletop experience, but it does remove a lot of the nuance that existed in older crpg dialogue. 


        My hope is that a lot of that is instead replaced with contextual actions/events based on actions you've taken instead and that this is a compromise to making that work and not just a weird gimmick that gets tiring.

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Isn't it relatively easy to add Real Time with Pause to a turn based game? It just needs you to be able to queue multiple orders and have a "turn passes every x seconds" added in?

    LitRPG: The Game sounds fantastic, just include a in game copy of Wikipedia(with only medieval pages) and a spreadsheet!
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      The short answer is not without it being janky.  Obsidian Entertainment devs talked about how it's not at all a simple change when they added a turn-based option to POE2 from a previous Real-Time-With-Pause system.

      Take for example a rogue doing a falling retreat against a number of foes.  In turn based, each turn he throw a dagger at an enemy with his right hand (combat action), scatters some caltrops with his left hand (bonus action), and all while falling back from the enemy as far as he can move (move action).  In RTWP you'd have to have some kind of parallel queue system where you track each hand independently or have it pause at literally every action meaning it takes even longer than turn based would.  

      Balance and encounter design gets totally shuffled too.  Imagine an enemy mage casting sleep twice, then slitting your party's throats while they can't fight back.  That's fine in turn based because you can react, but unplayable in real-time-with-pause because it's an instawipe if you fail to pause within 6 seconds.

    Thanks for linking that video. I had no idea that BG3 was in the works. I have to say, it feels really weird to see a melding of the isometric perspective and art design from the Divinity games with a more over-the-shoulder style gameplay.

    In my experience, the downside of 'real time with pause' is that it's more difficult/annoying to precisely time reactions to enemy attacks, maximize buff or CC duration, etc. I'd only prefer that system in cases when combat isn't challenging enough to encourage micromanaging strategy.

    I've played isometric RPGs with each type of turn-based combat, and in my opinion either method can be fun as long as the difficulty/complexity is balanced well enough to match.

    Eh, it's Larian, so the combat will be excellent either way. I'm more worried about the story and the dialogue.

    Zetsuen no Tempest is probably the most rat-adj anime I've watched.

    I can second Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as just generally having solid worldbuilding and well-motivated characters.
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Ghost In The Shell, Psycho-Pass, and Shinsekai Yori all have cohesive worldbuilding and deal with themes that are popular here. Kino's Journey has an inconsistent (from episode to episode) but thought provoking world. Spice And Wolf is just economics and a slow romance plot. The Devil Is A Part Timer is primarily a comedy but derives a lot of its humor from characters handling its absurd premise like responsible, reasonable people.

    Log Horizon I've heard is pretty rational.

    - u/Amargosamountain:
      ```
      So I gave this one a go… I see why you recommended it. The way they do battles and combine powers *is* nicely rational. I turned it off after episode 7 though, because as good as some aspects are, I can't get over how being suddenly trapped in a video game isn't setting off an existential crisis in most players. It's like none of them even care that they're trapped in a video game, they don't even discuss the idea of trying to find a way out! When I turned it off they were only just beginning to think long-term. It's not *completely* unbelievable, but enough for me.

      Still, thanks for the suggestion! LH wasn't even on my radar before now.

    CDC says:

    > It’s important to note that current global circumstances suggest **it is likely that this virus will cause a pandemic**. *[edited for emphasis]*

    That text is buried partway down their [situation summary](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html) page. They also say, "For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low." They don't talk about individual preparation, and to say a pandemic is likely but individual risk is *at this time* low -- it's a bit of a mixed message(!).

    So, I've got a partner coming to visit me in Australia from France for the month of March via Singapore. Currently there are no cases in my entire Texas-sized state except for two people who caught it on a cruise ship and were evacuated back to their home state and have been in isolation the whole time. 

    Singapore has a lot of cases, 'tis true, but if you can get it in Singapore airport then my city is doomed because we have planefuls of people going back and forth there several times a day. 

    I'm wondering what chances there will be of, in the next month, travel restrictions preventing him from leaving / preventing him from arriving home (as it is, his business would require him to work from home for 2 weeks as a precaution if he returned today, because of the Singapore transit). I wonder how that will interfere with immigration (if it's Huge Isolation Deal, I'm assuming there'd be some sort of waiver for people forced to overstay their visas, but perhaps I'm giving governments everywhere too much credit). 

    I'm hoping this will turn out like Swine Flu - a Big Deal, but not changing the fabric of society. It's really surreal, it feels like being part of a movie or TV show at the early part before the plague kills everyone. I'm hopeful, though, because even though it's probably going to spread almost everywhere (my city's relative global isolation, though significantly smaller isolation from China, only gives me hope that we can avoid it until treatment/vaccine comes out), the death rate is low, especially among young healthy people like me. 

    In terms of prepping we've purchased extra beans, pasta and rice. We have a comically overstocked pantry at the best of times and I think we could probably feed the four of us for a month, maybe two, if it came to that. I'm content with this because at the point where home quarantine for more than two months becomes advisable, or food becomes that scarce, the government is going to need to do something / we're all going to be living Mad Max stylez. 

    I don't know what else I can really do that isn't completely misguided. I'm not stockpiling water (we need way too much for that to be practical). I don't think medication or medical equipment is going to be much help to me. I don't *want* weapons in my house and even pepper spray is a mission to acquire here.

    So, I'm just sitting here hoping that some extra beans in my pantry will make my apocalypse more pleasant, which also feels misguided.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      A Mad Max scenario seems very unlikely. It's a bad illness, but Spanish flu was worse, and society kept on trucking.
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        So then what can we really do to prep apart from buy food?
        ```

        - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
          ```
          On the premise that this can't really be avoided, the main thing seems to be to avoid getting sick when everyone else is sick. At peak infection health care systems are likely to be overcrowded even in rich countires, which spikes death rates. 

          Getting sick early guarantues you hospital care and you roll the die for your age/predisposition class. Older people are more likely to die and any of [around 6.0% for people with cancer, hypertension or chronic respiratory disease, 7.3% for those with diabetes and 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease]. Robin Hanson over on overcomingbias even argues weakly for intentional early infection!    Unfortunately early infection does not guarantuee immunity, the data is still out on that. (one patient tested positive weeks after their first bout of the illness). 

          Early infection is to be evaluated against late infection, on the tail end of distribution. You should be able to get hospital care after peak infection (expanded capabilites as in China) and much more will be known about the disease. 

          To me it seems like european governments are massively underreacting.

    If we consider that the 'source material' is itself so incredibly racist it inspires an Apartheid state to this day, I'd say UNSONG deals with race quite well.

    And I'd argue Malia Ngo is a Kabbalistic representation of the American Dream. She was born in the platonic ideal of rough neighborhoods to a mother too tortured to care for her properly and an unknown father. The neighborhood itself was patrolled by untrustworthy, violent 'people' with the backing of a government built to oppress her mother and everyone like her. She had to learn to take care of herself from a young age, because nobody else would. Despite this, she had a lucky break and managed to escape the bad neighborhood, and parleyed this success into more and more power, until she stood at the head of the most powerful organization on the planet. An organization specifically designed to collect weapons to use against the government which had oppressed her.

  Some amateur mental exercises I've been working with finally paid off.

  Last night, after some miscellaneous odd experiences, I found myself in an office/cubicle setting, starting a few discussions amongst a group of a half-dozen or so about how our various plans should change given that the laws of physics were a bit looser than they used to be, as demonstrated by such details as several of the group being furries, and that I could levitate by standing, and folding my legs crosslegged without my head getting any lower. Some points raised included that trying to base a plan on QALYs had all sorts of problems, and not just because of how hard they were to measure, but they could serve as a placeholder until someone came up with a better approach; which new tricks any of us could now do provided enough value that we should start leveraging them immediately, and which other members of the office we should yoink from their current projects; and whether to spin off a separate group to investigate whether tropes and narrative had any measurable force.

  Then things started getting a bit hazy, somebody shouted "Red King! It's a Red King scenario, everyone!", and one of my group (a red-haired, horse-headed woman) ran up to me, grabbed my upper arms and looked into my eyes, and ordered me, "Remember as much as you can."

  Afterwards, I found myself pleased that I've finally absorbed the concept of "I notice that I am confused", and making regular checks of reality's reality-ness, sufficiently to start applying them even when I'm asleep. I'm looking forward to tonight with a certain amount of hope that last night wasn't a one-off.

    > I'm looking forward to tonight with a certain amount of hope that last night wasn't a one-off.

    Welp, the only part of my dream which was coherent enough for a narrative centred around the concept "I only need one more course to graduate", and for which the most exotic detail was "The school now offers a course-stream which is designed to lead toward's a pilot's license"; which, while certainly unexpected enough to be surprising, didn't manage to trigger my "am I in reality?" reflex.

    Given how little effort is required for my current version of reality-testing - call it half a minute - then despite its lack of sensitivity, maybe I should work more on remembering to give it a try whenever I'm surprised by even seemingly-mundane new info.

    - u/DataPacRat:
      ```
      A partial, but encouraging, success last night. In a dream set in a Groundhog Day time-loop scenario, involving trying to improve physics simulations of the long-term fate of the universe (in which I happened to know of an important theoretical prediction that doesn't shop up in most of the standard, or even well-known non-standard, theories), I was able to come up with the idea "If narrativium has the force of physical law, which tropes are currently in play?", realize, "Oh, I'm the /an/tagonist," adjust my behaviour to take advantage of some of the relevant tropes (without actually crossing the line into villainy), and get much better results.

      I didn't figure out that I was dreaming; I was too focused on the time-loop thing. But it's more self-awareness than I generally manage to achieve, so I'm willing to call it progress in the right direction.
