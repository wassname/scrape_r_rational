## Looking for rationalist fiction WITHOUT magic, ninjas, superpowers, mad science, etc.

### Post:

Hey, I'm interested in seeing examples of rationalist fiction that *doesn't* have "supernatural" powers and the like. The closest example might be *The Steerswoman,* by Rosemary Kirstein, though this still has an unusual setting. *The Goal* by Eliyahu Goldratt might be another example, and while it has a real world setting it has an unusual genre ("business novel"). Anyone know of other examples of this sort of thing?

  At this point we're basically talking about "good writing." If there are no magic systems or superpowers to make consistent, rational writing is just a book where the characters act according to their motivations & capabilities.

  With that said, here are a few of my favorite realistic-fiction novels I've read over the past few years.

  * *Angle of Repose* by Wallace Stegner: a severely disabled man moves into his grandparents' final home decades after their death and dedicates himself to researching their life on the American frontier. Extremely emotionally compelling, the character of the grandmother is lovingly crafted and relatable.

  * *The Martian* by Andy Weir. Hypercompetence porn & hard sci-fi at their best. A better title might be "The Engineer."

  * *Ishmael* by Daniel Quinn: if you can get over the telepathic gorilla, there's nothing magical or supernatural here--just a razor-sharp inquiry into the nature of human civilization & the root causes behind why it looks the way it does.

  If you're interested in nonfiction, I highly recommend *Collapse* by Jared Diamond. It features several case studies of civilizations that have either failed or survived to the present day, and discusses the reasons for their fates. Meticulously researched and fascinating. Hint: it's all about adaptability.

    No, "rationalist writing" is a very different concept to "good writing"!

    Rationalist writing aims to educate the reader, and to model real-world cognitive and emotional techniques.

    Good writing is often not even rational: a well-written romantic comedy, or even farce, would very rarely be improved by the characteristic coherence of a rational setting and characters. 

    UNSONG, to name a specific example, is in my opinion an excellent but non-rational novel - well written, characterised, and plotted; but while it hangs together well it violates Sanderson's First Law (magic mechanics are relevant to the plot while also unpredictable to the reader). This isn't a bad thing, it's just a different genre!

      Ah, I missed the fact that OP used "rationalist" and not "rational." 

      Of my recommendations, *Ishmael* and *Collapse* are actively rationalist; *The Martian* edge-qualifies.
      ```

    Loved The Martian, couldnâ€™t stand Ishmael, and Collapse is one that I want to read.

    But different strokes for different folks I guess.

    I anti-recommend Ishmael. It has weak reasoning and an overall smug tone, and really is just a long tract wrapped up in a little fiction to make it more palatable and avoid the need for citations. The case against civilization has been made better elsewhere.

    Edit: Hmm, after saying this I realize one could also claim this applies to HPMOR. But Ishmael really is just pure preaching, HPMOR at least has plot.

      If you read it as a case against civilization, I'd encourage you to give it another try. The purpose of the book is to make (presumably human) readers look critically at their status quo as if from the outside, something which requires a didactic approach. Your perception of smugness likely comes from the fact that Ishmael is always leading the narrator towards the conclusions he wants him to make. It's extremely effective at reframing a lot of issues that most people otherwise wouldn't think twice about.

  "Hatchet" kinda qualifies. It teaches rationalism in a very narrow topic of wilderness survival
  ```

- u/BavarianBarbarian_:
  ```
  I could recommend you a physics or engineering textbook, it's the closest thing to real world minmaxing, statistics, and overcoming biases, which I've often seen in rationalist texts.

  Jokes aside, what about Robinson Crusoe-like stuff? Overcoming practical challenges?
  ```

  ```
  The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne.
  ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  Set in Stone was really good. It's set in the far future on another planet, but the story's actual setting is entirely low-tech, pre-metal society enforced by AGI.
  ```

  Shogun by James Clavell. 

  Oldy but Goldy. Really well written and definitely qualifies as rationalist both by character motivation, and educational content.
  ```

  ```
  What about historical fiction? Something like *The Century Trilogy* Series by Ken Follett.
  ```

- u/123whyme:
  ```
  Stoner by John Williams

  just the fictional telling of a simple man's life where the characters live according to their values and are believably flawed. Easily one of my favourite books.

  It is not hyper rational in that every thought process of the characters is examined though.

    Oh, hey another *Stoner* fan!

  You might like K J Parkers writing.  Some of it's more rational than others, but there usually arent a lot of supernatural elements.
  ```

    ```
    I still change my mind on whether Poldarn is a god every time I re-read the scavenger trilogy.
    ```

    - u/Slinkinator:
      ```
      He definitely is part of a god, whatever that means
      ```

  What about detectives? Sherlok Holmes and other.
