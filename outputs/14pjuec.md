## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  It's been a long while but I am back from the depths of AO3 to display the small gems I've found in the bottomless pit of mind-numbing trash.

  These are listed in no particular order. Just how they're listed in my bookmarks tab. I've got a lot more fics in my bookmarks that are definitely not rational so these are pretty much the cream of the crop.

  Note I have a very particular style that I like, and that is very dark and occasionally bloody fictions that navel gazes the entire time. That will be represented in this list. I do enjoy the occasional self insert and power fantasy, especially those in the Worm fandom, but those are garbage bin level.

  1. [The Bat Effect](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38559063/chapters/96382032) (64k) Rational: 3/10. Personal: 9/10. Hiatus. Practically crack.

    Severus Snape gets sent back in time to his first year at hogwarts but this isn't your usual time travel fix-it. No, he hates children. Hates them with every fiber of his being. That includes himself. The flavor of the day is contempt with a small slice of nostalgia and pinch of guilt. I found it absolutely hilarious. I just wish there was any plot whatsoever. The author placed on hiatus before the plot got anywhere.

  2. [Falling Apart](https://archiveofourown.org/works/36234070/chapters/90325270) (215k) Rational: 8/10. Personal: 10/10. Almost completed. Maybe a chapter or two left.

    On a less funny note, Severus Snape is sent back in time to hogwarts to his sixth year. Except now, he's a man with a mission: Kill Voldemort. He's a man who has already died and has nothing to lose but his own regrets. The night sky is going to be lit by the amount of bridges this tragic anti-hero is going to burn. One of the best Snape POV I've ever read and it's just fantastic. I've knocked points off the rationality of this fic because it's not the most "optimal" but Snape's decisions arr quite logical if you view it through the eyes of a dead man walking.

  3. [Known Associates](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13518234/chapters/31007259) (221k) Rational: 10/10. Personal: 10/10. Updates very slow but arcs are largely self contained.

    If you don't know, Detective Conan is a very long running crime solving anime about a genius detective akin to Sherlock age-regressed to a childlike state by some "Big Bad" but still manages to solve murders. He does this by drugging his girlfriend's father Richard who's a drunk incompetent detective and using a voice changer to make it seem like Richard was solving the mystery while "asleep".

    This is played for laughs in the anime but what if, it wasn't. In Known Associates, we step into the shoes of Richard, the very flawed divorced man who loves his daughter very much but can't quite get the hang of showing that without fucking up. He knows he's a failure as a detective and maybe even a father and takes to drinking to cope. And now, his daughter brought home some strange child which means another mouth to feed.

    With the undesired help from that strange child, there might actually be a decent detective and a good father underneath all that pain in Richard but it's going to be a long road to find out. I highly recommend this fanfic but stop at chapter 13. The author updates at a glacial pace but ending at 13 is a great place to step off and wait for the rest of the fic to finish.

  4. [Pick Your Poison](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13604148/chapters/31231287) (201k) Rational: 3/10. Personal: 10/10. Updates very slow.

    I love my incredibly dark stories and this is one of the blackest (and bloodiest) ones I have on my list. The genocide tag is there for a reason and my god is it like a punch to the gut. The author properly set it up so I have to give them kudos. Although, the first half of this story seems to be completely different from the second half. Starting from chapter 12, the atmosphere falls off a cliff and into a black hole.

    Chapters 1 to 11 is pretty much just vibes. Pretty much none of the information or plot is of any relevance to be honest but the it sets the tone for the second half. I'm not spoiling anything not found in the trigger warnings or tags but the author isn't joking. Shit's fucked and it's beautiful.

    Read this but be warned, it's my favorite chocolate: extremely dark and bitter.

  5. [Running Back the Tape, Watching it Replay](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30133737/chapters/74230590) (124k) Rational: 5/10. Personal: 7/10. Hiatus.

    Adult Bakugou Katsuki gets sent back to before UA into his 14 year old body. Like Snape in the earlier two recommendations, he's now a little boy filled with a lifetime of regret but it lacks the driving force that pushes Snape. It's still clearly the explosive Katsuki and he is still on a hair trigger to blow up on someone but it's now tempered by a lifetime of poor decisions and bad choices. An interesting perspective done well and it's one of the better fics in that fandom.

  6. [Violent Solutions](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52324/violent-solutions) (575k) Rational: 10/10. Personal 10/10. Author on break between books.

    What happens if you take a combat robot from the far future when humans are long dead and stick them into a magical fantasy world with drug trafficking, religious sectarian conflict, racism, and class warfare. Well, Mr Robot here has a toolbox filled with hammers labeled "Violent Solutions" for all your nail needs. Clearly not your standard number-go-up litrpg (except maybe body count).

    This isn't crack. There is rather deep exploration into the human psychology, conflict, and perhaps non-violent resolutions (heretical I know, talking things out? Pshh) from a very alien perspective. The morality scale is not black and white with shades of gray, it is so far off on a whole other dimensional axis.

    No one is perfect and definitely not the MC. People are just flawed to the point that I can hardly tolerate them at first but they grew on me like a persistent mold. The sidekicks go from "Jesus christ why are they not dead yet" to "wow, they're a better person than MC and I would love to know what is going on in their heads". The author doesn't do alternative PoV which is something I normally give +100 on my score for but in this case it's so excruciating. The author does explain what is going on in other characters heads in the authors notes but it's in the form of an info dump, not the fantastic "show, don't tell" that is their chapters.

    I highly recommend this original fiction especially since it's just wrapped up book two out of three. A very unique take on the typical "power fantasies" that is not a self or reader insert. A breathe of fresh air for when I surface from the pool of eye bleeding examples that the rest of that website contains (i.e. royalroad). ~~I'm not saying all of RRL fictions are terrible, just 99% of them are. Don't @ me, I know I'm right. I've been reading fictions on that website since it was a light novel translation page. Ive consumed so much garbage Im surprised I dont have eye cancer.~~

    Why do you have Falling Apart at 8/10 rational? 

    Snape literally has no reason not to just straight up reveal future knowledge to Dumbledore. The only reason he doesn't is because of an amount of angst unbecoming of a 40 year old man and so that there can be a plot. I'm 20 chapters in and more than half of it feels like just an OC SI romancing Snape channeling "I can fix him". 

    That said I can see why you recommend it, the writing is a notch above the rest of the crud, abovementioned issues notwithstanding.

    I'm definitely enjoying Violent Solutions, the start of it actually strongly reminded me of another fiction on royalroad that has a near identical starting section but instead of murderbot-in-human it's murderbot-as-dungeon-core. I can't find the title of that one or I'd link it, but I don't think it's particularly rational anyway but it's been a year or two since I read it.

    ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    I just finished Violent Solutions and overall, it's pretty good and quite far from regular RR fare. 

    Volume 1 is definitely (significantly) weaker than Volume 2. It's probably because the author got better at writing after a couple hundred thou published, but it's also nice to see actual character moments rather than McMurderbot doing Murderbot-y things 24/7. 

    My biggest nitpick would be that at times it gets a bit "heady" or maybe "fast and loose" with the "science". There are large sections where it's just the protagonist futzing around with magic and applying 21st century scientific theory to (mostly) pwn all the local magic noobs. Like, the "cheat power" is a staple of the genre, and that's fine, but are pages of laboratory rat-disection description really driving the plot forwards? 

    Too much it feels like worldbuilding for worldbuilding's sake, and while it's clear that the author is absolutely in love with the world and magic they've built (which is a very good thing), worldbuilding alone does not a good story make--it should be a supportive element that props up character and plot.
    ```

  - u/lillarty:
    ```
    I've been enjoying Violent Solutions, but the scraper I use strips all author notes from chapters. In the retrospective the author mentions something about the story being flawed because it *requires* the author notes, but I've found everything to be perfectly comprehensible without them. Am I really missing that much?
    ```

    - u/Samarium149:
      ```
      No. If you're confused about anything you can go back and read the author notes and the comments the author made in the comment section for further explanation. They do explain a decent bit in the comments but that was when readers were following along chapter by chapter. Further chapters generally clear up any confusion.

  Hi, I would be glad if anyone could recommend any stories where the protagonist manages or creates wealth. It can be small scale, someone managing a simple store, to large scale, nobles managing their land. Some stories I have read that manage to do this well are among others [High Tide (A Corlys Velaryon SI)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/high-tide-a-corlys-velaryon-si.860581/), [Dread Our Wrath (ASOIAF SI)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dread-our-wrath-asoiaf-si.870076/) and [Purple Days](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/).

    The Baroque cycle by Neal Stephenson is somewhat heavy reading but has many viewpoint characters who invest money for others or themselves and at some points end up on cross continent trading voyages as well as manipulating or crashing the economies of entire countries in realistic ways. 

    The Merchant Princes series by Charles Stross has a family of interdimensional travelers who make money by an unusual strategy and the protagonist proposes a new way for them to make money. I recommend the omnibus versions which have several books in one as he made several changes to improve the pacing. 

    The Blood of a Dragon by Lawrence Watt Evans has a washed out Wizard’s apprentice who acts as a supplier of spellcasting ingredients for Wizards as a protagonist. The money management aspect is mainly trying to find a way to break into the market on an expensive ingredient and overall mainly an adventure story.

    Not sure how you feel about quest format, but [For House and Dominion](https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive.html?tags=House%20and%20Dominion) is probably the best Sci-Fi kingdom building-esque story that I've read. 

    It starts out with our commoner protagonist willingly enlisting into the Dominion Navy, as a pilot in charge of a mothballed mass production spaceship. She does this in order to avoid being drafted, which would probably cause her to become infantry. Dominion is one of the most powerful interstellar factions, ruled by feudal lords and ripe with infighting.

    Over the course of many years, our MC climbs the ladder of nobility. She also founds many different companies throughout the story, some are wildly success while others are dismal failures. Business management is a significant part of the quest.

    First 20~ threads are a bit rough, but the quality significantly goes up from there. Her rise is believable, and the worldbuilding is very very detailed. It is clear author put a lot of thought into it.

    For a more ridiculous take on managing money there is [Tale of An Industrious Rogue](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Tale_of_an_Industrious_Rogue,_Part_I), where a Pathfinder adventuring party decides to derail the plot of their adventure entirely and instead monetize a portal they discovered to the paraelemental plane of salt.

  Any good stories where the protagonist is a cleric or a paladin and the god is involved too? Good alignment ideally.

  Like the two inquisitors in Calamitous Bob are exactly what I want, except as main characters. I've see the trope a few times in Korean manhwa like Leveling up with the Sword, or Priest of Corruption more recently and I really like it. Also it would be nice to see the protagonist be a part of a religious order instead of opposing them.

    World of Prime series is an Isekai about a guy who becomes a Paladin of the war aspect of a lawful good goddess. It's not litrpg or anything, just a straight fantasy, but I've been told before the magic system/alignment is based on dnd 1.5. 

    It succeeds in doing something I've seldom seen before, which is to have a lawful good protagonist who accrues power and status without compromising his morality/alignment. Probably something that's only really possible in a world where a priest can actually see a person's alignment.

  I... hesitantly recommend Beneath the Dragoneye Moons. The worldbuilding is absolutely excellent. It handles immortal characters in a truly fascinating way, and the system's impact on the world is felt in so many big and small places. Seriously, as LitRPGs go, the worldbuilding here is top-tier, and feels super rational. 

  That said... the main character is decidedly not rational. She can be enjoyable at times. She does solve some problems in clever ways. But she constantly makes stupid descisions just to move the plot along. Plus, her philosiphy just aggravates me at times. She takes an oath to do no harm, makes exceptions for just about every circumstance, but takes a hard-line stance on some of the stupidest cases! Every time it happens, it just takes me out of the book.

  I enjoy the story. I really do. The system is genuinely incredible, and some of the highlights of the book are when the MC chooses a new class and explores what she can do with her new skills. But every once in a while, I'm just taken out of the story because of the MC's stupid decisions. That's why it's so hard to recommend here.

    I remember liking it in the beginning, for the first major arc. The world building was not without it's problems, but generally consistent and interesting, the characters distinct - overall an enjoyable read.

    And then it seems the author got bored and decided to go the route of all Xianxia: dropped all existing plot threads and moved the MC to the neighbouring country, where average peasants are much stronger than elites from the previous one.

    And then, much quicker than in the first arc the author got bored of this plot again (this time without even finishing the arc!) and had a meteorite drop on that country (metaphorically) to completely change the plot and scenery again, while of course again escalating power levels. Shortly after that I stopped reading it.
    Later I read in a rec thread on this sub that this pattern continued again and again.

    So now the question: does it change at some point? Are there actually complete arcs that are worth reading? Feel free to include spoilers, if you want.

      >!Honestly? Not really. I think the first 3 1/2 books remain the best out of the series. And then the next 2 1/2 go off into the weeds in a plot that spins it's wheels and just isn't as interesting as it was before. There are a few good moments, but the side casts are significantly worse than the rangers/sentinels. Book 7 is back to Remus, which makes things fun again, but after that the MC is time travelled forwards 20,000 years and aside from a few characters, everyone from the past 7 books is dead. Personally, I stuck with the series, mostly due to an excellent narrator on the audiobooks. But other reviews I've seen have been much more negative on the shift. TBH the dwarf part you read is probably the worst one, where literally every interesting character is replaced with a boring one, but no, the story shifts never really stop. The author almost feels alergic to having a recurring side cast.!<

    In majority of the litrpgs I've read, protagonist is always one of the biggest issues. 

    Almost all litrpg MCs are on the extreme ends of the competency spectrum. They're either very competent ruthless robots(mostly they have the appearance of competence, either because everyone else is an idiot or due to plot armor) where the entire plot is driven by "numbers going up" with very little challenge or character development, or they're constantly making stupid decisions in order to move the plot along as well as having idiotic worldviews. 

    There needs to be a happy medium between the above two extremes, preferably one that veers slightly towards the competence end of the spectrum. However making a story like this would actually require the author to have some writing chops, which litrpg authors rarely have.
    ```

    - u/Missing_Minus:
      ```
      I'd be happy to have hyper-competent stories, but unfortunately most of them don't decide to have a world that actually responds to them. (Often they aren't really even hyper competent.. the world just distorts around them, unfortunately.)
      ```

      - u/Naitra:
        ```
        Indeed this is true. I should've clarified by saying that they have the appearance of being hyper competent, either because everyone else is an idiot or they have heavy plot armor. 

        Most of these stories go the murderhobo route with barely any worldbuilding and character development too. So it makes it a slog to read through, and really annoys me when average/below average decision making get excessively rewarded while being presented as "genius" to readers.
        ```

    - u/MLfan64:
      ```
      If you're looking for suggestions, I'd recommend the ongoing The Game at Carousel and Super Supportive. The second is really only a LitRPG by technicality: the first 25 chapters is pre-system and after that the system is rarely utilized. Amazing story, but maybe won't scratch the exact itch you're looking for. But the former has a genuinely inventive system while still having a smart protagonist. Plus, both are updating every few days recently without any noticeable dip in quality.

      There's also Magical Girl Gunslinger, which is one of the best stories I've ever read, let alone LitRPG. Another amazing system system combined with one of the most combpelling protagonists I've ever seen. Unfortunately, that one has huge update issues, posting maybe once every few months.
      ```

      - u/Naitra:
        ```
        Super Supportive has solid writing and decent characters, but the premise wasn't really that compelling to me to be honest. 

        The Game at Carousel is a western adaptation of a very prolific chinese webnovel genre, where protagonists go through horror scenarios and gains rewards from it (for example [My House of Horrors](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/my-house-of-horrors/) and [My Iyashikei Game](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/my-iyashikei-game/)). 

        It is done competently, but I'm very familiar with the genre and its tropes, so it really didn't pique my interest. Would definitely feel like a very fresh and interesting concept for those who weren't exposed to the chinese webnovel scene.

        I don't remember Magical Girl Gunslinger, but apparently I gave it 2.5 stars on royalroad. So there was probably something that turned me off.

        I don't think I've seen any litrpg and said "this is really good", except maybe Slumrat Rising (which is litrpg-lite at most). Mostly because the entire genre is filled with trash tier writing, as the writers eschew polishing the skills required for writing traditional books, instead just using "system" to substitute for character development, plot and worldbuilding. You don't need plot if you can just give out quests, you don't need character development if numbers go up, you don't need worldbuilding if system just info dumps it for you.

          Have you tried Ar'Kendrythist? It has excellent prose for RR and is one of the deepest explorations of magic in society I've read in fiction, let alone webnovels. However I imagine a lot of people don't get far into it because the protagonist starts off as a hardline pacifist in a world where monster-killing is necessary for survival. It's also about 50% slice of life and the rest being a mix of drama, adventure, and magic experimentation. He does change, but change comes slowly and with a price.

            Cant just recommend something without linking it: [Godclads](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/godclads-a-godpunk-progression-science-fantasy-story.1048894/).

            Godclads is rough. Not in the writing sense, perfect spelling and grammar and everything, but in the sense that the MC is a complete unredeemable asshole. There are no silver lining to his behavior and personality. And everyone else is pretty much like that as well.

            And the lore is very very confusing. Readers have to hit the ground running and make sure to not get tripped up in the details of what's actually going on.

            Despite all that, I would recommend it. I'm a patreon to the author for advanced chapters because their dedication and regular updates to the story should be supported.

              One small example of the worldbuilding style: What is Wombrash?

              From the name and first couple of mentions, it's clearly a new sexually transmitted disease.  Actually, it's worse than that >!and justifies burning entire districts to ash!<.

      > In majority of the litrpgs I've read, protagonist is always one of the biggest issues.

      I disagree. I've read quite a few LitRPGs, and 90% of character complaints in LitRPGs mostly come down to "But *I* wouldn't have done that!", because obviously whatever insane fucking murderhobo decision that gets cooked up by Royalroad or scribblehub commentators is objectively the best.

      If people were hypercompetent perfect decision making machines, we'd be living in a society where everyone lived in the same tower complex, and we'd have all collectively agreed to turn Italy into an irradiated, smoking crater whose borders are 1 mile high walls with guards that shoot anything moving inside. (Italia dalenda est!)

      But that isn't how things are. ER doctors constantly have to sew thumbs back onto folks with table saws and low attention spans. Global Warming is real (Sorry /r/rational, but it's the truth!) and is a crisis we won't solve because some people *want* it to happen. The Italians have not been wiped off the face of the earth. (Viva l'Italia!)

      Anyway the point is I've read plenty of "idiot MC" LitRPGs that are more... normal. The characters aren't stupid - they just don't have *our* collective frame of reference and biases. You don't have mine. Like, take 5 of your closest neighbours. How would they function in a different world, with their experiences, and what they know?

      We'd suck to, likely. There's a reason why "Cheat Skill" and "Summoned by the Kingdom" are two core starting conceits of Isekai - it's because the authors know that they are essentially throwing a stranger into a foreign land while they have literally nothing but some clothes and no connections - thus no real way to impact the world. By default, they'd be barely keeping their head above water.

        This comment strikes me as a little weird. If you’re that opposed why are you on this subreddit? No one’s disputing that people aren’t all hypercompetent perfectly rational machines in real life, but this is about fiction, and surely there’s space in fiction for highly competent and rational protagonists to exist? This is that space!

        Also quick side note what is this

          I love how you pick up on that but not the objective and undeniable truth that we must round the italians up and throw them into a pit to attain a utopic future.

  I recently read through [What We Do to Survive](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51307/what-we-do-to-survive) and it's a moderate rec from me. It features a sociopathic MC that is in a murder magic school where basically *anything* is allowed. There's rape, torture, slavery, and using your fellows students' body parts as spell materials. It's not anything deep but it is competently written and doesn't go too edgy. The MC is competent, hardworking, intelligent, and even fairly relatable given the circumstances. However, I am now looking for other works that feature intelligent use of magically enforced contracts, mind control, or bound servants. Both original and fanfics are fine.
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I tried this story but I didn't like it. The onscreen rape (that the mc does for personal pleasure) was too much for me. But I have read something similar that wasn't too icky for my tastes. 

    Have you tried Polyhistor Academy? It's a quest on the forum QuestionableQuesting, and you need an account to read it. I'd say it's similar in tone to what you want, although the exact things you want don't show up in there that often. It's a quest set in a murder magic school whose headmaster runs it as an experiment to show that cruelty and suffering results in the most powerful mages, and so far he's been proven right. 100 students go in each year, 10 students leave 4th year alive and with free will. Rape, torture, slavery, and using fellow students as ritual sacrifices also shows up in here, though to a lesser degree I'd say. Most of the students are just trying to survive, although there *are* some bad apples in there, and sometimes people get pushed to corners where the only way forward is slavery or torture (sometimes this happens to the MC too). 

    It's very good imo, but since it's a quest there's a lot of quest weirdness in here. The characterization of the MC is beholden to the hivemind's short attention span, and this causes a lot of problems to him. His powerset is also beholden to the hivemind's short attention span, and this results in some not very optimal training choices. I enjoyed it all though.

    I'm don't read that much of it, but you might enjoy the [HFY, or "Humanity, Fuck Yeah!" subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/).

    I enjoyed [Faith Engines](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/13ovr80/faith_engines/) for example.

    I remember having fun with [Ben's Damn Adventure: The Prince Has No Pants](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32411/bens-damn-adventure-the-prince-has-no-pants), though it seems to be on indefinite hiatus. 
    I'd recommend trying [chapter 3](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32411/bens-damn-adventure-the-prince-has-no-pants/chapter/496763/youll-be-a-man-chapter-3), works without context and still makes me tear up a little.

    I think romance stories or anime in general would be your best bet for that combination, but I don't have many recommendations there. There is [Beware of Chicken] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken) on Royalroad that might work.

    By the way, your request is interesting to me. After introspection, I can think of many inspiring stories but they are not happy. And I can think of many lighthearted uplifting stories but they don't inspire any particular hope. Maybe you can narrow down if you lean more towards tragedy or comedy.

    [Ar'Kendrythist](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) evoked that feeling in me a lot. It's about a pacifist being transported into a world where killing monsters (and sometimes people) is necessary for survival. The world is a dark and dangerous place, and it is also fundamentally broken. The story is about how he slowly reintroduces hope to this world, even through the times when consequences are catastrophic and hope seems impossible. If you ever wondered what it would be like to have a litrpg story where the protagonist is Jesus, this would probably get close :P

    If you're into fanfiction I quite like [Advice and Trust](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/advice-and-trust-nge.311196/). It's an evangelion fanfic where instead of things getting worse they get better instead. Three broken people support each other instead of drifting apart, and that makes all the difference. 

    [Fate Far Side](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7154469/1/Fate-Far-Side) is similarly a Fate/Stay Night fic crossed with Tsukihime. After the ending of FSN Shirou, adrift, happens upon the Tohno Estate. It's structured like a visual novel with three "routes," each ending with a different girl and revealing new information. Overall the tone is somewhat melancholic, but also hopeful. Left me feeling some nice feelings.

  Hello people, I'm looking for writing advice. I've been exceptionally lazy and just writing as the fay mood takes me, which has led me to writing myself into a rut.

  I would appreciate advice based on my personal traits:

  Strengths - I'd call myself good at rich worldbuilding, and very good at prose in general

  Weaknesses - I struggle with theory of mind, intrigue or writing characters. My ADHD makes the prospect of planning out threads and plots seem daunting, especially when I do write for fun. I find it very hard to inhabit the shell of a character, which is why I tend to cheat and make my protagonists, if not self inserts, someone I could plausibly see as being very near minded to myself.

  If anyone has any advice on how to shore up the latter issues, I would be deeply grateful, since my go-to strategy of getting GPT-4 to do it never paid off haha.

    Read more bad fiction, preferably fiction that's been published and can be bought in bookstores.

    This has two great upsides:

    1. Motivation. Reading something terrible and being overwhelmed with the "I could do better than this" urge is something I've found to be a powerful motivators to just sit down and write. Seeing that there are published authors that fill shelf space with absolute garbage is more motivating (to me) than reading great fiction and thinking "I could never have written this".

    2. Learning from bad examples. I've found it's often easier to pick apart what someone has done "wrong" rather than pinning down exactly what someone did to make something great. If you struggle with character, read bad characters and figure out how to do it better, and if you struggle with intrigue, read poorly-contrived intrigue and strive to do better.
    ```

  - u/ButterflyGirlEnjoyer:

    I used to have this problem. Have you looked at other types of writing than web serials and fully published novels, like quests or roleplay?

    >  struggle with theory of mind or writing characters.

    > I find it very hard to inhabit the shell of a character, which is why I tend to cheat and make my protagonists, if not self inserts, someone I could plausibly see as being very near minded to myself.

    Roleplay helped me a bit with these, since it's not just your character, it's the other person's/ people's too.

    > My ADHD makes the prospect of planning out threads and plots seem daunting, especially when I do write for fun.

    Have you tried writing a quest instead of a linear story? Set the worldbuilding details at the beginning, think about what you want the players to encounter to get your plot/ themes across, and then give them a protagonist to throw at it. Since the players are deciding the character's decisions, it won't be your self-insert but theirs, and playing a semi-antagonistic role as a QM can be a slight power trip that simultaneously enables you to indulge in rich worldbuilding tendencies. Since there's constant feedback via player action, it can cause you to spin off subthreads/ subplots that you wouldn't have thought of yourself.
