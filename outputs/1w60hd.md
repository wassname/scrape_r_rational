  I truly don't think I've ever seen anything like this. *Effulgence* expands on the universe of [*Luminosity*](http://luminous.elcenia.com), but it expands in several different directions and crosses over with multiple different other works of fiction and AUs of those works of fiction. But what really does it is that it's a roleplay at the same time – it's more-or-less written line-by-line by a couple people ... including Alicorn, the original author of *Luminosity*. And at the same time, it's *long*; I'm not going to count them, but there are probably several hundred threads in the index I linked to.

  This is bizarre – good-bizarre, but bizarre nonetheless – and totally unlike anything I've ever seen before. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I hope to.

    There's only two authors of Effulgence - me, and Pyth, my kappabeta.  Also, linking to [How To Read Effulgence](http://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8579.html) rather than the index is preferable.  Thanks for the link!
