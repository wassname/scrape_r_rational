  The video really isn't rational.
  I was more interested in how you guys would exploit the system to generate as much gold without losing a significant part of one's personality.

    Depends on whether it takes *my* memories or whether it can be powered by *anyone's* memories.

    It's it's *anyone's* memories, then we use it as part of our criminal justice system - we sacrifice a person's entire store of memory/personality before an execution we were going to carry out anyway, for example, or as part of rehabilitation so we can undo some of the harmful parts of their psychology. If you think that's too immoral, we use the beneficial aspects of memory erasure - someone who has been the victim of a violent crime can have their memories of the event erased after the trial is over. Or you can erase the memories of a relationship from someone who had their heart broken (a la *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*).

    If it's only *my* memories, then I use the system pretty sparingly, or possibly not at all. If it's precise enough, I would use it to erase my knowledge of some of my favorite books and movies so that I could read or watch them a second time. There are also a whole lot of memories that are degrading anyway, and don't serve much of a purpose. But mostly I wouldn't trade away my personality for gold.

  There was something in it like "the more precious the memory, the better it worked."  I'd try to get a very good idea of how that's measured, because some definitions would have the tradeoff *never* be worthwhile, but always be tempting.

  He may have done the right thing when he smashed it.

    Right, that's a good way to limit the power of the system. If better memories create more gold, then the exchange rate might be such that you'll always lose more utility than you created.

    Of course the story is about hubris and knowing what's really important, and not about e.g. the value of gold collapsing to zero due to cheap alchemy.

  He'd probably have made more gold selling the machine.

  no no no the real value is not the gold. bah weak metal! The ability to pinpoint, remove, and preserve memories for others perusal is... invaluable. As stated by others it could be use for therapy and/or punishment. if the memory could be played without consuming it it would not only prove the concept of qualia but bring people closer than before by allowing  us to *really* experience life as another. Lastly but not least you got a thought-powered reactor capable of creating mass from nothing! (no apparent volume change from **Fe** to **Au**) and even if *lesser* memories are less effective (producing **Pb** maybe?) you got a way to dispose safely of radioactive or otherwise hazardous materials!  sidenote: could you use the happy memory of a sociopath murdering someone? are masochists able to fuel the machine with memories of pain? who or what judges a memory worthy?
  ```

- u/Roxolan:
  ```
  Recruit people on their deathbed, as suggested in HPMOR? Although in their final moments they might be less willing to give up their cherished memories than their magic.

  If it's just yourself:

  - Warn your friends / loved ones to expect a little amnesia.
  - Figure out the awesomeness rating of the memories you can produce [by careful spending of a certain amount of gold](http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3712).
  - Arbitrage away!

  Don't forget you're also spending some of your lifespan (from the perspective of amnesic future you), so be sure to account for it. Or to spend some gold on immortality research; you're an alchemist, that's supposed to be your field.
  ```

- u/whywhisperwhy:
  ```
  For my personal use, I don't think it would be too useful. A better approach is to instead license out the machine, or maybe collecting a small fee for every use.

  And all this is assuming that (1) the machine could be used by anyone and (2) how "powerful" the memory is corresponds to how much gold you can make, not just how "happy" the memory is (which is how the Alchemist used it). But if that's the case, our society would end up looking very different. To start, it would be excellent for psychotherapy. Veteran suffering from PTSD? Erase the last 6 months or so (including the traumatic event), come out the other end rich and psychologically healthy. It might even help alleviate poverty in the general population- had a very poor childhood, with gang warfare and abusive parents? Use that to become wealthy. In fact, I feel like this would end up becoming an escape hatch for anyone in a bad situation. If you lose your job and become homeless, if you're in a horrible accident and need the money to cover medical treatment, this provides a perfect way out.  Of course, in the end I think this would end up devaluing gold to the point where another standard had to be chosen. I think an even more interesting question is what the response to this would be and how much of an upset to our whole system it could cause.

  On the other hand, if you can forcibly use the machine on other people's memories, this could easily turn out to be one of the most horrific inventions in history, I don't think the implications need to be spelled out.
