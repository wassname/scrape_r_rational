## [RT][WIP] The Flower That Bloomed Nowhere, part 33

### Post:

This is a shorter chapter then normal - a little vestigial in that it was too long to be merged with the following one wholesale, but there weren't any other good points to cut them together. Still, the last one was pretty eventful, so it's mostly about the followup to it.

We've finally transitioned from the 'setup' phase of the murder mystery to the 'escalating bad decisions in response to bodies' phase, which is pretty exciting. If you've been paying close attention, there should be some things you can infer about this mystery already.

  Since this is a murder mystery, I've gotta wonder if we even met our entire cast of potential culprits yet. How many people are even ~~on the island~~ at the order's hideout?

  The glossary mentions 13 people: Utsushikome, Ran, Kamrusepa, Theodoros, Ptolema, Seth, Ophelia, Lilith, Mehit, Sac'Nicte'Ic'Nal, Bardiya, Linos, Neferuaten.

  But it doesn't list Anna, Durvasa, or Balthazar, just to name a few. We also haven't yet met Samium (who is supposedly here) and Ezekiel (who is supposedly here). I'm not sure if I'm forgetting anybody else. (Edit: also, Yantho)

  But also ... I think they mentioned that there was going to be a huge audience for the presentations, which suggests there's actually a boatload of people that we haven't met yet. While I assume we've at least met most of the _narratively_ relevant people, this makes it difficult to narrow it down factually.

    I really need to update the character section of the glossary. To be honest, since I got rid of the silly character cards, I sort of forget about it.

    And I believe it's passingly mentioned that the other people are going to be watching the conference remotely, not while physically present. Without saying too much, though you haven't _seen_ everyone directly yet, at this point all the people in the Sanctuary have been mentioned. 

    The ten students: Ustushikome, Kamrusepa, Theodoros, Ran, Lilith, Ptolema, Seth, Ezekiel, Bardiya and Ophelia.

    The six council members: Hamilcar, Neferuaten, Linos, Zeno, Anna and Durvasa.

    The two servants/'stewards': Sacnicte and Yantho.

    And three other guests: Mehit, Balthazar and Samium. 

    ...Bringing the established total to 21 people. It's tipping my hand just a little bit, but that's not the _complete_ final count, although we are extremely close and, again, anyone left over has come up by name already. Once all potential suspects are on the table, the story will make that very clear.

    ok some actual speculation here

    It's hard to come up with a motive since we don't know anything about the victim, but Balthazar is hella sketch, which in turns make Zeno sketch (oh, that's someone else I hadn't mentioned yet). But that all seems too obvious, I guess.

    It seems likely that the note was given to Su in order to make her go looking for the "archive" and find the body, which would mean that the culprit wanted the body to be found.

    But then why does it appear like the note was in the book for over a year? I wonder if it could have to do with the pantry that had some kind of chrono problem, although I'd probably need to reread the sequence of events to see if I can get anywhere with that hypothesis or if it implicates anybody.

    Or maybe it was *actually* put there a year ago, which would mean someone had been planning this for a long time? But that seems kind of ridiculous, why would you prepare such a tiny details so far in advance?
