  These stories follow Hermione Granger's perspective through the 7 HP Books with significant changes. The largest change is that Hermione is a math genius by muggle standards, and also a genius in arithmancy once she is introduced to the world of magic. Many of the plot points throughout the series are solved purely through mathematics, or through the mathematical invention of new spells. The 7 books are just over 1.1 million words all told.

  ooh is this finished now? I LOVED the first few books, I think the fic developed issues with pacing later on, but if it's done I'll definitely binge the rest of it.

    yep, she announced a spin-off, but the 7 years are finished, and the plot was summed up nicely. There are definitely pacing problems, but without professional editing, that is probably just to be expected. Fortunately, I stumbled upon it like 2 months ago, so I binged up to the last battle, then waited for updates.

      Thanks for the recommendation. I'm glad you liked it. Although, for the record, I'm a guy.

        Whoops, my sincerest apologies.

  God, the first book was okay but the second one jacked her off so bad I’m surprised she can still walk straight.  Seriously, she became such an incredible Mary Sue I couldn’t take it any longer and stopped in the late 60’s I think?.  I mean, fucking barbed wire = WOW SHE’S SUCH A COOL SCARY GENIUS SHE’S SO AWESOME FOR USING A BASIC PIECE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND APPLYING IT 

  Not to mention the plot holes you could drive a truck through in regards to her fucking up the war effort (by ignoring all viable solutions) in a way that would make HJPEV cringe.

    I don't see that. One, the wire was new for wizards, and it was made of carbon nanotubes. So it could be incredibly small and hard to spot. Her genius wasn't in using it, it was inventing the spell system that allowed for that sort of molecular reconstruction in the first place. She uses the same system to solve a variety of different problems.

    And what plot holes? I've read the thing twice now, and I feel I am fairly adept at spotting them. But I can't really think of any major ones.

      Ending the war in half an hour?  Sniper rifles, imperious, the fucking taboo is a 100% guaranteed way of getting enemy soldiers where you want them.  Get them into a landmine infested hellscape with anti-apparition wards out the wazoo with toxic gas and flash bangs and all manner of traps to make sure they’re not getting out again.  Hell, get yourself a hazmat suit, fill a room with mustard gas and *then* see how they like sending troops to your location.   Then say the taboo again and again and again to decimate their forces in mere minutes.

      All of which she didn’t use because.... apparently she wanted to fight fair or something retarded like that.

        The taboo abuse would only get a couple of low level goons, at substantial risk to themselves. The death eaters aren't total idiots. After the first couple didn't report back, they would know something is up. Also, if you break the taboo, the national rune network would destroy your wards (unless you were Hogwarts). They even discussed the idea at one point (regarding the preparations for the tongue locking ritual), then dismissed it. They aren't fighting NPCs here.
        ```

        ```
        Hermione tried exploiting the Taboo a couple times when Hermione bound her tongue.  They got a few Death Eaters, but - like you said - they knew it wouldn't keep working.

        And once you can't summon enemy troops to your location by the Taboo, a whole lot of your other ideas also fail.

        I won't say Hermione was flawless - she should never have been in the raid on Malfoy Manor, and at the very least she shouldn't have brought her notes with her - but that isn't a problem.
        ```

  ```
  I love both of these stories. They aren't perfect, sure, but it's very worth reading imo, and I'm very happy that it's finished finally! Mad props to the author for sticking with it and making two great works.
  ```

- u/ketura:
  ```
  Oh neat, it finished. It's definitely got some nice "beating magic with the power of SCIENCE" moments in it, although it mostly preserves the canon plot and characterization, to the point of occasionally directly quoting canon.
