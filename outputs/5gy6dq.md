  Awesome chapter!  Sounds like she's still the Squire, with Take as her first aspect.  Seems good.
  ```

  - u/NotAHeroYet:
    ```
    Though given the bonus chapter, that may not be the case. Sure, it wasn't as dramatic as what captain did there, but apparently messing with name-givers can result in new names anyways.

    Either way, it's certain that take is her aspect.
    ```

- u/hoja_nasredin:
  ```
  I still don't get why Angels owed her anything.

  Only because she took the sword from the stone?
  ```

  - u/Running_Ostrich:
    ```
    Presumably the universe has a similar story to the Arthurian legend of the sword in the stone. In it, only the "true king" can take the sword. 

    I'm guessing that Catherine made a play at being the heir to the king of Callow and that the sword is on Callowan land. If so, she can pull out the sword and presumably use the angelic magic within the sword / ritual to restore her life. The Angels owe her because she set up the story to take the claim the sword, so denying her the magic inside it would be like the sword rejecting her. (As was mentioned previously, only angelic magic can truly restore life.)
    ```

    - u/hoja_nasredin:
      ```
      so the question how long ago she planed this? Did Apprentice know that the summoning ritual consisted on putting a sword in the stone.

      Or she just saw the sword in the chapel and came up with the idea on the spot?
      ```

      - u/MoralRelativity:
        ```
        Good question. She said she had a plan AND she's really good at improvising. So either one could be true.
        ```

    - u/MoralRelativity:
      ```
      And indeed she did get the sword and put it to good use.
      > The sword was still in my hand, the blade that has once been his. I rammed it into his neck, biting deep as he fell twitching to the ground.
      ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  Also, there's a new 'extra' chapter up as well: https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/extra-chapters/
  ```

  - u/Running_Ostrich:
    ```
    Interesting that Captain transforms into a Beast. A guard in book 1 mentioned that when Captain and Black fight seriously, they don't use any weapons, implying they're stronger bare handed. I wonder if Black also transforms in a serious fight.
    ```

    - u/NotAHeroYet:
      ```
      Is it just me, or does it seem like Cursed -> Captain [spoilers](#s "just kill the name of Warlord there?")
      ```

      - u/Running_Ostrich:
        ```
        In chapter 15, Catherine brings up that there are no goblins or orcs with Names, and Black says that the Miezans are responsible for the orcs' lack of names since they dismantled orc cultures that give names. He also says that their main name was Warlord. I'm guessing that you're right, but there was nobody to give the name to without being noticed previously.

        On a sidenote, in chapter 16, there's the promise between Catherine and Hakram where he names her Warlord and she names him Adjutant. Maybe Catherine will grow into the name of Warlord, especially with the aspect of Take.
        ```

        - u/NotAHeroYet:
          ```
          I mean, I think that place is where claimants went to try for the name, if there's any elements of ritual to namings that don't have a prior claimant alive. That this is the holy place where you could become Warlord, and while the name might still be around, the orc's traditional acquisition source has just been killed.

          A more terrifying possibility is that Captain is a corrupted form of Warlord, which means the name is closer to returning than ever before, and only held down by Captain. On the other hand, it means the name won't be back for a while. It looked like she was going to become a Warlord in there, after all.
          ```

        - u/ATRDCI:
          ```
          After chapter 45, the author replied in the comments on the site when someone impled the same about Warlord

           "Warlord is an orc Name, now used as a courtesy title by some greenskins the same way “Tyrant” is for Dread Emperors/Empresses. Catherine is not an orc, not particularly well versed in their culture and numerically speaking the majority of her followers are humans."
          ```

    - u/MoralRelativity:
      ```
      Good point. I'd forgotten that.
      ```

- u/over_who:
  ```
  Wait a minute, I still don't know what Cat thought William's reply should have been...
  ```

  - u/NotAHeroYet:

    >“You planned to become a necromantic abomination?”

    There was a minor meme in the comment section that they'd have a reprise of those two verses of their original banter in book 1 when Lone swordsman discovered she was undead- but she diverged from it first, even if she didn't realize it.

    EDIT: Lone Swordsman, not comment section. coherency, boosted.
    ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  > Akua flinched, then looked at the sword. Too late now: she’d already given me what I needed. Of her own free will, too. That had to sting.

  What did Akua give Cat?
  ```

  - u/Running_Ostrich:
    ```
    Heiress made a claim:
    > “This is my house now,” she said. “And the only rules here are mine.”

    which leads to Catherine claiming it's actually Callowan ground and gets the Lone Swordsman to back her up. This is what Catherine needed. 

    If Catherine had tried to bring this up without the Heiress's claim, she wouldn't have gotten backing from the Lone Swordsman.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Possibly, though I assumed that referred to Akua describing Black as Catherine's master, and hence establishing her claim to be heir to the King of Callow.
      ```

      - u/Running_Ostrich:
        ```
        I didn't notice that before and that sounds like it could be right too.
        ```

  - u/NotAHeroYet:
    ```
    An enemy of both herself and "her" kingdom, and a hero's support to her claim that this was the kingdom's land. Which one she's referring to, i'm not sure.
    ```

- u/hoja_nasredin:
  ```
  So is she still a Squire with the Aspect Take or already thr Queen of Callow?
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    I'm unsure on this. My guess is Squire + new aspects.

    Another reply to this thread mentioned "Queen of Blades" which makes sense also.
    ```

    - u/ATRDCI:
      ```
      She is not Queen of Callow.  The angel offers it and she rejects it, pissing the angel off. Queen of Blades is.a nickname of a specific woman not the Name of a Role. So as of right now, she is the Squire, with Take as her first aspect
      ```

    - u/hoja_nasredin:
      ```
      WOG: Erratica told that Queen of Blades is noo a Name, just a nickname.
      ```

- u/hoja_nasredin:
  ```
  Was she resurrected by the angels and used Rise just to cure the wound inflicted by William or she used Rise to ressurect herself?
  ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    The way I interpreted it was the angel turned her zombie body into a real body, then she used Rise to heal injuries sustained in the fight (wounds, lightning strikes, pulled muscles, etc.)
    ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  Re-reading that part just now I think it's pretty clear that Cat used Take to rip the resurrection from the angels. And then Rise to deal with William.
  ```
