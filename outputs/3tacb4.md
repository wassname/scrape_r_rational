  Man though, why is there not an audiobook version of Dinosaur Comics. Just, literally read out loud (by erudite British people). Narrator and title text included. I might pay for that.

    This but also with dinosaur roars in between strips.

  Uhhhhm, covering the arctis with trees to combat climate change sounds like an extraordinarily bad idea. Trees absorb so much sunlight/warmth that this would probably accelerate melting the ice. 

  If Ivy is already messing with algae just use the much larger available area+energy of the oceans.

    Dinosaurs are not, as a rule, climatologists.

    Changing the albedo of the planet that much would definitely absorb more heat and melt the ice. Not just in the Arctic, either. Covering the Arctic in trees would in fact solve climate change, but not in the direction we would prefer. 

    Still, it would be in the direction *Ivy* would prefer. She seems to have a thing for "kill all the people because they hurt plants."

      Yeah, wouldn't be surprised if she turned all of Antarctica into a giant jungle. Sea level rises but more than enough extra space is uncovered for plants.
      ```

  ```
  Dinosaur Comics has been running pretty much every day or every other day for over a decade. God, I love the Internet.

    ```
    Schlock mercenary, too. Highly recommended! Not totally rational, but good, and funny. With rational elements.
    ```

    - u/FaceDeer:
      ```
      The smart goal-directed characters generally do a good job taking advantage of the tools they have available to accomplish their goals, so I'd call it highly rational (perhaps not *perfectly* so, but people are flawed so I don't mind a few exceptions). One of the few sci-fi settings where revolutionary new technology gets introduced in a particular plot and then later on becomes a basic part of the background for subsequent plots.
      ```

      ```
      I am a big Schlock fan.

      ```
      Sinfest, nearly *every single day* for 12 years.
      ```

- u/Aabcehmu112358:
  ```
  This neglects the fact that Poison Ivy is distinctly not some sort of ultimate actor on any version of DC's Earth, and is not at freedom to make sweeping long-term changes to Earth's ecosystem.
  ```

  - u/aeschenkarnos:
    ```
    That's more Swamp Thing's deal.
    ```

    - u/Aabcehmu112358:
      ```
      Even the Swamp Thing is just the champion of the Green, the (if I recall correctly) nebulously defined pseudo-deific entity which governs the goings-on of all plant-life on Earth.
      ```

- u/Meneth32:
  ```
  Reminds me of [Amelia](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3998737).
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Yeah, me too. Poison Ivy is the Panacea of DC.

    (Granted, most major characters of DC are the Panacea of DC.)
    ```

- u/aeschenkarnos:
  ```
  If you like characters using their powers intelligently, you're going to love /r/parahumans.
  ```

- u/ErgonomicCat:
  ```
  Punching a murder clown is my new way to dismiss Batman fans.

  "Oh, is he the guy who likes to punch a murder clown?"
