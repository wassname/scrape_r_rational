  I really enjoyed this, though so far it feels like one very long intro to the point where the plot is just starting. Given what I've read about the frequent retcon's I've put it in my "check back in a year" folder

  I honestly don't mind rereading revised chapters. I enjoyed going back to previous chapters to remind myself of whats happened and discovering something knew and improved. The conversation with EP at the start of the previous chapter definitely goes quite well with Accord's parting words at the end of the chapter.

  The fact that I'm reading a story in the middle of development has always been my assumption when reading fanfiction/web fiction published a chapter at a time anyway.

  Definitely dropping this fic, every time a chapter goes up I have to re-read the previous ones because they changed significantly. I'll wait until this reaches a quiescent phase to read the unmodifying story.
