  I think it's always important to have writing that does more than one thing. If you have a chapter that is there only to advance the plot, you'd better be damn sure that you pay off that plot thread, because otherwise you'll have completely wasted your readers' time with that chapter.  However, if you have a chapter that builds character, setting, *and* plot, it's easier to get away with ending that plot thread, because the chapter will still be useful, and the reader will (hopefully) feel that their time with it was well-spent, even if some grander payoff never comes.  If you go back and read the early chapters of Mother of Learning, it feels like stepping into Chekov's armory. But the first time I read that book, I missed the fact that much of it was laying the groundwork for things that would be paid off later, because I was so wrapped up in the world-building.  Sometimes, you see a gun on the mantlepiece and say, "I wonder when that's going to be fired," other times you see a Kalashnikov hanging from the wall and just admire the texture of the wooden stock before moving on with the story, only to realize several chapters later that "hey, that thing was important!"  If the reader engages with the gun on the wall merely as a piece of set dressing, and then the gun never gets fired, the reader won't notice that anything is amiss.  The point about the importance of writing that does more than one thing is true on a fractal level: I want every chapter to do more than one thing (revealing interesting things about the characters and setting and not merely advancing the plot), but I also want that to be true of every scene, every paragraph, and even every sentence if possible.  (A sentence need not be complex in order to achieve more than one thing; one of the great things about limited viewpoint is the fact that every sentence can develop help develop character simply by the nature of the way the story is narrated.)

  Audiences will happily forgive you for dropping threads if those threads are not the main thing that your audience is there for.  If your audience is there for the plot, you can basically dispose of characters after they've served their purpose in advancing the plot, and people won't complain too much about that character's arc not having a satisfying resolution.  If your audience is there for the characters, you barely need to have a continuous plot; this is the main level on which most episodic TV shows operate. (When people turn on Friends or The Office, they're doing it because they want to spend half an hour with characters that they like, not because they're expecting the plot payoff to some grand narrative.)  Obviously this is true of sitcoms, but it's true of other episodic shows like Star Trek and Dr. Who.  (In fact, sometimes when I enjoy a nice little self-contained story, I get annoyed when the show goes out of its way to remind me that the *real* payoff is yet to come.  I enjoyed my time with the first Avengers ensemble movie and would have been perfectly satisfied if it was the last MCU film I'd ever seen because I was there for the ensemble antics, not the stinger at the end to let us know that the *real* bad guy was still out there.  When I went on to watch the other MCU movies, it wasn't because "I need to find out what plot beat they hit next," it was because "I like Steve Rogers as a character and want to see what he's up to this summer," or "Black Panther seems like a guy with an interesting background and I wouldn't mind spending a couple hours learning about where he's from.")

  Even for longer serials, there's often a big element of being more interested in the characters than following every plot thread to its conclusion, and we tend to only care about the plot to the extent that the characters do.  (We care about catching the criminal because Sherlock Holmes cares about catching them.  If Sherlock Holmes decides, "wait, this other mystery over here is more important," we will, for the most part, be happy to follow him there.)  Maybe other people get more invested in cliffhangers and the stingers that happen at the end of every MCU movie than I do, but generally readers will care about something to roughly the extent that you tell them that it's important, and if you've made the mistake of building up expectations around something that's not going to pay off, it's sometimes possible to let them down gently by convincing them over time that actually, that thing wasn't as important as you thought it was.  (This works better if you're replacing it with something more interesting; most people will be fine with your decision to cancel the weekend trip to the water park if if you replace it with a trip to Disneyland.  Most people will be too hyped up for Space Mountain and Star Tours to care about the change in plans, and if someone tells you that they really had their heart set on water park rides, you can remind them that Disneyland includes offerings like Splash Mountain, so hopefully everyone gets something that's at least directly adjacent to what they were hoping for.)

  Of course, there are certain "switcheroos" which are nigh impossible to pull off, and this usually happens when the expectations that you've built up are radically different from what you're actually paying off to the point where you're completely shifting genres and tone.  If the first half of your book consists of chasing villain A, and then partway through you decide "actually villain A was a mere pawn, the real person of interest here was villain B," then people won't riot too much if you drop the villain A plot thread and replace it with a story about villain B, especially if villain B is more interesting.  However, if you spend the first half of your book telling a thriller story about chasing down a criminal, and then in the middle of act 2 the protagonist falls in love with a witness during an interview and decides that pursuing romance is more important than finding the bad guy, and act 3 is solely focused on the detective winning the heart of person that they fancy, you're going to have a problem.  That's not to say that you can't have a romance story about a detective who's engaged in an investigation, but you have to do it by doing what Alfred Hitchcock did with *Rear Window* (the protagonist is involved with a romantic partner but also resolves the mystery by the end), or if you intend to drop the murder plot, make it abundantly clear from the start that you intend to do that.  (For example, if the first chapter of the book is about a detective who is hunting for clues in a coffee shop but keeps finding excuses to push the clues aside to chat with the attractive barista, that might be our first clue that the story isn't going to be one that focuses on someone solving crimes with single-minded focus.  If the opening scene involves the main character lamenting the fact that they're too busy with work to have a social life, we're not going too feel betrayed if they decide to quit their job to pursue some new love interest.)  

  Hopefully, you know before you start writing your web serial what genre you want to work in and can signal to the reader early on what kind of story they're in for; if you get bored with your gritty crime thriller and decide you'd rather be writing a romcom instead, my advice would be to hit the pause button on your old story and start a new story rather than trying to pivot with your existing narrative.

  Oh man, thank you for doing this. I needed something interesting to listen to.

  At some point I will get around to reading more than just the mewtwo parts of your story too (I have read the beginning enough to get a vague idea of the characters of Leaf, Red and Blue).

  Happy Christmas!
