  I want to say something along the lines of "I'm tentatively interested" or "I'll be following this", but honestly, there's just nothing to go on here.

  Athena and the way Dragonize handled reincarnation was interesting and novel (compared to the way every other reincarnation isekai does it), but by straight-copying it you remove that novelty, and aside from that there's literally nothing to tell me about the story. You don't have a summary, there's minimal setting information (aside from what has to be inferred from having read Dragonize and Worth the Candle), and the character's still a human, so there's no aspect of "I want to read this because I want to read about a main character that's an interesting species."

  I don't want to discourage you from writing-- I didn't notice anything that put me off about your style of writing, and I love the genre you're writing in. But please, give us something more to work with. A summary, a premise, or at least a few thousand more words. Some sort of twist, to distinguish your work from every other isekai out there.

  Insufficient meat for a beginning, imo. It's more the first part of the first chapter. Keep working.

  There is an easy test if you should continue write or not. Imagine that no one will read your work for ten years. Do you still want to write? If you do want you should write. If not may be you shouldn't.
  ```

    I'm not sure this test quite applies, because it's a valid reason to write when you have something to communicate to others -- people NOT reading it does negate that reason.

    It's just the author asking the readers in advance "Are you interested in what I have to communicate?" at this point in time will inevitably get the response "Not sure, you've not communicated enough of it yet".

  As others have said, I was excited to see this because WtC is my current favorite /r/rational fic and I wanted to read more like it. Unfortunately, there's nothing here to engage me -- nothing happens except a little bit of musing on love/power/knowledge and then boom, done. I'll read one more chapter because I really do want to like this, but the next chapter needs to have some real meat on its bones -- it doesn't have to be long, but it needs to be interesting. Action, set up a plot arc, introduce some engaging party members or antagonist...something. 

  Technical note: dialogue paragraphs always start with a ". They end with a " unless the same speaker continues across multiple paragraphs without pause, in which case only only the last one does.

  Please let me know if you read this and want to continue. I’m not someone who writes a lot or is dedicated to it, so I’m planning to only keep the story going if there’s a group of readers who care.

    You as the writer, need be making it so the readers want to read on. If we the readers need to make you, the writer, want to write, I feel there's something wrong here.

    If you don't have a longer story that you want to tell, then perhaps call it a one-shot, mark it as complete, and move on?

      Not every story is a mystical invocation of the Muses. Sometimes a story is a pilot episode testing for ratings. Or a Minimum Viable Product searching for product-market fit.

        Having done this a fair bit, I can say that writing and publishing on the internet is WAY too much work if you're not invested in it for its own sake. I spend about 8-10 hours a week writing the updates for Marked for Death; that's a lot of opportunity cost.
        ```

      - u/Croktopus:
        ```
        I'd say there's some truth to both sides. I think it's fine for an author to use praise as an incentive to write (maybe not optimal but that's a problem for the writer more than the reader), but TV shows have pilot episodes because they're expensive and there are limited time slots on the networks, two things that don't really apply to web fiction.

        There's an argument to be made that acclaim is a reasonable analogue for funding, considering the situation where the writer is using praise as an incentive...but again, that's something for the author to worry about, not the readers. Imo.
        ```
