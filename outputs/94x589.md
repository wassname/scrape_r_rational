  Well the Sulrothom thing was fucking hilarious.  They should really check with QI if he got a similar visit, and if he kept the angel as a pet.

  Slaying a Dragon huh?  I'm betting there's a major subversion in there somewhere, but everything we know about them so far matches up to it's behavior, so I don't know.  At least Princess will finally get some good exercise.

  Also: Lizard-Troll = Best Troll!
  ```

  - u/RuyKokki:
    ```
    Might be worth a try to simply ask for the dagger...

    A visit by an angel to the Eldemar royalty could explain how red robe got the dagger so easily while still beeing close to the cult and having access to the robe and QI crown.
    ```

    - u/spanj:
      ```
      As a house noble, Zach is probably qualified to know whether or not the Eldemar royalty are beholden to the angels. Depending on how secular they are, he would already have an indication on whether or not asking would help at all.
      ```

      - u/RuyKokki:
        ```
        That would probably be one of the first things red robe would have wiped the memories off (the dagger beeing one of the only dangerous things considering Zach doesn't know soul/mind magic) and besides house Noveda is beeing dismantled and the crown is pretty much okay with that. 

        So unlikely they would tell him anything really.
        ```

- u/Subrosian_Smithy:
  ```
  >Just like that, another five restarts had passed.

  oh shit
  ```

  - u/notagiantdolphin:
    ```
    Which means that everyone else is on their final restart. Or 'dead' depending on how the new marker works. Bet the next chapter is them figuring out how to spoof it, or a last madcap dash of character development for them.

    We're up to.. what, twelve remaining total?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I was actually kind of disappointed with that, since I was hoping for more focus and development on certain characters due to the temporary markers.  Now only one loop left for that.
      ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Zorian might be able to store their new memories somehow and dump them on the originals in the next restart.
      ```

    - u/doodlyboy15:
      ```
      I noticed in one of the chapters they said something about each person having 12 restarts. Not sure if that was saying that the temporary marker lasted 12 restsarts or they had 12 left before the loop ends.
       I didn't pay too much attention and I think they stated that they had more than 12 restarts left when they brought everyone into the loop.
      ```

      - u/notagiantdolphin:
        ```
        It's that when the marker runs out, you need to wait another six to replace it.

        Maybe Zorian will overwrite their minds wholesale. Or maybe they figured it out.
        ```

        - u/doodlyboy15:
          ```
          I guess we'll just have to wait three more weeks...
          ```

          - u/notagiantdolphin:
            ```
            Not at all. We can just wildly speculate with zero evidence instead. Pretty much what the MOL sub is for. Example: Taiven is a swarm of cranium rats who have excellent makeup skills. This is supported by her referencing Zorian as cockroach and thrashing him - hunting behaviour - as well as always having another trick up her sleeve and being described as swarming him in these incidents. She is also red robe because reasons. Her master plan is to escape and cause the overwrite process of the gate to turn every.living entity on the planet into one giant swarmmind with her at the head.

            Some of that may even be factual.
            ```

            - u/abcd_z:
              ```
              [This is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia)
              ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    Don't worry, finding the Staff is the only thing they strictly speaking need to accomplish.  Once they know where it is, they can grab it, take the Ring, steal the Dagger, unearth the Orb, and then take out QI for the Crown, and then leave.

    There's still the question of how to get Zorian et al. out, but the last truly big challenge is finding the Staff, and it looks like they're getting close.
    ```

    - u/eSPiaLx:
      ```
      well they need to figure out how to get zorian out as well.
      ```

    - u/letouriste1:
      ```
      lol, can't believe there is still people thinking that will be so easy
      ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      We are still uncertain as to whether or not that is a viable escape root, especially if they want to take some of their friends with them, which I think they do, I honestly don't think that they will be getting out the conventional way, or at least Zorian won't. I imagine a situation in which Zach leaves the loop and then Zorian needs to get all of the thing again to get out, but it still doesn't work, so he has to use the collective experiences he has gained in the loop to force his way out with his small army of time travelers and simulacrum.
      ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    Yeah, the speed at which these restarts are flying by is concerning. There doesn't seem like enough space left to answer everything, though I'm sure nobody103 will manage.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Don't forget about after the loop. That portion could be quite long if it mentions them repaying most people.
      ```

      - u/thatsciencegeek:
        ```
        Oh god, I really, really, REALLY hope the story won't finish with them exiting the loop, and that there will be an arc with the aftermath outside of the loop. But is that likely to happen though? Did nobody103 hint at anything in this regard?
        ```

        - u/Split_Pin:
          ```
          I think he has said there will only be 3 arcs - but you're right. It would be pretty cool.
          ```

- u/TacticalTable:
  ```
  I'm thinking the lizardman's staff is the Staff they're looking for. Zorian was talking to what seems more like a very well done illusion, which is why his mind was invisible and the staff ahead of him didn't ping his soul.
  ```

  - u/SpeculativeFiction:
    ```
    He screams "reclusive archmage", given he snuck up on Zorian and Zach. I wouldn't be at all surprised if he had the staff either.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The lizardman is a polymorphed dragon.
      ```

      - u/leakycauldron:
        ```
        Asking for itself to be killed?
        ```

        - u/DerSaidin:
          ```
          Boasting
          ```

          - u/Xtraordinaire:
            ```
            Or luring its prey.
            ```

        - u/turtleswamp:
          ```
          Could be aiming them at a rival dragon.
          ```

  - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
    ```
    I don't think so. If he could sense that it was a divine artifact through the illusion, he could have also felt if it was the key.
    ```

    - u/rtsynk:
      ```
      right, he can detect an artifact if it's in range, and I refuse to believe that the lizard mage was able to cast such an impressive illusion outside that range
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        The twist: super long-range illusion projection is the ability of the Staff. Boom!

        It would be funny for the lizard mage to give ZnZ a dragon-slaying quest that he then repays with the staff. Not saying I'm calling it now... but, um, calling it now!
        ```

        - u/signspace13:
          ```
          My best guess is that the staff is either a shaping aid (the typical use of a staff for a wizard) or grants psychic abilities, as it is one of the more useful abilities that could be given to a human, lately I have been wondering whether Zach's huge mana reserves are more useful than Zorian's psychic nature, and I don't really think they are. Zorian is likely the best human mind mage on the planet at this point and he reached that level in 8~ years (although through the use of Infinite resources and some rather unscrupulous behaviour), if that is worthy of being a divine gift, I don't know what is.
          ```

          - u/addmoreice:
            ```
            One of the things which bothers me about zorians mind magic is that he hasn't taken the obvious advantage of augmenting his mental *senses* beyond the single incident of creating a reverse direction eye.

            That's all Z? come on man! create a device which is *constantly* divining 5-60 seconds into the future (whatever seems reasonable to the author) and dumping it into your head. Now *that* is a power up. At first it will be horribly distracting, but eventually it will become second nature...and instinctive short term divination will instantly turn him into a power house combat mage on the same order as Zack.
            ```

      - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
        ```
        Especially given that the staff only has the property of "being a key" within the time-loop. He wouldn't even know to block that (Edit: The soul-sense) even if he were capable of doing so.
        ```

      - u/Calsem:
        ```
        But what length is his range?
        ```

    - u/nipplelightpride:
      ```
      > If he could sense that it was a divine artifact through the illusion

      "The staff was probably some kind of divine artifact"

      That wording isn't very strong, I'm not sure he detected it's divineness, but rather just speculated it.
      ```

- u/Seyt77:
  ```
  Wait five restarts? Does that mean the ppl they worked with had their memories reset? Also they haven't fought the dragon in those five restarts? I feel like we're missing a whole lot because a lot can happen in five restarts with fully aware time travelers. 

  Edit:After the story ends, a side story would be awesome of MoL. I just love so many of the characters. I'd hate to see the end of this world after Z&Z defeat red robe.

      This was my assumption too. That the next is the last with markers intact.
      ```

  - u/rtsynk:
    ```
    yeah, I wasn't the biggest fan of the time skip either. It felt like we were getting to some of the most interesting stuff, then . . . woosh

    yes we spent 3 episodes on this one loop and things might need to be sped up a bit, but . . .

    I hope we get at least a couple of episodes covering everything they discovered in depth

    On a side note, I was wondering how they were going to keep progressing the 'orb as black room' research without informing the researchers. Because at some point they are going to recognize their own work.

    too bad they weren't able to talk about the sandworm

    hope he visits the lizard mage again, his tricks are top notch and sounds like he could be a tremendous tutor

    and of course VISITING A DRAGON. We've only seen them offscreen, it would be great to see one in person and either learn from it or steal all it's precious precious treasure
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      It wouldn't be hard for them to freely acknowledge that there has been prior orb research.
      ```

      - u/rtsynk:
        ```
        it's not that there has been previous research, it's that they'll recognize the previous research as their own, like how Alanic and Xvim recognized their own work
        ```

        - u/nipplelightpride:
          ```
          It's probably less likely a team would be as particular in the style of research as an eccentric individual. Also IIRC, Alanic and Xvim had many more restarts worth of research to see and get suspicious about than 4 or so.
          ```

- u/Hard_Avid_Sir:
  ```
  Kirelle waking him up with the bucket of water was hilarious.
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    It's good to see her keep her Best Sibling title.
    ```

- u/JiggyRobot:
  ```
  Well, I hope Z&Z learned their lesson, it is always best to ask for something than trying to take it yourself.

  The Kirielle thing was funny, but also kind of sad. She was apparently scared enough of how different Zorian was that she seriously thought he was an impostor. 

  Now that we have reached the end of the temporary markers lifespan, here is hoping that we can get some permanent markers placed and then even the 'non-useful' characters can be brought in.

  Side note, how many years into the loop are we are this point? I have completely lost track of the time they have left.
  ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    We were eight years in a couple of chapters ago when Zorian meets Ilsa after everyone gets a temp marker. This did no include the Black Rooms.
    ```

  - u/rtsynk:
    ```
    13 or so
    ```

- u/xland44:
  ```
  Well, this was a literal deus ex machina
  ```

- u/vallar57:
  ```
  This chapter describes three events, each hilarious in it's own way. I don't think all of the events happened in the first restart and then timeskip though, more like they were spread through the 5 restarts, showing the most important things from the work in progress.
  ```

  - u/letouriste1:
    ```
    no they happened the first restart. next chapter we will see the results of what they achevied in the 5 restarts (or 4 depending on how you read that). that's not the first time the autor wrote events like that
    ```

- u/loonyphoenix:
  ```
  Last several chapters I've had the feeling that the author is kinda tired of the story and is rushing to get it finished ASAP. Constant timeskips and summaries. Maybe that's not the case, but that's the impression I get from the style of the second half of the third part. Maybe that's the consequence of the characters growing too strong for interesting and believable conflict?
  ```

  - u/pm_your_dnd_stories:
    ```
    I have to disagree. The author has commented about long timeskips, saying that it's just slow progress and would be boring to slog through. Additionally, it is readily apparent that the author really cares about the story, what with it being lovingly crafted with tons of worldbuilding including supplementary lore posts. 

    We're in the final stretch here so I expect it to pick up soon
    ```

    - u/AHippie:
      ```
      Where can I find these supplementary lore posts?
      ```

          Omg there’s so much. Thanks man.
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think the biggest issue is that there isn't any real drama, nor stakes; Besides the threat of soul attacks. It feels as if the story will really start once they leave the time loop. 

    They come out of the time loop suddenly much more powerful, which could attact a lot of unwanted attention, and then they'd be able to interact with the world with actual consequences.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      This. With RR gone, there isn't much tension, I've said it when that piece of information was made available. 

      QI can kick ass once, but nothing can really challenge the time loopers in the long run if they are careful enough. 

      The only challenge left is the time crunch. Can they get out before the loop runs out of steam?
      ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        There's a primordial to fight as well.
        ```

    - u/AHippie:
      ```
      There is some threat of QI discovering about the time loop and grabbing the same marker they have. It can’t happen til close to the end of the story though, or he would just steamroll them.
      ```

  - u/rtsynk:
    ```
    "Maybe that's the consequence of the characters growing too strong for interesting and believable conflict?"

    some of the best chapters had nothing to do with conflict. I enjoy the exploration and discovery and growth. Getting out of the loop is secondary to me, I wish we could just continue to explore this world. For instance if they spent an episode figuring out how to get the lizard mage to teach them, that would be fantastic. Or visiting the dragon and going through all her treasures.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Hate to say it, but epic fights aren't the author's strong side. At least that's my opinion. So I agree, the first two arcs were the best because Zorian was keeping a low profile, and the chapters tended to be more personal. There was a lot of growth potential, both magic and personal. And a lot of things weren't going Zorian's way. We still get some of that when a particularly strong character appears, i.e. the lich's public persona and Silverlake, but most of the time ZnZ just plow through and there isn't any banter.
      ```

      - u/Overmind_Slab:
        ```
        At this point in the story Zorian has access to enough tools that he’s able to quickly learn new things as well. Early on we got to see him get better, now it’s just a matter of where he placed his attention. He doesn’t struggle to convince powerful people to teach him anymore because he’s either got the skills to prove himself to them or the money to pay for it.
        ```

    - u/loonyphoenix:
      ```
      Now that you say it, I agree. I don't really mind the lack of conflict, but I do find the abbreviated nature of the ending boring. Each of these summaries could have been made into an interesting story. I don't mind slice-of-life episodes at all.
      ```

  - u/Chayim47:
    ```
    I mean the story has been going on for close to seven years now right?
    ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    I feel the same rushing or tiredness, but I disagree it is caused by time skips or summary. I infer they're due to insufficient attention to character interactions. I wrote my criticism [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/94x589/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_88_mysterious/e3ory4u/) because it's not the problem with the story. It's strictly the way it's written.
    ```

  - u/thrasherfect92:
    ```
    I totally agree. The sulrothum thing was interesting but didn't seem like how that part should end.
    ```

    - u/Calsem:
      ```
      I disagree.  Not every conflict needs to end in battlefield and I think it's good they worked it out in a peaceful manner.  Also it's hilarious that it was solved by literal deux ex machina.
      ```

    - u/None:

    I feel that Princess and Ibak can use some more attention this chapter. Peculiar hydra and grouchy suspecting oldman are interesting characters, but they feel flat. Passages on Princess are of lower quality when compared to Novelty; who displayed unbound enthusiasm first time she's appointed as Zorian's tutor, or giving an off-hand dismissal when Zorian talked about creation of glass apparatus. And Ibak is the same when compared to Haslush Ikzeteri; who's friendly but still commanding respect.  

    Zorian brief interaction with lizardman children could also use some work. Moving the description of their big build earlier (when they're touching Zorian wondering if he's a fairy) would allow better flow when they play with mudman construct.

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    > ... While the 'everything' was almost certainly an exaggeration, there was probably some sort of basis for his reputation, right?  
    >Right.  

    The novel has inconsistent POV from early chapters, moving back and forth between 1st person to 3rd person limited. If author wan't to make the whole narration strictly 1st person, then the second _right_ will have greater impact with same question mark.
    ```

      --Kirma  
      >I really do appreciate it, though.  
      --Taiven  

      I always feel the _, though_ inflection as a verbal tick. An informal form of a more traditional at-front-of-sentence _although_. Seeing more than one character using this tick felt strange.
      ```

      what? when is it ever in first person?

      - u/sambelulek:
        ```
        There are numerous incident when Zorian thought leaking into narrator's. As a reader, I can process them just fine. But upon taking a closer look, they became more apparent. Following _Oh_ perfectly matched Zorian's thought.  
        >This group here comes from the Ziggurat of the Sun," Ibak said slowly.  
        >Oh.  

        Following paragraph also perfectly matched Zorian's musing,  
        >Should they tell them they were after the ring? No, that might make it harder to lure the high priest out of the ziggurat later... but maybe ... .

        Those paragraphs are indeed not using _I_. But compared to others, they feel more personal. The distance between narrator and Zorian seemed to vanish. Please compare with following paragraph clearly in 3rd person, which is the majority of novel,
        >A deathly, uncomfortable silence soon descended on the scene. For several minutes, the two sides ... .

          OK, I see what you mean. This is called [free indirect speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_indirect_speech) (technically 3rd person).

    ----

    > It had been four days since they had managed to obtain the imperial ring from the sulrothum, and they were still somewhat under the impression of what they had heard in the ziggurat.
