## replicator story

### Post:

I remember a story (possibly a star trek fic) where a low level tech realizes that the " no replicating living stuff" rule is just a config tweak in the firmware. I can't for the life of me remember the title.

Edit: found it [here, transporter tribluations] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/159ASjt0t-YVWcKY8l1CzWF3IqmgxnOlNPy6iBUbN40M/edit?usp=sharing)

  I kind of forgot that I had shared that one. It never really got properly working, for reasons that are still a little opaque to me (which goes for something like half a million words worth of stuff that's sitting in Google Docs instead of out in the world). It's not actually Star Trek fanfic, which would just make it a let down for someone who came across it on ff.net. I really like the core idea, of a bunch of roleplayers running around in a version of Star Trek built by the lowest bidder, and a Wesley Crusher stand-in who's trapped there and has to hack his way out, but ... I don't know, maybe it's an idea that I'll attack from another direction at a later date.

  It doesn't read too poorly though, I don't think.

    So you're the author, then?

    I think the problem is that it reads more like a thought experiment than a story. It's pretty much just a straight run through three or four major reveals about the setting, with a little bit of discussion for each.

    I think it could be a good story. [Spoilers](#s " I'd be very interested to see how he can escape to the real world when he's never even had a physical body.")

      Plus all matter in the real world has likely been converted into computronium by this point anyway, so it's not like getting there would do any good.

    I quite like the story.

    [Spoilers](#s "What I never understand about these sort of 'retreat into VR' settings though is why people would want to totally give up contact with the real world. Why not just live in an incredibly luxurious virtual environment, and do whatever you'd do in a meatspace utopia? No reason not to keep up with events from reality, or to pretend that your virtual world is anything but what it is. Maybe some extreme cases would decide to lock themselves in a Star Trek simulation and never come out, but I can't imagine that it would be a very common response.")
