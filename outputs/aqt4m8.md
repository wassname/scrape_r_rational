  Looks like Cat has also began to dabble with some Rivermancy.

        "In comparison to their neighbors in the Dread Empire, Callowan magic is nothing special, except for one very specific branch: Putting large volumes of water exactly where you wish it wasn't."

  Someone mentioned to me the other day that "In Dread Crowned" was to be sung with the melody from "Black and Tans" (Obvious in retrospect if you compare the lyrics) and damn if that is not a hell of a battle cry. Went from a 7/10 to a 12/10.

  I am getting a little tired of the "those stories must be exaggerated so I'm going to ignore them" trope, in this and other fictions. The other side is supposed to have competent leaders, and Named apparently have all sorts of powers. Why doesn't even a single enemy commander have a hero at their disposal whose power is to accurately witness / record / retell events? Or, more mundanely, some commanders they trust enough to take at their word? Given either of those, how is there not a direct line of information down from the top to various levels of command ranks below them? Sure, you don't want to give the rank and file nightmares, but that doesn't mean the generals shouldn't know exactly what they are up against, down to lieutenants and captains having at least *some* accurate intel. Surely the scarier parts could be spun to be less intimidating. It seems stupid to send your forces into battle not knowing that the enemy commander is capable of dropping a lake on them, so they should avoid engagement on bowl-shaped terrain if that commander is known to be present.

    To be fair, Cat has been out of the field. Over a year's time, iirc - that can be a lot in a war. Considering where she was last spotted (near Keter), I wouldn't be too surprised if people started assuming her to be dead after a couple months. Besides Masego (also missing from the front) most of her remaining subordinates are not exactly spectacular in the way she is on the field of battle. I don't think the Callowans under Cat have clashed directly with Levantine forces before either (edit: The main army at least. Not counting Peregrine & co. considering they tend to act alone and have inscrutable motivations).  

    Under these conditions, I don't think it would be unreasonable for a commander to assume that Cat's exploits have been overblown or exaggerated. If they had any idea that she was coming for them beforehand, I think this would have been a definite plothole. But as it stands they have no reason to spend resources finding info on an enemy they have no idea is alive, let alone present on the battlefield.

      Yeah, this is the age before internet and these people hear rumors of crazy shit all the time, even if some of it is true why would he believe that she "tamed" the mythical-themselves fae that almost no one ever interacted with, let alone cooperated with, and that they support her by riding flying horses into battle.  

      I mean, from an outside perspective Cat is kind of BS.  Black Knight's secret daughter, never defeated in battle, binds fae, fights demons hand-to-hand, *bullied a fucking angel into resurrecting her*.  There is a limit to how much impossible shit you can accept even about a Named, and Levant is about as far away from Callow as you can get, in an age before phones.

        Also became a fairie queen, *dropped a lake on a crusade*, allegedly almost killed the Dread Empress, (allegedly) fought the Dead King and now leads army of Drow (a race many forgot about) as their Prophet/Priestess to a pair of Twin Goddesses whose ascension she (kind of but not really) personally had a hand in. Cat is *bullshit* even by Named standards
        ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      It isn't just this one Levantine commander. This has been a running trend throughout the whole story, ever since she started to get especially novel powers.

      And it wouldn't be a particularly big piece of a briefing. If she rated even 5 minutes out of the many hours of briefings for a field commander headed even vaguely in her direction, which she certainly does, that should have covered at least a few high points of known accurate intel on her.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        Yeah, it really seems like keeping track of all known Named on the continent and their powers should be a fairly standard job for whatever serves as intelligence community of that country.
        ```

    ```
    Being underestimated seems to be Cat's protagonist power.

  my only thought was, that cat is not wearing a helmet, she just begs to get shot.
