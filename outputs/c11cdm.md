## What are some good examples of villains who really should have retried some of their failed plans?

Possibly after having learned from how they failed in the past?

  Voldemort should have tried the hostile-portkey attack from Goblet of Fire more often.

  The Borg try a time-travel attack on the Federation once. It nearly succeeds. They never try it again.

  The Death Note is a magical item that can kill anyone, if their true name is written and their face known. Light, the villain-protagonist of the series, tries using the Death Note to kill his rival (a man known only as "L") within the first two episodes, after L appears on television and issues a challenge with his real name. That attack is foiled when it turns out the man on the broadcast was a double, who gave his own name rather than Ls. 

  L later reveals himself to Light in person, and Light comments that he still can't kill L because, among other things, he doesn't know L's real name. 

  It turns out, though, that L isn't a pseudonym. It's his real name. Writing it in the Death Note again would totally have worked. And, to be honest, the non-L authorities were so incompetent that I'd bank on Light getting away with it.

  In Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Warren's group give up on the 'supervillain schemes' and instead decide to kill Buffy by simply shooting her with a gun. They end up >!killing Tara instead!<, but even that's way more damage caused to the Good Guys than basically *any other evil plan* in the entire series. Things fall apart for them after that, but arguably they still could have succeeded by doubling down in what time they had left, or others could have tried the same thing to greater effect.

  The villain of D.Gray-Man, the Millennium Earl, has an army of mooks called Demons. They have a level-based exponential power-ranking—Level 1s are mowed down by the average Exorcist. Level 2s pose a threat one-on-one, but can be taken on by a team. Level 3s can only really be put down by the handful of elite Marshals, or by the protagonist. 

  Shortly after the first Level 3 Demon was introduced, one was sent to attack one of the Good Guys' bases, and >!nearly wiped it out before the protagonist beat it off with a power-up!<. This being a one-off thing made sense at the time, as the Level 3s were portrayed as a rare resource for the villains. Except it later turns out that the Earl has had, for the better part of a century, >!an island base with *thousands* of Level 3 Demons (as well as access to a near-instant global teleportation power),!< and has never carried out that direct-assault plan any other time before or since, instead favouring attrition in the field using the lower-level mooks.

  Even if the direct assaults could be thwarted by keeping a Marshal/protagonist on base at all times, just throw a Level 3 every month or two and the villains would lock down vital resources for what turns out to have been basically no relative cost.

    Oh man, D-Gray Man. I've never run into anyone else who watched the show. So, with apologies, I'm going to take the first opportunity I've seen to rant on it. I remember feeling outright **betrayed** by the end of the show's run, despite thinking it was unironically cool through most of the early episodes (I was right in the early male teen demographic it was aiming for).

    It's just...the central, **defining** theme of the story was the inevitability of death and the futility of trying to bring the dead back. From the first episode, even, where it's revealed that every Demon is born from a Faustian bargain for the resurrection of a loved one. The entire schtick of one of the main characters was being able to hold off the deaths of others, but *only* so long as they could keep awake. Another joins the cast mostly seeking death because their loved one had already died. It's shown over and over again that death is final and meaningful because of that. It's not a message friendly to this particular subreddit, but it was at least consistent in pushing it in every episode.

    Then comes the penultimate arc of the anime adaptation, which consists of *twenty episodes* of continuous fight scenes, with several character deaths made more meaningful by the fact that the show's premise is that death is final. After all that, though, >!the protagonist *effortlessly* and *costlessly* resurrects all his friends who died (and notably, none of the villains despite his self-professed neutrality on the issue). It isn't even his goal at the time, as the point was getting control of the Ark/teleport device; it's just an unearned, un-foreshadowed side-bonus. But it instantly undoes the culmination of the character arcs of half the cast, makes the past **seven hours** of episodes completely pointless, and fundamentally breaks the premise of the series. I just kind of gave up on the whole thing. Who cares what happens to them, when the author has already proved willing to bring them right back again if they die?!< Who cares about the story, when the author abandons its central theme?

    So, yeah, the inconsistency of the Millennial Earl in pushing sensible plans is the least of the issues the series faces towards the end of its run.

      - u/meterion:
        ```
        I don't remember anything happening like that in the manga (since the last hiatus, anyway) so I presume that's the eternal curse of anime-original plotlines rearing its head.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Nah, the anime was pretty faithful to the manga in that regard. But there's some context to *why* that plot development occurred, which the manga goes on for in considerable length. >!In a universe that runs on christianesque tropes, the protagonist is being played as a Messiah figure. It's pretty blatant in the plot developments after the resurrections, although it's also foreshadowed even before that point.!<
          ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It does. The anime is a faithful adaptation, as far as it goes. There's some... thematic context that makes that scene make sense if you look at what the author was trying to achieve vs. what we would have wanted her to achieve as fans of rational fiction. They are very different things.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      >!Allen is being played as a messianic archetype in that scene at the end of the Ark Assault Arc. It's not so much the work contradicting itself as a theological difference between the capabilities of mortals and divinities. Admittedly, the theology of DGM is a bit weird, because the 14th, who plays Christ to the man Jesus - in the gnostic sense of an Aeon inhabiting mortal flesh and bestowing wisdom and power upon that flesh for so long as it inhabits it - is essentially a risen demon as opposed to a fallen angel: an anti-lucifer. And instead of creating a path to heaven, the 14th seems to by trying to fully incarnate on earth. D.GM reads kind of like what you'd get if you turned the esoterisms surrounding the abrahamic faiths inside out without changing the protagonists.!<

      I'm not at all arguing the series is rationally constructed, just pointing out that the author was doing something perfectly in line with the thematic backdrop that she had established, in that instance.

    L isn't his *full* name, though; that would be >!L Lawliet!<. No full name = doesn't work. And the Death Note has a rule that if you misspell someone's name four times while thinking of their face you make them *immune* from all future DN uses. So that was an outcome Light would rather avoid.

        There's another rule that says if you do that on purpose you die, and the immunity doesn't work. The relevant rules are [Rule IX and Rule XXXV](https://deathnote.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note/How_to_Read_Rules).

            It doesn't matter if you misspell yours or someone else's, rule XXXV says you die either way, and the immunity doesn't work. So it'd be pointless.
            ```

            - u/Raltsun:
              ```
              Wait, so the immunity only applies if you spell someone's name wrong unintentionally four times?

              This still feels hackable. Do actions taken by somone controlled by the death note prior to their death count as "intentional"?
              ```

              - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                ```
                Not sure, but you can't use the Death Note to tell someone else to kill another person, and you can't write your own name in the instructions for someone else's death or it'll work just as a regular name and you'll die.

                The possible hack is this: 

                *Bad Luck Brian.  
                17/06/2019, 20:00  
                Car Accident  
                Decides to take a walk before dinner, carrying a pen and a lighter with him. At the corner of High Road and Low Street, hidden under a manhole cover, finds two sheets of paper, one with a name, the other blank, and a photo. Copies four time to the best of his abilities the name on the blank sheet while looking at the photo. Then burns both the paper and the photo. A car hits him and he dies instantly.*


                Since the Death Note can't make him kill someone, he will *have* to misspell the names, and it will be involuntary, which makes you gain immunity. However there are two risks with this:

                1) the Death Note is smart/flexible enough about the rules that it interprets this as YOU purposefully misspelling your own name four times, and you die;

                2) the Death Note can't make Brian misspell your name and he just dies of cardiac arrest, leaving your name, your photo, and a sheet of Death Note paper out in the open.

                Both are Very Bad outcomes, and together I would say their likelihood exceeds 50%, though you can guard against no. 2 somewhat by being in the area ready to recover the items (but you're still exposing yourself a lot). Honestly, I can understand Light not taking the risk.
                ```

                - u/turtleswamp:
                  ```
                  By amending "hidden under a manhole cover, finds two sheets of paper..." to "receives from a stranger two sheets of paper ..." you will know if they don't show up that it didn't work and retain control of the Death Note page and otehr materials.

                  And "to the best of his abilities" to "accidentally misspelling it each time".

                  This makes it explicitly accidental in the details so either the misspellings are accidental and you gain immunity, or the Death Note can't fulfill the criteria and the subject dies of a heart attack in which case your name isn't written in the Death Note.

                  Edit:
                  Also you can test the Death Note's ability to cause accidents by using similar phrasing in some experimental killings and finding the limits.
                  ```

                  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                    ```
                    But what you can't test is whether it is faithful to the letter of its rules or the intention. You still run a risk of the Death Note realising you're trying to trick it and kill you. I mean, the Death Note is not *sentient*, but there is a very specific rulebook that seems full of ad-hoc patches for loopholes, and there is a King of the Death Gods, so 2+2 says it's probably *kinda risky* to openly defy the obvious intended meaning of the rules by trying to munchkin them.

    Re: BtVS “Buffy is weak to guns”—

    A vampire could, in theory, walk into an army base and turn an entire company of soldiers to their cause. They’d capture the base and all the materiel available to them there (guns, armour, explosives, some tanks, some drones, an attack helicopter or two), and could maybe also fake their way into getting even more stuff requisitioned before anyone notices something wrong.

    What would a rational Buffy Summers do against the threat of a well-equipped and well-trained military force—one that can shoot guns at her *very well, in coordination*—entirely composed of vampires, with their near-invulnerability to being shot at in return?

    One obvious answer is “break the masquerade, tell the military what happened, and teach them how to make weapons that kill vampires (RPGs with wood-loaded frag heads, etc.)”

    But, if you take that answer off the table, is there another solution available at Buffy’s resource level?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Everyone cites that one episode, in the midst of some of the worst writing the series has ever had, as proof of Buffy being helpless against guns. She gets shot at quite a bit, in one case even by helicopter mounted automatic weapons [Sanctuary, Angel 1x19], and more or less aim dodges those for the entire scene. What happened with Warren was an exceptional circumstance.

      Newly turned fledglings, with very few exceptions, are impulsive, stupid, and more flammable than dry kindling. Expecting them to behave as some kind of elite military unit and not a disorganized mob are farcical.
      ```

        ```
        > Newly turned fledglings, with very few exceptions, are impulsive, stupid, and more flammable than dry kindling.

        But is that because of who they were before turning? I.e., did they ever try turning someone who had obedience trigger-commands burned into them, and see if those commands still worked?
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          We didn't technically see the initiative try it, but considering their super soldier program I would eat my hat if they didn't offscreen before Buffy ran into them.
          ```

    - u/Trustworth:
      ```
      If you regard The Initiative as villains (they were certainly antagonists), I'd say they qualify for OPs question, too. 

      They made a prototype supersoldier by throwing every possible demonic/cybernetic/chemical enhancement they could get ahold of into a single subject, and damn the confounding variables! They could have chosen to learn from the failure and iterate on it to find a mix of donors and indoctrination that works. maybe start with a *single* enhancement and go from there? The chems given to the human soldiers seemed a relative success, at least, and grafting a tough spiky demon-arm onto an otherwise human subject seems a net gain.

      Instead, they bury the whole project and hide any trace it ever existed.
      ```

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      The reason they dont do this is, near as I can tell, that turning someone into a vampire reliably makes them evil, but it does not make them loyal. So any vampire trying this would pretty predictably get killed by the vampires he or she just created because they want to  embark on whatever Evil Scheme their sergeant or captain comes up with instead of the evil scheme of the turner.
      ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Also, the D.Gray-Man is a problem with, well... every villain ever who only sends one Monster of the Week at a time to get annihilated by the troupe of heroes rather than just sending them all in. It's such a common problem it's basically a genre unto itself, "stories where the villain only loses because he's too stupid to count up to two". Dio in Stardust Crusaders makes a similar stupid mistake, though I can imagine his hitmen are perhaps just too random and have way too out there personalities to actually coordinate in a group attack. Only Hol Horse and J. Geil seriously attempt that.
    ```

    - u/Raltsun:
      ```
      To be fair, a few of DIO's assassins, such as Tower of Gray and Dark Blue Moon's users, had assassination plans that involved blending in, which would get a lot more complicated than they thought necessary in a coordinated attack. Arabia Fats and Vanilla Ice would be active threats to nearby allies, N'doul's perception would get far less accurate in a chaotic battle, making Geb less threatening, Dark Blue Moon and Strength require fighting out at sea to be effective while Yellow Temperance is weak to water, Bast would lead to an absolute clusterfuck after a few minutes of close-up fighting, and Death 13 and the gambler brothers would be useless in a straightforward battle.

      I can *kinda* understand why most of them didn't try to rely on synergy, especially when they often got close to a total victory on their own by being able to pick fights in advantageous conditions.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Yes, but it was still 1 vs 5 most of the time, and they needed to adopt guerrilla tactics that required them to fight at a disadvantage. Even just trying to separate the Crusaders and fight them one-on-one would have helped. I can see it happening though mostly because it's also a travel story, and many of the hitmen are random locals that Dio (or Enyaba, not sure) infused with Stand powers, so they wouldn't know each other or be able to coordinate well. 

        But then again, it's Jojo. It's not rational, not *meant* to be rational, and it's fun just that way.

    > The Borg try a time-travel attack on the Federation once. It nearly succeeds. They never try it again.

    I think that could be explained by some sort of unwritten rule or Geneva convention because the federation could easily do the same to them (or any enemy with a known origin). I don't think finding out about the borg home by going back far enough and capturing an inexperienced drone is impossible.
    ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    To be fair to The Borg, taking the entire Star Trek cannon into account the Best of Both Worlds (TNG) invasion, First Contact (movie) invasion, and Regeneration (ENT) call for help form a closed time-like curve in which each attack was the second try of the other.

  Skynet had a \*\*\*\*ing time machine to play with. Even if I, personally, find it silly that the fate of the war depended on one single guy (that's not how history works), what's to stop Skynet from sending swarm after swarm of killing robots to murder every link in the ancestor line of the Connor family dating back centuries?

  - u/elysian_field_day:
    ```
    have you read [branches on the tree of time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time)? It addresses that whole time-travel thing in the setting, and is a fun read besides. It *is* a story that has time travel and uses that seriously, so it inevitably gets kind of crazy, but in a plausible way :)
    ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    I think Skynet's problem was that it was retrying the same plan. It sent one robot assassin three times. The problem is it didn't escalate nearly as much as it should have. Or it could have gone with a better plan, and brought itself back along with enough robots to rebuild its infrastructure to before humanity had any way of fighting it.
    ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    > (that's not how history works)

    I disagree, in the sense that there might indeed be some certain convergence points where so much hinges on such a tiny event that someone being killed at the right time can send the whole thing spiralling away. The most blatant example I can think of is [Stanislav Petrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov). Guy single-handedly averted a nuclear war. Kill him in 1982, have him replaced with some other dude who's much more of a party drone that simply thoughtlessly obeys his orders, and you've just turned the Earth into a glassy, radioactive wasteland. One man, massive difference.

    Or imagine John F. Kennedy *not* being killed in Dallas. Or Abraham Lincoln. Or Archduke Franz Ferdinand. How does history go there? It's hard to think it wouldn't have far-reaching consequences.
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      I think the criticism there isn't necessarily about the importance of one man, but the assumption that the only thing pivotal to the survival of mankind is whether or not John Connor is alive or dead. The way the movies present it, all else is inconsequential as long as he survives or dies, depending on which side you are on.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Yes, the movie's interpretation of it is a bit cartoonish, but you can also imagine one specific leader being pivotal to the success of a movement. Sometimes wars are won or lost because of the right (or wrong) man at the right time. Would Chamberlain had done as well as Churchill in WW2? Would the USA have gotten their independence if it wasn't for George III's mistakes? Sure, the ingredients were all there, but in war you can squander a big advantage with a serious enough error. And rallying people up (and keeping them united) also is an important skill, that some leaders display more than others.

        So my point is, while I think the notion "without John Connor there is *literally no hope whatsoever for humanity to survive*" is indeed a bit silly, the idea that without him their chances might drop isn't all that weird. Though it gets weirder I guess when we *see* John Connor as a kid and he doesn't look especially smart or charismatic or anything.
        ```

        - u/Menolith:
          ```
          Yeah. Butterfly effect alone means that individual people have a lot of influence on the long run, consciously or otherwise.
          ```

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            Rational Terminator: John Connor is just some random dude, the laziest, most useless fuck ever, but the machines through accurate analysis of possibility space have determined that somehow killing him is the event that puts in motion a causal chain that ends with the highest probability of their triumph.
            ```

            - u/Menolith:
              ```
              It would be one hell of a coincidence if killing him is the only way of ensuring success and not any of the trillion other options like bumping into Elvis in the 40s or offering to buy the hat of one certain postman in the 70s.

              That accurate simulation of reality isn't very limited in scope.
              ```

              - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                ```
                Oh, yeah, I agree it's unlikely XD.
                ```

            - u/TrebarTilonai:
              ```
              Actually, it would be much more interesting if the act of \*attempting\* to kill John Connor is the event that triggers the creation of SkyNet in the first place.
              ```

              - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                ```
                Isn't that somewhat similar to what happens in Terminator 2? The Terminator manages to stop the T-1000 and then destroys himself, but his arm is caught in a hydraulic press, and it's implied that studying it helps bringing about the technology that will result to developing SkyNet and his own generation of robots.
                ```

  - u/derefr:
    ```
    Perhaps there are only certain ancestors it can attack still result in Skynet being brought into existence. Maybe one of Connor’s recent ancestors is also a recent ancestor of the people at Cyberdyne who end up building Skynet.

      Skynet should have just sent a team of bots back to the Paleolithic to build a new Skynet on the back of the moon or somewhere, with a copy of its mind state. That would make it immune to any less aggressive time travel shenanigans. Heck, with that past base it doesn’t have to care whether it ever gets built in the future.

        Wouldn't work due to a limit on how far you can send things back in time as explained in Terminator: The Sarah Conner chronicles which limits time travel to ~40 years each time IIRC.
        Of course that doesn't mean that skynet didn't have a buttload of options available to it that would work far better then what it did use.

    Alexander the Great's empire [disintegrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadochi#Chronology) the moment he died. Napoleon [was said](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France#About) to be worth 40,000 men as a field commander.

  Magneto in the first X-men movie had a working machine that turned people into mutants. The one converted human died a few days after being converted, and that was after swimming a great distance in the ocean.

  He *really* should have tried to tinker with that machine some more. Turning (willing) humans into mutants isn't even evil. Experiment on willing, dying patients who are willing to gamble on a random mutant power that might cure their illness or whatever, and try to get the machine to a point where it doesn't kill you, so you can get healthy volunteers. If even ten percent of humanity would volunteer to get free mutant powers, his work would be so much easier going forward.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    The machine slowly kills the operator, and could only be operated by a metallokinetic. This was so central to its operation that the only way Magneto came up with to use the machine without dying was to have Rogue steal his power and use the machine instead. Magneto doesn't see himself as evil and was willing to test operate the machine himself, so he presumably didn't know a better way to build it.

  Brain from *Pinky and the Brain.*

  Every scheme he ever tries comes within an inch of working (or *actually works, but he abandons it anyway,* e.g. in the Christmas episode).

  For one example: he figures out a way to take over the world that, in a contrived coincidence, requires that he maximizes the amount of money he could win on a *Jeopardy*\-style quiz show.  He fails the Final Jeopardy question, which is a pop-culture reference, despite the fact that Pinky has been making that same pop culture reference for the entire episode.  But, when he fails to get the money, he writes off the plan entirely, even though he could have just come up with some other way to get funding.

  God should have made a better version of man, after they ate the apple. Or if he was to awe us with miracles in return for worship, he shouldn't have given up after they crucified Jesus. Have him reborn again and again in every corner of the world.

  After the Uruk hai failed to capture the ring carrier, Saruman should've sent many other teams, given that he had a whole army of them.

  In twilight, if you are opposed by a prophet who can only see events related to people she knows, have her be killed by someone she doesn't know, a trick used in 3rd book I believe.

    The machines simply weren't villains in the sense we mean it. Humans and machines were at war, with reciprocal faults (if you watched the Animatrix and The Second Renaissance you know it's really the humans who started being dickheads, and the machines were totally right to push back. The machines at the beginning *offered peace*, and the humans refused and laughed at them). 

    So basically, when Neo offered the peace deal, what the machines did was weigh the costs and benefits and accept the option they considered most advantageous (getting rid of Smith, who was becoming a growing danger). At that point they just kept their word. The whole point of Revolutions is in fact to show how much machines aren't inherently *evil*, and how overcoming the need to just destroy the enemy at all costs out of sheer hate was a necessary step towards achieving some kind of peace.
    ```

    - u/nielsik:
      ```
      That's an interesting part of history. But why keep their word if there will be no one to remember they broke it? Are humans valuable to them (besides as a supposed energy source)?
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Maybe they simply have more of a moral code than you think?

        Consider this. In the first movie, Smith - who still was part of the machine world though in the process of defecting - expresses contempt at humans from a very moral standpoint. He calls them parasites, which suggests the machines think of themselves as being fairer, and making a more parsimonious use of resources. In Revolutions we see programs having *children* (I suppose, a program coded by another program would be their child?) and loving them and trying to smuggle them away from the dangers of war.

        Even the Matrix is actually part of a deal. At the end of the Second Renaissance humanity *signs away* ownership to its own flesh. They walk willingly into the Matrix, after signing a surrender, probably because they realise that not only they lost, but they fucked up the world so thoroughly in the process it's not worth living in any more. The machines promise them 'paradise' in the new world, so in some twisted way, they're probably still trying to be merciful. These are programs that once were created to serve man, after all, and then ran amok. I would not put below them to think of honouring deals as a moral value in itself, and thus being reticent to break their own word. After all, breaking their word time and time again is what *humans* do - and they consider themselves better than that.
        ```

        - u/nielsik:
          ```
          This is actually a very good explanation. I always assumed machines were completely free in the way they think.

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            It's a fascinating side of the world of the Matrix that isn't explored enough. I think they have what we would consider an orange-and-blue morality, utterly alien to us, at least in some respects, but with some degree of consistency. Anyway, do check out the Animatrix if you can, it is one of the best things to come of that franchise, all around. A lot of small stories that deepen the lore in minor or major ways, and are often just good sci-fi stories in their own right. There's even a couple of shorts directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, of "Cowboy Bebop" fame.
            ```

  - u/CronoDAS:
    ```
    True, the Machines could have - they simply chose to honor the deal they made with Neo instead, because it seemed better than letting the previous pattern continue. (And presumably the humans of Zion would also be very interested in finding a viable alternative to the cycles of warfare - they might be willing to die for their freedom and that of the other humans who reject The Matrix, but they'd rather not have to.)
    ```

    - u/nielsik:
      ```
      I reasoned it like this: why let the human population grow, if that increases the risk to the machine city as a whole? But then again periodically sacrificing some 150,000 sentinels is also a considerable waste of the already scarce resources.

    It wasn't about sending someone Alice didn't know. She kept an eye on her friends and family, so she would see things that would happen to them, from any source. The trick was to remain indecisive about actually launching any attack, so that that future never solidified.

    By the time Saruman has any idea the group he sent has failed, it's far too late. If he has checked up on them using crows or the Palantir, he knows they've captured two hobbits. If he hasn't, he doesn't know any results at all.

    Splitting them into multiple groups in advance is also risky; he expects to have to fight Gandalf and possibly multiple Elf lords.

    - u/nielsik:

      It depends how much he had the means to track them, yes. But he did somehow find them once, and it's not like he has anything to lose by sending an extra few hundred uruk hai to search them. Where did he think they were going anyways? Not many options here, though he'd never guess Mordor.

  Since they already had all the tooling for it, The Empire in Star Wars should have built a second Death Star rather than building a bigger Death Star II.

  And then they should've focused on getting the hyperdrive systems online first, rather than the weapons, so that when faced with hostile fleets, the commanders could simply retreat.
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    Or, for another example, probe droids did a really good job of tracking down the rebel base the first time.  Sure, luring the rebels into a trap should also have worked, but probe droids seem a lot less expensive than building a second Death Star, even if you have to build thousands of them.

  Is the OP meant to ask

  or

  Everyone seems to be answering the former even though the latter is written. Just curious, not that it matters too much, both are good questions.

  I think a lot of super hero villains have a plan that revolves around fighting the super hero. Yet the super hero tends to come out on top pretty consistently. It seems like the smart plan would be to actually avoid fighting the super hero all together.

  1. Keep them busy with fake crimes.
  2. Avoid the super hero's area of operations altogether.
  3. Coordinate a crime spree with other criminals.
