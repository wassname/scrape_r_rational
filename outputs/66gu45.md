### Post:

[Chapter 1 - not your typical isekai summon](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3303695/1/%E5%8F%8B%E5%B9%B8%E5%90%9B%E3%81%AE%E3%83%AA%E3%83%99%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8-Tomoyuki-kun-no-Revenge)

I just thought that it belonged here. The MC isn't stupid and uses his brain to solve his problems.

Disclaimer: not my story, btw. My Fictionpress handle is "Sherlock D Holmes", not "Tomoyuki Tanaka"

  Couldn't get into it. I felt like certain other characters in the first few chapters were transparently idiots, in a way that could only be explained by the plot being more convenient that way.

  I read the whole thing. It was... okay? It's very, very irrational - I enjoy plenty of irrational stories, but this story consistently and egregiously had characters acting in ways that no real person would, and only sometimes for The Plot, which is pretty goddamn threadbare. Honestly, I get the feeling the author is making the whole thing up as he goes and isn't thinking things through.

  The story also consistently makes references to various other niche works I haven't read - not enough to affect my understanding of the plot (because I'm not convinced there are any important plot moments to miss) but enough to break immersion and leave me confused.
