  My favorite book by far in my last few months of reading has been Semiosis by Sue Burke. It's an amazing work of xenofiction, and it reads like a series of five novellas, each one being focused on a pivotal member of that generation. It's a story about a new colony on an alien world where the intelligence niche was filled by plants, who then manipulate the animals to do their bidding. It's a fascinating tale of generations clashing, hard choices, and learning to communicate.

  Worth The candle and Threadbare are still the only "hard litrpgs" that have actually entertained me, there's just so much terrible writing in the genre it's painful to find the gems.

  Caverns and creatures / Critical Failures by Robert Bevan is more of a character driven comedy/adventure. Group of jackasses piss off their new GM, game master turns out to be a wizard who drops them into the game world. It's honestly hilarious, and while there's a modest amount of cruder humor, it usually fits in context and isn't disruptive to the story. It's really enjoyable, especially if things like the narrative disrupting popups that every litrpg since the gamer needs to have, are irritating to you. Character sheets are an actual item in this story, and the stats are secondary to the plot, closer to how things are in order of the stick and other stories that keep a nice plot/mechanic seperation.

  NPCS by Drew Hayes is another interesting "the tabletop game is a world", where the player characters die off rather early, and a few NPCs, in order to save themselves from the threat the dead PCs were supposed to handle, take up the quest, without the GM noticing.

  Super Powereds is also by Drew Hayes, mentioning it because it's finally all in audiobook form, and it's great. It suffers from some pacing issues, like only halfway through the last book do we finally understand the goal and motivation of the antagonist, but there's plenty of action and other character arcs to fill the space. The only major plotline irritation I have with that world is that it has the annoyingly common "cutoff system" where the students are trained and ranked and there's a drastic artificial culling system that ends with only 10 graduates and dozens of washouts with a massive amount of training they can't legally use.

  There's a new book by Yahtzee Croshaw, currently an audible exclusive, Differently Morphous. It's a novel in an urban fantasy world where the masquerade breaks. It has Eldritch horrors getting asylum in England, a student of magic who doesn't actually have magic, just an eidetic memory. It has an entire magical community learning the meaning of political correctness. I've loved his other novels, mixing his wonderful sense of humor with rather original settings.

  The Undead: Parts 1 - 18 by R R Haywood is a rather unfortunately named zombie survival series that I passed over for a long while. Despite the most bland title I've ever encountered, the actual contents would best be described as a zombie apocalypse happening inside a british comedy. It's got a lot of really solid characters, including one of the more realistic depictions of an autistic main character.

  The Curse Workers Trilogy by Holly Black is a wonderful thing. It's a fairly simple magic system, where some people have one of a handful of touch-based powers. This magic is well known, and among other things, has caused a society where gloves are just as socially important as pants.

  [17776: What football will look like in the future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football): A work of multimedia fiction by the always excellent Jon Bois about an immortal humanity, told by artificial intelligences. I laughed. I cried. I wondered. Not "rational" but very very entertaining.

  [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/), by Wildbow: You've heard of Worm? In my opinion, Twig is better. With a greater focus on characters than Pact and Worm, Twig blows his previous works out of the water. Having the classic Wildbow focus on worldbuilding, Twig portrays an extremely interesting setting, both in the biopunk aspects and the political ones, and how they are both intertwined. The first few arcs start off feeling like a tabletop roleplaying game, with a "monster of the week feel" (which Wildbow himself dislikes but I found fun). The story moves past that once the main plot is set up. A coming of age story on the backdrop of a colonial America filled with biologically engineered horrors, I consider Twig a must-read.

  [Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/prologue-2/), by Scott Alexander of SlateStarCodex. Unsong is based on a simple idea: what if the world ran on Judeo-Christian teachings? In 1968, Apollo 8 crashed into the heavenly crystal sphere surrounding Earth, causing physics to break down. The archangel Uriel comes down from heaven to hold Earth together, but it is irrevocably changed. A pun-lover's dream, Unsong is half Kabbalah-punk adventure romp, half alt history story, about rational-ish characters making their way through a world that makes little sense anymore.

  [Always Human](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/1-i-guess-thats-why-i-admire-her/viewer?title_no=557&episode_no=1): You want Utopian science fiction lesbian romance? Look no further because this is cute as hell and gives a very optimistic view of the future. Also well written romance between two girls that isn't toxic and doesn't end with either of them dying. Very slice of life. Very good.

  I also recommend [The Gods are Bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/), [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/), [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning), and [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126), but since you're on /r/Rational you've probably already heard of these.

  Main rec: I finished [Kings of Paradise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35994830-kings-of-paradise) by Richard Nell a few days ago, a self-published novel which only recently got a physical edition. As you can see it's been out for a year, but has less than 200 ratings on goodreads, which is unfortunate as it's the best fantasy novel I've read in a while. I highly recommend it.

  The two storylines start very slow, and took a long time to capture my full attention. For me it took about a week to read the first 60%, and half a day to read the remainder. 

  Other recs: 

  [Spinning Silver](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36896898-spinning-silver) by Naomi Novek. A decent "wild magic" type of story, with all female POVs. 

  [Injection by Warren Ellis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25787656-injection-vol-1). A graphic novel. Super AIs and shamanistic magic. My kind of weird. 

  [Life Reset 2: EvP](https://www.goodreads.com/series/214767-new-era-online) by Shemer Kuznits.  It's pretty good(for a litRPG). The first book didn't occupy a high place in my mind because of some weirdly bad interactions with a corporate lawyer, but it was still a pretty good story. The sequel does away with the bad and improves the good significantly. It's impressive how much the author improved. He managed to juggle the feeling of progression and keep the narrative tension high throughout a very long book.

      I would say that 2 of 3 of the main POV characters in Kings of Paradise are level 2 intelligent characters, and all are intelligent and fairly rational. The mechanics of the universe have not been deeply explored, and the characters are only starting to develop their powers, so it remains to be seen whether the author will do so rationally. I'd say the story as a whole is probably up to scratch in rationality.

      In Spinning Silver the protagonist is intelligent, but not a level 2 character. To put it simply, the story is a self-aware pastiche of a fable type story told in a fable format, kinda. It's clever, but almost purposely irrational, if that makes sense. 

      Injection has plenty of Level 2 intelligent characters and I would say so far what I've read of it is definitely rational.

      Finally I would not say that Life Reset 1 was a rational story, as a lot of the plot was flimsy and felt like "the plot required it". The second one avoids all those problematic plot points and retcons some of the worse ones, so it's much better in that regard. But it's still not particularly rational.

  I noticed a new series topping the list of [topwebfiction.com](https://topwebfiction.com) last month and decided to give it a try. I was a bit ambivalent about it for much of the first half, but really got sucked into it as the series went on. I just finished the most recent chapter last night, and decided I'd recommend [Metaworld Chronicles](https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles/chapter/163574/chapter-1-some-things-begin-something-ends).

  **Summary**: A 30-year old successful Australian business woman named Gwen Song awakens after a night out drinking to find herself in a parallel world. It is 2001, not 2017, and Gwen is a teenager again in an apartment she hadn't seen since she was 16. This new world is a startling mixture of familiar locations and faces from her old life and a completely different world altered by the existence of magic. Here, humanity lives in shielded cities guarded by powerful magisters in floating towers, to protect them from the magical and demi-human races that rule most of the Earth. Gwen, struggling with the dual nature of her old life and that of her new teenage self, vows to use her business accumen and this world's magic to establish herself and become a force of nature that will leave her mark on the world.

  **What I liked**: The magic and elemental system is well established and explored, and there's enough left unrevealed that the readers are constantly guessing what will happen next. The setting is also different from what I'm used to for isekai novels; this isn't Japan, Europe, or the US that's main-screen, it's alt-Austarlia and alt-China that serve as the backdrop. The author liberally sprinkles the text with regional slang and sayings, which helps the areas really feel differentiated. There is a lot of detail paid to both outfits and to food, which is not really what I'd expect in this kind of series but helps flesh out the settings. And the alternate history is really neat too, and has so far been pretty well done. Finally, the author seems to be writing at a crazy fast pace; they have released 160 chapters since September 2017. So constant updates are a plus!

  **What I didn't like**: There seems to be a LOT of grammatical and spelling errors peppered throughout the text. Words missing, tenses wrong, etc. This gives it a very amateur feeling at first, though it does seem to improve a bit over time. The author also doesn't seem to like timeskips AT ALL, which can make some of the chapters feel like a real slog. The attention to detail helps flesh out the world, but it also makes reading the 20th description of outfits get frustrating. The fast release pace helps negate this somewhat, though. And finally, the main character is a Mary Sue (albeit, at least a morally conflicted one). She's incredibly overpowered. In a world where most magic users have one school of magic and the strongest can attain four after decades of practice, she has FIVE by the time she's seventeen. She has access to a second elemental affinity, Void, which so far only two people in the entire world seem to possess. She befriends or is protected by some of the strongest mages in Australia and China, and is casually gifted items that only the 1% could could usually even dream of possessing. She's not invincible, but a good amount of the world seems invested in giving her the best protection and opportunities to grow. That said, she has a really interesting perspective caused by her dual lives/memories, and the big bad antagonist is intuited to be even stronger and infinitely more ruthless so you always get the impression that Gwen's not quite strong enough. She's basically a teenage Supergirl, with potential to be the strongest being on Earth but only if she gets years more experience and can somehow overcome an evil Superman-level foe.

  **Is it rational?** I'd say it's rational-adjacent. Gwen is intelligent, and frequently uses her abilities in a smart way to overcome challenges while staying true to her moral compass. She does make a lot of mistakes, but often this is because she doesn't know something about the new world or its factions, not because she's holding the idiot ball. Her goals make sense - she wants to make connections and increase her power before she really debuts, to protect herself from being used by any one political faction or worse - being captured and cut up as an experiment. The magic system is well developed and the cultural-social systems are realistically interconnected, which means that when a twist results from an event you can usually see how it happened when looking back. Really, the only parts that don't seem rational would be that the plot revolves around her to an unrealistic degree. While we get explanations for the times she's unexpectedly saved at the last moment, they still feel like deus ex machinas in the moment. As the series continues there's more foreshadowing than after-the-fact justifying, but it makes the first arc feel unsatisfying for quite a while.

  Anyway, I say it's worth reading. It's definitely one of those series that, when I caught up, I was anxiously awaiting what would happen next. I'm not sure why it suddenly showed up on topwebfiction, and is placed so strongly, but it's currently competing with Ward, A Practical Guide to Evil, and Wandering Inn for the top few weekly/monthly spots. I'd give it a solid 7-7.5/10, with it being weaker at the beginning.

    I tried it but it just didn't pass the sniff test for me. I read quite a bit into it, but the author never addressed how the two worlds have such different histories, and yet have so many similarities in the present. The same cities, the same nationalities, very similar geopolitics, and culture, and technological level. And yet the history is completely unrecognizable. 

    Worse is how Gwen meets the same familiar people with the same names and personalities and everything else, and yet on closer inspection they have wildly different backgrounds. And despite that, they are virtually identical to the counterparts gwen knew, to the point where Gwen doesn't even have to try to fit in or to clandestinely fill any knowledge gaps. It's never much of an issue that she would automatically pass as a native of an alternate dimension, hah.

    Does the author ever address this?
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      Not to the extent it would likely pass a smell test, no. There are comments on it (like how brands are the same, but have entirely unique features - like Audi cars existing, but running on magic crystals rather than gasoline). There is some talk about how in this world magic crystals replaced and removed entirely the need or desire for fossil fuels (if they even exist). Basically they are a naturally renewing but capped energy resource that provides great power on par with electricity without any environmentally or anthropologically dangerous byproduct. Like if humanity had harnessed solar power before even learning of petrol, and thus never even bothered to explore other options. There is also some rumination on how amazing it is that humanity survived to the modern day when magic study and scientific research didn't really begin until approximately the alt-Enlightenment. Which... again, strains credulity. Humanity *should* have been wiped out in its infancy, in all likelihood.

      If you can hold your breath and just go with it, it still works out fairly well. There are definite differences: no one's heard of Shakespeare, or at least he didn't write his most famous novels, which Gwen quotes extensively. Humanists like John Locke existed, but were famous because they were magisters. And many ancient countries and cultures existed and are remembered because their faiths included sectarian magic not available to others; so the Egyptians are referenced but are known as necromancers due to their (in)famous pharaohs, or Israelis exist, but they're a powerhouse due to their golems. 

      Not sure how far you got into it, but as I said before, I find the beginning to the be the weakest part. The world expands as it goes on, and the story becomes more interesting and engrossing as Gwen grows from a closeted high school teenager in "frontier" Sydney to a slightly-more-worldly college student in magical Shanghai.

  Author's summary:

    What made you like/recommend this story? Is it rational/rationalist? How does it stand out from everything else? Have you read the source material and would you recommend doing so?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I would reccomend the source material. Its not rational, but def8nitslly rational adjacent. What sold me on it as a series was it’s introduction, in which the MC dies, meets a being that stops time, calls itself god, and demonstrates various abilities like reincarnation and world shifting, but unlike the standard for this genre, realizes that this is, in fact, not nearly enough evidence to prove that their god, and that it’s rediculous to expect an educated modern person to beleive a tale that rediculous. He ends up getting in an argument with the god, which he dubs “being X,” and it ends up with him being reincarnated in not!1900s europe against his will. 

      As far as youjo senki / a young woman’s military record goes, its much harder to describe the story without major spoilers than just the setup, but it’s essentially isekai flashman, or maybe isekai ciaphas cain. The author puts a lot of effort into doing their research and has some very consistant worldbuilding, which is always great to see. I would heartily reccomend you give it a try, although if you decide to go with the.anime their choice for what to puut in the first episode doesnt do a good job of setting the series, esspecially relative to how the manga and light novel did it, but it does to a better job in other ways.

      All this is to say that the source material is good, and the fanfic is really good. It’s if you’ve seen the source material, but I introduced the fic to my brother and he’s able to keep up just fine without having seen the og series.

    Read through it since yesterday, it's quick since there are only several chapters so far. It was hilarious, gripping, and horrifying all at once. My reaction the entire time was basically "No... no... no... no no no no nononononoNO!" Like watching a slow motion trainwreck. I do find it odd that Tanya tried to take over in a manner that pretty clearly is going to make her into alt-Hitler. Considering she's the reincarnation of a modern day Japanese salaryman, I would have expected her to realize that xenophobia, militarism, and social upheaval would lead to a worse outcome than trying to, say, enact a rapid industrialization and modernization plan like Japan post-WW2. Granted, the Treaty of Versailles put post WWI-Germany in a MUCH different state than the Marshall Plan did with post WW2-Japan. Still, it teeters on the edge of disbelief that she wouldn't see the parallels to her own world's history.   
    Still, a good recommendation and one I'll probably catch up on again in several weeks when more chapters are out!

      She’s well aware of that. You seem to have missed the part where she’s trying to not get elected? She wants to rabble rouse enough to have a seat in parliament, hence drumming up a supporter base with nationalism and jingoism, but be so crazy she never has the widespread voter appeal to become a majority and never gets invited to a coalition.
      ```

        ```
        >  You seem to have missed the part where she’s trying to not get elected? 

        No, not at all. I mean she's groping the idiot ball at not seeing the obvious parallels to the modern world. Her oblivioucy is the silly part. "Let's point the anger at the alt-French, because they're not the Polish, or the Jews! This will never end poorly!"

        Or even in the more modern US age... Why does she think becoming Alex Jones is a great idea, rather than Elon Musk? She's acting like a sociopath, sure, but also like an ignorant one. 

        It's still fun, don't get me wrong. But also it requires accepting the protagonist (and author) are riding rails to WW2 at the expense of shoehorning Tanya into the role as alt-Hitler. It's horrifying and hilarious, but completely obvious.

  I would call the book semi-rational in that the worldbuilding is deep and thoughtful, and most if not all the characters have clear goals and realistic motivations. Though there are a few moments where the MC should have died but didn't because of Plot Armor. 4.5/5

  If any of you haven't read Blackwing the raven's mark you should.

  The main pros of the story are: 

  1. Author is a HEMA practitioner, he knows how combat works and how to write about it. 
  2. The story has accurate representations of god-like beings. Immortal people with incredible but limited powers, with deep plots and plans that can span 50 years. Gods how you'd imagine them to be, they are rational, calm, cold, cunning, ruthless planners and somewhat distant from human affairs.
  3. Interesting time period and world building, time period is basically renaissance europe, guns exist but they are bad and people still fight with swords and plate armor, with some magic powered technology. World building is basically a battle between 2 distinct god-like factions one with humans as pawns and the other as an eldritch sort of faction.

  It's one of the best fantasy books I've read in the past couple years, and I'm looking forward whatever that author releases next.
