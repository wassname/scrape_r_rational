## [Spoilers MOL 96] About: Tesen Zveri

### Post:

 Tesen Zveri was implemented as the caretaker for House Noveda, as such had REALY CLOSE connections to the Eldemar royalty and the crown ( Access to dagger?). Now here is the kicker: Zach alway fought Tesen in almost every restart for quite some time. Sure he was pissed about him, but really kicking his ass every restart? In the sense of the new knowledge about Zachs contract , shoudnt we revisit the case of Tesen?

  I thought it was only once every few restarts, and Zach seemed to frame it as a method to release some of his anger. Also, in that discussion, Zach seemed genuinely angry at both his caretaker and the government for basically robbing him out of most of his family's possessions. He was attacking him because 

  1) Easy, nearby, believable target to attack; &

  2) Zach is a mostly irrational, emotional person with a lot of focus on fighting.

  The reason Zach is pissed at him is because he's completely ruined Zach's entire family's fortune and inheritance while acting as a benefactor. He's pissed because he's been used without his knowledge, and with the tacit approval and knowledge of most noble clans, including the royalty. He's angry at him for perfectly justified reasons, so I don't see why this is the part you find particularly strange. If Tesen was Red Robe (as I think you're implying), then Zach should have observed unusual activity on his end at some point within the restart, or should have observed that he reacted differently in their fights, even in a very minor way. And Red Robe would have needed to have one simulacrum permanently dedicated to playing normal Tesen in every single restart in which he was still in the loop, doing the exact same actions, the same conversations, and using the same spells with the same proficiency. Although I realize that he could have just sent simulacrums to do this every time and therefore the real one would have no idea of exactly how tedious it truly is, this still seems unlikely to me.

  I assumed that Tessen and Zack had an early each restart encounter similar to Zorian and Ilsa.

  Probably something along the lines of Tessen runs into Zack as he's leaving for the day and because of the timeloop doesn't realize that it's a bad idea to try and assert the kind of authority adults try to assert over a teenager in their care who looks like he's going to go bar hopping instead of go to school.
  ```

- u/TheIssac:
  ```
  To be more specific Tesen would A) have tried to access Zachs mind to trigger that kind of aggressiv reaction or B) Have knowledge about the content of Zachs contract, thus forcing this very aggressiv behaviour from Zach. Maybe even without Zach knowing why exactly he is so angry. if there is a C) option i have missed it.
