  ```
  There was a chance Cat would lose before, when it was two roughly equivalent powers going against each other. Now it's Cat alone, backed into a corner, completely powerless against a minor god that just usurped her mantle. They're fucked.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    "If it looks like you can't possibly lose, you are to retreat immediately."
    ```

    - u/BlackKnightG93M:
      ```
      Only works for Heroes. 

      However, Winter is stripped from Cat. She mentioned previously that the bones of her previous Name Squire was still there underneath the flesh and blood that was Winter. 

      Squire was a Neutral Name. Who's to say she won't transition into a Heroic Name now that she's lost Winter? 

      Unlikely I suppose.

      Fret not though, Akua and her "Folly" is still unaccounted for...
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Cat is something better than a Hero though. She's a protagonist. Both on a meta level for the book we're reading and on a in story level with Fate. She has too many weighty connections in every corner of Calernia to be replaced so easily. She's the Arch Nemesis of the East, the primary reason the Crusade is happening. The story would break is she died and was replaced by just another Goddess to stand with the Dead King.
        ```

        - u/Locoleos:
          ```
          Sve Noc could pretend to be Cat though - that might well work, especially as Cat has taken oaths herself as the Sovereign of Moonless Night; "Cat" would at the very least be bound to make her best effort at forging the Liesse Convention as Cat envisioned it, and enforcing it afterwards. She might even be forced to work in Callow's best interest as she understands it.

          It's possible that Sve Noc, Sovereign of Moonless Nights might be close enough for story purposes.
          ```

          - u/Azzazeal:
            ```
            From what I understand Sve Noc will not be "of Moonless Nights". No one seems to be able to chose their fae title.
            ```

      - u/tavitavarus:
        ```
        Oh for... Cat is not a hero. She is never going to be a hero. I wish people would stop seizing on every opportunity to declare that she's suddenly going to change her entire personality and become a servant of the Heavens.

        This story is called 'A Practical Guide to Evil' for a reason.
        ```

        - u/King_of_Men:
          ```
          Of course she won't become a servant of the Heavens. But she's good at using narrativium to her purposes; she might be able to take on a Heroic role to screw the Heavens over.
          ```

          - u/tavitavarus:
            ```
            That's what a hero is. Someone who fills a cultural Role and is granted the power of a Name by the Gods Above. There's no such thing as a hero who isn't on the side of the Heavens. You don't get to be Named without the approval of either Above or Below, and Above only chooses people whose beliefs align with their cause.
            ```

  - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
    ```
    Sve Noc: “Eh, I can take her”
    ```

    - u/vimefer:
      ```
      \**Overreaches like a proper Villain and overdoses on Night, fulfilling Cat's promise to the Dwarves.*\*
      ```

- u/TaltosDreamer:
  ```
  Ooooh, she planned for this. The oaths. The oaths whose content we are not fully aware of, as well as the oaths upon her domain. Wow.

  It hurts more than I expected to see Cat hurting. I want so badly for her to succeed.
  ```

  - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
    ```
    Oh my god I see it now too. Sve Noc will go against the oaths that she is unknowingly accountable for. That is absolutely slick. I can't wait to see how this plays out.
    ```

    - u/vimefer:
      ```
      I think it instantly did, hence the Wintery splash zone left all over Great Strycht. RIP Sve Noc.

      (Edit) Ah well, wrong on that. Sve Noc got a reprise, but I suspect it's not gonna hold for long.
      ```

  - u/soonnanandnaanssoon:
    ```
    Oh. This is actually really brilliant.
    ```

- u/BlackKnightG93M:
  ```
  10 denari says Wednesday is a Black interlude with the Pilgrim. 

  Any takers?
  ```

  - u/Just_some_guy16:
    ```
    That would fit with the cliffhangers we have been seeing lately
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      More specifically, it would fit a Wednesday: this is typically the chapter at the end of which the weekly cycle has its lowest point. Cat's already lost most of her power and (probably) sigil. To top that EE would either have to harm Indrani or display the greater picture *also* going to shit.
      ```

- u/RUGDelverOP:
  ```
  Man, I thought we'd get a *little* farther in before it all went to shit. Sure, no one's dead yet, but this seems pretty bad.
  ```

  - u/soonnanandnaanssoon:
    ```
    Imo, this is pretty much the worst case scenario which I didn't expect for Cat. Assuming Winter was unleashed before she lost it (which seems to be the case), I doubt her entire Drow sigil would have survived. Maybe the Mighty might have survived, but I don't expect anything below her Lords to survive Winter. So not only she loses her power equaliser against Heroes the level of SoS & GP, she loses her anti-army weapon that gave her an edge over Procer & Praes, loses control over the remaining Fae left, she doesn't get any military manpower that she originally went to the Drow for, and if Indrani is dead, Masego would be highly emotionally crippled while the Woe loses their Narrative advantage of a 5-man band. And this is all that I can list off the edge of my mind over lunch.
    ```

    - u/werafdsaew:
      ```
      No way, the worst case scenario is if she loses but didn't plan for it.  She did, and we're going to just have to see what happens next.
      ```

- u/Gr_Cheese:
  ```
  >Choosing my words with great care, I grinned and met its gaze.

  >“Take me to your leader,” I ordered.

  Oath shenanigans. Cat already won. 

  Was the whole 'Get everyone brawling in the middle of the city!' plan actually a plan? Was it the author deceiving the reader or was there some meta-purpose I'm missing? Would the Brawl-City plan have had a preferable outcome? Because Sve Noc combining Winter and Night, then inadvertently oath-ing every Drow seems like the best possible outcome outside of just beating literally everyone into submission.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  The whole drow arc lacks narrative weight for me.  It's a side show.  Even if Cat loses Winter to some z-list wannabe God, her long term goals and desires won't have been affected.  Oh no, she lost something she didn't want.... And also, fights with the Drow are starting to look like the *Matrix 3*; the more powerful the fighters, the less interesting the fight.  Because of all of this it's hard to feel invested in the fight or the characters.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Until the drow Apotheosis engine was unveiled, I almost thought the same thing. Now it seems like she's fallen into something beyond her control.
    ```

  - u/Werthet:
    ```
    Agreed, I'm exhausted by this arc. It's a whole lot of battle-jerking, random terms and pointless names, it's like a bunch of bad web-serial tropes suddenly showed up.

    At least her losing her mantle is an interesting development.
    ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  This feels like one of those chapters that would need *heavy* editing before being in a published book. I've no doubt EE had a vision in mind while writing this, but I think it fell a bit short of audience understanding.

  Hopefully proper editing will be able to improve it if/when it's published.
  ```

- u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
  ```
  Side note, what ever happened to the demon inside Cats soul that stole her third aspect? I don't quite remember how that was resolved.
  ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    so yes like the other guy said but i'll make it more detailed.

    her third aspect was supposed to be "seek", were she could basically get information she needed, but that one got corrupted by the demon so she lost it by having apprentice cutting it out permanently crippling the name of squire for her.

    then she lost her name by having it stolen by the goblin before her resurrection, but by killing him she claimed it again but rather then getting the same name she had before, she got it granted anew with all 3 aspects so then she had potential for 3 aspects yet again.

    then with winter making a deal with her with her heart being replaced and her nature shifted her third aspect became fall, that makes things enter the domain of winter.
    ```

  - u/asdfion:
    ```
    Cut out by Apprentice (iirc including the aspect), then all aspects got reset in the Liesse shenanigans
    ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  Sve Noc... two faced goddess... Cat's schtick often relies on usurping power from a superior entity via narrative... Akua has been building herself up as a "tool without personality" while Catherine has been digging into her out of curiosity about how much humanity she has left... cat's power almost always comes with a cost, but with winter, it seems like she doesn't really have anything left to lose...

  But there is.

  Cat's personality itself.

  Half of her humanity.

  What if... 

  Cat usurps the mantle/Name/Title of the two faced goddess...

  ... with her alter ego being Akua?

  Then the oath with Vivienne would essentially have to be applied to herself... as Akua is a *part* of her, a tool. Ending of the final book having Catherine/Akua face off against her former friends... the ultimate climactic fight!
