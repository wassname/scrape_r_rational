  Some unrelated unrelated thoughts;

  1). It's gotta be really annoying to constantly unpersonned as a villain, re the Proceran contingent. 

  2). Not allowing the possession check seems bad policy. Its clearly a good idea and costs her nothing and removes any red flags that the haranguing she's about to give is from anyone other than her. 

  3). I thought Cat already grasped Juniper's strategic goals and didn't disagree with them, I would think her presumption would be that the setbacks were unavoidable or impossible, rather than that Juniper screwed up, given her history of competence, I'm unsure why she's going in so angry at her, rather than just getting updated as quickly as possible.

    For #2, I don't think that the problem was that they wanted to check her - even she said it was a good idea - it's that they were essentially taken her into custody in front of her soldiers. It completely undermines her and her authority, and probably would have started some nasty rumours too. If they had waited until she was inside the tent and done it privately Cat probably would have been okay, if not pleased, that they were making sure everything was what it seemed.

    It's actually pretty far from what you say:

    2) The possession check is (1) useless because if Cat was possessed by Winter or any other Eldritch entity, it's not 25 footmen and 15 mages who can do anything to stop her. Vivienne might be, with the Oaths, and it's another reason why her not being there was a major screw up. If Cat was really possessed, their only chance was Vivienne being at the front to use the oaths and not at the back so Cat destroy half the army if she wanted to do something bad and (2) was undermining her autority. If you have to do tests on your fucking queen, no matter how sensible it is, you don't do it in public, right after she saved your ass in a major way and cleaned up after your screw up. And it leads to (3), if Cat was possessed, her first move after getting in there WOULDN'T be to end a procer charge at a huge personnal risk, save Callow's Army and try to get a cease-fire. (Which kind of eldritch entity would do that? Just that would be a definite proof that she was not possessed)

    3) She never said anything about agreeing with their goals. Empting Callow of soldiers when Praes is back into the game (no more crusade aimed at them for now), with major frontiers conflicts was not the right move. Trying to intimidate Cordelia when she has her hands full with the Dead king was not the right move. And the worst of all, relying on a fucking magical trick for everything in the plan (the magical gates) was NOT THE RIGHT MOVE when you know that it will obviously fail at the worst moment (and surprise! It did!) and everyone (Hakram, Vivienne, Juniper) should know better than that.

    You can add to that the whole separation scene in book 4. Vivienne tells clearly to Cat that she can't be trusted with negociation. And in the end, Cat perfectly fulfilled her mission, while Vivienne made a continental mess when it REALLY wasn't needed. Typical case of talking big and deliver little. So yeah, it was 100%, 200%, 300% deserved on ALL aspects.

      You're playing a very shallow game here. I can think of several eldritch entities that might do such a thing;  in Charles Stross' *Laundry Files* series, The Mandate is such a character. The Mandate cares about operating within human laws, for some reason, and this is part of why >!he saves the Laundry from an existential threat by convincing Parliament to reauthorize their existence!<
      ```

      - u/Keyenn:
        ```
        Nobody cares about what other characters or things from others books and universes would do. Here, no angel, demon, devils, titled fae or anything else would do such a thing. Period.
        ```

        - u/boomfarmer:
          ```
          I do not believe it would be out of character for the Tyrant of Helike or the Hierarch of the Free Cities to, having possessed Cat somehow, negotiate a ceasefire between her army and its antagonists. The Tyrant would do it for teh lulz and because he might need their assistance later. The Hierarch would do it because the killing was not sanctioned by the People.
          ```

    2 and 3 point to something very much not good

    ```
    Cat gets angry when her soldiers die. She didn't get to maim a few thousand people to work it off this time, so it is taken out on friends.
    ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  That seems oddly out of character for Cat.  We don't know how the hell the battle happened, and with heroes on the other side I'm not sure what she expected.  The mages sent to escort were reasonable to check the possibility she was Sve Noc in Cat's body.
  ```

  - u/killingnik:
    ```
    It's reasonable to check that it's really Cat. But not in the way they did it. It totally looked like they were throwing a coup.
    ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  I was annoyed at first by how Cat acted, especially since she knew the situation more-or-less from Hakram but didn't tear HIM a new one. I'm guessing her being so angry is a combination of factors:

  1. Two of the four armies of Callow were about to get wrecked - and would have, if she hadn't appeared when she did. That would have been a pointless loss, in a larger war where every loss is unacceptable.
  2. Juniper is a brilliant commander who always makes the right decision - which makes her predictable. That's how Cat's described her since they first met. It's a huuuuge weakness when you get heroes and villains and fae involved, because those all operate not on tactics - which Juniper is amazing at - but on narrative... which Juniper failed to account for. That Vivienne, an-until-recently heroine, also didn't account for the narrative bit of "villains always suffer failure at a critical moment" is even more egregious.
  3. The security measures are common-sense if some simple mage was impersonating Cat, but were utterly useless for what they were supposed to accomplish. 40 soldiers would not stop a corrupted Winter demi-goddess. Sending Hune to lead them was an unintentional rebuke to a steadfast soldier. And the queen does not subject herself to something like that, especially in front of her armies. Doing so would be as good as declaring that she places herself beneath and subject to her regent and her general. As Black once said: **We do not kneel.**

  So it feels like Cat's anger makes sense when you think about it. She understands why Juniper and Vivienne acted like they did, and the logic behind their choices. But their inability to see the larger context almost led them to annihilation; and their refusal to come out and atone for their mistakes made them seem like they were looking down on Cat and her position. The stakes are too high for them to mess up this badly. I think I just was annoyed by her behavior because I want them all to get along immediately and kick butt as a team again.
  ```

  - u/Keyenn:
    ```
    Actually, no, the whole possession check makes no sense at all no matter how you look at it. If they wanted to have a remote chance to handle the "oh-cat-was-possessed" situation, Vivienne HAD to be at the front to use her Oaths. If Cat was possessed, never ever she would have tried to protect the army of Callow and managed to get a ceasefire.
    ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  I wonder if they'll just gate back to Callow when night falls.
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    Cat didn't recognize the fae on her trip there. Might be more dangerous than it used to be, with her Winter gone and the old courts merged into something else.
    ```

    - u/bubby_cat2:
      ```
      How many of her old pacts were tied to her title rather than her person? Most of them, yes?
      Is the Hunt even under her nominal control anymore?
      ```

      - u/Gr_Cheese:
        ```
        It annoys me that we were never given a proper explanation of oaths, and the difference being Fae made regarding them. Obfuscating those oath rules to the reader while allowing characters to take advantage of them in-story is anti-rational fiction.

        Also regarding oaths, given the intricate oaths that Thief used to thwart Akua possessing Cat, it seems theoretically possible that someone could get a couple thousand slaves together and create a computer equivalent or start some hive mind shenanigans.
        ```

      - u/Mountebank:
        ```
        My bet is that Sve Noc inherited the Wild Hunt alongside Winter, with the exception of Larat who I think has a personal oath with Catherine, not her title.
        ```

        - u/bubby_cat2:
          ```
          I believe it, BUT - I'll say split loyalties in the Hunt sounds like setup for a fight to me.
          ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  Well then. Looks like the Vivienne betrayal plot is back on track. Poor Hakram lost his hand for nothing.
  ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    Very unhappy about how Cat handled the reunion. I have absolutely no idea what angle she is playing here.
    ```

    - u/bubby_cat2:
      ```
      Honestly I felt like her actions almost convinced me she WAS compromised somehow
