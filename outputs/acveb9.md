  The Optimised Wish Project is finally back after the Christmas pause - with the start of the new Tenkaichi Tournament arc! This chapter throws around a lot of details and new characters, so hopefully it'll get hyped for the follow up.

  One small thing: I remark in the chapter that Baba the Sybil is 'almost four hundred years old'. This is actually inconsistent with the official Dragon Ball timeline, in which she's more than five hundred. The reason for this change is that it allows me to adjust a bit the matter of her being Muten Roshi's sister without completely messing up the timeline or having to allow for their parents to be immortal. I'll go into stuff that ties a bit more into this next chapter, so I thought I'd just lay it down.

    I like the Baba change, for exactly that reason. A 200 year gap between siblings in a mostly-mortal civilization raises so many questions you could right a whole book trying to answer them.

      We know Muten *isn't* mortal, as he says he's drank the Elixir of Immortality in canon, and the same should go for Baba. Also for the Crane Hermit (who was around at the same time when they fought Piccolo) and Tao Pai Pai (who was his brother). Since we're talking about two who studied under the same master, Mutaito, and their closest relatives, my interpretation of it is that they all got it from the same source, but that requires me to put Baba and Muten's ages closer.

  This story is getting consistently better and better. You're really good at hyping us up for future arcs without giving us terrible cliffhangers. I think it's cause you give us a bunch of things happening currently while also doing foreshadowing. It's fast paced without being too crazy.

  I honestly forgot all about the red ribbon army arc so most of this is reading like new to me and I love it.

    Ahah, thanks :). I can tell you, besides having some old names and faces or references here and there, the RR arc will resemble very little of the canon one. In fact, from here on, almost nothing will resemble canon.

  I got the weird urge to make a rational DBZ/DBS fighting game. Years and years ago I worked on a DBZ mod for LieroX with a group of friends, which became strangely popular. 

  My thinking is: what if I compile a database of all moves and transformations, and map the abilities to a table of every documented feat and all claims of absolute and relative strengths, power levels, speeds, etc.?

  If I start with Mike Tyson as a human of high ability, and find that Goku's base strength is 1000 stronger, SS1 is 50 times that, SS2 is 50 times that, then how hard could he hit?

  Same thing with speed. I'd adjust the game speed so the character's reaction time matches the player - between 0.25 and 0.3 seconds. At high power levels, thrown objects would seemingly travel in straight lines, etc. I'd probably have to implement Special Relativity to avoid attacks going faster than the speed of light.

  Of course, there are some characters that are unphysical - I think that rabbit from DBS went FTL, in fact. And there are lots of conflicting data points about power levels. But a data-driven Dragon Ball simulation sounds like a lot of fun, both to develop and dick around in.

  I just need to find that mod so I don't have to redo all the artwork, because *damn*!

  Anyway, since you are into rational fiction and dragon ball, what do you suggest is the best way to go about compiling this database I need? Is the Dragonball Wiki the authoritative source? Is there a site with transcriptions from the show that I could datamine?

    Something like 12 years ago, the two primary online references for power balance and feats and such were the Gamefaqs forums (lots of power level debates, or that was the reputation at least), and the Daizex (now Kanzenshuu) forums (mostly took the "power levels are bullshit" position, but people still wound up debating these things anyway). The Death Battle episodes on Goku vs Superman try to quantify some of these, and used a lot of the same references.

    Some of the general points and recurring disagreements, as I recall:

    * Daizex users strongly opposed the idea that any of the characters moved faster than light, other than via shunkan'iido (Goku's teleportation) or Kai-kai (Kibitto / Kaioshin (I forget which) teleportation). The comment about Raditz moving ftl was dub/anime only, iirc. The only points of obvious contention were in the Buu arc (I have not looked at post-BoG feat discussions, so this might have changed), particularly the bit where Gotenks flies around the Earth several times and the amount of time that passes is unclear.
    * Big point of disagreement, power level-wise, goes a couple different directions. Neither community was united on any of these points, but fwicr, Daizex favored less power inflation, while everywhere else favored more (particularly for the humans post-Freeza). There was a period where there were two different families of power level lists, due to a translation error in Greg Warner's ... dayaizenshuu 4 or 7, I think? In which Hreeza and Goku had their powers off by a factor of 10 (12m / 15m, when the actual value was 120m / 150m). I think recent guidebooks and statements have made the post-Freeza transformations more confusing, whereas previously, there were apparently statements somewhere to the effect of ssj levels going 50-2-4-500, presumably cumulative, although ssj4 was confusing and GT is a consistency nightmare anyway, especially with Super in the mix.
    * Discrepencies between Anime and Manga caused weird results, such as Kid Buu being the most powerful Majin in the Anime, whereas the evidence in the Manga favors Super Buu + absorbtions. I don't remember it ever being resolved whether or not Gohan was SSJ2 during his fight with Dabra, and Manga vs Anime made this more confusing. Then there's the Anime filler in which Yamcha is holding his own against characters who could one-shot superperfect Cell, which Daizex users generally rejected altogether.
    * One area frequently debated was scale-of-destruction feats. As I said, Daizex tended to err on the side of the lesser interpretations, so claims such as Cell's solar system busting were treated with skepticism, and it was pointed out that there was nothing saying that Buu or Broli destroyed galaxies in single attacks, rather than over time (I don't remember anyone explaining how they traveled from planet to planet, though).
    * A guy by the handle of Herms translated lots and lots of reference material over the past decade. I recall a sticky in the Kanzenshuu In-Universe forum that organized these, including which were relevant for strength/feat debaters. When this was originally going on, the DB Wiki was pretty terrible, but seems to have improved greatly since, and occasionally cites Herms's translations. So unless I missed something in the past 5 years, Herms's translations are probably the most reliable.
    * And the gag parts of early DB throw a wrench into everything, never mind the destructions of the moon (Kami fixed it the first time, but why there was no apocalypse after he died, I do not know. Maybe Popo couldn't take Goku to the Saiyan fight because Kami had him making sure the destruction of the moon wouldn't break things five minutes later?).

    The one thing that I occasionally saw floated around, but was never really elaborated on, is the question of what kind of scale Battle Powers really are. Are they linear? Logarithmic? What about Babidi's Kiri/Kili system? There's a bossfight for Goku around each order of magnitude: The Muten Roshi was in the 100s, iirc, Raditz 12-1500 (it's confusing depending on the source), Vegeta at 18000, then 180000 as Great Ape, Ginyu at 150k, Freeza at somewhere above 1.5m and below 60m during most of his fight with bass Goku, then 120m at 100%. And some people looked at these matchups and concluded that a difference of something like 1.3x is enough to one-shot someone, but that was never really confirmed, afaik. So is a single point worth much, or do they have diminishing value the higher you go?

    As you may have guessed, the subject is extremely confusing and of dubious consistency, and many have made a hobby of trying to make sense of it. Just about everyone has to have their own Power Level list, filling in blanks or uncertainties left by the official lists. It's going to be quite the adventure to untangle it all.

    [Here is Herms' guide-guide](http://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=9633), which includes just about everything you'd need. More specifically, you'd want to look at the Strength Checker, which supposedly contains every strength-related statement in the franchise up to its last update.

      Wow, all of this was incredibly helpful, thanks!
