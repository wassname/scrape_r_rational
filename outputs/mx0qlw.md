## Thoughts on Mage Errant?

### Post:

I just recently read the full mage errant series, and while reading the later books in the series much of the politics of the story reminded me of a slightly more straightforward PGTE. 

Also, one of the primary criticism I've seen leveled at it by the r/ProgressiveFantasy crowd is that the later books drift away from being Progression fantasy and towards Rational fiction. 

So I was curious if the people here who have read those novels considered it rational fiction or not, and am interested in the general thoughts on the series by those who have read it.

  Books 3 and especially 4 didn't fit the "progression" category as much, but book 5 very much did. (I don't think it's a criticism either way, though, just a categorization.)

  I would also call it rational fic for several reasons, though:
  - Lots of active exploration of "what would the political implications of this magic system actually be?"
  - Long-term goals based on that, e.g. Kanderon sponsoring Liches because they encourage stability.
  - The parts of magic that don't seem to make sense (affinities for human-made categories like "fire", "stone", "dreams", etc.) are also puzzling to the characters for the same reasons.
  - Characters with seemingly weak affinities like paper being powerful mostly because they figure out clever ways to use them.

  It definitely has rational elements.

  The approach the main characters take to magic is actually fairly scientific. Most of their improvements are incremental through practice, with occasional breakthroughs. New spells are generally learned and practiced before being used in combat instead of made up on the fly. The major upgrades that occurred in book 5 were all products of research. The whole magic system and how it's partially related to language and human understanding/belief is also quite rational compared to many systems. Magic also follows a scientific progression, where new discoveries are built on previous ones (think Loarna talking about how wards have improved).

  Even more importantly, its not just the main characters who find creative ways to use their powers. Most of the notable archmages/great powers have actually explored their powers and found ways to abuse them. Artur's "breathless" spell, Alustin's whole style (and the silk mage he based it on), Heliothrax's body mods, Kanderon's planar/crystal armor, Clan Castis, etc. Pretty much everyone whose abilities we get any detail on has their own creative way to use their powers, and lots of the enemies who we don't get details on have "they have some method to do X, but its a secret our POV doesn't know". There are very few named characters whose powers are "this guy can throw fireballs". Big difference from many books where only the MC ever does anything to abuse his powers.

  Finally, the characters generally act rationally (except when it's teenagers acting like teenagers over romantic issues). The political system is extremely believable, to the point where it's hard to imagine it working any other way or how the MCs can change it. Character's reactions to the system are also quite realistic.

  It's good, I liked it, waiting for the next book to come out. Kind of wish the characters suffered some reasonable costs for doing the crazy stuff they do and taking the risks they take. i.e losing a limb or at least some fingers, or an eye, or some teeth, anything permanent really, it stretches my disbelief to see people (specially children) in combat that often and still not have suffered any kind of permanent damage..

  Also, I like the fact that children aren't saving the world or doing anything like it. I tend to dislike seeing children doing that type of thing because it's quite silly.

  Everyone the children go up against turn stupid or don't think about using their abilities (especially mobs). 

  The children are also too strong.

  Beyond this, it is a fairly rational world tho. Nice world building.
