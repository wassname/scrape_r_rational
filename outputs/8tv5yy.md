  There are actually only [two emotional states](https://puu.sh/ALZlh/30d5924043.png) for both heroes and villains, no matter what both sides would like you to think.
  ```

- u/Yes_This_Is_God:
  ```
  General Catastrophe is new best girl and Legion X Horribilis is the name of my new band
  ```

  - u/Turniper:
    ```
    Basically a Hunter X Hunter Episode title.
    ```

  This is great. Now there is no way into Callow besides the Stairway, so Cat essentially has a whole year where she is guaranteed safe from invasions from Procer. Stairway would be a bitch to assault if it were guarded by an army, so even after that Callow is fairly safe. This means Cat could (in theory) pop over to Black, Gate his whole army home to Praes, and that'd be it for the crusade, assuming they don't open up the Vales somehow.
  ```

  - u/swaskowi:
    ```
    Uh oh, you're saying the villains can't lose? RIP Cat.
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      I think it's the the crusade - which is distinct from the heroes - can no longer win.

      I think a question there is whether the Pilgrim, in his role as an observer accompanying such a plan, would be free to try to kill Black.
      ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    Forgot about her being able to do that at his request.

    That was the main flaw in this, to my mind, was that he's giving up every advantage he had.  Chasing after the heroes means they can just turn back and pound his army, and even going the other way will likely have them show up due to the "heavens" tilting things in their favor.

    Being able to Gate back if things look to grim before the fight?  Perfect.
    ```

      yeah, this is basically bonfire all over again, only better- because it isn't "evil villains pre-emptive striking civilians", it is "defending army getting trapped in hostile territory, running from superior numbers" and after playing catch with Papenheim for a while, they still can gtfo via gate. I hope this works out.
      ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        This would be PERFECT timing for the Hierarch and the Tyrant to invade.
        ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  My guess is that neither Witch nor Warlock died in their battle.  Very unsure about that though.
  ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    If you don't see the [body](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody), they're still alive.
    ```

    - u/NotACauldronAgent:
      ```
      With a mage of Warlock’s caliber? If you do see the body, it’s probably a trick.
      ```

      - u/Halinn:
        ```
        Maybe after you have both seen the body, and somebody else has claimed the Name, will you know it for sure

        Know for sure that Wekesa has gotten a new name and his powers are more terrifying than ever before
        ```

        - u/PrettyDecentSort:
          ```
          I don't think we've been given any reason to believe that non-transitional names can get upgraded.
          ```

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            Any name->Dread Emperor for example.
            ```

          - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
            ```
            To be honest, I’m happy Wekesa didn’t see Cat after she went full-winter since he might get ideas about weaving his soul into his name. Or, if he did, he didn’t notice it. I mean, Akua missed it and she was bound to Cat for a quite a while.

            (Also, I just realized that *absolute positioning* seems to be a version of Warlock’s **imbricate** except with stories and narratives instead of physical parallels. Masego is definitely his father’s son)
            ```

          - u/Nimelennar:
            ```
            I'm pretty sure that any villainous Name can be upgraded to Dread Empress/Emperor, but I don't know if that's an example of a general rule allowing any Name to be upgraded, or a specific exception for a post-transition Name that can only be won by conquest.
            ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    Mine is that they got shifted into another plane and there continue their battle.

    Likely Hell #720.  Just being there doesn't give Warlock a huge advantage, so he's not signing his own narrative death warrant, but they can continue to cut loose at full power without harming either side.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  "Attack ze army."

  "But I am le tired."

  "Okay, first we take ze nap, then WE ATTACK ZE ARMY!"
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  General Catastrophe sounds like such a delight to work with.
  ```

- u/Taborask:
  ```
  I think Black is intentionally trying to get his whole army killed, but in a way that dilutes Procer's Crusade story. This has the double effect of removing a lot of the people who would object to Cat's near certain rebellion, and helps reduce a large threat to her rule
  ```

  - u/hoja_nasredin:
    ```
    so whatever happens Black will say keikaku and die.
    ```

    - u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
      ```
      Isn't one of the signs of a great general that all paths lead to victory?
      ```

- u/King_of_Men:
  ```
  So I was going to object that, if Warlock could just block the Vales, why didn't they do that in the first place? But then of course there wouldn't be a great decisive battle of Good and Evil, so Above would, so to speak, move heaven and earth to interfere with that plan.
  ```

- u/sparkc:
  ```
  I loved seeing how a great general like Klauss was entirely outshone by another great general (Black) who also has knowledge of Names and stories and how they interact with the battlefield.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    That, and Pappenheim went into this fight assuming that Black's goal was to defend the Vales. He planned accordingly and got destroyed when Black's actual goal was to invade Procer.
    ```
