  I would start with the stories in the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index). [The Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) is a decent, relatively short one. And by short I mean normal book length rather than epic 10 volume series length like some of the stories on here. It's about treating superman like a villain.

  But I don't know if it's a good idea to pick up a hobby just to get someone to notice you. You're better off talking to him and asking him what he would recommend, then going off and reading it so you can discuss it with him.

    This is excellent advice

      Rational advice even!

  Looking over the wiki or [tvtropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic) page will give you a good idea of what it is, and list a bunch of examples so you can see what strikes your interest, particularly if there are any fandoms that you like that there's rational fanfiction of (Harry Potter, Pokemon, Twilight, Naruto, Animorphs, Superman, Terminator, etc).

  Also you should know that the community is small enough that, if your crush likes rational fiction and reads it often, they probably frequent this subreddit and will see this post :P

      I'd also add that if you're close enough to this person that you get to hear them speak passionately about their love of rationalist fiction you're probably in a good place for pursuing something. So good luck lmao

  If that is your motivation I will reiterate what other's have said: Ask him what he would recommend reading and likes, that way you can discuss stuff in common.

  The next answer is that there is a lot of fan-fiction based rationality writing. Go to the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works) or [tvtropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic) (scroll down to examples and pick fan fiction) and find one from a universe you like. [Hpmor](http://www.hpmor.com/) is considered an important work, and is a good choice if you like Harry Potter.

  The final answer is my personal favorite: [Worth the Candle](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle) (you can read the first 14 chapters, book 1, and see what you think).

  [HPMOR](http://hpmor.com) is the quintessential rationalist work. I read it because someone attempted to *criticize* it by calling it Harry Potter with the plot of Ender's Game, which obviously meant I was required to read it immediately.

  [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) is the genre breaker of superhero fiction. If you've always been bothered by superhero worldbuilding that just doesn't make sense, this one is for you.

  [UNSONG](http://unsongbook.com) is Bible fanfiction which takes a look at what the world would look like if every single thing in the Bible were true, including and especially the contradictory bits. It manages to be hilarious to both me, an antitheist, and my father, a theologian.
  ```

    ```
    Oh cool. I'd really like to know which bits your theologian father enjoyed the most due to his knowledge.
    ```

    ```
    These are all definitely great examples of the rational genre, but aren't super suitable for someone just looking at getting a taste of it, due to the sheer length of these things. They're more what I'd recommend if someone said "So, I tried rational fiction and loved it, what are some stories I can sink my teeth into?"
    ```

  ```
  Not sure what counts as "rational fiction" but the Crystal trilogy is amazing and you should read it.
