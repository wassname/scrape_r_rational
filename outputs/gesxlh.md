  A short "AI in a box" story, with a small twist that has probably been done before.

  I like the idea, but I'm confused.  Is it simulating actual people in the real world, or is it simulating speculative placeholders for "the project manager," "the person with the 'key' to the 'box,'" etc.?

  If the latter, I don't see the value, considering that different people will react differently to different stimulus (unless it's simulating dozens of different people to talk to, of which "Arti" is just one).

  If Arti is supposed to be an actual simulation of the real person who would come and talk to the inductor in the case of an anomaly...  Then does Arti really have a coworker named Jen Erative?

    As I think you picked up on, the names were meant to be a hint that the people were fake.  ("Arti" is short for "artificial" which probably wasn't obvious, "Jen Erative" I think is pretty straightforward.)  The section "It didn’t feel real. Arti realized his heart was hammering. When had that started? He couldn’t even remember what he’d been working on earlier, everything outside of the facility was a vague blur of unimportance." was also supposed to be a hint.

    The AI is basically wargaming; simulating lots of different types of people and seeing how different approaches affect them.  Arguably a superintelligence would do this in some more abstract way rather than literally simulating a bunch of universes, but eh, it's a story.

      Arti is unfortunately close enough to being a reasonable name that I didn't pick up on it.  And yes, I caught that the *immediate* past of Arti was left unclear, but I wasn't sure if that meant that Arti was fake, or that, he was real, and that part was intentionally being left vague because the inductor can't control events before the interviewer arrives, so it isn't bothering to simulate them.
      ```
