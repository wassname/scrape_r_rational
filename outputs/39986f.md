## [Q] Can a dumb protagonist exist in a rational work?

### Post:

Excuse the over-simplistic title.

From the sidebar, the characteristics of ratfic are:

1. Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
2. Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
3. The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
4. The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

Assuming a work has 1, 2, and 4 covered, but the characters are "dumb":

- they make basic mistakes in thought
- they don't learn or not the right lessons
- *but* they still solve problems by making decisions using their knowledge and resources
- they don't just flip a coin or "go with their gut"

(Edit: in short, taking №3 and removing the word "intelligent", making: __The characters solve problems through the ~~intelligent~~ application of their knowledge and resources.__)

Would this hypothetical work still be rational? If not, what could redeem it, short of making the work comply with characteristic №3?

### Comments:

  ```
  The thing that can redeem it is if it highlights mental skills for the reader, for pedagogical purposes or otherwise.

  For example, you could argue that some of Pratchett's Rincewind books qualify (The Last Continent being a favorite of mine) despite most of the main characters being quite stupid. We might formulate a general rule about satire, like - In satire, stupidity by the characters should highlight good thinking rather than obscuring it.

  Another sort might be stories where the setting is wonderfully imagined and stands regardless of the characters. Stephenson's Diamond Age might qualify as this, for example.

  Yet another might be if the story's plot is clever and understandable by the reader, either through chance or the actions of intelligent background characters. Ringworld might exemplify some of this.

  Or if the story simply focuses on thinking without worrying about intelligence in particular. For example, The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-time.

  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

  I would like to see more works discussing low-IQ rationalists, people who are very careful, unjudgemental, well tempered, but who arn't very good at identifying patterns, noticing things[1] thinking of novel solutions or exploring implications.

  That last thing might make it difficult for them to invalidate cached thoughts when they ran into counterevidence for past assumptions, which may be hard to reconcile with rationality. I imagine they would have to be highly disciplined. That may result in their ultimately seeming a lot more competent than many of the better endowed characters around them.

  [1]: but they know how little they see. If asked, "Did you see the gorilla walk through the scene?" They would not respond "No, I can't believe there was a gorilla", they would tell you that they were paying attention to the players, as instructed, not the presence or absence of gorillas on the court, and they would not have noticed any if there had been.
  ```

    ```
    Unless the character is already aware of the power of focus (which isn't what I would expect from a stupid person), his answer sounds underconfident. It's a surprising result that something that obvious can be hidden, because normally the brain is very good at sifting through visual data and noting irregularities. Expecting it to suddenly fail for the gorilla just because you're focussing seems unwarranted.
    ```

    - u/IWantUsToMerge:
      ```
      Good point. I guess I'm assuming, just as they'd have to have a lot of discipline, they'd have to have mad introspection, they'd need to know their limits very well to even look like a rationalist, since they've got so many.

  A dullard protagonist won't work in all probability.

  *Two* dullard protagonists *will work*, because they can *talk it out* in full view of the reader. Watch Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.

  It would be really difficult. The sidebar guidelines are only half the story; there are other, more nebulous characteristics that define rational fiction as a genre (or ethos). Competence and intelligence, specifically in the protagonist, are definitely part of it.

  You can definitely have a character who's *flawed* in some way. Hubris, overconfidence, social awkwardness, things like that. A protagonist who has some specific failure mode in their thinking is almost a staple. The thing is, those flaws can be overcome, or laid bare. Plain dumbness sort of can't.

  The other big problem is that you have to think long and hard about "because the plot requires it". It would be really easy to railroad the plot with the character's dumb actions, and "the character didn't think of it" is often identical to an asspull.

    Could you elaborate a little on this /u/alexanderwales? It would be useful to those of us new to the sub-genre and not from the lesswrong / fanfiction.net original writers / fandom.


    For example when looking at op's post works like Flowers for Algernon, A Scanner Darkly
    and More than Human sprang to mind. What separates something like Flowers for Algernon from rational fiction?

      The sidebar has its origins in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rkkam/in_light_of_the_recent_slew_of_recommendations/cdo5nto) in /r/HPMOR by /u/Vivificient.

      The problem with it (to the extent that there is a problem) is that it's not a very tightly focused rule; it's like a rule designed to select zerbas that does a good job of keeping out cows, but also keeps letting in horses.

      This is why you will see debates about whether a work is or isn't rational in the comments of many submissions. To me, it's more of a spectrum/ideal rather than the binary that some people treat it as. Coming to a firm definition is difficult, because we only have *maybe* a dozen works that we might agree on as "the rational canon", and of those dozen, it should be expected that a few of them (maybe even all of them) violate the ethos in some way.

      Anyway, things that I somewhat expect when going into a story that either labels itself, or has been given the label, "rational":

      * An intelligent, competent protagonist with a fair amount of agency
      * "Thinky" type problems with "thinky" type solutions
      * A focus on science and technology
      * A focus on what people are thinking, and why
      * Transhumanist themes
      * An emphasis on making the world logical and consistent
      * A push towards progress, understanding, and advancement

      But it might be better to think of every text as an arrow that's already been launched; this just happens to be what my personal target is, and some of those arrows are going to land closer to the bullseye than others. I'd consider *Flowers of Algernon* to be tweaking that same part of my brain, with *A Scanner Darkly* doing it to a much lesser extent (and I haven't read *More than Human*, so can't comment there).

      (My biggest problem with the sidebar is actually the second point, because it would seem to exclude Man v. Nature stories; nature doesn't have beliefs or values. If the story is about an imminent asteroid impact, you don't need factions or interpersonal conflicts.)

      Edit: I can't spell.

        Personally, I would like to say rational fiction is deliberately trying to make the reader more intelligent in *addition* to entertaining them, but there is a gap between stories which try to do so and those which succeed. You can't define a genre based on the authors' *intent*, only the works themselves.
        ```

        - u/callmebrotherg:
          ```
          Hm. I took that to be part of the difference between rational and rationalIST works. 

          But it also seems that the boundary line between these two things is not totally clear cut, and will probably shift this way and that as the genres develop.

    > "the character didn't think of it" is often identical to an asspull.

    As long as the audience didn't think of it either, then you can get away with it.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The trouble with that being, the larger the audience, the smaller the chance they didn't think of an action which would make more sense than the "dumb character's" choice, to the point where, depending on the "dumbness" of the character and the size of the reading base, it would become nearly impossible for them to miss at least one, especially as the writer is, in theory, confining the true, or simply superior, answer/answers to the realms of reason.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  I don't see why it couldn't be done, carefully.  There is a class of literature that does this regularly - animal-as-main-character books.  Jim Kjelgaard wrote a lot of young adult fiction with animal protagonists.

  You're going to have to work to make this happen, and you're going to have to work *really* hard to make it happen with an adult human and not turn people off.  Very few people want to be drawn into the mind of an unintelligent person, and that's the first thing you need in a story - a lead character that the reader wants to associate with.

  You're looking for a way for characters to avoid carrying the idiot ball while not being conventionally intelligent.

  Well, you can have fiction where all the characters are less intelligent than a human. Consider Watership Down as an example.

  There's a story I read that I would consider rational where the main character is not particularly smart, but it's still rational. I can't find it now, but it's about a stolid soldier who puts a dying alien pilot out of its misery.

  I agree with wales in that the sidebar rules are more guidelines than laws, and it's more spectrum than anything else. 

  For me, rational works are stories that have intelligent elements about them, to a degree that it noticeably affects the plot (There's tons of media out there with that snarky side character that's making good observations, but is never credited/noticed/utilized) And the protagonist is one of the most powerful vehicles for this, as we're, presumably, going to be spending most of our time with them, and it's much easier to have an intelligent human than to just try and make your setting really intelligent and hope the audience notices. Although having a rational protagonist and stupid setting doesn't fly too well either, at least in my opinion. There are a few works out there that take a setting that's been stupid for a while, and is only becoming intelligent as we see the protagonist interact with it (This is stupidly, ridiculously blatant in HPMOR. While individual characters vary on the rationalist scale, the setting of the magical world is this (although it's not AS bad as JKR's original, it's pretty close), and EY uses this fact to both comic and serious effect a number of times. Two Year Emperor is another place where this happens, although it's rapidly deconstructed as the fic progresses.) For those works, I'm neutral. It's about how the author goes about doing it that decides it for me.

  A rational fic can be a rational fic, simply because the protagonist (or associated characters) use every single tool they have at their disposal in an attempt to form a solution. Even if one isn't formed, the fact that they go through the critical thinking necessary to say "Hey, maybe this paperclip and battery CAN do something here" is really important to me. Thought needs to be displayed for me to consider a work rational. But this thought doesn't necessarily need to come from the protagonist; it's just easiest (for both the writer and the reader) when it does. And reading stupidity is just painful. Ignorance? Incompetence? Acceptable to a degree, as nothing is perfect. But it may be too grating to see it constantly displayed on someone who we're supposed to be inclined to like and support.

  I think a rational fic with a dumb protagonist could work. It would just be much more difficult than if the protagonist was smart. An easy out may be having him in a role that constituted advisement from smarter people, say a boy king with wise advisors, or the front guy with a really intelligent guy being the "brains" of the whole operation?

  I was just revisiting this thread and realized that the state that the OP mentions fits practically the entire history of mankind before the scientific method was firmly established.

  Yes, there were several more rational civilizations, but most of the world lived without the ability to really understand what was happening around them, because they didn't have the mental or physical tools to properly isolate cause and effect.

  Humanity did learn.  One little bit at a time.  And that learning was frequently bitterly opposed by people in power with a vested interest in maintaining ignorance.

  Rationality given bounded computational resources: take your own lack of intelligence into account. If someone presents you with a valid mathematical proof that you don't understand, then you don't know if it's valid or not, so it's not very strong evidence to you. There is certainly such thing as computationally bounded rationality, and it's a more practical concept than computationally unbounded rationality, i.e. information-theoretic rationality.

  For example, one character in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (who is allegedly unintelligent) encounters two people, one of which is an enemy and one of which is an innocent. He can't tell which is which, so he knocks them both out. Actually he guesses and he happened to guess right first but he was willing to knock them both out. A more intelligent character might have figured out which was which somehow, but he took his lack of knowledge/intelligence into account and made the best decision given the available resources. This demonstrates rationality, but, assuming there was a way of telling them apart, it also demonstrates a lack of intelligence.

  Analogously, if there's a big rock in front of a door you want to open, it demonstrates a lack of physical strength and a presence of rationality to use tools / assistance to move it instead of moving it yourself.

  I don't know how much fun it would be to read such a story though.
