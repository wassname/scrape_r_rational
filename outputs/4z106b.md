  The way in which they hit on the name "Bayesian Conspiracy" is a little contrived and took me out of the story. I'm still interested in seeing where this is going to be taken, though, so I'm going to bookmark the fic and read the other chapters later on.

  As Dwood15 pointed out the Fallout world doesn't make a lot of sense. Neither does the plot in Fallout 3 so I hope you've changed it to make sense. Those are the things which worry me at the moment. Otherwise this is a nice first chapter, I like it.
