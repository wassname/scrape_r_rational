## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

    > You want to defeat them. If death just causes a revert--how?

    Standard anti-voldemort protocol: If the body is impervious to death, attack the mind. Hard to be more specific without knowing what resources we available, though. 

    * If we have access to memory wiping powers, the obvious thing to do is just pull an HPMOR and wipe the entirety of the time traveller's memory. 

    * Putting the time traveler into a coma is another option if you can do it without triggering the reload. 

    * If both of those are off the table, things get a lot darker and a lot messier. One thing to try is to capture the time traveller, keep them drugged up to the gills and hope that this prevents them from activating the reload. If so, investigate what kind of drugs you can inject them with that cause persistent changes to their personality, preferably making them more susceptible to depression or more anxious or anything else that makes them less effective as a person. If the reload preserves changes in the subjects personality (which it should), these changes will carry over to the next loop and make the time traveller progressively easier to defeat with each iteration. 

    * If that is also out of reach, you could go for social manipulation. Get as close as you can to them while simultaneously alienating them from their friends and loved ones, then figure out what their buttons are and subtlety steer them into darker and darker places. Convince them that their abilities are a curse, that nothing has meaning if you are stuck in a time loop, that no matter what they do they will eventually die and everything will start over again. Try to convince them to find a way out of the time loop, either by figuring out a way to break the mechanism itself or by continuously moving their save point further and further forward (this doesn't actually break the time loop, but if you can convince them to do it, it is a major victory for you).

    All of this should be considered a last resort, obviously. If you can find a way to work together with the time traveller to achieve your goals (whatever they are), that is far, far better.

    >You want to discover they are a time traveler much earlier in the timeline. How can you manipulate them into revealing their abilities to you in the past? Can you do it without them knowing you know?

    To get the first part (having them do something different in the past), you'll obviously have to engineer present circumstances so that they are essentially forced to revert, preferably in such a way so that they change their actions in the past to head off an undesirable future. Most likely, you'd want to aim for some kind of relatively slow and unpleasant death, like radiation poisoning.

    Next, you'd need to convince them that some action involving you will be required to prevent that slow and unpleasant death. Preferably, you'll want to make them think they need your help so they don't try to just kill you to fix whatever the problem is. Alternatively, if you can't do that, but there's some point the last five years where you would have been perfectly prepared to rapidly knock out an unwary time traveler, you could try tricking them into thinking that that would be your most vulnerable moment in the last five years.

    Even so, subduing them can only last so long. Eventually, they'll wake up and revert, or they'll die and revert. Either way, it's unavoidable. The timeline can never really advance as long as they have that power. Your only hope of stopping them is to figure out how to stop that power.

    How did I find out in this timeline? Try to ensure that such a situation occurs sooner in the next timeline.

    ...I can think of ways to trick them into revealing their abilities once, but not to prevent them figuring out the trick, re-loading again, and not being so stupid as to fall for the same thing twice.

    > You want to defeat them. If death just causes a revert--how?

    Freeze them in carbonite.

  This is a powerset for a character who exists in superheroic universe.  Their goal is basic superheroics, save people, stop criminals, whatever.

  They see the world in black & white, except for one person at any given time.  This person, their 'Muse', shows up in full color.

  It is not obvious to the person that they are the Muse, the specialness lives in the character's eye, not out in the world.  The Muse has no particular idea that anything unusual is up.

  The Muse shifts unpredictably, and rarely back to the same person again.  (That is, different people stand out over time, the power picks according to eldritch and unknowable criteria).  It does so when the character senses people, so the Muse is always either someone they remember or someone they are currently perceiving.

  The character has no superpowers when they are acting in a way unconnected to the Muse.

  They have low level superpowers (Captain America strength/tough) when they are acting on behalf of the Muse, personify the power as an eye rolling DM in terms of how far it lets you stretch this criteria.

  They have high level superpowers (Superman strength/tough) when they are acting on the direct orders of the Muse, but they are utterly unable to disobey those orders.

  The orders of a previous Muse cease to be controlling and cease to give powers when the designation shifts.

  &#x200B;

  In terms of basic munchkinning, how do you think this person would try and go about their business?  What are some precautions/practices that they should adopt?  Should they make their powerset known to the world at large, or try and conceal the specifics of how it operates, etc?

  Another thing I'm curious about, though, call it Author-Munchkinning, can you think of any interesting complications or arcs to give this character?

    >utterly unable to disobey those orders

    If the muse ordered the cape to view them as their muse forever would that work? 

    What if the muse orders them to do something they aren't physically capable of, like teleporting? 

    What would happen if the muse ordered them to kill themselves, would they be able to despite being super strong/tough due to acting in accordance with their muse's orders. 

    Is there anyone in the setting capable of causing temporary amnesia or something similar? If so, without being able to remember anyone, it'd be very easy to regulate who their next muse will be.

    Story arc idea: The muse is someone in an abusive relationship, he tries to save them, maybe gets a bit too rough with the abuser and the muse tells them to stop, the cape freezes up and stops moving altogether, the muse figures out the rules from this (and some further testing), the muse turns out to be a shit person that orders them to do a bunch of shady and potentially traumatizing stuff.
    ```

    - u/hh26:
      ```
      Or, rather than the muse being a shit person, the muse is a vulnerable person who is in an abusive relationship and does whatever their abuser tells them to.  So the abuser ends up in de facto control by ordering the muse to relay their orders to the cape.

    Let's say I live in city X, and don't travel much.

    The Muse is (virtually always) going to be someone in City X. Therefore, maintaining the peace and stability of City X maintains the peace and stability of the Muse, no matter who it is at any given moment.

    I therefore put on a costume and designate myself "Captain X, protector of City X!" I have access to low-level superpowers as long as I use them to protect the city as a whole (by keeping crime rates down) and thus protect the Muse.

    In a truly dangerous situation, I just have to hope that the Muse is one of the people yelling "HELP ME!" - because then I can bring a completely unexpected Superman-level smackdown on the Villain Of The Week.

    --------------

    I tell my secret only to a few people, close to me and highly trusted. Preferably only *after* they've been the Muse at least once, since repeats are rare. However, there must be a few, in case someone figures it out, becomes the Muse, and controls me for their own agenda (and it's not like mind control is unknown to superheroes).

    --------------

    Complications:

    - The current Muse moves to a different city
    - The current supervillain *becomes* the Muse mid-battle
    - A threat approaches that threatens an entire continent and all superheroes need to team up to hold it back. Problem is, the continent under threat isn't the one the Muse is on...
    - The Muse dies unexpectedly, and a new Muse is not immediately selected

  You are an intelligent and particularly resourceful [goose](https://goose.game/). Ending spoilers ahead.

  You like shiny things, and the nearby town has a [golden bell](https://www.agoxen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Untitled-Goose-Game-Walkthrough-05.jpg) in a set location that is regularly replaced when you steal it. The humans in the town are very predictable (and a bit silly) so your intelligence makes it easy for you to give them the walk-around and regularly steal their precious bell.

  Problem: In the game, the goose stores all their bells in what [looks like a ditch](https://i.imgur.com/ur3nuPb.png) just outside of town. Unfortunately, you are a goose, and geese are not really known for their ability to defend a position. Eventually the humans will find your ditch and take the bells back. How would you go about defending, hiding or protecting your bell horde?

  **Details:**

  * We will assume that you have human-level intelligence, despite being a goose.
  * In the game, the humans behave extremely predictably, due to the shocking lack of GAI included in modern video games. We'll assume that they have human intelligence as well, though they have their own lives and probably aren't dedicated to 24/7 goose-hunting.
  * You have the life experiences of a goose, and therefore aren't able to read, write, or honk the fibonacci sequence.

  Bonus objective: Get more bells, without calling the collective wrath of humanity down on your fluffy goose head.
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Goose game logic: Steal every pair of shoelaces in the village. Maybe they have replacements, but they'll run out eventually, and now nobody can chase you without tripping.

    /r/rational logic: Something something instrumental utility something something bootstrap something something bell-maximizer.

    Boringly practical logic: Cover your bells in mud when you're not enjoying them. Or throw them in the bottom of a small pond.

  Challenge scenario, because I just saw the new movie.

  You've just moved into a new neighborhood, and the house you bought was surprisingly inexpensive. Then you discover the reason: your neighbors are The Addams Family. They're filthy rich, are capable of Mad Science, and are happy to meet their new neighbor, but they're, well, The Addams Family and don't understand non-Addamses very well.

  Being a self-respecting Munchkin, you're determined to exploit the situation to the fullest. What do you do, and how do you do it?
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    First priority is asking them how they became undead and begging them to do it to me. The procedure appears to have few downsides and causes no cognitive deficits, so it is a near-ideal immortality mechanism.
    ```

    - u/CronoDAS:
      ```
      Are the Addams Family undead, or just (super)naturally durable?
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Honestly you'd probably just get some nonsensical answer, like "the powdered lead in our makeup deflects time rays" or something like that.
        ```

    - u/hh26:
      ```
      > causes no cognitive deficits

      Not sure if we can conclude that.  It's possible that their weird perception of .... everything, their quirky personalities, are a side effect of being undead and not just coincidentally attached to it.
      ```

        Becoming kooky is less bad than dying.
        ```

        - u/dinoseen:
          ```
          I'd still rather eke out as much time not being kooky as I can beforehand. The best time to take an immortality potion that might have side effects is right when you're about to die from old age.
          ```

          - u/fortycakes:
            ```
            It doesn't seem unlikely that it preserves your body in its current state, so there's a reason to take it before any age-related symptoms started to kick in. The exact tradeoff between aging and side-effect mitigation will be up to the individual.
            ```

  What munchkinry would you be able to get up to if you could have any stand, but only one at a time? Effects like Enigma's paper and Killer Queen's first bomb persist through switches.
