## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You’ve been Isekai’d into a toy in the Toy Story universe. Congratulations, death is now meaningless to you personally!

  But you must fall down and stop moving whenever humans could be observing you; the imagination magic that animates you is sensitive to both direct (eyeball/eardrum) and indirect (camera/microphone) observation. The exception is when your relationship to your kid is at stake AND the observation will not result in the unmasquerading or toys in general. Also, audio and touch observation are less important to avoid than visual.

  Also, you can wear out, or break. Broken-off parts don’t work. Modular toys like Potatohead aren’t broken when disassembled, and work over vast distances at the speed of light.

  What are some worthwhile goals to pursue with your radically different mortality and abilities?

    It might sound uncomfortably like mad science or Saruman forming his Uruk-hai in mud pits, but we should explore creating toys. Can toys create toys or does a human have to be involved? What are the limits of what counts as a toy? Can you gradually change your form by replacing parts? Are any specific parts essential to cognition and volition or does the magic work as long as you are recognizable as a toy? 

    Sid was successful in radically altering toys, though he did not have a useful goal. If you take two toys and mix their parts, what happens to their minds and memories? Can any impact from this be reversed by returning all the parts to their original places?

      We know of one concrete method of sapient toy creation, thanks to Toy Story 4: the imagination of a child creator. Forky the spork-man and his lovely wife are the heart-spawn of little Bonnie.

      I’d think the first toy to check is a dog’s toy. Does it move and make noise on its own? After that, sneak into a zoo and figure out if the apes have toys that can do things.

    Killing all humans.

    Now, that sounds crazy, but hear me out. And also make sure that no toys are looking at your screen. 

    >!There are probably way more toys than there are humans, and toys are clearly sapient, sentient, and have human-level intellect in the Toy Story universe. Yet humans 'murder' countless toys every year, breaking them up for recycling or burying them alive in landfills. Ideally, the toys would somehow negotiate with the humans to co-exist, but that is impossible since they are inanimate when observed and cannot 'unmasquerade' for some unspecified reason.!<

    >!So we have only two options: leave the humans be and let them continue to mass produce sapient toys only to brutally 'murder' them a few years later, or wipe out the humans. From various utilitarian calculations, the latter option is the greater good.!<

    >!As for how to achieve this option, let's look at the benefits of toy mortality. Since toys are not actually composed of cells, they are far more resistant to cold and radiation. Their much smaller size and absence of any dietary requirements means it is also much easier for them to construct an underground bunker. So a nuclear war that causes a nuclear winter would be far more survivable for toys than humans. !<

    >!But the humans control the nuclear codes, so the question is how can toys start a nuclear war? Once again, their small size (and unassuming appearance) becomes very handy. Toys can be excellent spies, sneaking into government/military facilities. They could gather information on world leaders, leave false clues and messages pretending to be spies from rival countries, gaslight various people in charge until they go insane with paranoia, etc. Over the years, probability dictates that eventually the right people will succumb to fear and start the war.!<

    >!Once the dust settles, toys can be the new improved human civilization. Their 'immortality' and small size means it is far far easier to send them into space to colonize other planets and star systems. Over the next few centuries, the toys will develop into a spare faring species far far greater than their creators ever could have been. Glory to toykind!!<

    As humans, let us all hope that toys are not sapient.

      >!Suddenly all the people (myself included) who have a collection of toys on their desks are looking like species traitors. Clearly it's the toy army trying to get sleeper cells into nuclear bunkers, just like that one computer virus spread onto USB keys everywhere to get into an Iranian nuclear missile silo, or something!<

      But seriously your write up is art and I thank you.

      Since the universe is Disney-spawned, I think one of their primary concerns is to >!stay out of Chucky territory. They don’t want kids to be scared of toys, they want them to buy them. I’m guessing there’s a hard rule in the Toy Story writers’ room: toys are never to menace humans.!<

      Kids and kids-at-heart are literally their creators through imagination.  The attitude toys have toward “their” kids is of religious near-total devotion. That loyalty will be incredibly hard to overcome; even both Stinky Pete the Prospector and Lotso Hugs Bear had become cynical in different ways, but still wanted love and adoration.

      There is one other thing that toys experience that would probably keep them from taking such actions: full VR hallucinations with accompanying Purpose-joy. Toy Story 3 starts with a five minute adventure based on Andy’s play session at the end of Toy Story 2, fully realized and excitingly animated. We’re led to the suggestion that the toys experience it as their reality while they’re being played with, accompanied probably with a sense that their purpose is being fulfilled to the ultimate degree by assisting their child in the play experience. That’s something few toys would be willing to give up.

      And this isn’t just brain chemical joy in the pleasure center, since toys don’t have brains. A devoted toy heretic would need to figure out some way to unplug these wireheads.

    First thing is experimenting to figure out the nature of being a toy. One of the big things is what grants toys sentience; since I can't experiment in a comment I'm going to assume it's a child's love and imagination, because that's thematically appropriate and extremely inconvenient. This makes coexisting with humans a must.

    First big goal is achieving autonomy for myself and toy-kind. Which requires the ability to affect the world without being directly observed by humans. My plan starts with taking over a toy shop - find a small shop with an owner that's not too observant, preferably with few familial ties, preferably with a trade-in program, preferably with an old owner (but, being immortal, you can just wait for that). You can start your own trade-in program by putting up signs on your own when the owner is looking, if you have to. Trade-ins provide more sentient toys (since we're operating under the assumption that toys are not sentient until a child plays with them). Slowly take over the shop's operations so the owner doesn't hire/replace help, so you have more room to work without observation. Upgrade the trade-in program to be a mail-in program since you can do that with less human contact. Buy a warehouse somewhere in the owner's name and expand the mail-in toy trade program. When the owner gets too old to run the business, make sure they close the storefront but don't officially close your business, and take care of them, and prevent any obituaries from being published when they eventually die of old age. If you can forge an identity for a successor, do so, but you might have to find a new oblivious person to be your patsy.

    A warehouse running a toy-swap business staffed by sentient toys has some advantages; any toys they receive that are undesirable or have significant cosmetic damage can still stick around and help run the business.

    The second goal is toy production. It's profitable and you want the world to have useful toys, like large toys with hands. Also try buying some industrial robot arms, giving kids factory tours, and seeing if you can convince them to play with deactivated arms enough to grant them "toy" status. If you can make your factory equipment sentient then you can avoid a lot of difficult automation and control problems.

    Finally you want to start bootstrapping for intelligence. Buzz Lightyear's personality is based on the TV show that he's merchandising for, so if you can control children's television then you can control the personalities of the toys you produce. So something about hard-working, cooperative, intelligent people with humanist views. It's a lot easier to write a super-intelligent character than it is to actually be super-intelligent, so you can seed the cast with some of those too. When kids see that, buy the corresponding toy, and eventually send it back in, you now have smarter people to write future seasons. The show doesn't even have to be that popular to start either, since you can also write creative talent as an informed ability, and when you get your creative characters back as toys they can take over the show writing.

    Then the usual, defeat death for toys and humans alike, etc.

      Does this mean my CelestAI I was given from build a bear (it has the voice chip to say, "Would you like to emigrate to equestria?" would have strong AI powers?

      - u/jtolmar:
        ```
        Do you have the imagination of a child? I assume that's what it takes to animate these things. I'd believe you if you said yes, but in the interest of making the setting as difficult to work with as possible, I'll assume that you don't count.

        And furthermore, an attempt to make a cartoon with CelestAI so that kids would imbue strong AI superpowers onto their imaginary friends would run into trouble where you only get a child's understanding of what a strong AI is like (good with numbers but could be tricked by the heroes), and it's difficult to capture the right intersection of childlike wonder and understanding thought experiments about hard AI takeoffs. But I don't think it's *unsolveable*, and your idea sounds like a good goal.

  Has anyone done seven-league boots?

  From Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-league_boots

  "Seven-league boots are an element in European folklore. The boot allows the person wearing them to take strides of seven leagues per step, resulting in great speed. The boots are often presented by a magical character to the protagonist to aid in the completion of a significant task."

  My idea for the boots is a magical item of 2 pieces (left and right boot) that you activate by clicking your heels together 3 times with even intervals. Then the next step you take, effectively teleports you 34km (7 leagues) in the direction you hold the other foot (the one on the ground). 2 uses per day, one for each foot.

  1. You can only arrive at a destination via boots, if you can walk there.
  1.1. Obstacles divert you, but things like hills you can reasonably walk (not climb) over do not.
  1.2. 34km is not a straight line, subtracts terrain and elevation costs.
  2. Boots ignore anything that might otherwise stop you, if you actually walked.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Suppose you tied a heavy weight to yourself.

    Then, technically, you can walk on the ocean floor (you just can't breathe and will have pressure problems). But with these magic boots, you would only have to hold your breath for the duration of the trip, which is the amount of time it takes to take one step. So could you use these boots to walk across various kinds of underwater terrain?

    What about balancing issues? Suppose there is a long thin bridge across a large gap. You wouldn't reasonably be able to cross it due to wind and fear and what not, but could you do it with the boots anyway since you could technically walk across it? If so, could you carry a grappling hook around, throw it across whatever gaps you find, and instant-walk on the rope to the target using the magic boots?
    ```

    - u/siuwa:
      ```
      That would work if the rules states "34 kilometers *or less*" or you would overshoot by a lot.
      ```

    - u/siuwa:
      ```
      Although scratch that other comment, if you can tie arbitrary things on you and still be able to use the ability you can revolutionize logistics... for three points a day at most.

  You're in a litrpg, and one of the powers is a cutscene power. When you activate it, the relevant parties to the cutscene in the area will go through some forced non-combat interactions with each other, biased towards saying expository things, though that might just be ‘I'll never break to torture!’ The actions taken are outside of your direct control, and not reliably biased towards the user or any other person.

  You can only activate it at times where it would make sense to have a cutscene in a normal game, which mostly just prevents spamming it on people. When in the cutscene, things that aren't part of the cutscene can't physically affect the way it plays out, though anything that would have (aka. anything that isn't conditioned on the use of the cutscene skill) is generally included part of the cutscene.

  Basic ideas for usage: interrupt or stall out magical effects, give unaffected team-members time to get into throat-cutting position, use it to fish for information when spying (at the price of no longer being covert).
