## Recommendation for my bfs (29M) birthday

### Post:

Hi! I recently figured out that my boyfriend loves reading/listening to rational fiction books, as those are the only ones that don't drive him crazy because of illogical plot and characters. I know he absolutely loved hpmor, and he's currently finishing Crystal society, which he's so far liked as well. 

I'd love to give him a book (preferably an ebook/audiobook) that fits rational fiction description that he'd enjoy, but I don't know anything about what makes a good one. He's gonna be 29, is a software developer and loves to play videogames/computer games. Do you guys have any suggestions for books I could gift him? Thanks a lot!

  I wanted to point out the distinction between 'rational' and 'rationalist' fiction - illogical characters are realistic, and totally belong in a rational story as long as they are illogical in human-accurate ways. If those also bother him, he probably is into the more specific genre of rational*ist* fiction, which is mostly about rational people having plot in a setting filled with largely irrational people. HPMOR is an excellent example of that.

  Oh, and if he loved Methods of Rationality, I heartily recommend the continuation-fic "Significant Digits". Not something you can really get him as a present, unfortunately :-\

    Nonsense! You can get a copy bound as long as you don't try to sell it. I did that with HPMOR for a few friends and family members last year and it turned out great.

    ```
    I wasn't aware of this difference, thank you for enlightening me! I'm pretty sure he doesn't mind characters acting illogically, as long as it's consistent and believable, not just for the sake of the plot. I'm gonna check out your recommendation for sure, thanks!

      I will point out for the record that there is little consensus on the exact distinction between rational/rationalist fiction. The definition given here isn't wrong, it's just one of several.

  If he likes comedy, then I highly recommend the Bobiverse series. It’s a mostly rational take on a Von Neuman probe with a main character that cracks jokes a lot. It’s very well done. Also similar to The Martian.
  ```

  - u/denirii:
    ```
    I'll check that out, thanks for the recommendation!
    ```

    - u/Dragonheart91:
      ```
      The audio book is really well voiced. Just wanted to mention that since you called out audio.

  As a fan of rational fiction, something that caught me completely by surprise was the DIRE series, starting with DIRE: BORN. It’s rational adjacency and style of humor hit all my “spots” in a very satisfying way. 
  Has the added benefit of being something not on many people’s radar, so it’s less likely he’d already have read it. 

  As a related aside, you may want to check that he hasn’t already read/listened to the works recommended here, before investing. If he’s significantly into this style already, chances are not too bad that he’s read things like Sanderson or The Martian, for example.
  ```

  - u/denirii:
    ```
    He doesn't actually read that many books, and he's talked to me a lot about e.g. hpmor (actually got me to listen to it too), so I'm pretty confident that he hasn't read them, or he'd have mentioned them. But it doesn't hurt to check, I agree! I know he's read The Martian, I'm not sure about Sanderson. I'll definitely try and subtly check before getting him one.
    ```

  More rational-adjacent, but I really enjoyed the Cradle series of books, and by the same author, The Traveler's Gate series, which I'm relistening to right now.

  Traveler's Gate is fantastic because, all in the first book, it takes several fantasy cliches, and flips them all on their head, perfectly, with perfect interactions in how things are different. The main protagonist isn't actually the chosen one, but there is a chosen one, and he's not actually unhelpful. There's a princess, but she's not actually in danger, and she's actually quite competent. The antagonist in the first book isn't actually that bad, and there isn't really one particular person/group that I'd call the bad guys.

  The book is a perfectly executed car crash in slow motion. Most books like this have a ton of irrational bits that cause the story to fall apart on further inspect, but Traveler's Gate doesn't. Every single event and motivation makes perfect sense, which is the hallmark of rational fiction, beyond the surface level sci-fi bits that usually adorn the genre. The first book is amazing, and funny, and incredibly well executed. It's an amazing story.

  And the other two books in the Traveler's Gate trilogy are just like the first. They're amazing, and they portray the direct consequences of everyone's actions in each earlier book. Exactly how rational fiction should be. This is all on top of a neat magic system, which certainly helps, too.

  Cradle is more of a r/progressionfantasy, which is somewhat adjacent to r/rational, more about having a good and rational system of power levels in fantasy, which are satisfying to watch the protagonists learn about. More so than the shitty versions of the genre, LitRPGs. I like this series, and the author releases a new book every 6 months or so, and I'd definitely recommend it, but it's not as obviously rational, though the protagonist does have to be pretty clever to get out of some crazy situations.

  Both of these have great audiobooks. TTG is read by the author, who's surprisingly good, and Cradle is read by someone else, who does amazing voices and is a delight to listen to.

  [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249) by Alexander Wales is an amazing work, that gets updated around every one to two months, and you can download the latest ebook from that link, or just read it online. It's the epitome of rational fiction, and it's definitely of the best (i.e. best demonstration of rational fiction) this sub has. No audiobook, though.

  ---

  [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/102/Mother-of-Learning) is my favorite story of all time, and it's about to be completed. It's been ongoing since 2011, and although it came after the genre was named, it's also a good example of progression fantasy. This sub is also obsessed with this one; posts about it reach the top of the subreddit, if you go and check. You can download an epub from that link using https://ficsave.xyz.

  There are multiple ongoing audiobook efforts, three I know of, but two of them suck, and I *hate* the voices of the third one. I've listened to the first four chapters, and the female voices suck a ton, and the protagonist's annoying mentor is stereotyped into the unintelligible Chinese teacher, and you can't understand him *at all*. Besides that, the narrator just generally has a really unusual accent in general, which isn't terrible, but that in addition to poor voice choices for basically every character (I only mentioned the worst bits) mean that he sucks to listen to. I recommend that Mother of Learning just be read instead, then maybe listened to later. And it really should be read, because it's a goddamn amazing story.

  I'd recommend Heinlein's \*The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\*.
  ```

  - u/panchoadrenalina:
    ```
    i dont know if id call "moon... " rational. is a great read dont take me wrong but i dont know if TANSTAAFL is really a rational concept.
    ```

      I can see where you're coming from. I like your username!
      ```

  - u/denirii:
    ```
    That definitely sounds like something right up his alley! He definitely enjoys good science fiction
    ```

- u/Quibbloboy:
  ```
  I would recommend The Martian. Very methodical, very plot-focused, with an emphasis on logic and creative problem-solving. Still manages to be an exciting read. The writing itself can be a little bit bland at times, but if he loved HPMOR, that shouldn't be a problem for him.
  ```

  - u/denirii:
    ```
    Uh, he already read The Martian, but thank you anyway! Do you know any books similar to it that you might recommend?
    ```

    - u/RedSheepCole:
      ```
      I assume he read Artemis too?  It's kind of wincey IMO because Andy Weir has no notion how to write women, but it's very similar in tone and style.
      ```

- u/nevinera:
  ```
  Depending on what he *likes* about rational lit, he might enjoy some Neal Stephenson books, like Cryptonomicon or Anathem. They're fairly rational, and very introspective/thoughtful (that's actually the main reason I love rational stories - they tend to include a lot of introspection because the authors are thinking *about* what the characters are thinking).
  ```

  - u/denirii:
    ```
    I don't actually know, I'll have to think about it! I think for the most part it just really irritates him to read books/watch movies where there are plot holes, characters are doing ridiculous things just to get the story moving, etc. - I'm pretty sure that's because he is a VERY rational guy, and he always notices inconsistencies that other people maybe don't even realize are there. I'll check out your recommendation, thanks for helping! :)
    ```

- u/t3tsubo:
  ```
  I'd bet he'd love it if you read some of those stories yourself and discussed/showed him your reactions to them.
  ```

  - u/denirii:
    ```
    I could do that! He did enjoy when I listened to hpmor and we talked about it, thanks for the idea!
    ```

- u/TrebarTilonai:
  ```
  Given that he has an background in programming, I might recommend UNSONG. It's definitely not everybody's cup of tea, and to really GET it it helps to have a background in both Jewish mythology (preferably Kaballah-specific) as well as computer programming, but the people that like it tend to really enjoy it.  


  Basically, the world \*used\* to run on physics (thanks to an angel, ironically), until Neil Armstrong took a spaceship up to the moon and accidentally cracked the crystal sphere that holds the stars in place. Now the world runs on God, and by invoking the Names of God you can cause things to happen. The main character starts the story working at a "theonomics corporation", which researches, discovers, and trademarks the names of god in order to make a profit.   


  The whole thing is a bit silly, and while the setting may not be rationalist the characters are very consistent and the consequences of the setting are played out in a rational and consistent manner.

  Some recs:

  * I’m partial to Graydon Saunders’ Commonweal series,
  * Dexter Palmer’s Version Control
  * Pratchett puts me to sleep (but maybe gives me good dreams :)
  * Not a complete book, but I’m quite partial to Alexanderwales Dark Wizard of Donkerk. Although it certainly has its flaws, the core concept is something that really appeals to me, personally.

  ```
  Sanderson's audiobooks are all excellent. The most outright rational ones are probably Stormlight, primarily because he's matured as a writer since i.e. Mistborn and Warbreaker.
  ```

  - u/phylogenik:
    ```
    Potentially also consider the "GraphicAudio" versions, which may enhance the listening experience. Only downside is that to buy them is substantially more expensive.
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Personally I'd never sacrifice the actual text of a book for foley work, but for those who maybe aren't as attached to reading as much as I am it's a good option.

          I personally appreciate your follow-up much more than your comment that /u/LazarusRises responded to; I read their response as "your comment is expressing 'your opinion is wrong and you should feel bad'". In particular, stating "his characters are atrocious and dumb" elicits this impression to me, at least...

            Well, I wasn't planning on starting a discussion, but I am more than happy to explain why Brandon Sanderson is a poor writer, if there is interest. 

            He has work ethic, but he produces subpar work - with no consideration to how his world's should work and be internally consistent, nor is he able to remove himself for Christian morals. And by christian I mean Mormon. When I am home for work I'll expand on it if you have any interest.
            ```

          - u/LazarusRises:
            ```
            In the interest of honesty, I should make it clear that I was calling his opinion bad, not making fun of the tone of his post. I don't think he's right about any of the things he posted, and when I have some more time I'll refute his comment in detail.
            ```

  - u/denirii:
    ```
    Thank you! What are they about?
    ```

    - u/nevinera:
      ```
      His thing is complex coherent world-building. He generally intends the world to drive/inform the story as much as the characters, and he keeps getting better at it.
      ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Epic fantasy of the best kind. He's written a few different fantasy series all set in the same universe (the cosmere), each with a magic system informed by a different set of rules. All magic systems are knowable & discoverable by characters in the stories, and characters always use the magic available to them in consistent, creative, *badass* ways.

      The Stormlight Archive is set on the world of Roshar, which is periodically ravaged by huge Highstorms that travel east to west, damaging everything in their path. The whole ecology & society is structured to deal with this (all cities are built with heavy fortifications to the east; all animals & plants have shells they can withdraw into for protection; etc.) Highstorms also carry with them a powerful magical infusion called stormlight, which can be used for various enchantment/transmutation abilities focused through devices called fabrials; there are also myths of the Knights Radiant, who could absorb stormlight and use it for varying magical effects based on the oaths they swore. Emotions and concepts can also generate tiny magical beings called spren--a wounded person might spawn painspren like little crawling hands, a victorious general might have gloryspren pop into existence like tiny golden orbs around his head, etc. 

      It's very, very good.

  I pretty much fit this description, and the best book I've read recently is [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126).

  It's still unfinished, and it's free, so probably not the best recommendation for a present, but it's insanely good.

  For a present, there's [Rationality: From AI to Zombies](https://www.audible.com/pd/Rationality-From-AI-to-Zombies-Audiobook/B076ZY6Y9C). It's not fiction, but it's written by the author of HPMOR, and if your boyfriend hasn't read it yet, he'll probably appreciate it.
  ```

  - u/denirii:
    ```
    I've actually seen the second one you mentioned when I tried to find something myself, and so I automatically tried to see if the author of HPMOR has written something else too. I'll give it a better look for sure, thanks! I'll check out the first one too - I might just recommend it to him after his birthday, I'm sure he'd still appreciate it :)
    ```

    - u/roystgnr:
      ```
      He's written other fiction too, some decent, but nothing nearly as good as HPMOR, just to warn you.
      ```

      - u/denirii:
        ```
        Ah okay. Thanks for the heads up!
        ```

- u/Solliel:
  ```
  Mother of Learning if he hasn't already read it.
  ```

- u/tadrinth:
  ```
  Well, it's not precisely in the rational genre, but Blindsight by Peter Watts is some dark hard science fiction.  

  The first couple Vorkosigan books are also excellent, and I am pretty sure they were a major source of inspiration for HPMOR.
  ```
