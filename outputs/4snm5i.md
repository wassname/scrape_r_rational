## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Random world-building exercise! What would happen to society, if some arbitrarily chosen animal species developed human-level intelligence and can "magically" speak the human language?

  You can decide how the species got their intelligence, but communication has to be easy to perform so it's not very easy to deny evidence of intelligent animals.

  For coolness: octopi, horses, and dogs

  For horror: cows and chicken

  For the creep factor: plants and bacteria

    Not "world-building" per se, but here's a way to make this semi-viable:

    Let's say, five years from now, we get machine learning down well enough to apply it efficiently to translation algorithms. Pretty soon, we have excellent translations from even languages as disparate as chinese and english, or portuguese and hindu, or whatever.

    Then, some bright researcher decides to apply this to elephants/dolphins.

    It turns out that it actually works reasonably well, and bam-- it turns out humans aren't so alone after all.

  So I'm in the middle of brainstorming the mechanics of turning /u/DaystarEld 's rational pokemon into a video game. I might toy around with making at least a small slice of such a game if I can convince myself that it works well enough, but I probably won't. How would you rational-ize a game in general? Specifically, how would one do it for pokemon?

  ([Some of my brain vomit here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whXYdep6_lUBoSiqUsmzrf3c9vZKlZ68EsDRSOjjcOI/edit?usp=drive_web), with the caveat that none of it has been edited for clarity, etc etc).
  ```

  - u/Drexer:
    ```
    The mechanics of the world, or of the battles?

    Not that one is particularly easier than the other, but the battles in the fanfic work well as explanations of the abstraction of the game's battle system, while the way the world works is the more complex emergent system IMO.
    ```

    First thing I noticed is that, physical moves are nerfed to hell. They cost more Endurance and require more tactical concessions than special moves. Would there be anything to compensate for this, or would you just let metagame swing in favor of special attack focused teams?
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      First off, the move "cooldown" resets faster, so repeated karate chops hit harder than repeated flamethrowers, making special much more risk-reward at close range...miss that hit and your opponent's gonna trade a lot better. Also since the moves recharge faster, the depleted endurance hit from the physical moves themselves won't be as much a factor in the formula, so I would tweak it to balance out. I imagine both physical and special as having the same dps (and endurance drain) on average, with special having powerful single strikes and physical being a lot of weaker quick ones (with outliers, of course). Physical wins the short-term endurance trade by ending the match, special wins the long-term one of they can line something up. Though physical would also encourage repeated move usage, pushing their max endurance higher faster in the long run.

       Not to mention that this would follow gen iv's concept of phys/spec being intrinsic to the move itself, so no reason to not have both. Softening the 4 move restriction helps too. I really don't want hyperspecialized two or three move combos, one or two hit KOs would be all but nonexistant (i hope) and type advantage wouldn't be quite the catch-all it is now.

      Also, in my head, special moves mostly have to be aimed, whereas physical operate more on an automated sentry mode. Vine whip will just hit if the opponent enters the sphere of influence (modified by accuracy) making agility the real trick, but hydro pump will need to be directed at the spot you *hope* your opponent will be at, making positioning the emphasis. (Maybe that's too gamey? No *fundamental* reason that you have to tell your retarded Kadabra how to land a mental AoE attack but your Snorlax just *knows* how to flail his body across the battlefield with impunity. At the same time, good luck coming up with an interface to aim punches that's not just as gimmicky.)

      A few things I didn't mention at all (but underlines most of this, I just realized): I would experiment with both sides taking turns simultaneously, in a pseudo-turn-based style. I expect the hit percentages to be similar to XCOM. *Landing* the hit is almost more important than which hit was used, with different moves enabling different ranges, AoE, positioning, or whatnot. Tell your blastoise to charge, tackle, sidestep, headbutt, then hydro pump at the spot you hope the other guy's sitting stunned in, and then start running again towards the hex you just knocked him in to body slam. I imagine the throwaway early moves like tackle, quick attack, gust, etc, having very important utility in combining movement with attacking, with higher level stuff being more damage focused, including mostly special moves. Switching would be nerfed significantly, needing the same time delay as Origin of Species, giving up X ticks in the process. 

      I guess what I'm trying to say is that I expect someone with 4-6 trained special moves is going to get shrekked by someone with a more flexible kit and a finisher or so.

      Sorry for the wall of text, you gave me a lot to think about. It's definitely shaky right now, it's the sort of thing that would just need to be playtested ruthlessly.

      Some of the special moves need resources that are unlimited in the pokemon video game, but would be more limited in a rational game.  All the water based attacks, for example, depend either on available water sources external to the pokemon, or the pokemon having a large internal supply of water.  Flame attacks actually need something that burns, so the pokemon is limited by some internal supply of oil or gas.  Etc.

      So in general, the physical moves are easier to use multiple times in a single battle.
      ```

      - u/Aabcehmu112358:
        ```
        That seems like it'd primarily apply to the more 'elemental' types' special attacks, rather than universal. For example, I don't see how Psybeam would consume some resource that Psycho Cut wouldn't.
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          So Psycho Cut is actually a move I feel like was poorly designed: its intention, flavor-wise, appears to be a move that shoulder operate by the same rules as Psyshock, a Special attack that deals Physical damage (uses the opponent's Defense instead of Special Defense). 

          But I agree that only certain special moves would need a more limiting resource, and that psychic  attacks in general wouldn't be as limited as water attacks. The way to make this more balanced might be to allow resource-dependent pokemon to use significantly less Endurance for their special attacks, since they're using their "Resource" as well. Alternatively, when in an environment that allows them to recharge their limiting resource, they can recharge Endurance as well.

          As an example, in the recent chapter Misty's starmie using the nearby water to use a Surf attack on the alakazam. Normally such an attack of that power might use, say, 30 Endurance. With mechanics (A) the attack only uses 15 Endurance, because it requires Starmie to also use her interior water supply **or** have water nearby to use, while with mechanics (B) it only used a net of 5 Endurance instead of the usual 30 because Starmie gained 25 Endurance by dipping into the water and sucking a bunch of it up.

          **Pros and Cons of  (A):**

          **Pro** - More flexibility, realism, and ability to fine-tune balance and allow player ingenuity.

          **Cons** - Requires  a separate resource to be tracked for a multitude of pokemon. Blastoise might have water reserves of 100, while Squirtle has 20 and Starmie has 40. This can be annoying to keep track of, and the recharge rate should also be different.

          **Pros and Cons of (B):**

          **Pro** - Much more streamlined and mechanics-light. 

          **Cons** - Not quite as realistic, has some weird alternative interactions where a pokemon can now do more physical attacks after drinking in water, or even use other non-water special attacks since they all use Endurance.

          As a final note, /u/ketura, just wanted to say this is a really neat idea, and let me know if there's anything I can do to help with it :) I've designed a couple games myself, so I know how daunting some of the fine-tuning can be. In my head I see this working more easily as a tabletop RPG than a video game, but no reason it can't work as both with enough time and effort in coding.
          ```

          - u/ketura:
            ```
            You're right that A is the more realistic, but the line gets a bit hard to identify for some types.  What's the "resource" for plant pokemon?  One surely exists; one runs out of leech seeds eventually.  Is it soil?  Sun?  It seems easiest to abstract it away into the Endurance stat as a combined "physical energy" and "physical resources" sort of stat, with perhaps just a few exceptions for easily designed terrain such as water pools or lava flows or whatnot.

            A good compromise would then be to do something like B but internally tracking the gained endurance as "temporary water" or "temporary fire" or whatever.  It would only be used if the pokemon utilized the correct type of move in lieu of normal Endurance usage, and maybe at the end of battle any excess is dumped into the base Endurance pool, to avoid the weird physical bit you pointed out but still representing a rejuvenation.  

            For this very sort of compromise I prefer these kind of systems to be moderated by a computer; tracking that sort of thing would get very annoying very quickly in a tabletop, and crunching all the numbers starts to wear on you. 

            Thanks for your feedback, and I'm glad you liked it!  I'll no doubt be in touch with you if anything ends up getting made.  I reinstalled Unity last night, so we'll see if I'm up for it, but don't hold your breath.

          That could be handwaved, something something mental exertion blah blah.  But you're right, and it doesn't help that any type move can be Special.  What does it mean to have a Special Fighting move?  Hmm, maybe like a chi move, I guess, could be draining.  Special Rock?  Tearing bits of yourself off, and so more demanding?  I don't know if one could go down the list and justify why all 18 special types require more immediate exertion than their Physical counterparts, but I'd rather not go that route anyway.  

          It feels inherently un-rational to try and force them all to fit into two moulds of fast, automated, long-term-demanding moves on the one hand and slow, manual, short-term-demanding moves on the other.  I don't particularly know how to solve it without handwaving and making it gamey.  An obvious step is to make automated and aimed attacks not directly tied to the phys-spec spectrum.  Another step would be to label something as "resource-intensive" vs "cantrip", with water gun in the former and karate chop in the latter.  With Special-Physical as a third axis, plus type, that's essentially four separate axes that all moves would have to be divided into.  

          But then we get into DF-style complexity, and then do we have a game or a simulation?  The line's a fine one.

    This is interesting and I hope to see more.

  Imagine a world where useful metals were much rarer than historical Earth.  What are the most marginally useful metal tools for, say, an early Roman Empire tech level society?  Which could be replaced with stone, wood or labor with the least loss of functionality or efficiency?  How rare would iron or bronze have to be before you started equipping soldiers with clubs?
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    This is an interesting question. The majority of a spear is wood, with just a tiny sliver of metal at the end. And I wonder how needed the spearhead really is if metal is too rare to make full armor. Plus there are other things you could stick at the end, such as obsidian or even just stone. Or maybe glass or harder woods such as ironwood. Or just sharpen and burn the end.

    Horseshoes are one thing I don't think you could replace, though Wikipedia says that there were straight alternatives sort of like sandals made of rawhide that the Romans used anyway.

    Gold is obviously worthless for anything that needs to be hard. Silver was used for lots of things, and I wonder if it couldn't replace bronze in a pinch, albeit at a much steeper rarity. Iron only came after bronze, with its primary advantage that it only needs a single ore and not two to forge. Speaking of which, remove copper and you lose bronze, and tin was rare as it was, making up like 15% of the bronze blend.

    So to answer your question, I think iron could disappear with the least amount of impact to a Roman-era civilization, assuming you just coped with bronze. Assuming you went with zero metals, gold would probably be missed the least, what with it just being a currency and all. Clubs would never come into it, with spears being so much easier to wield and impacted less than swords.

  What would you do/think if you notice your mom staying young in mid-twenty even as you grew into adulthood and beyond. Or for matter, the people around her and society at large?
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    If she was doing a lot of stuff to maintain her health and appearance... I would assume she was just aging really well and using diet, exercise, and make-up effectively.  Occasionally I might make comments on it, but she could deflect them by saying stuff along the lines of, "oh your grandmother aged really well also".  This would work okay probably all the way up until I started getting into middle age myself.  Even then, if she gradually used makeup to make herself look older, it might be a while before  I got really suspicious.
