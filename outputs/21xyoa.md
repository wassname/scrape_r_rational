  I think Sanderson's points about magic systems and plot tension are the most important of all of his ideas about world building.

  > Sanderson’s First Law of Magics: An author’s ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.


  As he suggests, resolving dramatic tension with blind magical fiat isn't good storytelling. Some bad authors and a lot of fanfiction writers (but I repeat myself), seem to think surprising the reader with a new facet of their oh-so-interesting magical system *at a climatic moment* is good storytelling. It isn't.

  If you don't have an already somewhat detailed explanation for the phenomenon or have not sufficiently referenced it, you can't have major plot problems solved with it. This is important in fiction with sci-fi and modern elements as well as classic fantasy.

  If the author doesn't point out early on that the FBI might be on the case, or that the entire race of Yorgins hate cats, or that your brand of orks melt in the rain, readers won't be impressed when those elements feature prominently in resolving conflicts in the final chapters of the book.

  Hell yes, Brandon Sanderson is the best at fantasy magic systems. Sanderson general thread? Anybody else pick up Words of Radiance on release day like me?

    Yup, I'm done with it now. I'm really liking the interplay between his other books, as well as the slow-roll explorations of the magic systems present in that world. And thankfully, since it's Sanderson, I won't have to wait all that long before another book comes out.
