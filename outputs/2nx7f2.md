  "Ah, there he is now."

  God I love this.

    Wait until you get to the literature.

  Eeeheheheehehe!!!

  (The title almost sounds like a *Watamote* allusion.)

  And you know the *really* terrible part?  If you manage to avoid all possible plot hooks, *you end up a Slice-of-Life protagonist*.

    But wait!  [It gets worse](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse) - this appears to be a response to our all-time top post... ["Nope! *The Anime*"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/25hbpa/dc_nope_the_anime_a_short_comic_about_a/).

    The ~~protagonist~~ individual in question is not just doomed to ironic failure, but has failed *many times before we even begin!*
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      For her best chances to avoid *ever* winding up an MC, she should really just move out of Japan.  While there *are* anime plots that take place outside Japan, they're far fewer in number: she'll have an easier time avoiding them.
      ```

      - u/bbrazil:
        ```
        You're seriously suggesting that she becomes a foreign transfer student?
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Shit.
          ```

          - u/Kuratius:
            ```
            If she could learn the foreign language so well that she is able to fake being a native, she might be able to avoid that fate. In general, there are definitely ways to make your story so boring that the entire thing turns into a timeskip.
            ```

  ```
  Just read introduction. Wouldn't the best strategy be to select a favorable genre as opposed to avoiding any genre?  Action-Harem anime would guarantee multiple strong allies, at the expense normal relationships.  You could go for magical realism and benefit from having an ordinary life except for random magic events.  Just avoiding it seems like a bad plan.

  Of course knowing sufficient velocity, I'll bet they tried something like I described...  I'll read it later if I have time.
  ```

  - u/Rouninscholar:
    ```
    I think that trying to get close to a plot and not falling in would work best. The world demands an anime, be just close enough to cause one then step away
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Rather than fleeing plots, she should try to solve them in ways that circumvent the story.
  ```

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  The whole thing is great, but the literature teacher and the bucket are probably the best bits so far.
  ```
