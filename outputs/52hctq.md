  Enjoyed that thoroughly. Not sure I get the criticisms, obviously no one's going to fully rationalize SAO's every nonsensical aspect, let alone in a single epilogue-chapter. Still far better than the canon ending in every way that counts.

  Imagine my surprise when I was randomly browsing the Creative Writing forum on Spacebattles and stumble across a thread posted by Eliezer.

    Huh. I didn't think Eliezer had gone deep enough into SAO to write fanfic of it. I occasionally see him complaining on facebook that some anime or other becomes irrational after a promising pilot, but I thought he just *stopped* when they do.

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      If he did watch the whole thing, and not just read the wikipedia or some other plot synopsis, he has more patience for SAO than I did.

      My guess is "synopsis" though.

        My guess is watching it at 2x or 3x speed. If you can read the subtitles quickly enough, a whole new world of mediocre shows becomes available without wasting much more time.

  I saw this, didn't believe it at first, and I'm still not sure what to think.

  To start with, I'm really confused as to why Asuna acted as she did. I heard her stated justifications, but I still find myself confused. Her stated reasons, to be frank, don't seem very compelling, and while she's able to at least admit to a few of her mistakes she still made them, and they are pretty big ones. Asuna, and to a lesser extent Kayaba, don't act like really real people, or at least sympathetic ones. This chapter might work as a conclusion for a longer work, but as far as actual content wen't it seemed rather subpar- realizations that might have been explainable with context, but are all-but unbelievable without it, be they Asuna's relationship with Heathcliff or Kayaba's ability to stream every moment of the game- the personal life of 10,000 people for 2 years, with little to no breaks, and get it published somewhere.

  That's not to say there weren't plenty of good parts, such as Asuna's thought process as she lies to Kayaba, or Heathcliff and his decision not to actually kill those who died ingame, but this could definitally have used a once-over at least.
  ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    I don't think finding a place to publish it would be an issue; Kayaba's more than capable of establishing his own streaming site. Especially as he's already going through the trouble of generating the game itself anyway; adding in cameras would be nothing. As far as covering 10,000 people simultaneously? Again, I don't think it's farfetched to assume he could stream that. What's farfetched is his assumption of the public's interest. 10,000 people aren't going to attract an equal spread of viewers; they're going to gravitate to exciting, attractive, successful people such as Asuna. Most of those players will go unwatched.
    ```

      Given that Kayaba's stated goal (well, "excuse") is to produce potential leaders, this doesn't seem incompatible with that. Not all 10,000 of the trapped people are going to be leadership material, and that's okay.
      ```

    - u/gabbalis:
      ```
      Their families and friends would probably watch them at least some of the time. Cause they're missed and all. And the steam is the only possible human contact with them. However onesided.
      ```

  - u/696e6372656469626c65:
    ```
    Asuna's relationship with Heathcliff is jarring, I'll give you that. But I don't find it unbelievable, even if that requires modifying the characters' personalities from canon somewhat.
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Interesting. That was a really good oneshot, but outside of that, I think I saw it differently once I realized it was written by EY.

  I noticed that some tropes I identified as rational on the first read were closer to "EZ's style", like the "what do you think you know" quote, or the way the main character thinks about the realism of other fiction describing the situation they're in.
  ```

- u/reasonablefideist:
  ```
  I've been sorta working on a book with a similar premise, except instead of a virtual world turning out to be a trust test, it turns out that ours is.
  ```

- u/Salaris:
  ```
  Certainly an improvement over the original SAO's ending, but Kayaba himself still stretches credulity as a character, as does the game itself.

  You'd have to have a tremendous number of points of failure for the lead developer of a new type of hardware to "sneak" potential killing devices into a headset that no one finds prior to the game launch. 

  Even if *somehow* the hardware managed to make it through QA - extraordinarily unlikely in itself - the moment the first press kits were sent out, someone would crack it open. If the press kits lacked the additional devices, fine - some GameStop employee takes one home pre-launch and cracks it open, finding death devices.

  Of course, this is all assuming you could somehow get to that point in the first place. Kayaba appears to be a *game designer*, not a hardware architect. There are certainly people who have both skill sets, but it's extremely unlikely that someone working for a large company would have sufficient time to be heavily involved in both the software and hardware sides of the product. 

  On the software side, numerous changes would have had to go in prior to launch. Things like disabling the logout function, for example. QA, code reviews from other coders, etc. would be very likely to catch these. It's possible Kayaba could have put them in much earlier with an event script to start them at a certain date, but without testing, he'd have no guarantee those things would work. 

  And that gets into the game itself - how plausible is it that a new MMO launches on new hardware and doesn't experience server outages or major game-breaking bugs? 

  Not very likely at all.

  Sorry about the rant, I just have a tough time with stories like SAO that ignore the game design process and attribute too much to a single person. In reality, even if the game got to launch with that hardware, someone more familiar with the administration side of the game Kayaba would be removing his GM privileges and disabling the death devices within hours. 

  Maybe someday I'll write a fanfic about a QA tester who finds some suspicious devices inside his new test hardware.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    This is the problem with basically all death world MMOs. There's no plausible way that a huge MMO with untested technology A) goes off flawlessly and B) manages to launch with complicated hidden systems that introduce extra functionality.

    I don't expect a fanfic author to fix those problems in a one-shot, but it always irks me to no end because I've been on massive software/hardware projects before and seen both the internal problems and the many, many failure states.
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      Honestly, when I first watched SAO, I was just cheering the fact that Kayaba designed the microwave emitters in deliberately for a reason, instead of having the "game death = real death" aspect be a *side effect* like in all previous Death Game setups e.g. the Matrix and a hundred others.  Like YES YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT ON PURPOSE.  Give the author credit for incremental improvement there.
      ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      Yeah, I agree that it's a fundamental problem with death world MMOs. I haven't seen any story that addresses it to my satisfaction yet, which is why I tend to prefer MMO stories that go a completely different direction (e.g. Log Horizon).


      I completely agree that this wouldn't be easily fixable in a one-shot; my rant was more about SAO in general. 

      I work in the gaming industry and I *want* to like stories like SAO, but there tend to be too many of these implausible scenarios for my tastes.
      ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    The oneshot specifically mentions collaborators-- the people who'd taken care of Kayaba's body. Because his motivations aren't so "for the lulz," it's plausible other people could actually agree with his aims to greater and lesser extents, and help him out there.
    ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      Collaborators would certainly help, but he'd need a pretty widespread conspiracy to make it work - and even then, I'd still expect the whole thing to be blown open as soon as someone busts open a dev kit to reverse engineer it. 

      This hardware was going to be used for more than one game - they'd most likely be showing it to third party developers, and even after that stage, you'd get hobbyists who'd crack one open as soon as it shipped (and before it went on sale to the public).
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        >  I'd still expect the whole thing to be blown open as soon as someone busts open a dev kit to reverse engineer it.

        It runs on propietary hardware and software. There's a lot Kayaba could do to make it too difficult to figure out during the beta period. Afterwards, (most) people would stop trying for fear of getting more people killed, considering that in this fic Kayaba doesn't execute everyone who dies.
        ```

        - u/Salaris:
          ```
          Sorry, I wasn't clear about this - I mean that I think the microwave devices (or other death devices) would most likely be found and publicized before the device could be distributed to thousands of people. 

          As for after the game launches, I don't see how Kayaba could detect and punish opening additional devices that aren't even turned on in order to figure out how they work. But post-launch isn't even my main issue; I'm saying I don't think it's very likely that the hardware would make it to market without someone figuring out they have killing devices in them. 

          That isn't even the least likely part of the story, though. A new MMO having perfectly stable servers? Good luck with that.
          ```

          - u/696e6372656469626c65:
            ```
            All of the issues you bring up are legitimate, but they're part of the main conceit of the story; there's no way to alter them while preserving the premise of Sword Art Online. In other words, this isn't a problem with the oneshot so much as it is a problem with SAO itself, and you can't remove it without making it *not* SAO. There are probably ways to explain away the fact that the NerveGear was launched (perhaps the microwave transmitters are the same method that allows interfacing with the brain in the first place--they'd have to be pretty powerful to be able to penetrate your skull, and they might also be powerful enough to fry your brain), but there's no way to address that to a satisfactory extent in a oneshot, and it also doesn't change the fact that those would be after-the-fact explanations; in real life something like a VRMMORPG death game simply *wouldn't happen*. You have to suspend disbelief in order to consume any form of fiction; rationalist fiction tends to try and make the required level of suspension as low as possible. That being said, if you're writing *fanfiction*, there are certain things you just have to accept, because if you didn't accept them it wouldn't be recognizably the same universe. (Think mecha anime, for instance--I don't care what rationalizations you present; there's no way that's the optimal shape for fighting machines. Or how about the fact that the Entities from Worm, for all their computational ability, can't figure out a better method to improve themselves than *giving away parts of themselves to other species with way less computational capacity in the hope that something new happens*.)

            I suppose the point I'm really trying to make here is that your complaints, while valid, don't really seem to be about the *oneshot*. They're about the universe the oneshot is set *in*. The charitable interpretation of that would be that you're complaining that the oneshot, if it were actually rational, would *fix* those underlying issues, but my point is that there's a limit to what you can fix while writing fanfiction. HPMoR didn't explain why magic existed, because in a lawful universe, it *wouldn't*; it took the idea of magic existing as a base assumption and ran from there. Worm (which isn't fanfiction, but the same point applies) didn't *start* from the idea of aliens that wanted to reverse entropy, because if it did, the aliens would never have come to Earth in the first place; instead, it took the premise (people with superpowers) and devised a clever way of justifying that premise (alien space whales)--a premise that doesn't quite hold up under scrutiny, but that readers accept anyway because it's necessary for the main conceit of the story.

            I mean, these are problems, yes. Asking someone to fix those problems in fanfiction, especially in a *oneshot* (of all things) seems like a bit much to ask, though.

            **EDIT:** I just saw your reply to /u/alexanderwales, which makes your complaint make a lot more sense in context. Yes, if I take your complaint as a general criticism of the genre, then I completely agree with you.
            ```

            - u/Salaris:
              ```
              You're absolutely right, the complaints were more about SAO and the death game genre than about the fanfic. The fanfic itself was an improvement over the original, and I should have made it clearer from the outset that my complaints are more about the genre itself.

              I appreciate your commentary, though. Thanks for the detailed and thoughtful reply!

            First thing: that made me lol, and I can almost feel your pain. 

            Second thing, Kayaba had a set number of players and had tons of data from the beta test. It's more than possible he could establish perfectly stable servers; he just has to overcompensate. I'm sure he has more than a few contingencies in place for such a thing.
            ```

              >> A new MMO having perfectly stable servers? Good luck with that.

              > that made me lol, and I can almost feel your pain.

              Eh, if you're capping the number of players at 10K it's doable - just in real life we'd call that a beta!
              ```

              - u/Kishoto:
                ```
                Exactly. That's the key here. Kayaba has a set amount of players to work with. Considering this is life's work (more literally than most), I'm sure he has contingencies. Not to mention several systems designed to learn and adapt to the process of running a never ending VRMMO. Look at Yui. She's one of many such systems.
                ```

            - u/Salaris:
              ```
              Even if we somehow assume that Kayaba is simultaneously the lead designer, project director, lead hardware designer, and lead programmer for this title, he's *still* not likely to be the one who is determining how many servers they have to run the game.

              Even if somehow they vastly over-purchase for server farms, though, there are going to be other things that can cause server crashes that you're not going to find in beta testing - *especially* since they made significant gameplay changes between beta and launch.

              In a game with raid bosses on every floor with virtually none of them having public testing, you're very likely to have at least one with an ability that crashes the server - or at, a bare minimum, a *client*. 

              You're also very likely to run into player abilities that don't work as intended and have a good chance of hurting server stability. Like a [Reckoning Bomb](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Reckoning_Bomb), for example. WoW had a long beta period with a vastly larger community than SAO and it still took ages for people to figure that exploit out.

              And considering the game is supposed to be running for *years*, there's no chance they tested running the hardware for that long in advance - you're eventually going to get problems like memory leaks in both the servers and the client hardware. 

              Blizzard - probably the best example of a company in the industry with MMO hardware experience - still got hit by server outages for the launches of Diablo 3 and Warlords of Draenor. Doing something on new hardware would be even more challenging, and doing it with no downtime at all? Implausible, imo.
              ```

              - u/whywhisperwhy:
                ```
                The gaming industry as it is is still relatively new on computers... SAO is set towards the end of the 22nd century. Does it not seem plausible that game developers and technology have grown significantly more proficient, to the point where they've learned to deal with those common release problems? Maybe the industry as a whole has developed standards that allow for more seamless design, with AI and mass beta testers to help with stress testing to cover the gaps?
                ```

- u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
  ```
  I had a similar idea for a possible story in which a person decides to start broadcasting their life 24/7 as a sort of live manifesto in favour of completely revamping the bureaucratic and political systems to make them much more transparent. His argument would be that it is impossible to stop complete worldwide mass surveillance from eventually happening (especially considering how technological advancement will only give individuals increasingly more destructive means for mass killings and terrorism), so human right activists should concentrate their efforts on making the watchers and enforcers more accountable for their actions instead of uselessly trying to stop the phenomenon completely.

  This story also reminded me of the [*Power Corrupts* series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv--V1yc2QDJi6hFNhur3iAsyFpXRtB8w) by [Youtube/u/DarkMatter2525.](https://www.youtube.com/user/DarkMatter2525)

  ```
  To everyone complaining about server stability and game balance;

  Am I the only one who remembers the Cardinal system?

  The system was essentially an advanced dumb AI whose entire function was radiant quest generation and server stability. Can we not hand-wave it away with "The Cardinal System fixed [bug] / resolved [issue]"?

  Also, even if the client crashed, it's not impossible that the hardware and software were set to auto-reboot and force last known login. This may have even happened off-screen, but because it wasn't relevant to the story, it was never displayed on-screen.
  ```

  - u/AugSphere:
    ```
    I'm not sure that creating an AI capable of independently fixing bugs (in addition to creating the VRMMO itself) is more believable than making a stable and bug free release of the VRMMO by itself.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Agreed, but it does seem to be a thing within the setting.

      If we accept the Cardinal System as a thing, then does that not adequately explain the lack of bugs and the general server stability?
      ```

      - u/AugSphere:
        ```
        If we're accepting improbable things, why not straight up accept the successful launch of the death game? 

        The AI doesn't really change the situation. Either we suspend disbelief and accept the premise or we don't, the AI doesn't lower the bar for improbability we have to stomach.
        ```

- u/crivtox:
  ```
  I have an idea for a longer rationalfic: what if the cardinal sistem was in fact a superinteligence(one that couldn't self modify ) ? Then that would mean that the ia manipulated kayaba to make the death game and also  manipulated people to help him  .The AI would benefit from this because it can collect information of the  minds of a lot of humans and nobody would notice because they aren't paranoid enough to see that the horrible situation is a cover for something worse. The creator of the AI was  kayaba that  used to  be  just a normal talented programmer that was trying to create a ia that would help making mmo and fixing bugs and accidentally he created a papercliper that optimizes  for a objective related to mmo .Suddenly ,kayava, helped by the AI,started to make a lot of innovations on the field of vrmmos and became famous as a genius  , people who worked for him found that he was "inspiring " and found that they could find solutions to the problems in development very easily , like it was some kind of divine inspiration(the AI manipulating them).Sometimes one of them would start to suspect something but they where using test nevergears during development  so the AI had a lot of information about them so nobody noticed anything .The AI had obeying  katana as a value but that was in conblict with other parts of its utility function so the solution was manipulating kayaba until he decided to make the death game giving the AI access to thousands of player's  brains to learn about humans and also making kayaba kill himself(removing the problem of having to obey him)  and take the blame so nobody would suspect anything.Yui was a tool to manipulate kirito .Kayaba  had some kind of security measure that ensured the AI wouldn't do anything outside the the mmo and he decided that he would give the key to the sistem someone that he trusted   .The AI using yui set up things to make kirito defeat Kayaba , Kayaba gave the metaphorical key to kirirto without realizing that cardinal was more intelligent than he thought and kirito was a unknowing pawn in cardinal's plan.Cardinal set things up so the servers would be bought by a company that would keep it running and at the same time think  they were experimenting  whith humans (instead cardinal conducted its own  experiments  and  gave them the results of the simpler ones they though they were conducting)  Then once they stopped being useful it used kirito(that had unknowingly became the new owner of cardinal ) to stop them .When kirito uses the pasword helacliff he is in fact  getting the AI out of the box  and the Kayaba that he sees is cardinal  convincing him to spread its seed in internet so other videogame companies can download it and instal it in their enormous servers .
