## Comic Recommendation Thread

### Post:

So I've been thinking it's time for a new recommendation thread, but to avoid repeat from the last recommendation thread or just reposting the recent submissions, I'm making the requirement that the story has to be something drawn.

Comics, graphic novels, manga, webcoimcs, or anything else where the story is told through pictures instead of words.

  Qualia no purple, one of the strangest mangas I've ever read. Escalates really quickly, but the whole thing is kind of amazing
  ```

    I second.

    Definitely one of the better manga around.

    I enjoyed the quick escalation, but it went from "calm" to "crazy awesome" but then overshot to "silly" in my opinion.

  Gunnerkrigg Court, Homestuck, and Erfworld are among my favorite webcomics.

  This thread reminded me to catch up on **Strong Female Protagonist**. The angle it takes to explore superpowers/heroes is an interesting one, and the execution is good. 

  **Re:Monster** is good. Munchkinry. Perhaps a bit indulgent.

    SFP buys in too much to internet feminism for me to take it seriously. I have some problems with the characterization and dialogue after issue 5 starts. But I haven't read 1-3 recently, so I might have problems with them as well.

    Feral's arc (issue 3) was the best one, in my opinion. It made me cry.

      >Feral's arc (issue 3) was the best one, in my opinion. It made me cry.

      That's where I read up to before forgetting it existed. Disappointed to hear it doesn't stay that good.
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        Yeah, but that's just, like, my opinion, man. It's tied into very politically-charged beliefs, and I disbelieve some of them. You might not care.
        ```

        - u/Yuridice:
          ```
          Yeah, I just caught up. I think it's stayed roughly as good as the Feral arc, honestly. Which is to say, really really good. 

          I agree that the moonshadow stuff is more feminism-charged than the other stuff the comic covers, but I don't think it's as if the comic went out of its way to unabashedly push an "internet-feminist"-y stance. They made Furnace, who was in part the embodiment of anti-false rape accusations, a sympathetic character, and made sure to deliberately acknowledge male rape victims. It all seemed fairly reasonable and balanced to me, or at least enough so that it didn't leave me behind. 

          The breakdown on 157 was pretty good too, and really built upon the ongoing exploration of the particular themes of ethics and social responsibility that the comic covers and was so well done in the Feral arc. I mean, the comic has a little bit of tell not show going about it when it does this, both with Feral, the current arc, and other moments, but in general it's striking a chord with me and I think it works pretty well.

  **Superman: Red Son** is my favorite Superman comic (the pitch is that Superman's spaceship lands in Soviet Russia instead of Kansas).

  **[Demon](http://www.shigabooks.com/?page=001)** started out as being very much the sort of thing /r/rational would love, but has sort of descended into madness. I don't know, it's weird. Consider this a half recommendation?

  **[The Bouletcorp](http://english.bouletcorp.com/)** does a lot of really neat long-form comics. It's definitely one for RSS though, since he tends to drop a big chunk every few weeks rather than being on any sort of schedule.

  **Y: The Last Man** was good, and was part of that genre of "some big thing happens, here is the result", though the ending was a bit weak. It's finished, so it's got that going for it.

  For the ridiculous repertoire of bizarre facial expressions and the amazing dialogue (not to mention the self-awareness and hilarious action sequences), my current favorite webcomic is Paranatural.  

  The manga Liar Game, which focuses on game theory in the setting of, well, actual games. That the participants are forced to attend, after being roped in by the first round where they were either put into huge debt or blackmailed based on how they won. The protagonist is extremely off-putting at the beginning, but the other main character is awesome enough to offset it until the protagonist grows into herself as a competitor, which does happen.  

  The MSPA comic All Night Laundry. Incredibly well done, more than slightly creepy, and with a lot of mysteries to be unraveled.  

  That's all I've got off the top of my head, and I'd link them if I wasn't on mobile.

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    The reveal and ending of Liar Game was very disappointing.
    ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Liar Game: while they never explicitly spell it out, I really like that the female protagonist wins many game through the power of [](#s "credible precommitments"), which no-one less idealistic could do. She still needs the male protagonist to unleash that power in clever plans, but neither could he win without her.

    Shame that she has to drag that idiot ball for so long though.

  [No Hero](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3dyrbj/dc_no_hero_by_warren_ellis/) by Warren Ellis.

  Iâ€™d associate it with Watchmen and [Metropolitan Man.](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man)
  ```

- u/mns2:
  ```
  [Transdimensional Brainchip](http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/comics/first/) for a great premise and flawless execution. The bad art is just a bonus.  
  [Prequel](http://www.prequeladventure.com/2011/03/prequel-begin/) for being a better Homestuck.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    Transdimensional Brainchip btw has really, truly awful art. If you can deal with it or find it cute, then it's worth reading. It is a rationalist work with a profoundly unintelligent main character.

  [1/0 by Tailsteak](http://www.undefined.net/1/0/?strip=1)

  No idea how rational it is, but has some very good moments and is severely underrated.
  ```

- u/ancientcampus:

  I'll tentatively put out "El Goonish Shive", if "one of the male protagonists has the power to turn into a girl" isn't a put-off for you. ["Bringing Silly Back"](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1061) is a decent place to start. Kind of like Sluggy Freelance, in the genre of "bunch of normal characters who gradually through the story acquire superpowers form different sources". Unlike Sluggy, the plot is a little more tightly bound together.

  ["Grrl Power"](http://grrlpowercomic.com/) is a superhero comic that is very self-aware of the superhero genre, but not to the point of parody. Character driven, not combat driven. Very funny. Not particularly dramatic, but learning the universe, characters, and settling in is plenty interesting to keep me reading. Humor gets an "A", clever use of powers gets a "B+". Characters are smart, but the author hasn't tried to break the universe yet.

  I will never stop recommending http://freefall.purrsia.com/ it starts a bit slow, but ends up with a plot revolving around a colony's robot production facilities being forced to use a sentient AI design.
  ```

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  Not particularly rational, but... the One Punch Man manga has an entertaining story with a fantastically funny premise and characters. I recommend the more recent version with refined art over the terrible webcomic art the story was originally told with. Yusuke Murata's art is amazingly high quality; it's gorgeous, the manga would be worth recommending on the strength of the art alone.
