## How long did it take you to read Worm?

### Post:

I really want to start reading Worm, but I'm scared of how lengthy it is, so I'd like to know how long it usually takes people to read it.

  I was in sophomore year of college when I read the whole thing, I read it for a good two hours every night before bed and almost every spare moment during the day. Once winter break came, I was reading a lot more. I think all said and done it was a month or so? I read fairly quickly, but it's looooonnnggg.

  The real thing about Worm that I feel no one warns you about is that you're (probably) reading it on a computer, so you aren't holding a huge physical object that lets you feel how far you have left to go. What that means is that you'll think 'Oh wow I'm so close, let me just try to finish it tonight so I can be done.' But you're actually still half a million words from the end. If you've ever read a really engrossing book, something you couldn't put down, something with a really engaging climax that you just had to read right-the-hell-now - then imagine that feeling persisting for the entire length of a normal novel. That is what is crazy about Worm.

  It's really good though, I highly recommend it. Just be prepared for it to eat your free time for the next while.

    This is exactly how it felt. I started off slow, just a chapter here and there, but by the end all I did was get home and go read worm until I fell asleep. Same thing happened with twig.
    ```

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  It's around 1.7 million words. So, roughly 3 HPMORs, or 2 Worth The Candles. Or 10 Dunes. Or half of a Wheel of Time.

      So, 1.4 million.

        Huh, that's 966 words per day. I somehow thought that it was being written faster than that.
        ```

        - u/bpgbcg:
          ```
          It's faster now; I think it wasn't always 3 chapters a week (that was a Patreon goal).

          Average chapter length is 4k words, so 12k words a week works out to like 1700 words per day currently.
          ```

          - u/Claytorpedo:
            ```
            Definitely wasn't always 3. I think when it started it was just 1, but that was long enough ago I don't remember anymore.
            ```

            - u/imyourfoot:
              ```
              Yeah, it went 1->2->3 as respective Patreon goals were hit.

    It is not as dense as Dune. Close, but, not quite.

    Now, if you want something that's 10 Dunes, try Destination Void. Shit's all but impenetrable even for *me*,

- u/DarkwarriorJ:
  ```
  I no-lifed it in one week. That said, unless you spend every waking moment of a week-long break devouring the series like me, probably expect to take much longer. A month or more seems reasonable xD
  ```

  - u/ElizabethRobinThales:
    ```
    > no-lifed

    Hmm. I learned a new verb today.

    Maybe that's my problem, why I haven't been reading as much as I know I should. I've historically been very unlikely to begin reading a new book unless I'm in a position to "no-life" it. Maybe I should relax on that a bit, and take whatever one-hour or two-hour chunks of time without aural obstruction that I can find.

  I no lifed it as a depressed insomniac college student who speed reads in a few days. My normal and/or sane friends who I convinced to read it have all taken about two months, reading whenever they feel like it.
  ```

- u/wizzwizz4:
  ```
  Not that long; only a couple of months.

  I mean, usually it takes me a couple of _days_ to read a book. But Worm is worth it.
  ```

- u/onlynega:
  ```
  I think it was two months with mostly lunch time and bedtime reading, with a few "this is too late for bed time" and "I need to get back to work" breaks in discipline along the way. Honestly, it depends on what kind of reader you are.
  ```

- u/AStartlingStatement:
  ```
  It took me a long time because I stopped three times because I didn't really like it. Most people here seem to adore it though, so I accept I'm in a minority with regards to this.

    ```
    What were your problems out of curiosity? I'm not particularly fond of the sequel and am the minority in that regard

    - u/MereInterest:
      ```
      Some stories don't have much tension because the author isn't willing to let the characters lose.  Worm felt like the opposite, where even when the protagonists won, it never really had any effect, because the next level of escalation left all previous achievements meaningless.

          That's one of the dangers of posting on a fandom specific sub, instead of a generalized sub like r/books, r/scifi, r/fantasy, or r/noveltranslations.  All the hardcore readers sub there to discuss the work years after it has been completed, while the casual readers move on to other things.

        Ward hasn't updated from the superheroes being real and the end of the world.

        Worm was interesting in how the ridiculous "cops and robbers" was purposefully maintained.

        The villains were great, the world was deep, the characters all felt lived in. 

        Taylor's actions all flow logically and we get to see how she uses her brains and a weak power to win.

        Ward doesn't have the same feeling. 

        The economy doesn't make sense. The world ended but apparently there are enough surviving fashion designers to give everyone crazy costumes.  Wildbow will describe a detailed silk lattice with armour and greaves as a costume and then later describe starving refugees.

        We see all the great cosplayers on Reddit and how much time, effort, and money that takes.  

        Now imagine all of the great cosplayers on Reddit were doing that in the middle of modern Syria.  

        It doesn't make sense.  

        The story is about the parahumans not keeping to the cops and robbers from worm.  

        They start engaging in patented wildbow nightmare fuel which is great... But no one is questioning why these people in a New Orleans two years after Katrina are still wearing costumes and making up cool nicknames that explain their own powers to possible antagonists. 

        The old parahuman order should be breaking down by having more and more parahumans not bother to wear capes and make up names.  

        But no.... It doesn't and the story doesn't explain why these people who are worried about surviving through the winter are still concerned about having the right team name. 

        Also, the current arc has our protagonist, who can lift cars and fly, repeatedly fail to use any effective methods to combat her antagonists.  In worm, we got to see Taylor use her power in novel and effective ways and were impressed. 

        In Ward, our protagonist repeatedly fails to do anything to her antagonists. 

        She wants to be non lethal when she's throwing concrete blocks, they're throwing molten glass, and others are using 12 foot telescoping razor blades. 

        Wildbow is writing fight after fight where we are essentially, as readers, told to watch 20 people have a non lethal gunfight.  (The antagonists also use guns). Yet, our protagonist, when fighting people who have guns refuses to match their lethal intent.  

        In the last arc, a flying parahuman was throwing molten glass at an incapacitated teammate from the air.  

        Our hero caught her, put her gently on a hill, and told her not to do it again. 

        Because the villains are just lovable little scamps.  

        Wildbow's amazing body horror is there in what the villains do, but our protagonist doesn't respond reasonably or effectively to it.  

        It destroys the suspension of disbelief. 

        In Worm, you would wonder how  Taylor and the undersiders could possibly win and Wildbow would surprise us with sometimes brilliant. 

        In Ward, you see exactly how our protagonist and her team could win and Wildbow surprises us by having them do something dumb. 

        I hope it gets better, but it's been hard.

      Spoilers for Worm

      Not the guy you're responding to, but I had trouble finishing Worm. For me I just got kind of tired of the constant peril that had Taylor an inch from dying but making it out alive. Obviously that's a pretty common predicament to put book characters in but at a certain point it just felt like too much. But more specifically there were 2 main developments that had me stop reading for a while before coming back.

      >!The first was when they defeated Coil. It was just so unbelievable to me that the writer would have Taylor defeat this villain with the same reactionary, by-the-skin-of-her-teeth style as she beat every villain. With Coil's power and information, if he's making the first move there should be absolutely zero chance he fails. He could ask his precog for the stats on any assassination method he wants to try and he can take as many attempts as he wants to get it right. This really should have been an opportunity for Taylor to outsmart him and his power in some way, but instead Coil has to be given the idiot ball for a couple of chapters so that he can try and fail to kill her.!<

      >!The second time I stopped reading was the big time skip. The way it just glossed over the Endbringers as a threat (2 more are introduced as basically an afterthought) and Taylor's efforts to reimagine her image as a hero was just very jarring. Obviously the books would have been even longer if the story had taken its time with that 2 year gap but it's just really poor pacing in my opinion. Maybe Taylor should have spent less time as a villain so we could see a bit more of that story, and maybe they shouldn't have introduced 2 new Endbringers who have essentially no impact on the plot beyond maybe being a misdirection to make you think the world is going to end differently than it does.!<

      >!And at the end of the day I still don't know what's up with the Endbringers. The story suggests that Eidolon is responsible, but how exactly? And if his power is waning how does he make 2 more? And if he's responsible then why does the Simurgh censor information about the true nature of the Passengers to keep it from getting to Dragon in one of the Interludes? I think for how significant the Endbringers were to a lot of the story these kinds of questions should have been addressed with some satisfactory answers.!<

      Also, I haven't really been able to get into the sequel either, I just don't much care about any of the characters and nothing very interesting is happening with the plot.
      ```

      - u/fishingforsalt:
        ```
        Honestly from a rational standpoint i totally agree on the coil thing, narratively though it felt good though so i overlooked it

        The timeskip was pretty bleh, i think everyone agrees on that

        The eidolon thing didn't bother me though, I presumed his power just awakened what was already there (we see in the entity interlude eden created the endbringers and was going to awaken weaker versions to challenge the parahumans)
        ```

        - u/illz569:
          ```
          ** Spoilers Below **

          It's clear in the story that Eidolon's shard was one of the most important to the function of the entities. If you think of him like a codex, basically able to rifle through every available power, and when you consider that the primary drive behind the distribution of powers is conflict, it would make sense that he was the conduit through which the so-and-so's were born, in order to serve the ultimate purpose of the entities, which is what every cape was really doing.

          Of course, if you really want to get into it, there's always the possibility that he *wasn't* creating them, and that Scion just knew that *telling* him that he was would confirm Eidolon's incorrect suspicions. After all, there's no rule saying that Path to Victory requires it's user to tell the truth. A perfectly timed lie would be just as devastating as the truth.
          ```

      - u/RiOrius:
        ```
        For your first spoiler, IIRC the implication is that Tattletale did all the heavy lifting off-camera.  Which is less nonsensical, but still boring.
        ```

        - u/Iconochasm:
          ```
          There's also the factor that the major asset that was mentioned was temporarily out of play.  Personally, I think it helped that I found the individual scenes themselves absolutely riveting.  But I do think that the *sequence* is a major candidate for "things Wildbow would have rewritten if Worm were a regular novel instead of a web series".  It has the sort of feel I get after running an arc in a tabletop campaign, where the players have defeated the salient combat threats, but never really understood what was happening.
          ```

        - u/NasalJack:
          ```
          I get that for the ultimate resolution at the end with their confrontation, but Taylor getting that far alive in the first place speaks to incredible incompetence on Coil's part.

          I was hoping that they would concoct a plan to get around his power, but instead we just have him using it flippantly in a confrontation with some very resourceful supervillains (which is especially confusing since we had an interlude dedicated to how he was being even more careful than usual with his power to leave nothing to chance).
          ```

        - u/TrebarTilonai:
          ```
          It's been awhile since I read it the second time, but here is what I remember. The first time I read it, it seemed like Coil just had the idiot ball for narrative purposes. On a second re-read, though, it seemed like a legitimate win. Coil has a few weaknesses; he tends to split realities multiple times a day. He's egotistical. He tends to split realities as soon as he feels it is safe, even if it isn't. And in this particular case, he was up against a time crunch so he couldn't just have one timeline where he tried to off Skitter and one he could collapse to if it didn't work out.

          As soon as he split a timeline to help kill Skitter more efficiently, it was over for him. Skitter's ability to think creatively and improvise with her power (with, potentially, a little bit of help from QA. I'm going to need to reread Worm again after some of these revelations from Worm about how shards interact) beat out the ability to see the short-term consequences of two different actions so she was able to escape.

          And then, of course, Lisa had been playing the long game in a way that his power could not predict. That was the final blow, but the path to getting there was entirely in character and was not just him holding the idiot ball because the plot needed him out of the way.

      First person point of view from a character who acts like a dumb teenager.  Yes, I know there's an in-story explanation for why she acts like that, and also she *is* a dumb teenager, but it was painful and mentally exhausting to read people drive themselves off a cliff.

      At least there's fanfiction to soothe the burn afterwards.

      Mental exhaustion applies to the sequel too, btw.

        >At least there's fanfiction to soothe the burn afterwards.

        99% of Worm fanfiction is crap though, and that's being generous.

        Works that make the characters more rationalist are almost always *especially* crap.
        ```

        - u/MimicSquid:
          ```
          Yeah, it's too often the fic writer wanting to show how he's so much smarter than the protagonist, if only he'd been in that situation he would have done it *much* better.
          ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      I never finished it, but for me the main issue was probably that so much of what happens felt unmotivated; ‘and then’ instead of ‘and therefore’. For something so long, it was demotivating to continue to read when the characters felt like they were missing that spark of life, and not actually playing the game.

      On top of that, I associate Worm with the rationalist community, but Worm isn't rational, which grated.
      ```

      - u/fishingforsalt:
        ```
        I would consider worm a rational work, regardless of my qualms, but i understand that it's kind of vague what qualifies and i may be wrong

- u/Banarok:
  ```
  I'm a avid reader so i read rather quickly and it still took 2 weeks for me to read all of it, so for people that don't read stuff constantly, probably about double that at least.

- u/Hust91:
  ```
  If you are worried about the length, I'd just like to say: Don't be.

  Why?

  Because thanks to a consistent sense of progress in the story, nearly every single moment is very enjoyable.

  So if you view it as a collection of books, just sit down with the first one and see if you want to keep reading.

  In my own experience it was one of those really exciting books that made me downright crave more after every chapter.

  Every page made me want to read the nect to see how things go and at the end I really wished there had been more (and then it turned out that the fan fiction scene is amazing).
  ```

- u/Laborbuch:
  ```
  I have no concrete information since I partially read it as it came out, but it took me two weeks to get up to date (while at the same time attending university), to get to shortly before the first timeskip (I think).

  A good estimate would be 30 min per chapter , judging by Pocket’s duration estimation for the last couple arcs, but there are a few outliers with 90 min estimated reading time. The earlier arcs have much shorter chapters. 

  If word counts give you a measure, the chapters were 5000–8000 on the average. 

  Another comparison: *A Song of Ice and Fire* / *Game of Thrones* 1–4 are 1,350,000 words altogether; Kobo estimates 112–123 hours for that.

  ```
  Depends on where you put starting it and finishing it, I read up to arc 27 in my first read, then kind of dropped it, I picked it up again about 4 weeks ago and smashed through it in 2-ish weeks, and then immediately moved on to Ward, which I actually like *more than Worm*. 

  The worm audiobook project was a life saver in this, as it meant I didn't have to listen to the Google text to speech voice for the whole thing, though I used it for the arcs where I wasn't fond of the voice actor or couldn't understand them. I also was simultaneously listening to the We've got Worm podcast, which is basically a 2-4 hour analysis body each arc, depending on length, so that definitely slowed my reading.

  After downloading the whole audiobook I can vouch for the fact that it is 180~ hours long, so if you read as fast as a voice actor that is a number, though they usually read rather slow for clarity.

  iirc about a year and some in total -- it was decent, but not *that* good, and by the end I was reading it more out of a sense of obligation to the story than anything. Tried reading the sequel and dropped it after a dozen chapters

  as a point of comparison, I read the first ~35 discworld books in about as many days, which extrapolating from [here](https://imgur.com/a/ybHmR) would have a hair under 4.5Mw

  (had a lot of free time my first semester of college, taking a relatively small number of credits to ease the transition from HS, and they were all intro classes, so I read 1-2 books each weekday evening... nothing on the weekends though)

  for further context, I'd say Wales' content is the most readable on this sub -- I made it through the first ~60 chapters of WtC in about a month, and e.g. The Dark Wizard of Donkerk in an afternoon. Something like HPMoR was more like Worm, rather slog-y by the halfway point

- u/Skrattybones:
  ```
  I read it the first time in a weekend, but like, the entire weekend. I couldn't put it down. The second time through I took it at a more leisurely pace and knocked it out in about a week.

  But don't let anyone else's reading speed influence you. Just start reading it. Read a chapter. If you're still invested, read another chapter. If you're getting bored of reading, take a break. The whole thing is there, you can just read it in your own time.

  Outlook recommendation:  Don't read something for the sake of 'having consumed it'.  Even if you finish and know what others are talking about, if you didn't enjoy it enough to keep reading for its own sake, it probably wasn't put the time you put into it.

  &#x200B;

  Try reading a little, and then if you keep wanting to read more (including 'finding out what happens next'), do.  Reaching the end of something worthwhile should, ideally, be a little saddening (though also satisfying) rather than a relief.

  &#x200B;

  To put it another way, let reading-some-more-of-it be a pastime to savour rather than a challenge to tackle, and if you find reading it isn't enjoyable enough to do that then don't.
  ```
