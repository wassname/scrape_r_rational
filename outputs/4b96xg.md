    Ha ha yea, Your comment 24 days ago actually lead me to reading interviewing trey, and it was amazing. I wish you had told me the story had no ending though. One of the worst story disappointments ever.

      I'm so sorry, I was trying to imply it by saying that the author had stories "starting out," and then he gave up. I'll be more clear next time.
