## [HF][FF][RT] Update: The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake â€” A Steven Universe fanfic.

### Post:

>One day, Steven asks why he and the Gems live so segregated from the rest of humanity. When the answer turns out to be unsatisfactory, he and Connie takes it on their own shoulders to save the world from all its misery through the power magic.

>In their misadventures Steven threatens to leave the Crystal Gems, Connie kills herself sixty times, Garnet splits up, Amethyst acts as a voice of reason, and Pearl comes to find humans interesting; all the while dealing with the looming threat of alien invasion, the perils of social obligations, and the infinite complexities of the modern world.

>In the face of all that, they are going to need a lot more knowledge and a lot more magic to get the job done, and there are a lot of problems that need solving and a lot of questions that need answering first.

>But most importantly? They are not going to do it alone.

Starts after the events of the episode *Reformed* (Season 2 Ep. 5, Episode 57 overall) and relies heavily on canon material. If you have yet to partake in Steven Universe, you can watch the whole thing [here](http://theworldofstevenuniverse.blogspot.com).
