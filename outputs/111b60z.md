## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Thundamoo, who has been mentioned in previous recommendation threads as the author of both Vigor Mortis and Bioshifter, has started uploading the quest she's been running on her Discord, [Pokemon Mercury](https://archiveofourown.org/works/44996500/chapters/113218813), to ao3 with an editing pass.

  It's another story of "neurodivergent/traumatised protag who is no longer entirely human has to navigate the changes to her own identity, perspective, and disconnect from broader society," which might not appeal to everyone (even if Thundamoo has gotten really good at writing that whole setup). The protagonist herself, Mercury, is the product of a series of inhumane experiments about combining humans with pokemon, done by the same people who made Mewtwo, and has fallen much further on the pokemon end of that divide than the human. That said, the fact this is a quest, with all the long term plot ambiguity that comes with that, and that Mercury's thorough pokemon-isation has significantly eviscerated her own capacity and willingness for long term planning, seizing initiative, and seeking of agency can easily prove a detriment to people on this subreddit enjoying her perspective.

  That said, this is a fic which takes the disconnected mess of pokemon canon and continually strives to mesh it together into a cohesive whole. The worldbuilding is great to read, and Thundamoo's own knowledge and love of pokemon is clearly evident in the work. While a lot of popular fiction in this subreddit centres on seeing characters coming to an understanding of their world and situation as the story goes on, I believe people here can get a similar enjoyment from seeing an author put together the same for the readers as the story progresses, even if people here may not find themselves connecting to the protagonist struggling with similar issues from a substantially kneecapped starting point.
  ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    Oh no, can see why Bioshifter updates have fallen off, Thundamoo definitely needs to finish some of these stories she starts. She's becoming the authorial equivalent of Netflix.
    ```

    - u/gramineous:
      ```
      Vigor Mortis is a few chapters away from ending, and getting that right is where the bulk of her efforts have gone. The quest is a fun distraction clearing out some brainworms over the past couple of months, and Bioshifter is still at 3/4 chapters a month, though she was sick recently and people finally convinced her to take some time off.

      Edit: Also HMGGH, the story before Vigor Mortis, was completed iirc.

  Good rational fantasy or scifi in which at least most people do rational decisions, not just MC
  ```

  - u/CaseyAshford:
    ```
    I would recommend the finished Naruto fanfic "The Waves Arisen". It does a great job of portraying all of the antagonists as rational actors intelligently working to pursue their own goals independent of the protagonist. There are some very entertaining elements where this rational pursuit leads the characters to take actions that seem absurd on the surface but are motivated by sound logic and are generally successful. I particularly enjoyed the arc where Naruto helps Hinata overcome her psychological and familial problems by teaching her how to use the tools of rationalism.

          I thought it was pretty close to novel-quality. I really enjoyed the way everyone's viewpoint was pretty alien to others, which is kind of how it is in real  life, just no one realizes.

          Keep writing, I know it's a slog, but you're good at it.
          ```

    ```
    **Budding Scientist in a Fantasy World** has a rational, sensible MC and most of the other characters at least have reasons for their actions.  
    **Apocalypse Parenting**:  Even the cartoonishly evil characters have reasons that are logical, in their way.

  What are some webnovels and fanfiction you watch for every update?

  Here's a couple I've been following. A few of these I've supported the patreon during months I was too curious to just wait for the next chapter.

  [Ave Xia Rem Y](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/#post-41524293) - The best xianxia from a western author. Yes I do like it better than cradle. Only problem is that one update a week for what is setup to be an epic xianxia level story has led me to the realization that this story literally might never finish.

  [Industrial Strength Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57011/industrial-strength-magic) solid Macronomicon story. Good humor, well written insanity and fun weirdness.

  [Enlightened Empire](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire) - My favorite kingdom building novel, but it is quite rough in many ways. Messy and weird, but brilliant in many ways.

  [All the Skills](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/55687/all-the-skills-a-deckbuilding-litrpg) - Well written deckbuilding novel. Interesting world and mechanics. The glaring problem is just how op the mc is which despite the positives of everything else makes the story a bit boring.

  [The Last Orellan](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46901/the-last-orellen) - Came back from the dead in December. One of the best progression fantasy stories out there. Being a sucker for [stories where the mc has a good relationship with their family](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/101em0c/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/j2uggcm/), this one is an instant read when an update comes out.

   [Hard Enough](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hard-enough-pokemon-si.102511/#post-23596192) for [these reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/101em0c/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/j2uggcm/)

  [With Great Power One Must Go Further Beyond \(Marvel/MHA alt power\) aka Power Plus Ultra](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-great-power-one-must-go-further-beyond-marvel-mha-alt-power-aka-power-plus-ultra.18234/) - Scrivener wrote two absolutely classic superhero fanfics ([Variant Strain](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8642442/1/Variant-Strain) and [Inviolate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate)) and this one is looking to be the same. Peter Parker has BNHA's All For One power which means he goes on a different journey, but he still holds those values that Peter Parker is famously known for. Something much tougher to keep to because of where life takes him and the potential his power carries.

  [An Undertow of Sand](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/an-undertow-of-sand-percy-jackson-and-the-cthulhu-mythos.941042/#post-76345880) is amazing. (PJ/Cthulhu Mythos) Love the characters, worldbuilding and way the plot travels. Percy's much more powerful and unlike most demigods has a God parent that helped raise him, but being a God meant that she legitimately traumatized him. 

  [An Impractical Guide to Godhood](https://archiveofourown.org/works/32339365) is an absolutely amazing PJ fanfiction. (PJ/A practical guide to evil) I have not read Practical Guide to Evil, and it is unnecessary. Antony444 takes the PJ universe and fleshes it out into a much more fantastic magical place with an absolutely entertaining mc. 

  [Raise](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14043289/1/Raise) is a Coeur Al'Aran story first and RWBY fanfiction second. Follows the story of a boy who awakens superpowers (a semblance) that is too powerful to handle. He can reverse death (within some rules). An amazing power, but one that invites a host of problems along with it. Problems that traumatize a young village boy as he tries to live with the expectations such an incredible power brings with it. Sad, interesting and entertaining to see how the story goes.

  There might be more that I automatically read when they update, but they update so infrequently that I'm not including them on this list. Also I might have forgotten some stories for whatever reason and will edit to include if I remember.

    > \- The best western xianxia from a western author. Yes I do like it better than cradle. Only problem is that one update a week for what is setup to be an epic xianxia level story has led me to the realization that this story literally might never finish.

    I dropped it for this reason, once I realized the author took 2 years to write what would have been the equivalent of 5 introductory chapters of a normal story in the genre I just dropped it. 

    &#x200B;

    I also felt massively hoodwinked, when I started reading the tittle was perceived to be a parody, given that the story had been 2yo and having none of the tropes the tittle implies by that point. 

    &#x200B;

    People just assumed the tittle was a joke, and then suddenly it turns out it was just the generic introductory chapters of a xianxia story but bloated, glacially paced and with all the tropes we thought he was joking about.

    &#x200B;

    It was a massive shift, we went from this doctor slice of life story in a xianxia setting to a generic xianxia story, just like the tittle promised. The warning was there, we just thought it was a parody.
    ```

    - u/ProfessorPhi:
      ```
      Hmm, it's definitely had a big genre shift, but I've actually enjoyed the story being played straight. Any kind of deconstruction will eventually need to be played straight at some point. I've enjoyed the story much more since it went from slice of life to xianxia, and the recent arcs have actually been excellent to read. 

      I definitely agree that it's update pace is glacial and it's going to take 2 years per arc so it really doesn't feel very worth the time investment.

        As someone who read way too much translated novels for his health, Ave does xianxia better than most actual xianxia. And yeah, it’s definitely a reconstruction of the genre, not a deconstruction.
        ```

      - u/SpeakKindly:
        ```
        Ave Xia Rem Y has much better characterization than Forge of Destiny, though. Forge of Destiny shows everything only from the viewpoint of the main character, and tries very hard to make that viewpoint kind of oblivious. Ave Xia Rem Y has some very cliche characters, but they all get a chance to justify their existence and their cliches to the reader.

  I've been trying lately to read more novels instead of web serials (mostly because I want tighter, less sprawling and meandering stories...)...

  First an anti-recommendation. My only prior experience of Scalzi was redshirt which I found hilarious and, strangely, rational adjacent, characters were not behaving stupidly (in a zany world). Based on this, I decided to give the Interdependency trilogy a try...

  The first book was not bad, if it were to be compared to a meal, I'd say it'd compare to in-and-out burger, Decent ingredients, decent execution, it's still junk food but it's well done junk food. The book wasn't bad, the characters and situation were interesting and there were not too many idiot balls flying around.

  The second book, was more like a Shake Shack, you wait a long time around that shack in New York for something that's at best mediocre and you wonder why you even bothered. It's not terrible but there's just so many better choices out there. It's more of the same as the first book and it's hard to imagine how that story can be a trilogy given the pace of the first two books.

  The third book is more like Staph that you pick up from the previous two meals, it completely ruins the entire trilogy and makes you feel that you completely wasted your time reading any of those books. The way this book works is that suddenly Scalzi pulls out a huge Deus Ex Machina and the book ends very abruptly. It feels that the writer wrote himself in a corner and had both no idea how to get out of it and no motivation to continue this book. I have a hard time remembering a book that disappointed me more.

  So, huge anti-recommendation from me there...

  On the other hand, I've finished Tress of the Emerald Sea which was just so nice, whimsical and sweet. It reminds me very strongly of Stardust and kind of reads like a fairy tale. If that were to be compared again to food, I'd say this book is like a very delicate dessert at a high end restaurant, it looks good and you're hesitant to break the presentation and start eating but, once you do, flavours pop in your mouth in ways you never expected them too. The desert is over all too quickly and you wish there were still more.

  It's a very good story and I'd recommend it to people here, there's even a passage that really reminded me of this community:

  >“Tress looked toward Crow. And then, Tress took the singular step that separated her from people in most stories. The act, it might be said, that defined her as a hero. She did something so incredible, I can barely express its majesty.I should consider this more, Tress thought to herself, and not jump to conclusions.”

  &#x200B;

  Any good recommendations for rational adjacent novels?
  ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    The entire Ted Chiang anthology is great, though it's mostly short stories. You might have seen some of his ideas in Black Mirror or Arrival which was adapted from his work

    I read through the Scholomance Trilogy recently, and really enjoyed it. It's a story about a magical school that is separated from the world given that the world is dangerous for young magical children. I really enjoyed the characters and the world building, it was really creative and super interesting. The author, Naomi Novik is also a founder of ao3. 

    I definitely would recommend The Magicians, it feels like a rational deconstruction of Hogwarts and Narnia at the same time. The story loops on itself really well and I don't think I've read a book where I've been so satisfied with its conclusion. I never read the sequels, but I did watch the TV show which I also enjoyed a lot, especially its departure from canon.
    ```

  - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
    ```
    Tress is brilliant, just such a wholesome warm fuzzy story. Everyone should read it. 

    It does have a similar feel to Stardust, though the film more than the book (I prefer the film)
    ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    I also wasn't a huge fan of the interdependency books, but I have re-read Old Man's War probably 3 or 4 times. I _love_ that book. It's probably in my top ten favorite novels of all time. The sequels aren't quite as strong, but are still good/worth reading. Old Man's war stands on it's own though and there isn't really much need to read the rest if you just want to stick to the best of the best.

    -edit- A note given the sub we are in, while I very much enjoyed the world he builds in the book, if you look too hard at it, it starts to break down a bit. Especially from a "rational/HSF" perspective, the way the politics of the world turns out would probably be pretty unlikely. He sort of takes a stab at addressing this indirectly, but, while it's good the sort-of-explanation is there, it's not really enough to fully justify things. (Trying to avoid spoilers, if anyone wants more detail, I can follow up with spoiler tags). Other than that though, I think the characters are strong, the technology is smart, plausible-ish, and well thought out, and I think it's an overall great story.

  Here's a copy from a [post requesting and recommending romance from a couple of years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gm33op/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fr22917/)

This story is a well put together crossover of How to Train Your Dragon and Frozen. It gets somewhat frustrating/slow at parts, but overall worth a read to the end. The dynamic between the heads of state makes this story. Solid writing, well paced plot and great characters.

The only real problem the premise is annoying the actual realism of how premise came to be in story is fairly farfetched, but the rest is is fantastic. The characters are very interesting, the conflict is very well done and the writing very high quality.

Set in a world where TR was a woman, this story is romance between the diary spirit fem TR and HP where they're both the same age, 16. The story focuses on the relationship between the newly, created/born diary TR and a more callous/older Harry Potter. Short and sweet.

    +1 to Grow Young with me, probably the best Romance fanfiction I've ever read. A few movies you might like are The Last Right, X + Y, and The Garden of Words. All three are a bit light on the romance side but they all have something about them that I can't put into words.

      Garden of Words is just aesthetically gorgeous, even if you care nothing for the plot.

  Bit late into this week, but does anyone have any good recs for published fantasy novel series? Or any sort of engaging fiction novel series that has copious amounts of violence.

  I think I’ve read most of the truly engaging RoyalRoad fictions, and don’t want to search through trash anymore. I just don’t enjoy shlock like Tunnel Rat or 90% of litrpgs or xianxias on the site, and another comment here made me realize I’m in the mood for some fulfilling, tight, and mostly complete stories. Daily Jackal Among Snakes and The Jester of Apocalypse updates can only sustain me for so long, along with the much more infrequent fictions I keep up to date on.

    [Masters and Mages](https://www.goodreads.com/series/192725-masters-and-mages) trilogy. Basically a coming of age story of a guy going to magic university in alt-history Byzantium and getting embroiled in epic, world-spanning plots. It's complete, and pretty fucking good IMO.

    [Timberwolf](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52693586-timberwolf), a story about a guy infiltrating the SS in alt-history nazi germany on orders of his Patron god, the devil/boogeyman. Also there's magic and diesel punk and america is a kind of hivemind(it's kinda unclear). A wild ride, full octane. Complete and self-contained.

    [Covenant of Steel](https://www.goodreads.com/series/310529-covenant-of-steel), where a young cutthroat who grew up in a ~~merry~~ band of outlaws(explicitly inspired by robin hood, I believe) sets out on a journey of revenge after getting betrayed by someone he trusted. (might interest u/hi____nsa, now that I think of it). Third one comes out in a few months, really looking forward to it. First book is good, second book is great.

    I've recced these here a few times, so apologies if you've seen it before.

  Looking for a more rational version of the [39 clues series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/45556-the-39-clues) (to qualify the statement, something that involves a hunt for something based on solving puzzles would work). Thanks in advance.

    The Years of Rice and Salt is an alt-history story where Europe is devastated far more by the bubonic plague and follows a group of characters who reincarnate multiple times over the course of centuries. It’s written by Kim Stanley Robinson, whose Mars trilogy I also highly recommend.

    [The Fifth Defiance](https://thefifthdefiance.com/2015/11/02/introduction/) is a great supervillian story set after most of civilization has fallen. Great mix of bleakness and hope, the 5 main characters are all compelling in their own ways, with much focus on their interactions with each other.

    [The systemic lands](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57018/the-systemic-lands-dark-progressive-litrpg) :

    MC gets teleported into a new world with other people with a system and a store where u can buy stats. I like this story because is full of mistery and the protagonist try to act rational.

    [The Pillar of Enera](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51180/the-pillar-of-enera)

    i dont know how to descirbe this book, english is not my first language and i find hard to write long senteces, but if u liked A pratical guide to evil i think u may also like this book.

    [Ave Xia Rem y](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15193/ave-xia-rem-y)

    One of the best xianxia story on royal road (imo), very slow with the pace of the story.

  Requesting good revenge stories or more simply stories that invoke the feeling of righteous anger on behalf of the mc. Some angst would be a plus as well. I know that these are all characteristics of stories found in a lot of Ao3 slash fanfics, and though I'd like romance to be part of this I'm not particularly interested in slash stories.

  Was re-reading some old fanfiction and was reminded the unfinished Coeur fanfic [A Hunter or Something](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12646396/1/A-Hunter-or-Something) to have righteous anger on behalf of the mc and hinted at angst, but was indefinitely stalled when I was reading it weekly and is probably abandoned at this point. [Durandall](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/47897/Durandall), RIP, one of my favorite fanfiction authors had a couple of stories that despite being fairly short, did the angst, righteous anger and romance combo really well. [Outcast](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8493574/1/Outcast) and  [At a Glance](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6995020/1/At-a-Glance) are the ones that come to mind. Actual literature that has these qualities along the lines Count of Monte Cristo is also requested. 

  Lies of Locke Lamora book 3 is another book that had righteous anger, angst and romance, but the actual plot, flow of the story and understandable but thoroughly frustrating mindset Locke had in regards to his love made it a fairly unsatisfying novel.

    [The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/) is a sci-fi story about an AI spaceship that has been waging a one-man guerilla war against the imperialist aliens that wiped out humanity two thousand years ago. To say that it hates them would be... an understatement.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:

    Maybe check out Coeur's [Null](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13492440/1/Null)? A lot of righteous anger and angst involved but maybe not enough revenge.

    The Engineer Trilogy by K J Parker.   The thing about K J Parker is that all K J Parker stories are about the same, so if you don't want to invest in three novels, you can just read [anything](http://web.archive.org/web/20120822105425/https://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/winter_2011/fiction_a_small_price_to_pay_for_birdsong_by_k._j._parker/) by him to decide if that is the thing you want to read three books of.

    The Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester. 1950s cyberpunk about a man too angry to die.

    Joe Ambercrombie’s Best Served Cold is a great revenge novel, but it’s a loose sequel to his First Law trilogy. You won’t be lost without treading it first, but it’ll be less satisfying.

    Jack Vance’s Demon Princes series. Keith Girsen and his grandfather were the only ones to escape when the five Demon Princes enslaved their village. There’s five books. The outcome is not a surprise, but the journey is a great romp through very different worlds and cultures.

Further the main character is purported to be smart. Ugh...
  ```

  - u/LaziIy:
    ```
    The world is interesting but the cast and plot are abysmal . The main character is just a projection template for someone to run rampant in a pseudo fantasy feudal world to satisfy desires.  

    The main character supposedly being smart is only because the characters relative to the MC appear to be mind bogglingly dim witted. Its a comedic skim/read for the world but if you can't get past the first 10 or chapters, you won't miss much for the rest of it.
    ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    I pushed on through, and it wasn't worth it. The MC groups up with an old white guy, an Asian guy and a Mexican guy. The Asian is a medical student, the Mexican is a gangster who betrays the group.

    Perhaps unsurprisingly, the whole thing also consistently reads like someone not particularly smart who thinks being a sociopath makes them smart. Seriously don't bother reading.
    ```

  - u/TJ333:
    ```
    Commented on the story when it was newer and got some replies from the author, it is intentional that the MC thinks he is smarter than he is and his early success is based on luck.

    All characters are somewhat incompetent and have other issues that hold them back as well.

    It is not a good match for /r/rational.
