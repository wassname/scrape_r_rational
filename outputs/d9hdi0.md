  And it's just as good as the previous ones. Only complaint is it suffers a bit of the 'middle book of a series' problem - the ending doesn't really wrap up very much.

    Just finished it.  I want *more*, again.

    I continue to enjoy Will Wight's inclusion of blooper versions of scenes in the book.

  Thank you!

  Unfortunately, it is the least rational of the Cradle books by a large margin. It is riddled with plot holes, retcons, and characters acting stupidly for no reason.

    How so?

  ```
  I enjoyed it, but I'm just not a huge fan of tournament arcs, no matter how well they are done.
