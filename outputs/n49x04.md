## Rational Fiction isn't a thing or rather it's just a label for good writing

  I swear I read this exact argument several years ago. Heck, I think I *had* this argument with an ex of mine, haha.

  >**But that's the definition of good writing; the world and the characters in it** ***are supposed to be consistent.***

  This is a false claim. There is very good writing out there that purposely bucks this style. Magical realism springs to mind; the inconsistency of the world and characters is key.

  Or heck, even Harry Potter, where the rules of the world seem to change constantly (which is why HPMOR, one of the definitive pieces of rational fiction, was made in the first place). The inconsistency doesn't stop millions of fans from loving the original series, nor does it stop them from thinking it's good writing.

  >But there's no such thing as "Rational fiction".

  The sidebar gives a definition and common features. If something fits these, why do you oppose calling it rational fiction?

  Following the same logic: there are no movies about WW2, only action movies featuring the military.

  You are confusing writing style with.. Genre, I think? What you are describing is in other terms an "organic story". The characters act and develop in a self consisting way without being forced by the author or the plot to take an action they would not to otherwise. Game of thrones is a good example of this, like you said.

  Rational fiction is basically just fiction with a heavy focus on smart characters making smart decisions, written in an organic way.

  If we just called this subreddit 'good fiction' then where would we get? Good is too easily confused with popular and I'm sure people have entire arguments on this very topic. 

  A lot of people are more interested in emotions and relationships as opposed to hard, logical coherent plots, intelligent characters, strategic situations and worldbuilding. Or they might just prefer quality of prose to plot. Rational fiction is like a 1960s era interceptor jet: primary emphasis on speed as opposed to agility, range, avionics, payload... There are a lot of things that make good fighter jets good and just like with literature we're primarily interested in one.

    At least going from the three most popular stories on here (MoL, WtC and HPMOR), the sub could be renamed to OverPoweredNerdFiction ;)

    Although I don’t know whether that would include too many other stories that don’t fit. But I can’t think of any right now.

  I wrote a blog post about this a bit ago, [Rational Fiction as Narrative Focus](https://alexanderwales.com/rational-fiction-as-narrative-focus/) which I think gives a better, more helpful definition.
  ```

- u/causalchain:
  ```
  A lot of people here also think "Rational" fiction is poorly named, but it's too late to change now. It definitely doesn't mean "rational" in the sense of cold calculated reason (though that is often a fun trope)

  It's NOT just good fiction, it's consistency *at the expense of* other enjoyable features. For example, it means the villain never gets to monologue at the end, and we never find out what his plan was, because he doesn't want to.
  ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    > Another issue with Rational fiction is the idea that characters are supposed to be intelligent and highly rational.

    This is false. Characters only need to be consistent for it to be rational fiction. An emotional character is perfectly fine.

    The thing we hate is when characters do out-of character things for the sake of the plot. An emotional character might do it because an exaggerated emotion. a cold calculator might do it because they somehow guess the right answer out of all the possibilities, despite it not making sense. Both are very common, and equally despised.

    We like it when they're intelligent just because we find competent characters more fun to read about. There is no "supposed to"

  My take, reposted from an [earlier thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e25rbdl/):

  > Rational fiction rewards [gears](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding)-seeking.
  > 
  > 
  > By gears-seeking, I mean a stance to reading which is essentially the opposite of suspension of disbelief.
  > 
  > 
  > Suspension of disbelief involves accepting something as a brute fact, not trying to understand how it fits into a broader framework, not asking why, and [not dwelling on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8w95xIdH4o&t=26s) (as that would interfere with enjoying the story). A gears-seeking reader is doing the opposite of this: looking for the underlying processes behind what's happening, taking each thing that happens as [deeply entangled](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wyyfFfaRar2jEdeQK/entangled-truths-contagious-lies) with the rest of the world, and being curious about the nature of the coherent world in which these events are taking place. They are letting their world-modeling skills loose on this fictional world.
  > 
  > 
  > One place to see obvious symptoms of this approach is with fictional worlds that fall apart when modeled. Gears-seeking readers will notice plot holes, idiot balls, and similar, including deep flaws as well as nitpicks. Sometimes this leads to attempts to rationalize/retcon the world by devising their own set of underlying processes in which events much like the ones in the original story do fit together coherently. Rational fiction which is intended for gears-seeking readers typically strives for internal consistency, where the world runs on systematic "laws of physics" (even if they involve "magic"), the characters do things which make sense to them at the time, and the society is what you'd get from a whole bunch of these beings with their physics and technologies.
  > 
  > 
  > But internal consistency is not enough; rational fiction also **rewards** gears-seeking. The story is written so that gears-seeking leads to deeper understanding and appreciation of the story. For example, often a character's success depends on figuring out more about how the world works and scheming about how they can use these raw materials to accomplish what they want. If the story provides the reader with enough information about the world, then the story is calling on them to join in on seeking gears and scheming. (One of the main ways that a story fails to be "rational" is by not giving the reader enough information to seek gears; instead it's just one thing after another. The author may have a coherent world in mind, but the reader can't see enough of it to let their mind loose on the world.)

  > This is a main reason why rational fiction is often set in a magical world and alien society. Internally consistent realistic stories can just use the actual world as background; they [don't require world-modeling](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml) from the author or the reader. Whereas an internally consistent fantasy world can easily call forth efforts to understand the gears behind the laws of magic, how the society ended up as it did, and what awesome opportunities might exist for a person in that world.

  I'm not on here much, but I think this argument, or one much like it, pops up several times a year at least.  I know it's far from the first time I've seen it.  Ratfic is a suboptimal label for a cluster of characteristics commonly found in the kind of fiction that's popular with a certain reader group.  Those characteristics are not identical to what makes fiction good.  To put it another way, would you call Jane Austen a ratfic writer, or just a hack?  Not that I'm a fan, myself.

    I've seen people argue that Jane Austen's works are rational, in that they have self-consistent characters who intelligently strive towards their goals.

- u/Tdaken:
  ```
  Well i would say that most labels only work for reference and won't perfectly translate the phenomenon. 

  Anyway this is a discussion that I would be glad to join if it was in my native language. I'll stick to watch.
  ```

- u/Dragfie:
  ```
  I largely agree; other than in the unique cases that are unrealistic on purpose, internal consistency is just good writing, but I disagree that the label does not have merit. 

  Internal consistency (or rationality, how realistic it is w/e) is one of the multiple measures of what makes a story good along with plot, pacing, characters, and whatever other metrics affect an individual's enjoyment of a story. These are always:

  1. Subjective and
  2. Often on a scale, where the bar for an experience to be enjoyable for each is also completely subjective along with the point where no further enjoyment is gained with an increase in the specific metric.

  In the case for internal consistency, most people's "bar" on how internally consistent a story needs to be before they start getting turned off by it is (in this community's perspective) fairly low. "rational fiction" is just fiction who's internal consistency meter is much higher than the norm, specifically designed for people who are sensitive to this metric. - You are arguing that rational fiction = good writing, I am arguing that internal consistency is a single metric out of many to judge good writing and rational fiction = good writing in this one specific metric only, which basically IS the definition. 

  \^That is basically my argument, but to expand a bit more: a good metaphor for this is movie quality; yes, 1020p is just better than 720p, but for some people, the difference between the two does not affect their enjoyment of the movie. Rational fiction would be the equivalent of 1280p movies, specifically for people who are super sensitive to that measure of quality, and needs a separate label rather than just "good movies" because this sensitivity is **unique.** 

  As a side note as well: Individuals who are sensitive to this tend to also share other subjective traits, which makes us (I guess) tend to enjoy similar things and a separate label useful for this reason as well.

      >So I think it makes sense to get rid of Rational Fiction as a genre because it tends to be overly general and replace it with Rationalist Fiction which focuses on the transparency of character's motivations and decisions.

      I disagree with this: the designation of rational and rational**ist** is clear, understood and used correctly. The fictions you described **are** described as rationalist as well as rational. There are fictions like Beware Of Chicken, Cinnamon bun etc which I would call rational but not rationalist, and fiction like delve, a budding scientist in a fantasy world, etc which I would call rationalist but not rational.

      These definitions are clear: rationalist is a genre, rational is a threshold on the bar of internal consistency, but because this is so unique often looks and acts like a genre. This is how the term is used on the sub and does not cause confusion. There is no point changing the word "rational fiction" to "how internally consistent a story is" because it is already defined and understood as that. And as I think you agree, we can't change the word to "good fiction" because this is false, its good fiction judged by one of the many metrics excluding all the exceptions, which is what we define as "rational fiction" already.

  Do you think *Romeo and Juliet* is both A] rational fiction, and B] good writing? I personally argue that it is certainly good writing, but decidedly not rational fiction.

  > Rational fiction is described as fiction that has a world with consistent rules and characters that behave consistently and logically.

  No, it isn't. Check the sidebar again, because you've boiled it down *way* too much.

  > But that's the definition of good writing

  No, it isn't. "Good writing" has no simple, universal definition. In one sense, "good writing" is whatever is technically elegant or aesthetically pleasing. In another sense, "good writing" is whatever achieves its aim. If a story is internally inconsistent, but produces specific emotions in its audience, and those are the emotions which its author sought to produce, in that kind of audience, then it was, in this sense, well-written. 

  What you're doing is confusing "good writing" with "writing that whoislawliett likes."
  ```

- u/Roneitis:
  ```
  This is stupid. Good writing can't be nearly so neatly summed up, and rationality is not at all a component of lots of works, prime examples being many surrealist or poetic works, or any work not centered on character. There are many things that make a work "good" (ignoring the whole ass issue that is assuming there is such a thing as objective goodness). Rational fiction (which exists more as a community than as a genre) is fiction that focuses on one aspect over others, not because it necessarily produces the best work, but because you get different, interesting work.   


  Here's an interesting metaphor: when one is trying to learn chess, one has this vague sort of goal of "playing well" in the sense of trying to make good moves. A beginner, however, really doesn't know what sort of moves that consists of, and they're essentially playing randomly. One thing that a beginner might try is to replace that goal of "playing well" with a different goal, like, say, "move my pieces near the enemy king", or "have my pieces targetting the most possible squares" which is adjacent, but easier to define. This is a useful learning exercise, and creates chess games (or stories, unwrapping the metaphor) that you haven't seen before, that are both interesting in their own right, and teach you about grander chess.   


  And finally: if rational fiction were "just good writing", why are there stories that people here like that don't get recommended? If you asked the majority of people here for their favourite books, many would give answers that wouldn't get posted here. The two off the top of my head definitely do not fit the mark.
  ```

- u/DAL59:
  ```
  Subject matter and how fiction approaches it are part of the definition of rational fiction.  In very oversimplified terms, rational fiction promotes Enlightenment subjects like bayesian logic, the usefulness of AI, and the effects of hard magic systems on a world, while most fiction focuses on Romanticist values (the amount of books about technology being bad, things being suddenly overcome through deux ex machinas the protagonists "earned" through morality, and things just happening solely for the sake of message is very high).  Frankenstein is a very well written book with consistent characters, yet it is the polar opposite of rational fiction.
