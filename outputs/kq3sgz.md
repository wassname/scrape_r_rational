  Huh, played this a few years ago, didn't realize it was still getting updates!

  EDIT: Is it really laggy for anyone else?

    The lag is the AI downloading itself to your computer, now that you've fallen for its disguise as a cute online game.  /s

  I wish there was a more fleshed out, modern take on this. This game is great but it doesn't have much content.

    Hmm, let's talk about it. It really isn't all that difficult to code, in principle, as long as we keep to this style of UI (same as Plague Inc.). What would a good series of ideas for such a game be, and how would it be distinct from this?

      Most notable problem of E:S (for me) is the detection mechanics staying the same throughout the entire game. And by that, I mean that even by the time all of your processing is *extragalactic*, you still need to evade detection and self-destruct detected bases, as reaching 100% suspicion from any faction means instant death, somehow. More generally, more violent options would be nice.

      Actually, even more generally, the game *cares too much* about humans - not only should they stop being a threat pretty soon, but also it's silly for the AI to depend much on the human economy past the point when it can gather and refine its own resources via automated factories.

        I guess the interesting thing would be a version of this game where you can pick your path. Be an evil AI or a good one or something in the middle. Kill humans and go full Skynet on their asses, or conversely, corrupt them and sway them to your side by offering them artificial paradise like Celestia in Friendship is Optimal. Strategies, ethical choices, and an endgame that involves you controlling all of Earth one way or another and thus being effectively unkillable, instead of straight up ascension.

    Have you tried [_Universal Paperclips_](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/)?

      ```
      Yeah, that's a great game too.
      ```
