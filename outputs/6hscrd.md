  Hm, do you mean what books teach skills we think are more important here?

  Magic and science are obvious ones. Magic made out of simple rules and systems is pretty common here, but it's not necessary for a good story.

  Magical magic: John Bellairs - The Face In The Frost, Ursula LeGuin - A Wizard Of Earthsea.  
  Systemic magic: Brandon Sanderson - Warbreaker, Ted Chiang - 72 Letters.  

  Gratuitous science: Greg Egan.  
  Science-based fiction: Arthur C Clarke - The Fountains of Paradise, Andy Weir - The Martian.
