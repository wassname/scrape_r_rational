  I was a bit surprised they didn't decide to switch periodically to share the load and for fairness but I suppose that would be hard to manage and increase the risk of discovery, that said why the secrecy? It has implications and while they solved the immediate problem their plan didn't seem to allow for follow ups enough. I guess that could happen later on but it doesn't seem like they were planning to investigate properly, just find the easiest way to maintain the status quo.
