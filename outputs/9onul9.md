  Note: I had to learn about skolemization at the time and it was boring af so admittedly making it a weapon of the villain is kind of biased. I had also been putting off reading on (spoiler)the chapter's villain(/spoiler) since everyone was talking about them so I did it for this chapter. It's a nice contrast to the more "pure evil" villain from before.
