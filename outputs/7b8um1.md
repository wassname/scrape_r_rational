  I think this conversation is missing the "for the sheer joy of it" aspect of the realism pursuit. No, it's not *usually* important to the story to know how a dragon actually flies, but it can be *fun*, in and of itself, to come up with a just-so story for how it works, or to peel back a layer and see that there's something underneath.

  I would posit that for many of the people who engage in a deep dive on realism or consistency, it's more because they take joy from that than any other reason. It's kind of sad that "fuck you, it's fun" doesn't come up as an answer more often.

    Isn't it kind of sad to imagine a person who could witness something amazing, paradigm-breaking, and yet who would not have the slightest interest in putting it under a microscope to find out what makes it tick?

      I completely agree with you but those same people would find it sad to imagine a person who can't simply bask in the wonder of an awesome inspiring event and taking it all in and needs to dissect it to tedium instead such that the mystery and wonder is lost.

        But that's the thing. Appreciating something amazing doesn't preclude wanting to dissect it and figure out how it works. I marvel at skyscrapers every other time I see a building taller then the clouds. I took an architecture course as a part of materials science classes, and I have a rough understanding of how skyscrapers stay up, how they tolerate extreme winds and temperature changes, and a bunch of other cool minutia.

        It doesn't at all detract from that sense of wonder at the idea of "holy shit, we built a building that literally ends above the clouds. And then we did it over, and over, and over, and over again". If anything, it increases the wonder and appreciation I feel for it.

          I completely agree with you. Just playing devil's advocate

  I feel this has a lot to do with games in general, or at least has a direct application there.  
  There's this element of fair play, of setting down clear rules and the implicit agreement, a promise between players and the game master/producer.

  If a person breaks his promises, then their words aren't worth much. If a GM breaks the game's rules, then there's not much value in beating their game, as it's pretty much arbitrary- you only beat it because the GM *allowed* you to.

  Consistency in a setting basically means it follows logic. If GM tells the truth, then things he say shouldn't clash. Let's show an example:

  * Dwarfs can't use magic, at all.
  * There are no known ways of replicating magic's effects.
  * Author is (in this case) telling the complete truth.

  So those things known to the players, they go to a dwarven stronghold, ready for a heavy conventional fight. What do they find there? *A dwarven archmage*, flinging fireballs and lightning on the completely unprepared party.  
  Let's assume this kind of scenario repeats several times- players just learned that their knowledge, 
  logical thinking and planning is worth diddly squat.  
  How else *can* they beat this game, assuming that you can't just beat up the GM or 'persuade' him in other ways? They have no real agency here, and their actions are meaningless.  
  That's not a game, but a nihilism manifesto.

  Readers/viewers may not directly influence the narrative, but they still care about how it unfolds.  
  Take a standard slasher as a good example- realism is assumed (it's real world, not Middle Earth), stakes are high (live or die!) and the danger is clear (Big Bad Monster!): *The girl is cornered, killer is coming closer, there's no hope...* except she's in a car. With keys in. And she can drive. She's not even that hysterical.  
  Would you feel frightened, or just jell angrily at the screen, telling her *to just drive away*?

  Watching someone else 'play' means we identify with them at some level. If they behave like you never would (not even in their position), then this connection is immediately severed (or at least weakened).


  My point is- stories and games are driven by *US*- players and viewers. When the author comes in and reminds us that he's calling all the shots, then he shatters that illusion.

    > So those things known to the players, they go to a dwarven stronghold, ready for a heavy conventional fight. What do they find there? A dwarven archmage, flinging fireballs and lightning on the completely unprepared party.

    Obvious conclusion: the archmage is using illusions to pretend to be a dwarf, but is not *actually* a dwarf.

    I mean, that's completely contrary to your point, but it's not *quite* impossible until "magical illusions can't represent dwarfs" or something.

    One of the posts in that thread has a PDF of an ebook titled "Farms, Forge, and Steam" about the development of technology, and what it means for fantasy world building that's a pretty interesting read.

        I honestly had no idea that it was available for sale. You're not supposed to post commercially available works using /tg/'s PDF function; the rule there is that if you're posting them, you're supposed to upload them to a filesharing services somewhere else and then post the link. Somebody was naughty.

  Internal consistency is important, but don't be fooled by the post about /tg/ only caring about consistency. There is definitely a large portion of that board's users that hold realism over verisimilitude. They're more interested in historical precedent than in entertaining any kind of fantastical idea, even when the setting is fantasy.

  I remember a specific thread I was linked to where someone asked what a forest kingdom's agriculture would look like, and most of the responses were that they'd just burn down the forest to make room for farms and it wouldn't stay a forest kingdom for very long.

  The reality is that just as with any other form of fiction, the important thing is the suspension of disbelief of the person enjoying it and most people can believe "Dragons have wings so they can fly" without a physics explanation behind it that would likely necessitate magic. There's really nothing positive about training yourself to pedantically assume it's not realistic and ruin it for yourself.
