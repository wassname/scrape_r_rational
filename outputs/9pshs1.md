  Glad to see this is back. I binged the first sixty chapters and was left wanting more.

  I like the clearly visible skill differences and attitudes of the experienced people versus the newbies. And it looks like Theo has not been going into the dungeon after all.

    Yeah, fifty chapters ago, I made a joke to someone I know that the dark secret is that Theo just plays rugby, and there's nothing suspicious going on.  Ever since then, I've been waiting to deploy that in the story.
