  First Rule of NaNoWriMo: When your characters are too bogged down in boring conversation and you have no idea where the plot should go from here, have ninjas leap out of the closet and attack.

  And I have personal experience with autistic kids, if you want to PM me.

    I know exactly where the plot should go from here, fear not. Whether it's a good idea is another question altogether.

    As for ninja leaping out of the closet, you have to give these things time. There's only so much being confused about his sexuality Naruto can get done at the age of twelve.
    ```

  And here I was, thinking halfway through the chapter, "I wonder how they're going to handle the Chuunin Exams." In fact, I was even citing Yudkowsky's [second rule of fanfiction](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2269863/Less-Wrong) in my head, hoping that you would do entirely different tasks instead of the usual twisty test, forest of death, tournament format.

  And then you go and change up everything. Way to actually take me by surprise.

  Liked the chapter. Excited to see you writing again.

  Great to have you back; I love this story and am delighted to get more of it. Do you have any idea of an update schedule?

  As to the attack: it's a scam. I predict that there is no attack going on and this is just part of the exam. My current best guess is that the test is "will you obey orders instead of running off to do your own thing?" That seems too simple though, but it's what I've got based on current information. I'll look forward to the next chapter so I can see the answer.
  ```

  - u/Velorien:

    Already replied directly, but for those reading here:

    After too many occasions of stating an update schedule and then abjectly failing to live up to it (planning fallacy FTW), I am hesitant to do so in the future. All I can say is that for now, I have several chapters at various stages of editing and beta reading, and I intend to publish those at a weekly rate until I run out and have to slow down again.

      > nd I intend to publish those at a weekly rate until I run out and have to slow down again.

      That's excellent.  I look forward to reading them.

  Awesome, I think I'm going to reread the whole thing before I read this one, it's been a while. Good to have you back.
  Edit: pretty good, even though it was pretty much a transition chapter.

    I reread it all too, and the Most Epic Dialogue Exchange in the History of Romance (in Chapter 10) was even better than I remembered \^_^

    > Naruto considered what he'd been told. Then he considered it some more. It did not seem to fit anything in his understanding of how human behaviour worked.

    > "So let me get this straight," he said, slowly and carefully. "You started thinking bad things about me. Then you realised that your reasons for doing so weren't good enough. So you conducted independent research to fix errors in your thinking, and decided to give me the benefit of the doubt until you could ask me in person."

    > Hinata nodded tentatively, not sure where this was going.

    > "Hinata, will you have dinner with me tomorrow night?" The words left Naruto's mouth before he knew it.

    > "Just so we don't have any more misunderstandings... this is that dinner you promised me for being a good friend during your time in hospital?" Hinata asked cautiously.

    > Naruto shook his head. "This is me asking you out on a date after hearing the most amazing thing I've ever heard a girl say in my life."

      I know, right? I don't think I've ever seen that happen before. Even in HPMOR, Harry "falls" for Hermione because of her morality more than her rationality.

  I'm so glad this isn't dead.

  ```
  I just now realized that the nine-brained demon fox is called Kyubey instead of Kyuubi.

    Yes but, wouldn't they notice? I mean, the greaseball comes from a clan of genjutsu users, and it's not like the other two are stupid either. What would a land of smart and somewhat rational superpowered professional killers choose as a test? 

    Also, by laws of fiction, it could even be a legit attack, but my bet is on the kobayashi Maru outcome too.
    ```

    - u/Cyber_Cheese:
      ```
      Given that the rest of it seems to be progressing along the lines of the anime, the genjutsu test is more likely than skipping to the attack on the leaf

    That's just the author's avatar.

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    That's because it's the author's profile picture on fanfiction.net and there's no picture specifically for the story itself.
    ```

    - u/Velorien:
      ```
      Yeah. You do *not* want me to try to draw a cover image, for roughly the same reason you do not want to have liquid oxygen poured into your eye sockets.

      Maybe one day if my work is popular enough I could imitate HPMOR in yet another way, and call a fan art contest. Probably no cameos, though, unless there's a lot of people with Asian or plausibly Asian names. I have a feeling that having a ninja team composed of, say, Kagami Ametatsu, Fūma Ginpachi and Lord Sparklehooves would not go down well with the general readership.
      ```

      - u/NotAHeroYet:
        ```
        Is Kagami Ametatsu insufficiently setting appropriate?
        ```

- u/biomatter:
  ```
  It's awesome to see you still working on this /u/Velorien! I was actually just telling someone IRL that they should read this despite its unfinished status. I had to read the previous chapter to get my bearings, but it's still fantastic writing! Good luck1

  WOOOOOOOOO! I made a Fanfiction.net account because of you, just so I could register for updates on this story. I was so happy to see an update after this much time!

  Please keep going!

  Mmmm, this excites me... Anyway, my little brother has Asperger's. Let me know if that's far enough on the spectrum for what you need, I'd be happy to chat with you.
