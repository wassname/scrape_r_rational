  Only a few chapters released so far but the author seems to be releasing rapidly. AU but not drastic changes: it seems like the order of several familiar events has been juggled (e.g. Cadence and Shining Armour are married *before* Luna's return) but other than these timeline changes the world feels pretty familiar. Context is provided well with a brief selection of scenes from Twilight's early years. Several interesting new characters. Pretty well written so far, I look forward to more chapters.

  Edit: Update after more chapters. Still fantastic! Thouroughly enjoying this. Somehow still *feels* like MLP despite the tone being changed a lot, and some characters a fair bit too. If it stays this good it might take the top spot for my favourite fimfiction from "Days of Wasp and Spider."

    So... judging by the title... did someone basically read *Luminosity* and decide to write "rational ponies"?

  I'm going to have to actually start watching this show if people keep outputting such good fanfiction of it.

    \>actually watching the show

    The problem with MLP is that 50% of the episodes are just kinda shovelware crap for kids, and 50% are wonderful adorable fun-fun time for all good and sane people, and *nobody agrees on where to draw the line.*

      Ya your more likely to find a logical mechanism behind the pinkie sense then you are to get any two bronies to agree on which episodes are worth watching.

        ```
        Pinkie Sense makes perfect sense.  She's an eldritch abomination who can manipulate and sense probability at her whims; deal with it.

  Some excellent side chapters.
