  There's plenty of ratfic and semi-ratfic with someone time-looping and purposefully convincing others of this fact. But the only instance of an outsider figuring that out on their own that I have witnessed is a single ancient and alien spirit doing so.

  Mostly I just posted this here because I thought the whole video could lead to several interesting discussion though.

    Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Endless Eight.

    Eight episodes of the same shit happening, and the main character *eventually* realizing that he's a bystander in a timeloop. Although to be fair, he does have the advantage of being able to feel that *something* off is going on.

    Edit: Also... Melancholy isn't exactly rational, although I think I can fairly say that the main character is at least *sensible,* even if he's probably not explicitly *rational.*

      Endless eight, I should think, is rather specifically non-rational. Whereas the series in general is indeed sensible, EE appears to be an exercise in doing the least useful things possible.

      In all loops, characters have a good idea of what would end the cycle, but not how to achieve it. They also have access to an individual with persistent memory across resets, perfect recall in general, the ability to edit reality as code, and no particular inhibition to use these powers when specifically requested. Yet, no serious attempt whatsoever is made to utilise any of these resources, for the duration of the arc.

  If you enjoyed this you may also want to watch [The White Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjtQSMe0VeI) by the same people.

    Watched it and it is by far the funniest things I've seen in a while. 

    Thank you for that.

  What ratfic, semi-ratfic, or even non-ratfic is out there with timeloops? I know of Mother of Learning, and really enjoy that series. Are there others?

    There are quite a few, if you're willing to brave TVTropes.

    Time Braid. Naruto fanfiction which is very good.

      I appreciate the recommendation, but had a quick question for you.

      I haven't ever read a Naruto story. I generally have very western themed preferences, the translated works I have read are generally too large of a cultural gap for me to bridge. Do you think the story would be hard to recommend to someone like me?
      ```

      - u/ArisKatsaris:
        ```
        I read Time Braid without ever having seen Naruto either, and I could generally follow Time Braid well enough. Googled some images of the named characters so that I would have proper images of them in my head.
        ```
