  Enjoyable chapter although, correct me if I'm wrong, this seems a little shorter than usual. Or did I just read through it quickly?

  I'm loving your take on Orochimaru. He's very compelling, and a lot more interesting than a lot of the standard Orochimaru's used in fanfiction. The fact that Orochimaru is the head of an entire country is never properly addressed, in my opinion. Anyone with the intelligence and power to do that has to have some depth. Overall, great story so far. I like.

    No, this is short.  It's 3333 words[1]; the first few chapters were 8-9k, the middle ones were about 5k, and these last three have been around 3500.  As a very rough rule of thumb, there's about 300 words on an average paperback-book page, so you can get a sense of what the counts mean.

    It's been getting shorter because I've been focusing more on for-sale stuff, but I'd like to try to get back to longer chapters again.  We'll see.


    [1]  I was going to just say '3300' but the coincidence amused me.

      Ah, I see. Cool then. Also I have to say, I thought it was hilarious how there was that little bait-and-switch type moment with Hinata, when she walks in and starts undressing with Shino in the bathroom. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who was very confused by this supposed OOC-ness, and then you brought it back around when it was pointed out and we all realize that, rationally, in a house full of people that see through walls as a matter of habit, nudity is immaterial in the Hyuuga household. I chuckled.

  And today class, we see an example of a second-level deception being perpetrated on a first-level player. 

  Notice how honesty is mixed with deception in an attempt to attack the target's deeply held insecurities as a method to bypass the training and pre-existing personal traits that would otherwise make him clam up and ignore anything the deceiver says. By using this method, the target listens and understands the argument - if even only to try to prove it wrong to themselves.

  By phrasing it as a hypothetical and again hitting the goal state or utility function of the target - in this case, a need to become stronger, fast - the deceiver attempts to subtly influence the target's decision without actually asking in a manner that could easily be rebuffed. 

  Notice also the constant shift between statements intended to make the target angry, and apologetic in order to confuse the target, who is unsure of what they are feeling. The claim of psychopathy as if a disability may even instill feelings of guilt in the target. "This poor man can't help himself but to be offensive, he doesn't know any better. Why then are you so angry?"

  And in the end, the short term goal is for more information about the target. With that, the deceiver can tailor his future tactics even better.

  All in all, a master at work in deception and interrogation. Write this down. It will be on the test.

    Ouch.  I appear to have sprained my arm in the process of patting myself on the back.

      No comment on whether Naruto will re-examine his beliefs, but I will say that the mind-bending thing won't happen. It's a cool idea and it would fit the setting very well, but I did that in 2YE and I'm trying to break new ground.

  This post brought to you late in the day due to akrasia resulting from being not-quite-completely over 15 hours of jetlag.  It was a fun one to write, though.

  And once more we see how Orochimaru tries to sway people to his side. Interesting to see this Naruto was raised by foster family - no living by himself at four here! I'm also wondering what's up with the Kyuubi, trying to grab Naruto's chakra and all - honestly not something I would have expected it to do. Maybe it's badly injured from the attack Naruto used on the Sound ninja, considering it's basically a living mass of Chakra?


  Nice to see consistency with how you've portrayed the Hyuuga, what with Hinata not possessing any body shame and just casually disrobing while Shino was in the room. She didn't click there was a problem till Anko mentioned it either, and then seemed embarrassed moreso for the fact she must've been making the situation very awkward for her team-mate than anything else.

    I think they came to the wrong conclusion. He was on surgery. Medicnins should have seen what was happening. They have huge chakrabattery they want to fill up. They got themselves a living chakrabattery...

    Yeaaaa it's totally the fox draining him!

      I'll admit that also occurred to me, especially as we know from canon Orochimaru is capable of disrupting the seal at least a little bit. It could be either path, however, and we won't know till at least the next chapter.

    > Interesting to see this Naruto was raised by foster family - no living by himself at four here! 

    He lived on his own after a while -- I think I put it at either 6 or 8, I would need to check my timeline. I don't know what's up with Kishi, but kids just cannot do the things that he claims. Child soldiers at 12 after four years of study? Absolutely, right there with you. ANBU captain at 6? No way. Live alone at 4 and don't die? Hell no. 

    And yes, that was exactly Hinata's reaction. She has no body modesty at all, she was just upset on Shino's behalf.

      Maybe they put a _lot_ of kids live alone at 4, and Naruto was just one of the rare ones that survived? :p

        For whatever reason, I find that thought even more horrifying than the child assassin idea...and yet, it doesn't seem unreasonable for the setting. Brrrr.

      Wait.

      Canon!Itachi was the captain of the ANBU at *six*?

      What the fuck, Kishimoto?

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Yep. I don't even begin to understand why that was his choice. It's just made of bogons, right on the face of it. 16 would have been believable, so why go 6?

          Because a central conceit of the shonen genre is that there is no upper limit to the curve of human ability - if you train long and hard enough (and have enough passion), you can literally headbutt mountains in half without superpowers.

          Itachi is one of the purest examples, but the whole setting is full of people so far off the curve that they can casually slaughter armies.  To achieve S-rank means you have transcended the limits of humanity, and can exempt yourself from any force - physics to geopolitics - with a simple act of will.

          Nietzsche would be proud.

  I find myself liking Rochi far too much. Someone please help?

  I love how you get the feel of each character from canon correct while still making them unique and rational in their own ways. Especially the way they have to deal with their own deep-seated biases

    He's a creative genius rational psychopath. Imagine him as The Simurgh and act accordingly.
