## [RT][WIP] MALEFICENCE

### Post:

This is a story I started after reading HPMOR and RAZ(Haven't finished either. RAZ cause it's like a textbook, and HPMOR, because I didn't think I wanted to reach the ending. I may recontinue HPMOR one day (I read RAZ almost daily). 

&nbsp; 



I'm posting the story on royalroadl.com

&nbsp; 


The main protagonists and antagonists are rationalists, but it's a multiple POV story, and not all information may be available to the reader, so I'm not sure it will count as rationalist fiction.  

&nbsp; 

I'll post the synopsis here:

&nbsp; 


*SYNOPSIS:*


&nbsp; 
 

Lancelot Amon, a 26 year old Nigerian. In addition to possible racism, he has to deal with legalised discrimination based on ability; he was a mundane. In a world where a third of the humans had some form of esper ability or the other, he was completely powerless. Mundanes were second class citizens. But Lance wasn't satisfied with his standing. He was set on acquiring the world and nothing less. Lance was willing to do anything to actualise his ambition ... anything at all.

&nbsp; 
 

With nothing but his wits and Rationality to aid him, he'll challenge this unforgiving world.


 

 &nbsp; 


*Disclaimer:*

 
&nbsp; 
 

R-18: Contains profanity, descriptive sex, (hopefully) traumatising content, and gore. 

  
&nbsp; 
 

This is written as wish-fulfilment. Unfortunately, it's not your fantasies that I'm sating, but mine. The MC would be an Author self insert, and would reflect certain ideals about the author and his philosophy. There may even be propaganda here. The MC is super-edgy and a major asshole. He's a very unlikeable character.


&nbsp; 

The story is both sci-fi and fantasy.

  Well, I appreciate that you're honest about the story being self-insert wish-fulfillment, but what's the point of posting it publicly if you know it's not intended to appeal to anyone but you?

    Well my wish fulfilment isn't all that terrible? 

    I actually made it a real story. 

    By wish fulfilment, MC is a character I want to be. That doesn't default into a terrible story. 


    Just because it's wish fulfilment doesn't mean I'm writing crap; it's still a rational story. 

    Give it a try?

      I'll take a look at it after work. Are you open to constructive criticism?

        Very open, actively encourage it even. I'm fully aware, that I'm a noob author.

          OK, I read the prologue and the first chapter. Gonna stop there for now and give you my criticisms so far. I put it in a [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/z4DG5eRp) because it's long. I apologize for how harsh it is; I chose to be as blunt as possible because you don't strike me as the type to prefer sugarcoating. The overall takeaway is, "Way less telling, way more showing."

          I recommend reading Steven King’s “On Writing – A Memoir of the Craft.” It describes a lot of the common beginner-writing pitfalls you’re falling into, and how to avoid them. It’s not the be-all end-all of how to write well, but it’s a succinct and comprehensible starting point, perfect for a beginner. 

          If there are specific criticisms you agree with, but aren't sure how to incorporate into your story (e.g. "how could I organically introduce this particular detail?"), I'm happy to offer suggestions for you to build off of.

          Edit: Just read the author's note for Chapter 2. "I think I'll do a Weiwei chapter when next I'm horny, or maybe I should try Liz?" [*Shudder.*] Dude, please don't do this. This takes the story from your metaphorical to your literal masturbation material. 

          If you want to write a porn, write a porn and post it on a literotica site. If you want to write a *story,* you need to plan out and write an actual story which may contain sexual elements when they serve the plot, not just spontaneously write in sex scenes when you happen to be horny--not to mention making your audience deeply uncomfortable by announcing the fact. Nobody who's trying to read a story about a complex struggle against a powerful leader for rulership of the world wants to picture the author typing it with one hand.

            I'll take all of your criticisms. 

            As for the sex scene, it wasn't hamfisted into the story. The story isn't a literotica, but will contain erotica. 

            The story used sex as characterisation for the main antagonist. 


            He's a hedonist and someone who likes to dominate. When I pictured his intro, I imagined him surrounded by a bevy of beautiful women. 


            When I actually wrote it, I took that out, and sought to introduce an actual plot relevant character; as opposed to sex that may not contribute much to the story. 


            Chapter 2 is a real chapter, nothing plot irrelevant there. I'm not writing porn, just writing that includes porn. If I ever write sex scenes, they would be part of the story; why I said I'll write an X character chapter when that comes up. 


            I'll remove the Author's note if you felt it really disturbing. I thought it would be funny. I did put utmost seriousness into writing that chapter. I never wrote it as masturbatory material (it may or may not have been utilised for that after the fact, but it wasn't the intention when writing it).

            I'll give you full replies on your criticisms, but I am lost on how to edit the prologue though. 


            I'm stopped writing, so that I can plan out the general lay out of the story. I won't plan out the ending for now, so that I don't force a particular conclusion. My protagonist may not win, and I'm not writing him as someone who will. This isn't shounen.

              Taking out the author's notes about it being fap material will help a lot, yeah. If the sex stuff really does always serve the story, and you don't give in to the temptation to make it gratuitous, it should be all right.

              Having said that, the first couple of paragraphs in this chapter about Weiwei...I don't know if you're going to subvert this later or what, but it comes across as exotifying and dehumanizing in a way that's uncomfortable to read. There's a focus on reminding us that Weiwei is Chinese, relating her Chinese origins to her sexual prowess, etc...it might not be intended this way, but it comes across to me as a fetishization of her ancestry. Consider whether you would have put this much focus on race in sex scenes depicting women of other races. I'm not saying you should change her race or anything, just suggesting you be mindful of how you depict her.

              The sex itself goes into a level of detail that I do think qualifies as gratuitous if this story isn't meant to be literotica. I'd suggest paring it down; it should be possible to convey that the antagonist is a hedonist dom with substantially more discretion.

              Related: Since you're using the sex as a vehicle to show that Arthur is a hedonist, it's not necessary to have him then explain that he is one in his internal monologue. 

              As a style note, this is I think the third first-person POV character so far? I would suggest either writing all characters in the third person, or writing Lancelot in the first person and everyone else in the third person. Otherwise it is confusing for the reader. Many stories that are told from multiple perspectives use the second convention, with the central protagonist being the only "I."

              Pausing in your writing to outline the story is a great choice. The end product will be much better for it. I do think you should decide on an ending, even if it's one where the protagonist loses. You will be able to arc toward that ending in a more natural way if you know what it is.

  Finished Chapter 2. Some thoughts:

  As always, less telling. We don't need Arthur to explain to us that his fetish for dominating competent women reflects his obsession with power. Spelling out things like that just makes the readers feel like you think they're too stupid to pick up on it themselves. 

  The paragraph about how many different places Arthur is wearing the words "Nihil Superbum" comes off as silly. You could maybe have him wear it one place and, instead of him announcing to the reader "this is my motto and this is what it means and I'm wearing it," maybe you could have a different POV character notice him wearing it and leave it to the reader to grasp its significance.

  "Bodacious" is a very informal, outdated slang term for something attractive/admirable. It does technically mean what you used it for, but it's jarringly inconsistent with how Arthur normally speaks. From the context, it seemed like your intention was to use a sophisticated word, so I wouldn't have Arthur use "bodacious" unless you want him to sound like Bill and Ted.

  It's not worth spending time showing that Weiwei is trying to manipulate Arthur to her own ends unless something is eventually going to come of that. She doesn't have to succeed, but by making a point of her ulterior motives, you're basically promising the audience that she's going to make her play eventually and that this will have some kind of impact on the story. What do you have planned for her endgame? 

  Liz announces on upon her entrance that they'll be speaking telepathically while feigning mundane conversation out loud (I assume for Weiwei's benefit). But there's nothing to indicate that this mundane conversation actually takes place, which is confusing and seems inconsistent. I believe this kind of exchange is usually handled by putting the "fake" and "real" conversations in the same lines, like so:

  "Mundane thing," she said. [Real conversation.]

  "Mundane reply." [Real reply.]

  Liz, same deal as always about less telling--we don't need her to make a point of explaining to Arthur that she likes dominating competent men. He clearly already knows this, so it's too obvious that she's saying this for the reader's benefit, which breaks immersion.

  I'm seeing a pattern where you repeatedly break up the flow of dialogue with the protagonist's internal musings. This makes it more difficult for the reader to keep track of the conversation. I realize that part of rational fiction is showing the character's thought process, but it should be organized in such a way that the dialogue isn't interrupted so much.

  Arthur "using Liz as a piece" doesn't seem consistent with how you've said you intend to portray her as being above the game board. Unless she is just leading him to believe that she's a gamepiece? I will see if Chapter 3 sheds new light on this.

  It's unclear to me whether Arthur expects Liz to literally kill Alvin or whether he's making a dark joke. This is pretty important to be clear about. 

  If you want the strategy MMO to be an important aspect of Arthur and Lance's competitive dynamic, I don't recommend just skipping past their games the way you do in Chapter 2. It would be more interesting to see *how* Lance challenged him and how he defeated that challenge.

  I strongly recommend that you do not have Arthur's hair and eyes change color when he's using his Brittania powers. It makes him seem like every teenager's first cringy RP character. The reader won't take him as seriously if you keep this detail.

  In the conversation Arthur has after playing the strategy game, it's not clear who is speaking each line of dialogue. In fact, it took me several reads to figure out that the other party in the conversation is Liz. Given that they seemed to have reached an agreement already, that Arthur wants to give the game his undivided attention, and that said game takes *eight hours* to complete, the reader has little reason to assume he's still talking to Liz or even that she's still in the room. Has she just been standing there for eight hours?

  Arthur describing Lance as "strong" seems weird to me. It seems like you're using "strong" to convey competence in general, but that way of using the word seems unnatural. It would be better to use a more precise descriptor. 

  Why is the "highest caution" taken at the second threat level? What can the first level even be, in that case?

  Having Arthur delegate his most competent and trusted subordinates to Lance-related tasks is a great way to organically show that he takes Lance seriously as an opponent...as long as you *don't* have Arthur announce "THIS SHOWS THAT I TAKE LANCE SERIOUSLY AS AN OPPONENT."

  Arthur's description of how intricate and layered Lance's plans are would be more compelling if he used an actual example of how Lance has outmaneuvered him with such a plan. Right now the way he talks about it is too vague to hold the reader's interest. Even better would be having this happen in the actual story instead of Arthur just talking about it.

  The months-long time skips are very abrupt. Be mindful of your pacing. (Or is Arthur just describing what he's done in the months prior to the sex scene with Weiwei? It's not clear.)

  I was going to read chapter 3 and include my comments on it in this post, but the post is already too long. I'll make a separate post for chapter 3 comments.
