  I consider the *John Dies at the End* book series to be a modern day version of HP Lovecraft. The third book in the series came out yesterday which is why I'm posting this now. Here's the summary of the first book:

  > STOP.

  > You should not have touched this book with your bare hands.

  > NO, don't put it down. It's too late.

  > They're watching you.

  > My name is David Wong. My best friend is John. Those names are fake. You might want to change yours.

  > You may not want to know about the things you'll read on these pages, about the sauce, about Korrok, about the invasion, and the future. But it's too late. You touched the book. You're in the game. You're under the eye.

  > The only defense is knowledge. You need to read this book, to the end. Even the part with the bratwurst. Why? You just have to trust me.

  > The important thing is this:

  > The drug is called Soy Sauce and it gives users a window into another dimension.

  > John and I never had the chance to say no.

  > You still do.

  > Unfortunately for us, if you make the right choice, we'll have a much harder time explaining how to fight off the otherworldly invasion currently threatening to enslave humanity.

  > I'm sorry to have involved you in this, I really am. But as you read about these terrible events and the very dark epoch the world is about to enter as a result, it is crucial you keep one thing in mind:

  > None of this is was my fault.

  It's not what I would call rationalist, but it's one of the rare books that actually manages to convey a sense of what I call *cosmic horror* to its readers (which was not something I felt when reading HP Lovecraft's stories).

  There's a good amount of humor through out the books, but in some odd way the humor actually heightens the horror due to its contrast. It's similar to how [gallows humor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallows_humor#Examples) becomes incredibly funny when you are facing the hangman's noose.

    "Modern HP Lovecraft" is probably the best description of this series I've heard so far.

    I remember reading the first one years and years ago... Maybe I should pick it up.

  Thanks for posting this, I had no idea the third book came out. I remember reading the original when it was serialized on pointlesswasteoftime.com, way back in 2001. I think the first book suffers a bit from the serial format in a few places, but it's overall one that I really enjoyed, and while it may not quite be rational by the criteria as laid out by the sidebar, it's definitely fits my "thinky fiction" criteria, because it's got a lot of thought put into it.

  >4. If an Angel Appears and Speaks to You

  >Here, the risks are different—if a messenger from the Almighty actually bothers to contact you, it’s probably not the best idea to just ignore it. So, obviously, the first step is to make sure it’s an actual entity and not a dream you’re having, which is surprisingly simple: just ask the angel a question that you yourself don’t know the answer to but that you can verify later (like, “What’s the square root of 123,456,789?” or “What will be the final score of every football game this Sunday?”). If their information is good, well, then you know you weren’t dreaming and whatever prophecies or advice they gave you could indeed be valid. Of course they, too, could be imposters, so if they ask you to do something morally questionable—like stab your own child or something—you’ll need to use your own judgment. Let’s face it: if there is a god and he’s the type to think it’s unreasonable to refuse such a request, we’re all screwed anyway.

  Shouldn’t [*the Laundry Files*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/50764-laundry-files) be a closer comparison to HP Lovecraft? I liked the JDatE books too, but they’re too... goofy for that comparison.

  Regarding the David Wong series, thanks for the heads up on the third book. I remember liking both of the first two, although the second fine did feel somewhat lacklustre compared to the original.

  p.s. For anyone who hasn’t watched the movie that’s based on the first book, it’s a pretty decent watch — with suiting actors for the roles, etc.

  What kills the book for me is that David Wong is an absolute asshole. He's just a cunt of a human being so it's hard to appreciate anything he does.

    ```
    In what way is he an asshole? I'm not familiar with him outside of his work.

      He's an absolute dick in the Cracked forums. He pretends to be a feminist but then has said and defended some really chauvinist remarks. One of the writers on Cracked went off on some girl he thought was ugly and called her unfuckable garbage, David Wong defended him in the forums and banned anybody who called him out on it. 

      He's known on reddit to be a douchebag https://imgur.com/a/vCsaj#wnGu0pC

      He got banned on reddit awhile ago for brigading http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/10/10/cracked-com-editor-temporarily-banned-from-reddit/

      He presents himself as this holy moral bastion of progressive goodness, but he's a fucking hypocrite and a prick. He's turned Cracked into a SJW mess, censoring any and everything in the comment section and then letting his writers say some of the most sexist things I've seen on a mainstream site. There's a reason he deleted his reddit username, he kept getting called out for being a douchebag. Fuck David Wong. 

      Mostly I hate him because of the cracked forums. Maybe he's not a douchebag anymore, but I doubt it.

        Oh, jeez. The "unfuckable garbage" story is pretty bad--I don't know the context but it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where defending that comment would be justified. I'm a feminist myself, and it always bothers me when men vocally claim to be feminist but then use that as a shield for outright misogynistic behavior and refuse to listen to anyone who tells them they're doing it wrong. A couple of webcomic artists come immediately to mind. 

        I didn't get a misogynistic vibe from the books--well, at least not from the latest one, it's been a while since I read the previous two so I could be forgetting something. Maybe he's grown? Or maybe the process of editing an entire book gives him enough time to remove horrible shit from it that he'd think nothing of saying on the fly, I don't know.

  Oh man, I love this book. Thrilled to hear the third one is out, time to buy that immediately.

  I thought [MASSIVE FUCKING SPOILERS](#s " *That* revelation was one of the best "oh shit" moments I've experienced in a book. You know the one I'm talking about. I'm not even going to say it in a spoiler just in case someone who hasn't read it mouses over.")

  Also, another good book choice for people who like the "modern cosmic horror" vibe is [The Unnoticeables](https://www.amazon.com/Unnoticeables-Novel-Vicious-Circuit/dp/1491530871). Come to think of it, I think the authors of both books have written for Cracked.com. Small world.
