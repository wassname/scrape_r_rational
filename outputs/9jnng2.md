## Small Challenge: Another World

### Post:

Hi /r/rational.

This is a small journal prompt I was given for an English class. I thought it was interesting and was wondering if any of you can munchkin this situation as much as possible.

"Imagine: There is a zipper hidden in the space before you; the zipper tab is very hard to see. Once unzipped, the space in front of you opens and you are transported anywhere. Anywhere. Time here in the real world stops as you enter through the unzipped portal. The catch is, you only have 12 hours until you must return back through the zipper into real time in this world.

Where do you go?"

Stipulations: I only asked to confirm if you can bring things back through the rift, and received a yes with the confirmation that you can do anything that the prompt doesn't specify against. (So, really, mostly anything.)

Just to clarify, you're not doing my homework for me, it's too late for that and I'm pretty sure my professor would be annoyed if I went too in-depth for not being in the spirit of the creative writing assignment.

edit: another clarification: this doesn't have to be a real location. It's entirely your own construct.

  I go to the place that made the zipper and bring back a box of magic-space-time-defying zippers.

  "I want to travel to a storage facility filled with friently general artificial intelligences which agree with my CEV installed on laptops I could carry in a backpack with a couple kilos of compatible universal nanobots in jugs sitting on top of the aforementioned laptops"

  *unzip*

  *win*

  12 hours, please. I'd be done in 12 seconds.

    *The zipper falls off -- onto your hand.*

    "I want to go to the location that maximizes my cev "would be better.
    If you can trust something to make you FAI you can trust something to be FAI , and the zipper is more powerfull than nanobots.

      But wouldn't "convincing you your CEV has been attained" be way easier than actually making it happen? I'd worry that asking the zipper for that would zap me into a utopia sim. Which, you know, isn't the worst thing in the world, but I'd rather fix the real one.

      I guess this is moot if the concept of CEV contains the stipulation that the CEV itself must actually come to pass?
      ```

      - u/crivtox:
        ```
        convincing you your CEV has been attained doesn't maximice your cev .
        And  that objection  would aply to any request if it worked , aka you can't trust it to make you FAI instead of convincing you it made you FAI
        ```

      Well, it would be better for 12 hours after which you get yanked back to cold harsh reality per the prompt.

      &#x200B;

      The point of bringing the compu-god back was presumably to get around the time limit by letting it loose to build the desired utopia IRL.
      ```

  ```
  Is the twelve hours subjective time, or measured objectively?

  If the time isn't subjective, I'd travel to a place where something like the Sovereign Gate exists, and Groundhog Day the next year or so of my life until I can achieve an optimal outcome, and then live that same year again outside of the loop.

  If you can only experience 12 hours linearly...  I'd go to a place where they can replace my body with an improved model, and upload information and skills directly into my brain.
  ```
