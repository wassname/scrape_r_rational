Hopefully this clears up some mysteries--while still leaving some to ponder.  For those of you just tuning in, PB is a high fantasy novel about the challenges of life near the bottom of society in a marginally survivable world.  It seems to have about 200 regular readers.  The first chapter starts [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/) and a somewhat fuller synopsis may be found [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/).  Thanks for reading, commenting, voting, and everything else you guys do for me!
