## Looking for rational fiction without major darkness or sadness

### Post:

I don't like stories that are dark or have very sad parts, such as a character we've come to like getting killed off or experiencing major grief. What are some good rationalist stories (or movies!) that fit what I'm looking for?

      Are you trying to be funny? I honestly don't know what you're asking.

    >The Patrician took a sip of his beer. “I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I’m sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged on to a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature’s wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that’s when I first learned about evil. It is built into the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.”

  A Hero's War, and the Fall of Doc Future series

    A Hero's War is strongly seconded. I just read up to the latest chapter, and it's really well-done.

  I'll second Mother of Learning. With This Ring is pretty lighthearted, too, and has lots of optimization. Also, if you don't mind self-promotion, you might like my own books. (First one is [Forging Divinity](http://amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-War-Broken-Mirrors/dp/1505886554).) That said, all these choices are at least mostly rational, but not rationalist. Rationalist stuff is much harder to come by.

    Agree that [With This Ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/) is pretty lighthearted overall, but it might be worth mentioning that when he delves into the Hellblazer continuity (John Constantine, etc), it does feature some pretty dark stuff.

      Those parts are very short and even there it doesn’t really get dark on-screen. At least as far as I remember. [To be more clear: ](#s " No named characters died, death was mostly either in the premise (i.e. they find some bodies) or somewhere on the side (it can be assumed that nameless mooks and civilians died).")

      For the really light-hearted experience one might want to avoid the semi-canon omake episodes about what might have happened if Paul was more angry and became ruthless and egoistic.

    Can confirm, Forging Divinity is good.

  "The Martian" and *The Martian*.

  I would advice "Please don't tell my parents that I'm a supervillain" series. It's incredibly light-hearted while still being pretty smart, if not exactly rationalist. It also describes a superpowered society that successfully solved prisoner's dilemma and avoids superhero paradox, and that's great.

  I felt like Saga of Soul was happy and lighthearted. But it had worlds being taken over by demons and them building pain factories, so maybe not.

  I don't think  there's much of that in unsong so far.

  Also, I don't think two year emperor had major grief either https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/

    Unsong's great, I've been following that one since it started. I'll try the others, thanks.

      Can second 2 year emperor has being very good without being very dark. Things can get serious / heavy but it's never oppressive. And the humor is always there.
