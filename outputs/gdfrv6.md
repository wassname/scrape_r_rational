    Ouch. What a flogging. 

    I'm a huge worm fan, but could not get into Ward at all. Gave up 2-3 arcs in. I had vague intentions to read it once finished, but now...

      Try starting at arc 19 or 20. >!Victoria gets her shit together and being inside her head is not as dreadful after her time in shardspace.!<

      That review is not a fair review. It spends half its time on tangents, and half the remaining time on extraneous bs, such as worm having focused on a group of characters who survived scion and how the fact that the ward mc sometimes chooses to stick with familiar faces is somehow illogical or inherently makes the story bad. 

      90% of the "review" isn't even a review so much as filler but that's beside the point. Ward's problem is the same as Worm's problem: >!the fact that the MC has no way to affect the outcome of the ending except by being the puppet enacting Contessa's will.!<  Or in other words the existence of a character whose superpower is "always win at everything as long as you're somewhat careful."  The rest of both stories was just an in-depth case study of the internal monologues of trauma survivors and  Taylor happens to have her shit together to a greater extent theoughout Worm than Victoria does in most of Ward.  Where ward and worm differ is that Taylor loses her shit at the climax while Victoria  collects her shit at the climax.

        I don't agree with the second spoiler - determinism doesn't mean your choices don't matter, and you can apply a similar reasoning here. Her being capable and doing the correct things are why she is integrated into the winning plan.

        If you are the kind of person who thinks it doesnt matter what you do since it's predetermined you'll end up doing nothing and be useless. If you are the kind of person who still does their best and achieves things, things will be achieved.
        ```

        - u/MilesSand:
          ```
          Well not quite. The virtue that makes Taylor and Victoria into Contessa's puppets isn't a lack of laziness,  it's ease of manipulation. In fact,  part of Contessa's manipulation is to make them hesitate at certain points.

      Same here -- struggled my way through the prologue PHO (?) chapters as they were being released, but continued to be super bored as the main story continued. Was waiting until completion to see if anything improved, but the Weekly Rec Thread's review has dissuaded me.

      Are there any good fanfics of Ward out yet? I found myself liking lots of Worm fanfics more than I did the actual Worm, so maybe I can glean the canon resolution to older plot threads and character arcs through derivative works.

      Alternatively, were there any must-read standalone Ward interludes?
      ```

        ```
        [Kenzie's interlude](https://www.parahumans.net/2018/06/26/torch-interlude-7-x/) is pretty intense, and mostly self-contained.
        ```

        - u/Action_Bronzong:
          ```
          The Capricorn interludes ([9.x](https://www.parahumans.net/2018/09/13/gleaming-interlude-9-x/), [9.y](https://www.parahumans.net/2018/09/13/gleaming-interlude-9-y/), [9.z](https://www.parahumans.net/2018/10/16/gleaming-interlude-9-z/)) are some of the strongest chapters Wildbow has ever written.

          I got bored of Ward partway through, but the extremely cinematic set pieces are still just as good as ever, and a few of the best scenes almost make the whole thing retroactively worth reading.
          ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Holy crap, that's... a really strong take.

    I mean, this:

    >  People have various complaints about Worm [...]. But these problems are all small, petty, easy to work past to appreciate a well-told epic. They're nothing in comparison to the problems that define and pervade Ward. Ward's problems aren't subjective quibbles with how clearly some scene was written. They're basic errors in the writing process, [...] problems that have metastasized to the story's outline and style. The story is fundamentally and fractally half-baked.

    seems to me like the reviewer got way too attached to the original and saw something that wasn't really there?

    I'm not going to do a point-by-point counter-review, because I think these get tedious and petty fast. But I really want to comment on the general approach. Parts like these:

    >  We hear it said explicitly that the apocalypse killed something like 90% of humans and something like 99% of parahumans. But the actual story certainly doesn't act like it; *the fucking apocalypse* never stands in the way of bringing a character back from Worm.

    >  But somewhere early on, Ward got into its head that worldbuilding is masturbatory nonsense for rationalist nerds (which is a shame, because Wildbow excels at it when he's trying, which he usually is), so it dropped all of these threads; nothing was honestly examined or went anywhere. Instead, Ward concerns itself first and foremost with characterization. That's the defense that Ward's proponents generally give,

    >  An addict's house may be full of syringes, but that doesn't mean she's better at using them than a nurse. Ward spends much of its nearly two-million word (!) duration on highly introspective internal monologues and inane navel-contemplating small-talk between characters; after a point, it's just polishing something it's already completely worn away.

    > and the podcast became something very different - much less meritorious, but still very popular, effectively a glorified recap podcast endlessly pumping out content each week just describing what happened last week. And it became a literal feedback loop - Wildbow hearing a constant drone of "you're great, you're perfect"

    > because whiny fans treated tension and stakes as writing flaws and the writer was desperate to win their approval back just for a moment 

    are ridiculously angry and abrasive and uncharitable.

    **tl;dr This review has some good points, but the general outlook is a seriously unhealthy way to consume media.**

    Just try to read Ward and give up if you don't like it. It's just a fucking book.

      >tl;dr This review has some good points, but the general outlook is a seriously unhealthy way to consume media.

      Dunno, seems about what I'd expect if someone went through three and a half million words and the last two million or so turned out to be a big disappointment. Doesn't seem very reasonable to expect someone to invest so much time into something and then not get *invested* in it.

      Getting some big GoT S8 vibes from all this.

        Exactly, and that's why you read the book, but *stop when you realize you don't like it*, not keep going on because you hope it'll live up to your internal expectations.

        The reviewer is suffering from a classic case of Sunk Cost Fallacy, which is creating a huge negative bias in their review.

          > stop when you realize you don't like it

          There's something you probably don't take into account here: huge reserves of faith in the author after reading Worm. This was the sole reason why I didn't abandon Ward. And I think the linked review is pretty accurate, probably it wouldn't be as negative if the reviewer abandoned the story earlier, but it was also my impression that it was getting progressively worse towards the end.
          ```

          >stop when you realize you don't like it, not keep going on because you hope it'll live up to your internal expectations.

          Ah yeah, I did this with WtC when I realized I wasn't enjoying it anymore, and even then I was left feeling so bitter it took a lot of willpower to not start ranting online about it.

          It's hard to walk away from something that you had a lot of hopes for, specially if it's something that kind of proved itself to you or you thought had a good track record. I guess what I mean to say is that regardless of the sub we are in, we're still people, with all our flaws, and there is no button to instantly purge all biases and negative feelings and thoughts that might remain.

          That guy's disrecommendation doesn't exist in some sort of fully rational and unbiased void, and neither do all of the echo-chambery praises that started being sung in the Parahumans sub after Wildbow made his self-deprecating comment last week. Both are equally valid, and I don't think being dismissive of the points being presented because either side has strong feelings about it serves the actual discussion.

          Let's stay on topic and talk about Ward itself, and not about what an internet stranger's feelings are towards Ward's author.

          Edit: that last line might sound a bit gatekeepey, sorry, but I think counterjerks are as productive as circlejerks: they aren't.
          ```

          - u/mightykushthe1st:
            ```
            Oh I should've mentioned: I agree with the review where they said that Ward heavily prioritizes character development over plot and worldbuilding, and suffers for it as a result- that was essentially the reason I stopped reading Ward in the first place, because it just wasn't compelling enough as a story to keep me hooked. 


             I just wanted to point out that everything else, especially the post's analysis of Wildbow's intentions and his last post should be taken with a significant grain of salt.

            On an unrelated note, I'm sorry to hear you don't like WtC, I still enjoy reading it (though not quite as much as in the beginning). What were your reasons for stopping?
            ```

            - u/Anew_Returner:
              ```
              >What were your reasons for stopping?

              Spoilers for WtC: >!It's been a few months now, so I might be a bit hazy on the details but I hated how Fenn's death was handled. I'll start with that because looking back it was sort of the turning point for me, I didn't have any complaints and I really enjoyed it up to that moment (even berated myself a bit mentally for not reading WtC sooner), but there was something about that whole event that felt so jarring and wrong. Like there was a lot of build up and a lot of time that went into setting up their relationship, and then they have a little fight and literally two chapters later she dies? And it's not just that, but her death barely seems to phase the MC at all, like there is a little arc of 'getting over it' and then they move on with their quest? The same quest that started with his friend's death? The one that influenced the whole fantasy world he is living in right now? The one he keeps having constant flashbacks to because of his regret and inability to move on? I wasn't a big fan of Fenn, and I didn't care THAT much for her, but it bothered me that her death didn't seem to matter as much as it should, like the author just disregarded one of the main themes he had been pushing for most of the fic and one of the biggest flaws of his own protagonist.!<

              >!I sort of gave it a pass for that because I know WtC likes to get all meta and play around with tropes, so I stuck around to see if that would lead to some sort of subversion or anything interesting. I'm not sure when it happened, but I think it was a bit after the library arc (which imo was amazing) that I started to feel like the story wasn't hitting the same right spots that it had been hitting up to that point, it really felt like I was reading a fanfic of WtC rather than WtC itself. The pacing took a nosedive, unfunny references and memes started to crop up, the whole harem thing Fenn had pretty much undermined appeared again (which I somehow didn't enjoy in this story despite the fact harem, polyamory, and other unconventional forms of pairings are some of my biggest guilty pleasures), it also felt like a lot of characters lost depth and nuance and became cartoons of themselves. It was bizarre how the story as a whole seemed to tell you things, and then do others or have the complete opposite happen. I remember that scene where everyone gathers together and they resolve to not let themselves be manipulated by the narrative, taking the fight to the threats instead of letting them come to them, only for the MC to do anything but that so he could go to school, wtf? Then there was the cringy cannibal Shia Lebouf thing, Reimer appearing to deliver some exposition and then being written out, and then still magic.!<

              >!One thing I enjoyed a lot about early WtC is that you could see, almost feel, the MC's progression, seeing him use what he learned or just anything he could to get by was cool and interesting. I think it's before the whole still magic incident happens that all of that is thrown away. There is this weird and unexplained power gap and suddenly he can do stuff he couldn't do before for no reason, and nothing bad he does seems to have any consequence. The narration keeps telling you that sacrificing a skill for a boost means MC will have a harder time training it back later, but that never seems to be the case and it never seems to matter. Still magic being introduced and then exploited means he doesn't even have to bother with that anymore, suddenly MC is OP and any semblance of 'midgame' or coherent power progression is entirely skipped. Oh, and don't forget about the unicorn bones he kept on using to save his life which he never used to save Fenn because...?!<

              >!That was annoying, and many things I didn't mind before started to become increasingly annoying as well. I think at that point I sort of realized that there wasn't much of a 'world' planned out like I was led to believe and that every set piece and location existed as it was and there was little to no depth to it. The story tells you about a world that despite all of the chaos it has going on, it has a semblance of order that most of its inhabitants are used to by now. That's what you're told, but the truth is that things simply don't seem to exist until they're relevant, and once they're not relevant anymore they might as well stop existing. The dwarf city was a big example of that, it seemed to be such a big and important deal in earlier chapters, and then when they finally explore that part of the world it's just a cardboard cutout, and the same thing seemed to apply to everything else.!<

              >!Things happen, scenes happen, and it really does feel like there is little thought and planning to them. Which this whole thing being based around a tabletop is to be expected to a point, but even then it's jarring, and everything feels fake.!<

              >!I was bitter by the point the MC fights the infohazardous kaiju, none of the rules that had been established early seemed to matter anymore, there were no stakes because he had infinite revives thanks to the unicorn bones, and a lot of it felt like padding so we could get to the 'cool' scenes.!<

              >!I stopped reading on the chapter when Bethel and Val leave. I can handle flawed protagonists, I prefer them way more than bland or self-insert ones, but the MC's morality and the inconsistency of it started to get on my nerves early on. Him turning on his friend over what he did to the sentient house, condemning him despite the fact that Arthur pretty much stopped the world from being a giant shithole several times, was disgusting, specially after how he pretty much forced Fenn to kill a lot of people so they could get to said house in the first place. And that's without mentioning all of the other people he turned his back on and died because of him.!<

              >!I'm not one to get squeamish over violence, sex, or sexual violence, so I'm not one to get triggered over those topics (stuff like the fridge scene in Worm don't get much of a reaction out of me). But the whole rape thing in WtC and how it was handled sickened me, and to this day it's probably one of the most deplorable things I have read. Rape is a very serious thing for a lot of people, and whole it never affected me or anyone I know, to me it's still not something that should be treated lightly. The protagonist not taking consent as seriously as he should have, regretting the act, and then victimizing himself while taking a stance of moral superiority after the fact disgusted me and opened my eyes to what I was reading.!<

              >!I was sold this story as an isekai with an interesting world and magic system that was also an exploration and subversion of common narrative tropes. I went into this expecting Mother of Learning but with some strange tabletop RPG spin on it. So why am I reading about the fantasy equivalent of a false rape allegation?!<

              It wasn't what I wanted and what I enjoyed anymore, I wasn't getting 'anything' from it either, and I... I honestly didn't care about the characters anymore or what happened to them. So yeah, there is that, a very bitter feeling left. It's a real shame too because I was genuinely enjoying it, and then >!Fenn started acting OOC, died, and the fun survival adventure stopped being fun and reading became a chore that only kept making me even more annoyed and angry.!< I'm ashamed that it took me up to chapter 160 or so to realize that and finally drop it, maybe it got better, maybe it's even good and interesting now. But I don't care anymore, I moved on, I'm done with WtC.

              Sorry for the rant.

                **SPOILERS FOR WTC BELOW**

                Don't be sorry at all, I understand the feeling of a loved fic going bad. You bring up a lot of interesting points that quite frankly, I would need to do a lot of rereading to be able to fully engaged you on, so maybe I will do that. I do agree that fenns development and abrupt conclusion were surprising in an off putting way, but I went back for a quick re read and there were subtle (admittedly, maybe TOO subtle) references showing how Fenn was really tried of being treated as comic relief and not being taken seriously.

                I agree with you on bethel, I don't think she is a redeemable character (despite the fact that I am horrified at what happened to her) and I'm glad she doesn't really seem to be in the story anymore. As for Joon, the more I read about him the more I see him as not a hero or MC, but just a dude, one I might not necessarily like if I met but not necessarily one I would hate either. Just a flawed human being, who's trying and sometimes failing to be morally and logistically consistent. I think empathize with that, because i don't often like myself either.

                Last, it's kinda funny you say the world is a cardboard cutout, because I thought that was the whole point, explicitly confirmed by the One True God. That miiight just be deliberate and not a failing on the authors part.

                I'm sorry to hear that WtC disappointed you though. I hope you've found other isekai fics that you enjoy. I would recommend Patchwork Realms by eaglejarl if you want a really quirky isekai litrpg. The main character is a dog(yup, really) that lucks into an epic tier skill, and that's all I'm going to say, in case you want to read it. Good luck!

                  \>(admittedly, maybe TOO subtle)

                  This sounds super subjective I thought the signposting with things like repeated mentions of washathar and Joon aggressively shutting down uncomfortable conversations with her was a bit obnoxious in how obvious it was being and nothing that happened was the least bit shocking as a consequence. Similarly the idea that the story quickly moved past this when the consequences still loom large and she's getting explicitly bought up every other chapter alongside speculation on how to get her back is pretty crazy to me.

                    [Data kinda checks out.](https://i.imgur.com/PQ2QPSF.png) Every other chapter on average since her death - but clustered just after her death. When the plot restarts in earnest (Sound & Silence arc) there are long stretches where her name doesn't enter Joon's train of thought.

                      ```
                      Yeah that's what I remember happening. Sound and silence felt a lot like a crime thriller followed by one drawn out action scene with little introspection in general (except Joon zoning out twice in class I think). Still she's effectively replaced Arthur as the crux of the plot if my reading is right. Joon is rushing the end boss because his hung up on that dream he had as much as anything. She's kinda on par with ending the hells in importance so I really don't see her as a dropped plot thread.

                  I see a lot of things like these in WtC, and I get it and appreciate it for what it is. But there is a mark that is missed, or some balance that is not quite met. But that could be on me, perhaps I can't stomach characters that are too flawed and don't show as much progress as I believe they should. Either that or something being unique and interesting isn't enough 'payoff' by itself and I need it to reach a certain level of narrative satisfaction. Something to introspect about I guess.

                  >Last, it's kinda funny you say the world is a cardboard cutout, because I thought that was the whole point, explicitly confirmed by the One True God. That miiight just be deliberate and not a failing on the authors part.

                  Yes, I contemplated this briefly during the part where the MC wondered what would have happened if he never met Amaryllis and instead saved that other girl at the beginning, if she would have turned into Amaryllis instead. The world being tailored to him and to his present is a neat idea, one that probably went against the expectations I had at the beginning, those probably being a fairly more traditional storytelling and worldbuilding.

                  >I hope you've found other isekai fics that you enjoy

                  I started Lord of the Mysteries last week and I love it! The first eleven or so chapters can drag a bit, but once it gets going it's great. Isekai to a fantasy world full of SCP objects and other 'mysterious' beings. It's an engaging read if you can get past the rough translation.

                  >Patchwork Realms by eaglejarl

                  I'll definitely check it out. I'm still fairly new to the Isekai and litrpg genres, so I'm not that big on it, but I'll read anything so long as it is interesting or amusing :P Thanks for the recommendation!

            Also, there's the sunk time. As I said in my other comment, bailing on Ward 25% of the way through means you've read the equivalent of *War and Peace* only to decide that it was a waste of your time. That does not feel great.

      It's a book that's *two million words long*. That's a lot of time investment for something that ends up being disappointing. If, for example, you bail 25% of the way through you could have instead read *all of War and Peace*. It is not unreasonable to exercise a higher level of discretion about that kind of time investment, or to feel upset if you make it and it seems wasted.

      Don't forget stuff like:

      > Ward is the kind of story that gives a secondary character a dramatic, wonderfully-executed death at the hands of a fresh, fascinating, brilliant antagonist, but then the fans throw a collective bitchfit that pierces the heavens, because the character who died was a fan-favorite from Worm, so he brings the character back a few chapters later, literally doing what a facetious meme had suggested, reasoning that we hadn't seen the body, even though her death was from the perspective of an alien with local omniscience in charge of blowing her up. The bullshit-soap-opera-retcon-resurrected fan favorite then proceeds to kill the interesting new antagonist who had originally killed her, in order to secure cheap cathartic revenge on the fandom's behalf.

      > a protagonist whose character revolves around the time she was raped

      > "whelp, what I'm doing is like a cross between the way Hitler committed genocide and the way Hitler killed himself, hmm, oh well, still gotta do it"

      I feel like the reviewer was harmed by having read the comment section more than Wildbow ever was.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        There is this

        > This is an aside, but I blame a large part of Ward's disdain for worldbuilding (also known as "being set in a world that attempts to make sense") on Doof! Media. In the months running up to the start of Ward, a popular liveblog-type podcast called "We've Got Worm" sprung up and became extremely influential in the parts of the fandom closest to Wildbow; he even became a frequent listener and participant in the post-podcast discussions. It was well-produced and well-done all around, and in a very difficult-to-replicate way, it brought a fresh perspective and fascinating analysis to Worm. But the host responsible for much of this, Scott Daly, was very much of the mindset "well, I don't care about worldbuilding, because I'm not some fucking nerd, I'm here for all that other good stuff in writing, like character arcs". That's a valid lens for an individual reader to take in a project like that, but Wildbow wound up hearing a lot of Scott. I mean, the guys make a long professional podcast devoted entirely to relentlessly praising a particular artist; it's not a surprise that the artist would wind up hearing a lot of it. And then, when Ward started, the We've Got Worm guys moved onto Ward, and the podcast became something very different - much less meritorious, but still very popular, effectively a glorified recap podcast endlessly pumping out content each week just describing what happened last week. And it became a literal feedback loop - Wildbow hearing a constant drone of "you're great, you're perfect, I love this unconditionally, you're so good at characters, your shit is golden, but we don't care about worldbuilding, Wildbow, I love this, we don't care about worldbuilding at all, we're not fucking nerds, Wildbow, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter at all..."

          We've Got Ward has such a large mindshare and is part of so many discussions about Ward that it definitely bears mention in reviews about it.

  I quit because the world wasn't believable anymore.

  The whole "How do superheroes make money?" question was glossed over in Worm but at least somewhat explained by Crime and the quasi public nature of the protectorate.

  In Ward, a post apocalyptic society apparently still pays money for spandex clad heroes and it makes no sense.

  Additionally, the fights with powers were way too bloodless.  At the end of Worm, Manton limits are generally eliminated.  Reading the fights in Ward was like reading about two people getting into a chainsaw fight and having no blood.

  Also, no one is willing to kill.   Nursery's power is literally filling the room with Cronenberg babies and having them rape your face.  She does this to Victoria and Victoria is super blase about it.  Such a person would have a kill order on them after doing this dozens of times.

        She pulls a rape baby out of Parians face in blinding 11.7 and says this to the heart broken.

      " I could have told you that, I thought.  That was a shame.  “Nursery.  If you can hit Nursery, do it.  Just- nothing permanent.”

  Currently towards the end of arc 7. It does look to be getting better though I will agree with the general idea of it not feeling as good of a work as Worm. My two cents is that I feel like it is already too large in scope. Worm started out very locally with street gangs and expands slowly till the ending with the death of a space alien and it's done so well that it doesn't feel forced. Ward starts out focusing on too much and adding a new character every chapter, this makes it a chore to read trying to constantly remember different characters and what they can do.
  ```

- u/RedSheepCole:
  ```
  I started reading it more than a year ago.  Skipped past glow-worm after reading several pages of cryptic chatlogs.  Started the first arc, was somewhat nonplussed by civilization looking pretty hunky-dory after the massive apocalypse at the end of Worm.  Kept going to the end, learned Victoria was the hero, felt mild dismay since she struck me as a character whose dramatic potential had already been spent.  Also, fairly boring powerset.  Kept reading a couple more arcs, feeling increasing unease at the uneven narration and unclear story.  Got to the part where she's having a dissociative flashback in the middle of a fight scene and thereby making both stories extremely difficult to follow, and decided I was done.  It just wasn't fun.  YMMV.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I finished it, more as a factor of taking my mind of panic attacks than enjoyment, mostly without reading the comments.  I really see it as a continuation of the progressing problems in Worm.  As Worm went on, it seemed to get more and more bloated, particularly the fight scenes.  This was partially ameliorated by several factors:  I wasn't reading it while it was coming out; Taylor's powerset is really, really interesting; and secrets about the setting were being revealed.  The normal fightscenes were broken up by Endbringer attacks, which were unique, hugely dangerous, a change of pace, and used relatively sparingly.  The setting in general was fresh enough, dystopian superhero.

  &#x200B;

  Ward really took away a lot of those supports.  Victoria's powers aren't that interesting.  The most important secrets had been revealed.  And the setting is wildly inconsistent.  It starts with an interesting rebuilding society kind of setting, but it feels like Wildbow got bored/ didnt't like it, so it all went to shit again.  As this was going on, the fight scenes got more and more bloated.   Some of the sections, like March, the Family, and the Assault on Teacher's Compound just got boring.  There was also an expectation that you would care about all these minor characters, some of whom changed their name since the Worm days.  I also don't think most of the characters showed development.  To me, the characters feel mostly static.  

  &#x200B;

  This all adds up to incredibly inconsistent themes.  Worm has an internal and external descent into darkness driven by the main character's need for control.  Ward is clearly supposed to be about characters getting better, becoming more whole, and breaking cycles.  You don't see this in the plot, setting, or characters until there's a rush at the very end. 

  &#x200B;

  So you're left with a book where a lot of stuff happens, there are fights against people that don't matter, and the fights that do are too long.  I had little emotional connection to any of it.  Don't read it.  It's not terrible, but it's not worth it.

  (crossposting my review from the rec thread, since the other one is pretty over the top)

  Ward is very good in a lot of ways, but still flawed. The characterization in Worm was great, yet Ward's is still much better. Ward's pacing problems are even worse than in Worm, but in new, more nuanced ways that make them even more aggravating. And the focus has changed significantly, which will leave a lot of fans behind.

  If you enjoyed Worm for the clever interactions between simply drawn powers, you won't find any of that here; powers still behave in a consistent manner and interact properly, but none of them have simple explanations like "Controls bugs" or "Sensory deprivation smoke," and the details of power interactions matter a lot less when your main character has to solve most things by punching them. If you enjoyed it for epic monster fights and play by plays of combats, I can't tell you whether it's gotten any better, because I found it dull both times around (but I can at least tell you that the biggest monster to punch is smaller in Ward).

  If you enjoyed Worm for parsing Taylor's self-oblivious and extremely biased point of view, you'll probably enjoy Victoria's shaky self-awareness and half-constructed attempts to be impartial even more, but if you didn't notice that part of Worm then you're going to be missing a huge chunk of this story. And as I mentioned before, the characterization really has grown, so if that's what you're here for, you'll have a good time - Breakthrough are much more believably real, traumatized people, especially compared to the Undersiders who mostly exist as one or two character traits drawn to a maximum. I was impressed the first time around when Wildbow would spend an interlude writing a convincing POV of a dog, but now his writing has the nuance to characterize as just much difference in thought process just by using people that lie within human norms.

  The biggest problem with Ward though is the pacing. After spending several arcs slowly working through characterization and inter-character conflicts, Wildbow folded to fan pressure and started smashing people into combat trial after combat trial. After the first one, they rarely have the buildup time they need before the punching starts. And many of the combats go on until the fans get bored of the excessive slog of combat, then rather abruptly stop, only for the slow inter-character part of the work to return until some segment of the fanbase gets bored of it, and then suddenly lurching into more superpowered fistfights. I'm obviously on the side that it'd be better if it stuck to being mostly character-based, but the sudden lurching back and forth between the two modes didn't do a service to anyone.

    >powers still behave in a consistent manner and interact properly

    I'm actually going to contest this. I think one of Ward's biggest missteps is the scope creep when it comes to power boosting and power modification in general. Powers in ward do **NOT** behave consistently **AT ALL**. You can in fact expect that any power you see will work differently at some other point in the story, if not because of a Trump's involvement then because of shard mechanics.
    ```

      ```
      > You can in fact expect that any power you see will work differently at some other point in the story, if not because of a Trump's involvement then because of shard mechanics.

      Not to mention Tinkers, which seem to become straight-up Valkyrie replacements. For any given goal X, any tinker with a specialty in Y can build an Y that does X.
      ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        For someone who wrote tinkers to be pretty limited in most cases, Wildbow does seem to enjoy giving tinkers he likes a really broad ability to be Mr. Fantastic.
        ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      I was thinking of putting some sort of asterisk in for that, but that sentence was already getting pretty gnarly.

      As far as I can remember, every power behaves consistently except when acted on by a force. There's quite a lot more weird stuff going on with powers, as you point out, but it's not like classic superheroes where the amount of weight Superman can lift is several trains one day and the planet another.
      ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Worm is the same way with trump and shard mechanics, except that fewer villains let us watch the buildup and Taylor doesn't realize it's happening for most of the story.
      ```

      - u/Revlar:
        ```
        It's really not the same at all. The only serious power boosting that takes place in Worm is right near the end, with an interlude to set it up and for a power that we've never seen the base power level of, allowing the description within the story itself to be simple and easy to follow. Taylor's power changes so slightly and so simply that there's no seams to it. She gains the extra sense so gradually and her range expands so subtly, there's no comparison to the bullshit Ward pulls.

        In Ward, powers will change multiple times, sometimes radically, never in an easy to follow sense. If it wasn't past midnight I'd list all the examples I can think of. Lord of Loss? His power is ridiculous and even boosts itself in a way that's orthogonal to Lung's. It's impossible to follow what he's doing half the time. The second time he fights Victoria he's kaiju-sized, something the narration has trouble getting across. At the end of that fight we learn it's thanks to teacher giving him a secondary thinker power, which just complicates the power further because a reader would've only then managed to accept his power can be that strong and still be within Victoria's weight class , only to have that contradicted immediately after.

        I don't even want to get into the mess that are clusters in this story.
        ```

        - u/MilesSand:
          ```
          Worm powers vary with emotional state all the time.  The only reason we don't see it as much in worm is because the antagonists don't come back and because Taylor had the self-awareness of a brick wall.  But even then we see major changes in power sets, especially after the SH9 pay a visit to Brockton.

          Teacher might not have had a before and after.   Amy definitely did. So did bonesaw, contessa, and Jack to name a few examples.
          ```

          - u/Revlar:
            ```
            Worm powers vary in some small degree based on emotional state and repeated exposure to trigger-like conditions, but nowhere near to the extent that they vary in Ward due to external factors that never feel solid or predictable. There's even an entire fight resolved by the fine control a power-boosting Trump has over her power and how it allows her to render her opponent's power unpredictable and dangerous to themselves repeatedly and in novel ways.

            What you're trying to argue is that just because it's a fact of the setting that small variance like Taylor's range fluctuating can be expected, that we should've expected something like cluster-draining and Teacher all along, when the entire point of their inclusion is that small variance is not enough and external factors are involved.
            ```

- u/MereInterest:
  ```
  Are there payoffs to characters being successful in Ward?  This was my main complaint in Worm/Pact, where the outcomes of each plot arc didn't really matter.

  In some stories, there just isn't any tension because the authors are afraid to have the characters lose anything that is at stake.  You know going in that nothing bad will happen, and so the tension is lost.  Reading through Worm and Pact, it felt like the exact opposite was happening, but with the same effect.  The results of each conflict didn't matter, because something would happen to make everything worse.  Just as if everything gets fixed every time, the tension is entirely lost.
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    There is a very big and real complaint in that Ward undoes a lot of the seeming successes of the epilogue of Worm off screen prior to its start... like if you were expecting Yamada to continue being a super effective therapist and Dragon to rebuild everything with Tinker tech goodness and Tattletale to have a significant and important role in the alternate world city she had a major role in founding prepare to be disappointed.  This might be okay yet somehow the city has been built to sprawling proportions with very little power usage (we are explicitly told most powers are bad at constructive usages) in a way that maybe works as thematic commentary about societies’ goals but doesn’t work from a logistical standpoint.
    ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    Ward still has Contessa so nobody else's decisions matter until she dies of old age.  Though she may be gone now,  it's not entirely clear.
    ```

- u/BlastedEbola:
  ```
  The worldbuilding in Ward was insane in my opinion. The bizarre giant city setting wasn't even slightly believable as post golden morning. The weird amnesty everyone but there are still criminals but they don't seem to commit crimes? Amnesty even clones of slaughterhouse 9 members created to end the world, and the fucking endbringer cultists. Weirdly retcon the Fallen so they are slightly disreputable rather than endbringer cultists. Vicky tries to argue someone out of joining the Fallen but doesn't think to mention they are endbringer cultists who burn down malls for jollies.

  Then there is Vicky's character(In the first few arcs). She refuses to join some hero team because they hire racists, so she joins a team with a racist only there to use the nutters as human shields and a slaughterhouse 9 member only there to convert the autistic girl to villainy.

  Also I'm half convinced Glowworm was a producers-esque scheme to murder Ward's hype. Reading it felt like debugging code, I've never had to read something so closely to follow it. Then there was no point because all the characters it introduced were introduced normally in the actual story.

      Strong disagree.  Ward is "higher-brow" than Worm only in the senses in which being "higher-brow" is a bad thing.  Ward isn't a smarter story than Worm; it's a much dumber story that sees Worm's strengths as beneath it.  See my review in the week's recommendation thread.

    It's more focused on inflicting emotional pain on the characters than Worm is.  I don't think there's anything as physically nightmarish as Worm's fridge scene in the S9 arc, but there's still a lot of pain, injury, body horror, and violations of autonomy. Then on the emotional side, first person perspective PTSD flashbacks are just par for the course.

    Definitely not the most comfortable thing to read, and worth avoiding if the state of the world is getting to you.

    If you're looking for something lighter and haven't read Mother Of Learning yet, I'd give that a shot. It's very low-stakes yet still quite compelling.

    I've seen some complaints is this thread that seem relevant:

    * "if you like ward it won't be for the same reasons as worm" so maybe not? I started reading it, got caught up, and stopped, and there was some dark stuff, but not that much blood, but I didn't get very far in, and decided to start reading when it was over.
    * Another complain I saw was that the fights were too bloodless (unlss

    So, I'm not positive, but maybe it's not as "dark" if by dark you mean rivers of blood and such? Though I could see some potential for that, from where I got to. Remember the cults that worshipped the Endbringers? I think they show up in the story, and I don't know how that compares to s9 because I didn't get that far.

    Many people miss the part where Amy *didn't* >!transform Victoria into an abomination while trying to heal her.  According to her dialogue in Carol's interlude, Amy pretty much fully healed her but hadn't woken her up yet.  Then she got *lonely* and 'made some tweaks', resolving to fix her after.  Then, while fixing *that* she decided to take a break, and finish fixing her later.  And only after *days* with tweaks that caused Victoria to love her did Amy decide to finish the fix only to find she couldn't.!<

    - u/Seraphaestus:
      ```
      Just reread the interlude. When I read it, my understanding of what happened is that in order to keep her alive, Amy had to like fuse her into the coccoon as life support, which was what all the work was ostensibly supposed to be: unfucking the body horror that was required to keep her alive. And then along the way, she's exhausted and she starts making mistakes. She's indestribably exhausted and she stops being able to see Victoria as Victoria, like semantic satiation, and her caricaturistic on-a-pedestal perception of her bleeds into it too. And that's what resulted in the abomination-ing.

      I don't really know what implication is supposed to be there when she mentions taking a break. I can't draw a line from it alone to sexual assault, but I can't draw a line from it to *anything*, it just leaves me confused.

      When she talks about being lonely, I gather that she's trying to excuse how her personal desire bled into the process and resulted in Victoria becoming a caricature of how Amy sees her.

      And I'm pretty sure you're wrong when you say "tweaks which caused Victoria to love her"; that didn't happen during this event, but earlier on as a seperate thing.

      But that's just a reading from the interlude alone, and I'm not sure about subtext to that that I missed or what was explained or retconned in Ward. And regardless, I'm more interested in just looking at Worm, not considering what Ward may have added or changed.

        “I wanted to see her smile again.  To have someone hug me before I left forever.  So you wouldn’t have to worry about me anymore.  I- I told myself I’d leave after.

I changed more things.  More stuff I had to fix.  And days passed.  I-“

        >She got so tired and scared and *lonely* that she took another break.  Possibly justifiable if she was really tired, but by this point her other actions were truely heinous.  It wasn't just another break, though, because she 'Changed more things.  More stuff I had to fix' during that break.  And apparently, this period where she took a break and 'changed things' lasted days.  That is tremendously fucked up.

        Edit: also, Amy changed Victoria's sexuality earlier on, which caused her to become enraged.  When we see her in the asylum, though, she is uncontrollably infatuated with Amy.  That happened during the Ensquidening.

          Thanks for sharing your thoughts. The "break" parts still don't really make sense to me. I think part of it is maybe that this is supposed to be her making excuses for herself, and she wouldn't just casually say she took an unneeded extended break while doing so, and that disonnance makes me confused. And I'm still not convinced that the text as-is in Worm is sufficient to support the reading that Amy sexually assaulted her, I just don't see it in the text or subtext. The bit you highlighted with Carol's reaction does lean that way, but not enough for it to be definitive for me

          >Edit: also, Amy changed Victoria's sexuality earlier on, which caused her to become enraged. When we see her in the asylum, though, she is uncontrollably infatuated with Amy. That happened during the Ensquidening.

          I don't think this is true. In Interlude 11h (Amy) it's pretty explicit that Amy didn't just change Victoria's sexuality, but made her specifically in love with Amy:

          >Amy’s voice was a croak as she replied, “…make it so you would reciprocate my feelings.”

          >“I can find someone else to fix it.  Or maybe, at the very least, I can show some fucking self-control and realize it’s my sister I’m having those feelings about.”

          In Interlude 18 (Yamada), I don't think there is enough there to conclude that Amy must have made Victoria more infatuated with her during the Cronenberging
          ```

          - u/steelong:
            ```
            Going from 'flying away in anger' to 'begging for her to come back' is a pretty tremendous shift in behavior.  I'm not sure what to attribute it to if it wasn't further mental influence.
            ```

            - u/Seraphaestus:
              ```
              The other hypothesis would be that it was just natural change, I guess? It's clear in I11h that it's something she's actively resisting, and after the trauma of what happened and her experience afterwards, maybe she just broke down, sad and fucked up as that is

              Also I edited my comment just after writing it, in case you missed the edits. I added:

                I suppose it is possible that her begging in the asylum was the result of a mundane mental breakdown, but does that really fit the evidence better?  Looking over her comments about how she 'wanted to see her smile again. To have someone hug me before I left forever.'

                Technically possible, but improbable, that there wasn't any further mental manipulation.  At least, as far as I see it.

                And as for the edit.  You are confused because Amy is saying something bad about herself in a situation where you would expect her to be trying to sugar-coat everything, right?  Wouldn't that imply, then, that she really *is* downplaying how bad things were?    If excuse-making self-justifying Amy is admitting to something as awful as an extended unnecessary break, then what she actually did must be much worse.  Or at least, that is the conclusion that makes most sense to me.

                And I was trying to make the point earlier that even ignoring any possibility of outright sexual assault, the fandom tends to skip over or excuse Amy's actions far more than I think is reasonable.

                  Oh, that's true. Her comment here does actual suggest Amy did further mental tampering. Potentially to remove Victoria's animosity to her rather than further infatuation, though.

                  >Wouldn't that imply, then, that she really is downplaying how bad things were? If excuse-making self-justifying Amy is admitting to something as awful as an extended unnecessary break, then what she actually did must be much worse.

                  Hm, perhaps you're right. My confusion may also be on a meta-level, though, that there's some dissonance with it being there as something Wildbow would write into the text without anything else to accompany it and make it feel more natural, sensical. I don't know, it's hard to put a finger on what exactly causes my confusion with it, that it sticks out like a sore thumb.

                  >And I was trying to make the point earlier that even ignoring any possibility of outright sexual assault, the fandom tends to skip over or excuse Amy's actions far more than I think is reasonable.


                  That's fair; what Amy did was fucked up even without the potential sexual assault. But I think it would still be another significant leap into inexcusability, so it's not irrelevant
                  ```

      ```
      Worm never directly explains this, instead you have to read between the lines through Carol’s interlude with Amy’s explanation.  And even then you have to assume the worst possibility through the ambiguity.  Considering that just getting through Taylor’s rationalization was too hard for a major portion of the original fandom, expecting them to understand Amy without having it spelled out is an unreasonable expectation on the part of the author.  And given that softer interpretations had years to develop and spread, spelling it out in the sequel was bound to get some backlash.
      ```

      - u/steelong:
        ```
        Is it really reading between the lines?  Even ignoring anything ambiguous, in Amy's own words she pretty much completely healed Victoria and then 'tweaked' her and modified her mind because she was 'lonely'.  Then, she kept her that way for *days*, putting off fixing her.  Even if there wasn't any kind of mundane molestation going on, that's still heinous.  

        Sure, a lot of people missed subtext, but treating Amy like she was just some poor misunderstood victim that Victoria is being unfair towards is a step beyond.  At that point, you're ignoring the *text*, not the subtext.

            It was a bigger deal as hinted by WoG before being retooled for the sequel. Her aura gets downplayed a lot as a long-term effect, and is mostly used an "add extra words" button during fights.

            Keep in mind, discussing these things with current fans that have kept up with Ward is discussing it with a section of the fandom shaped by survivorship bias. The story managed to be a filter for the fanbase to such a degree that entire communities built to discuss WB's works are now segregated.

              Except even in Worm one of the first lines Amy has is that she's immune to Victoria's powers due to exposure.  You can speculate that she was lying or misinformed, but she isn't the only one who was exposed to her long-term.  If there had been long-term effects, that would have been noticeable in others.

            Depends. The part where it has some small effect may be canon. But the part where it makes people GG-sexual through exposure is a mix of fanon an >!just another one of Amy's endless bullshit excuses.!< Or to put it differently, not a single other member of Victoria's family is attracted to her.

            Also, the involuntary sexuality change at that first pivotal touch is not what people mean by rape.

            It's definitely overblow by fannon.  It isn't like anyone else close to her is developing any kind of obsession with her.  And considering how quickly her own mother stopped visiting her in the asylum, there definitely isn't any kind of addiction.

                  ```
                  The aura comment that Wildbow vaguely canonized is specifically about Amy going through puberty while under the effects of the aura 24/7, so no, because that's not part of the premise.

                  What's ambiguous is whether Carol abandoned Victoria or not, in Worm. That's something that's made explicit in Ward, not before. What's also ambiguous is whether Amy's Victoria-centric sexuality was intended to be a result of aura exposure, or maybe "breadth and depth". Guts and Glory was going to be centered around this family in a world where capes are routinely shaped by powers, especially when exposed at a young age. This has always been a setting conceit of Worm's.

                  I find it pretty funny that, somehow, when it's time to assign responsibility and mitigating factors, the characters who never did anything *too* offensive or horrible get full marks, while any who did mental illness *'wrong'* gets the "you had perfect agency! Why did you think this was a good idea!??" treatment.

                  When you set out to make a sequel built around themes of second chances, healing, therapy and redemption, having your protagonist be a pure victim that BTFOs her perfectly agentic rapist is hypocritical at best. Especially when there's a bunch of WoGs centered around implying there was power intervention in Amy's breakdown and subsequent actions. Fragile One and Shaper can't have anything to do with what happened because then Fragile One couldn't be worthy of development and Amy couldn't be perfectly stupid and evil.

                    Shaper definitely had something to do with it. And Amy isn't perfectly stupid and evil. Amy is a girl with a dangerous power that massively suffers under her own narcissism.

                    Yes, you can blame how she was raised, how she involuntarily felt for her sister, what kinds of pressure her ability to heal anyone put on her, what kinds of opposite pressure her shard not wanting to just heal people and who knows what else for various aspects of her personality and downfall, but the end result is someone sick and dangerous that doesn't see how she is sick and dangerous and has a crippling obsession for her victim. And that end result would not have been true for just anyone in her situation.

                    Blaming her as a stupid evil villain abusing her own perfect agency is nonsensical, just like it always is even in real life, let aline for a story character whose life is literally being written. So yes, Amy deserves pity. But she doesn't deserve to have Victoria, in any capacity.

                      You smoothly dodged any mention of Fragile One, as I said people do. Ward systematically "clears up" things by making Victoria's shard the underdog instead of the well-fed monster it was in Worm.

            So maybe it's an intended subtext or maybe it's just a neat idea that Wildbow thought about but never considered canon.

      No, Amy's core problem was just that she couldn't bring herself to actually accept responsibility for her actions.  I've had the misfortune of dealing with people who were the same way.  It's like that Friends meme irl, they'll agree with each individual line of reasoning inexorably proving that they acted wrongly, and then conclude "and it wasn't my fault!"  And it can lie dormant for *years*, never realizing they were that sort of person until they've done something atrocious and you get to have that baffling, incomprehensible conversation.  For the sort of person who posts here, if you ever have to have that discussion, it will make you doubt the other person qualifies as *people*.  My best guess for what's going on under the hood is something like "Ego Protection beats the piss out of Internal Consistency Checker".
