## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I don't know if you know the story Savage divinity
  On royal road. 

  But in the story there are "martial weapons" which cannot be destroyed (according to cannon as I understand it). and this is ripe for abuse.
  Therefore:
  What is the best OP weapons that can be created?
  (For example,I think that a very thin and sharp wire will be OP)

  Additional information if yoy didn't read Savage divinity:
  1) A weapon is only indestructible after being connected to a person's soul (the terminology is different in the story) and can only be used by that person afterwards.
  2)a person is limited in the amount weapons he can connect to.
  3) energy which closely resemble chi exist in the story universe, with it a person (after a lot of training ) can do things like make the weapon sharper, lighter, hit stronger, add reverberating for internal damege, and more.
  4) there are no gunpowder! or other explosives allowed (for cannon reasons )
  5) cannot be overly mechanically complicated (think middle/dark ages blacksmith but an extremely talented one)

  P.S I would very much recommend Savage divinity.( I don't think that the story is rational, although there are parts that are).

      ```
      As I remember, each weapon must be a solid seamless piece, one piece. So unless you have liquid metal, a functional armour set would contains like 100 pieces.
