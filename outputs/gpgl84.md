    This was the most bat-shit story I've read in a long time. I have no idea how to feel about it.

    Thanks for writing.

  - u/CannedRealm:
    ```
    Thank you for the marble and for making me feel the feeling.

    ```
    This was really good!  I can only think of one question you didn't resolve - who made Mahuika vape?  Charlie and Mike both say it wasn't them, and we don't know anyone else with the power to do so.
    ```

    - u/gazemaize:
      ```
      It was intentionally not stated.
      ```

      - u/nicholaslaux:
        ```
        Seems pretty clear that it was JUROR (aka the author insert character) who made her vape, then. For the purposes of art.

    Congratulations on Finishing a Thing! And what a scrumptious thing it is.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    have you written anything else? do you plan to?
    ```

    - u/gazemaize:
      ```
      I will write new stories when I am able to. I have concrete ideas for both fanfiction and original stories but I don't want to tease anything because it is going to take a long time before I can write them.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      If you look up "Game by God" on this subreddit, you'll find references to a (now offline and unfinished) story that gazemaize wrote under a different name. I think there are also people here who have it archived if you want to read it, but I forget who.
      ```

  - u/masterax2000:
    ```
    Thank you so much. Hope you write more in the future!
    ```

  - u/GrecklePrime:

    It was a very enjoyable story.

    This was a real gift. Thank you.

  I intend to interpret that last line as implying that for whatever reason, Chili still eats dirt, or in this case, sand.
  ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    I like this interpretation.
    ```

- u/MaxDougwell:
  ```
  In the end, Charlie and Wonka never got out of their pickle.

  …

  If Mahuika doesn't vape anymore, is she even still Mahuika?

  …

  On the one hand, her lack of true autonomy, perfect willingness to follow the instructions of others without misinterpretation and refusal to engage in anything too complicated makes her a suitable human substitute for a world-controlling AI and/or preserved vegetable god.


  On the other I just want her to feel the feeling for Marama. 


  Maybe they can go stargazing with Tide's family.
  ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    She may not be Mahuika-as-we-knew-her, but she is someone-worth-being-called-Mahuika, as the seed is replaced by the oak tree. 

    Or so I choose to believe.
    ```

- u/callmesalticidae:
  ```
  I just realized that there are strong tonal and stylistic shifts on

  * ch. 7 (loss of internet commentators, transition to factory tour)

  * ch. 14 (switch to new viewpoint character after first one dies, slow build up to cosmic horror)

  * ch. 21 (Big Damn Heroes moment, Chili is nice now, HPMOR-style challenge threatens to
  ```

- u/XxChronOblivionxX:
  ```
  This has been one of the funnest and most gripping rides I can recall reading. Hot damn. The masterful tone shift starting with the Keerthi chapters, suddenly realizing that you are very much trapped in a cursed mansion under the control of an untouchable lunatic who wants you dead. The contestants struggle to resist until they're picked off, leaving Tide to try her best to pick up the pieces, but of course she can't defeat this almost-empty shell, and all of the masks are destroyed, the endgame has begun. I will admit, the sudden tone reversal into this heroic "all of the contestants are alive and awoke a rebellion throughout the factory to learn his exact plans and try to stop him" stuff, that still felt a bit out of place. Same could be said of this fairytale epilogue. Buuuuut, I can't bring myself to care too much, because seeing the heroes win, and seeing the murderous little fuck from the beginning marry Keerthi, the beacon of goodness herself, and be ashamed of his former self, it just feels very nice. Definitely gonna try to spread this one around.

    Seconding this. The parts of this story which are strong, are strong enough to compensate for the parts of this story which are weak.

  Our just deserts
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    it really would make sense for the setting to be just deserts now
    ```

- u/masterax2000:
  ```
  Huh. Not marked as complete. That felt like the end, but...?
  ```

  - u/Tinac4:
    ```
    It is now, but I wouldn't put it past the author to release a new twist chapter anyway just for the heck of it.
    ```

  - u/Saffrin-chan:
    ```
    It is marked as complete. It's been marked as complete since chapter 6. So, you know, the 'complete' mark dons't really mean anything for this story, but yeah this does feel like the end.
    ```

    - u/masterax2000:
      ```
      >It's been marked as complete since chapter 6

      Pretty sure this isn't the case. It was first marked as such back then, but I think went back and forth a few times after.
      ```

      - u/Saffrin-chan:
        ```
        oh, well if it's gone back and forth I haven't noticed, but I do remember seeing it still marked as complete a few times even after chapters were posted following 6. I didn't check every update though, so it could have been switched back to uncomplete at some point before switching back to complete for this chapter ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          The story's description now says "finished", FWIW.
          ```

      - u/callmesalticidae:
        ```
        Seconding this. It's possible to find it marked / not marked as complete back and forth in the Wayback Machine.
        ```

- u/fljared:
  ```
  That's a lot of cute things in this story, but the mention of Chili and Keerthi's child having a skin tag is adorable
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  it was, ultimately, a complicated pickle.

- u/immortal_lurker:
  ```
  I loved this story. I am happier having read it.

  What's the cheating at cards story?

    That's Henry Sugar, who uses his power of xray vision to make tons of money at casinos

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  I appreciate OP using the correct tagging for the final chapter, by the way.
  ```

- u/royishere:
  ```
  I feel called the fuck out hahaha. Well played. 


  Great story, gazemaize. Creative, hilarious, a little terrifying, and beautiful in its own way.

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    Also, my brain keeps swapping words as I reread and think about this passage, e.g. "It suffered. Everyone suffers." 

    This is one of the few times I'm glad that my brain swaps words sometimes.

  Aww Chili got his just dessert. Sweet.
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    Well, Chili and his son both spent a while in a vast dessert, but they'll have desert later.

  That was...truly wonderful. It was a wild ride from start to finish, and I think this may be one of, if not my favorite fan fictions I've ever read. I could attempt to nit pick, though most of the story makes no sense, so I really don't think it would matter. My only real complaints is that there's not enough of it, and that there were a lot of unexplored plot threads (Chillenial Lee, the kid who created the AI, the president, etc.). Finally, I'm not sure if I would have had the final chapters...kind of go off the deep end, but it was enjoyable regardless.

  Also...how are you holding up Gazemaize? I know you were experiencing a lot of problems, though you deleted the chapter mentioning them so I won't say/ask too much in the way of specifics. Hopefully writing this story and your fan's support helped you get through some rough times, and I hope things get better and you find a point in which you receive some stability and relaxation. Thank you making me feel feelings and for writing such a plexicated and gloriumptious story!

  I think I found a very clever reference at the end there.

  There's a book called a Girl named Poison, which has similar themes of a character becoming the world's 'author' and interacting with 'people' she creates.

  Much like chili and the chocolate factory, the story went through several huge tonal shifts. It started as a girl running from an abusive household, to a heartwarming adventure with the guy who saved her, to eldritch horror as all the puppets she created as author begged her to take care of herself; since if she dies their entire world ceases to exist.

  ```
  can someone enlighten me as to what that mess of a tag stands for?
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    It stands for SATIRICAL DECONSTRUCTION OF BELOVED SURREALIST WORK WRITTEN FOR AND PARTIALLY ABOUT THIS SUBREDDIT, a gag that arose during discussion about whether this story is _really_ rational or _really_ belongs here. It at the very least directly and intentionally addresses the elements and style of rational fiction, even if it's not necessarily quite "rational fiction."
    ```

    - u/Reply_or_Not:
      ```
      I try not to read too many comments because of spoilers, but has this work completed?
      ```

      - u/gryfft:
        ```
        Yes, this chapter is the epilogue! I do really recommend it if you like dark silly fun, and especially if you have any familiarity with the works of Roald Dahl.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This both needs to be a book itself and is, simultaneously, exactly where it needs to be. 

  &#x200B;

  I love it. It was an experience. Also a horrific acid-face-eating nightmare, but an experience nonetheless. 

  &#x200B;

  Thank you for the ending.
