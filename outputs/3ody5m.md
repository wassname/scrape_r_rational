## [Q] Settings that beat "Reedspacer's Lower Bound"

### Post:

In "[Interpersonal Entanglement](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xt/interpersonal_entanglement/)", /u/EliezerYudkowsky described 'Reedspacer's Lower Bound': 

> if your grand vision of the future isn't at *least* as much fun as a volcano lair with catpersons of the appropriate gender, you should just go with that instead.

How many existing fictional settings do you know that *are* more fun to live in than that?

  Let's be fair: how many Utopias are basically volcano lairs populated by cat people, just with a different color scheme?

  I ... am having a hard time thinking of examples of Utopias, for some reason. I think that is a really bad sign.

  So, uh, James Cameron's Avatar. Basically a volcano lair full of cat people. Except instead of a volcano lair, it's the Temple of Gaea, because I am having a hard time determining the value in living in a volcano for more than a weekend. Also I don't remember the name of the planet in Avatar, because I already told you Pacman is apparently in my brain, eating my memories. \[edit: Pandora! Right after I posted!\]

  Star Trek! Like spaceships? Like exploring new worlds? Because it's got the cat people covered. In the future, space is a volcano full of cats.

  I tried to explain how Heaven and Disneyland are basically volcano lairs full of cat people, maybe even more literally than the other two, but I'm feeling less sane by the word and decided to cut it.

    Not really.  Most half-decent even-halfway eutopias I can think of simply aren't grouped as utopias.  Nobody who made them was trying to write a utopia story, and to call them such would insult them.  They're extremely nice places to live *precisely because* they were meant to provide *backgrounds* for the positive and interesting lives of their characters.

    To give an example, it was HPMoR that noted Rowling's wizarding world to be a "zeroth world country" in which most major material discomforts were so thoroughly abolished as to be beneath notice.

    To give a further example, the world of *Slayers* features various wars between gods and demons and all kinds of "not-so-utopian" worldbuilding details, but actually, on a daily basis, appears to have a high standard of living *plus* magic *plus* various forms of sophisticated fun available via Zany Schemes and Simple Plans for all kinds of advancement.  It has enough room that the main character of the series eventually grows to be able to control spells which summon the power of their Chaotic Neutral creatress goddess, the Lord of Nightmares.

    Nobody has to call it "eutopia", but you'd still actually want to live there.

      I *think* it was a commentary on Orwell that made a distinction for me:  utopia (or distopia) is generally a political message, whereas eutopia is more focussed on measurable hedons than ideology.

      I don't say "utilons" because I see it referring more to what *should* be good rather than that-thing-that-hedons-measure, and it tangles politics back in.  After all, it's very easy to say that the political and legal structure of a eutopia is ideal, and then it's just another utopia...

    Well, they're easy to do the set design and models for.

    If you stick to media SF, yeh. Literature SF has some pretty awesome utopias.

  Well, Star Trek has catgirl-lairs with the Holodecks, plus you get to explore space. Which happens to also resemble a volcano lair, and be populated by people who look suspiciously like catgirls. Hmm.

  Life in the Culture looks a lot like Reedspacer's Lower, I guess. I mean, the catgirls are mostly other bored people, and you have to ask a Mind for a volcano lair, but it's basically the same. But you die after a while, and there's other depressing stuff around... probably doesn't pass it.

  Um ... dang, most of the transhumanist ones seem to actually fail ... ah! *The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect* beats the Bound.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Old argument is old: you don't *have* to die in the Culture, but most people do, Because Philosophy.

    There's also the issue with the Culture or Prime Intellect's Cyberspace that the authors deliberately add negative elements to make it easier to write a book rather than because the core ideas have actual fundamental flaws.

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    > But you die after a while, and there's other depressing stuff around... probably doesn't pass it.

    1. You don't need to die after a while. You can uplift into higher dimensions, upload into a heaven, or simply live forever. It's mildly frowned upon (it's an "unusual life choice") but nobody forces you to die at 300 or 400 or whenever they normally decide to drop.

    2. Reedspacer's Lower Bound doesn't imply there isn't depressing stuff outside the volcano lair.
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      I'd feel obligated to go fix things, though :/

      And Culture people complain a lot about this feeling, so it is part of the utopia, although I'd be guilty about other things than they seem to.
      ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        You seem to assume that you have no obligations beyond the volcano lair full of catgirls. That's not specified, so the awesomeness criteria for a utopia don't cover whether EVERYONE has a volcano lair full of catgirls, or whether you have an obligation to provide one for everyone else. I mean, it's a really low bar when you think about it.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          The whole point is that it's a really low bar which most IRL and fictional "utopians" fail miserably at.
          ```

          - u/ArgentStonecutter:
            ```
            And I'm saying that there's lots of societies in _written_ SF that are _at least_ as much _fun_ as a volcano lair full of catpeople. Media SF seems less successful at meeting that target, as it is at meeting pretty much any other target.

            Oh, let's add Gabriel's domain in Walter Jon Williams' _Aristoi_ (Gabriel takes care of his catgirls very well). And for all it's not a Utopia by any means, Karl Schroeder's _Virga_.
            ```

  Easy setting exceeding the bound:

  A volcano lair full of cat-girls.... with _air conditioning._

  Volcano-heat tends to be a little bit overpowering, y'know?
  ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  AND, after reading the whole article:

  Why does EY assume the catgirls are nonsentient?

  I'd spawn a bunch of instances of myself so I'd get to be the catgirls as well. Why not? And why does he assume the catgirl option means you spend all your time screwing? Even if you do, how many people would stay stuck in the same gender? Hell, they'd invent new ones.

  Also, Larry Niven has already written the novel where men and women no longer have sex to hold them together. It doesn't end well.
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    >Why does EY assume the catgirls are nonsentient?

    If they were sentient then they would be people.  Possibly people with strange body-modifications, but people nonetheless.  If you think living in a personal volcano lair with other people is better, then that scenario has passed Reedspacer's Lower Bound.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      > If they were sentient then they would be people.

      Why do you/EY assume catgirls aren't people? Or that they're forced to be there? "Catgirls" certainly doesn't imply "not people" to me. [C'Mell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norstrilia) was definitely a people.
      ```

      - u/Jiro_T:
        ```
        This is another case of EY and LW in general using unusual terms for things.  "Catgirl" was used in the original EY post to mean "sexual not-person" which is not what most people would think of catgirls as being and which has several better words to use to describe the same thing.  (Someone replying to the original post suggested "fembot", which has much more appropriate connotations even though literally speaking it's possible for fembots to be sentient too.)
        ```

        - u/ArgentStonecutter:
          ```
          > "Catgirl" was used in the original EY post to mean "sexual not-person"

          I realize that's what EY thinks it means, but is that what <reedspacer> meant?

               This Utopia consists of a one-line remark on an IRC channel:

                  <reedspacer> living in your volcano lair with catgirls is probably a vast increase in standard of living for most of humanity

          I'm pretty sure that most people would want their futuristic catgirls/fembots/succubi/post-realdollian-sextoys to pass the Turing Test.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            You can strengthen the point in two ways:

            * The catgirls aren't independently sapient/intelligent.  This is what Eliezer meant.

            * The catgirls aren't independently sentient/emotional.  This tends to trigger people's discomfort with near-hive existences and lack of individuality.
            ```

            - u/ArgentStonecutter:
              ```
              I think you're making a point that's kind of orthogonal to the one I was making.
              ```

                True.

      The point wasn't that sexual reproduction is all the human condition.  The point was that we're fundamentally social creatures, and you're cutting off a *major* aspect of potential fun-space by reducing us to queen-and-worker colonies of semi-sentient eusocial organisms (that is, one Harem Anime MC surrounded by legions of pleasant, affectionate but ultimately mindless catgirls), in which the sentient queens (the Harem Anime MCs) never actually interact.
      ```

  ```
  As an initial example, which may be a lower bound for exceeding the lower bound: "[The Journal Entries of Kennet R'yal Shardik, et. al., and Related Tales.](http://pendorwright.com/journals/)", which has catpersons of all genders, and I'd suspect that an antigrav castle is a suitable equivalent to said volcano lair. :)
  ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    Catpersons of all genders and species. And an antigrav castle in a no-kidding Ringworld you built yourself.

    I'll pass on the violent dominance games. Not my cup of tea. Also, it's kind of disappointing that he didn't spin off multiple instances of himself. He misses out on so much of the potential fun of the Hall by only letting people go through it once, too.

    I'll vote for Banks "Culture", or Greg Egan's "Permutation City", though I still haven't figured out what's so great about pretending to be a "Chinese Room" AI. Peer's final embrace of Solipsist Nation principles is pretty awesome.

    Charlie Stross's "Accelerando" universe has people being pretty much whatever they want in as many instances as they want.

    Linda Nagata's universe has potential. Try "Vast".

    Varley's Ophiuchi Hotline universe is pretty much a blast, though his reboot decades later nerfed the shit out of it.

    Edit: adding Karl Schroeder's "Lady of Mazes".

    Walter Jon Williams, "Implied Spaces"

    Wil McCarthy, "Queendom of Sol" series.

      Despite overall Dystopian tone I got the impression life in the Sobernost as a Gogol might pass the bar, but I still wouldn't be willing to embrace their values.

  Heck, the backstory to Karl Schroeder's "Lady of Mazes" has [spoiler](#s " A whole solar system full of habitats and ships where everyone has at least as awesome an existence as a volcano lair full of catgirls, and a group of idealists ran off and set up a bandit colony to try something better. ")
