## [MK] [HSF/HF] Break my unusual FTL system

### Post:

So I'm writing a fantasy/scifi/magitech thing where the main character does all sort of muchkinry, and it has a bit of a different FTL system than usual space fiction. The magic system is quite limited but helps around a few engineering obstacles. 

Super effective impulse engines exist that exploit a spell to give Newton's 3rd the middle finger and create impulse without needing reaction mass, and they can provide multiple G's for years. However, people inside a spaceship with this drive still experience the acceleration, which limits how fast crewed ships can accelerate. Inertial dampeners exist, but they kinda mess up the entire concept of temperature so they're not used on anything that has complicated biochemistry in it.

Warp drives (Alcubierre style) aren't a thing, while there is space warping stuff it can't project a warp field in front of a ship because the "projectors" have to surround the altered region of spacetime. 

The only FTL method is creating stable wormholes by using the space warping magic to create an artificial rotating black hole which immediately collapses into Hawking radiation but acts like a holepunch to alter the topology of spacetime which normal space warping can't do, then applying more complicated space warping to keep the wormhole from instantly collapsing and seperating the two ends. Wormhole creation always creates two ends in the same location of spacetime, so you can't quickly open a wormhole to hop to another planet like in Stargate. If the equipment at one end of a wormhole is damaged, the entire thing collapses and is gone. 

What is done is carrying one end of a wormhole to a new location at below light speed, then using it to hop back and forth at FTL. Basically there's an entire network of stable wormhole connections, and most exit points are connected to multiple other nodes to create a network where you can go from any point to any other point through multiple wormholes.

Now, here's how initial connections to other star systems are set up: A wormhole is generated, one end stays at an existing node in the network, the other one is put on a fully autonomous relativistic cruiser which is basically an oversized impulse drive capable of sustained 10+ G's and a massive shield and nothing more. The relativistic cruiser spends half the journey accelerating towards the destination, another half slowing down, with most of the trip so ridiculously close to light speed that the CMB itself is shifted to deadly gamma rays, and a any piece of cosmic dust has the impact energy of a nuke which is why the shield is needed.

For an observer stationary to the starting point or destination, the cruiser takes just a little longer than a light signal to arrive, tens of millions of years. But for a moving observer on the cruiser, time dilation reduces the trip time to a few years. From an earth stationary observer looking through the wormhole, the trip also only takes a few years because anyone looking through a wormhole sees time passing normally no matter how fast the ends are traveling compared to each other. 

So a cruiser might be sent off to Andromeda, and a few years later people can hop through the wormhole to a point in spacetime at Andromeda but shifted millions of years into the future as seen by earth. Doesn't really matter, Andromeda a million years in the future is just as interesting to explore and you can always hop back through the wormhole to present day earth. Unless the wormhole collapses, in which case there's no way back apart from hoping that earth millions of years in the past reacted by sending another cruiser. Sending a cruiser back to earth would result in arriving a few million years after you left, same as light speed round trip time.

This system allows limited FTL (between existing nodes in the network, but it cannot be expanded outside of its light cone) and even time travel, by returning a wormhole end to the origin point after time dilating it a bunch. Time travel wormholes only have a fixed amount of time that they can go back by, and can't go back to before the setup process was completed, and doesn't split the timeline so closed timelike curves like HPMoR's time turners except for the potential of millions of years of delta-t. 

Obviously access to time travel wormholes is strictly regulated by the authorities and not handed out to schoolkids, and nobody else can easily make time travel wormholes because it'd require setting up a black hole factory. 

More common impulse drive ships that can use the wormholes but are acceleration limited otherwise are less regulated, but after someone tried to hit earth with an asteroid at .5%c they're also pretty restricted.

Politically, there's the Sol government that runs the wormhole network and there's a bunch of significantly less powerful local governments of various systems scattered across the local group of galaxies. Economically the magitech solves some shortages but most resources are mined traditionally in various asteroid belts and planets, energy comes from fusion and Dyson swarms that use wormholes to transmit concentrated energy, fabrication is done mostly automated. Most people work on intellectual property due to a ban on advanced AI. Civil wars and terrorism occasionally happens, most notable example that guy who tried to asteroid kill earth, but there's no large war because everyone needs Sol's network, and it's literally impossible for another system to build a usable network with another center point because the temporal differences would be way off. 

So what kind of shenanigans could a wealthy but common, rational thinking munchkin come up with in my world? I think I left a few too many exploits in the way things work.

  So you can open a wormhole and send a cruiser to Andromeda, and the cruiser will arrive 2 million years later. People from earth can travel through this wormhole, arriving 2 million light years away and 2 million years in the future, and then back, arriving in the place and time they departed from.

  So what you do is when you arrive in Andromeda in 2 million years, you open up a second wormhole near the exit of the first, with the other end in a cruiser bound for the Milky Way. When that cruiser arrives back at Earth, it's now t+4M years. You send someone through the Earth->Andromeda+2MY, then through the Andromeda->Earth+4MY wormhole, and have them collect data from the future then return back to present day Earth. 

  Congratulations, you're writing a time travel story.

  Edit: which on rereading I see you're aware of. Still, there are lots of time travel shenanigans you could pull here. Which ones will work depends on the exact time travel model you're using.

  - u/15_Redstones:

    The time travel aspect is kinda what politically keeps Sol in power. You can't send a wormhole connection backwards in time, only forwards and let someone come back through. This means that if a connection was built from A to B, B is further in the future than A and cannot construct a connection back to present-A, only far future-A which would cause all kinds of chaos. Since the original network was built from Sol and the other systems are scattered around the edge of Sol's light cone, other systems cannot make networks that connect all  present day systems because they're outside their light cones. If for example someone in Andromeda tried to make their own network, the vast majority of their connections would end up at other systems millions of years in the future compared to the connections from Sol.

      My point is that basically working time travel is a win condition pretty much no matter what your goals are. Consider having a thousand ideas that might work but will each take decades to accomplish your goals. Start trying the first one, and send an observer to the future to report back whether it worked. If so, great. If not, switch to strategy 2 and repeat.
      ```

      - u/15_Redstones:
        ```
        True. Although there's certainly a risk to letting someone return from the far future, they could be bringing back something dangerous self-replicating such as a supervirus or a copy of am artificial superintelligence, thus causing it to exist in the first place. That's why I imagined all connections to the far future to be used extremely cautiously, largely limiting the things that can be done.

        Time travel wormholes with just a few minutes offset would be pretty widely used though, mostly to solve complicated computational problems. Computers don't get scared when the message they get from their future self is "don't mess with time".
        ```

        - u/Geminii27:
          ```
          A-B/B-A time-travel wormholes with a few days' offset would be *incalculably* valuable from a political, military, and economic standpoint. Would a government which controlled access to the technology - or the individual politicians in power - be able to resist the siren song of knowing exactly how any decision they made would pan out, and thus being able to choose the option that works out the best for them?

          Would there even be able to be lotteries, gambling, or anything resembling a stock market any more, if information from minutes or days ahead was available? Would billionaires and megacompanies who could wangle access to future information (by means fair or foul) always outperform and outmaneuver their less successful rivals? Would there effectively be a new level of have-and-have-not in society, with people who had future foreknowledge establishing themselves firmly and permanently on top?
          ```

          - u/15_Redstones:
            ```
            True, the days offset range is probably the one with the most immediate gain. Access would probably be tightly controlled, and give a major advantage to those who run the system (and those who can get access that they shouldn't have). Not unlike HPMoR's time turners, except without the arbitrary 6 hour limit and a lot less portable. They'd probably have to limit the amount of information going back, since they can't change anything that they already know will happen unless they lie to their own past selves afterwards, which would completely invalidate the point. There might also be activists demanding further reduction in causality-breaking, free-will-limiting information, their success depending on how strongly democratic values are adhered to. I'm still in the process of working out how exactly the geopolitics (or spacetimepolitics?) would look like.
            ```

            - u/immortal_lurker:
              ```
              Why would they limit information? Future knowledge doesn't cast a binding spell upon you once you hear it (...unless is *does* because your world has magic). The binding was already there, because physics is deterministic.

              As you have HPMOR time travel, given that they are communicating information, nothing that happens will prevent that communication. This means that either the person talking can't stop the circumstances that led to them talking, or they don't want to.

              This isn't "serious advantage" territory. This is P=NP=1. The organization with time travel does one of two things:

              1. Explodes immediately. This should be unlikely, because whatever gets sent back has to be something that causes you to want to send the exact same thing back even knowing it explodes you.
              2. Has perfect days for the rest of forever. They never so much as stub a toe, not even to stumble over pirate treasure, because they would just tell their past selves "hey, there is pirate treasure here, watch your feet". These people aren't powerful, they are Contessa without blind spots.
                 1. This organization could technically be beaten by altering their goals. At 8:00 AM Jan 1st they hear from Jan 2nd, "Go to the abandoned warehouse at noon for excellent cake!" Instead, they are mind-controlled, and 8:00 AM on Jan 2nd they tell Jan 1st to go the warehouse. 

              Basically, the way to ensure this stays in serious advantage territory and not godhood territory, Just invent a physics or magic reason why every A-B B-A pair explodes if more than a certain number of bits are sent backwards. I'm thinking something like 32 bits a day, allowing for tension heightening but still cryptic messages like "HELP" to be sent back.

              Sharply limited data and sharply limited time allows for interesting things. For one, information from further ahead can come back by simply ferrying it backwards, one day at a time. And could be subverted along the chain.

              > since they can't change anything that they already know will happen

              Do we know this? Is there a single, fixed timeline?

              Of course, people who compose extremely careful questions to their future selves (or to future information-brokers) could still get use out of it. For example, not asking "do the activists get mysteriously murdered and when?", but things like "is there ever a time when a majority of the most vocal activists are together in the same room?" Effectively, asking about opportunities rather than conclusions.

          What stops someone dumping a wormhole 100 years in earth's future and pointing a big telescope back?

            They'd have to get their hands on a wormhole. Not exactly an easy process to create one. 

            And they'd have to deliver it to a point in the future of reachable spacetime, which means that if Sol finds out they have more than enough time to send an interceptor to shoot it down. Remember that Sol is at the bottom of the cone-shaped spacetime map of the network, they can reach any point they want with a relativistic ship. 

            Then they'd have to prevent the future civilization that they want to observe from destroying the spy.

            Finally they'd have to figure out how to make sure that the information they get is trustworthy. Any information from 100 years in the future is risky, especially when it's terabytes of data, because those could turn out to be the source code to the superintelligent AI that runs the future and sent itself back to create itself.

            My idea was a society which has time travel to and from the far future, but treats it extremely cautiously and if anyone created an unlicensed wormhole that might allow someone from the future to invade and Sol finds out, half their nuclear arsenal would arrive within the same hour.

  The problem you face is that any method of FTL physical travel is synonymous with time travel. Moreover, it's hard to see how the reference frames would actually even be mathematically consistent for your proposed wormhole delivering courier that only takes a few years from earth reference. It certainly seems that it privileges the earth reference frame, but there's no clear physical reason that should be the case, unless that's just somehow part of the 'magic'? It does not seem to follow from a simple application of reaction-less inertia. Depending how this actually works, time travel might be the least of your problems.

  I would suggest that your worm hole view of the courier should probably show a time dilated perspective. I suspect anything else would not offer consistent reference frames under Lorentz transforms.

    > any method of FTL physical travel is synonymous with time travel

    I know this in theory but don't understand intuitively. Could you expand? Let's say we have means to jump instantly between Earth and Mars. We are on Earth at the point in time E(0), we can observe Mars as it was at M(-3m). We jump to Mars and arrive at M(0), observing Earth at E(-3m). If we instantly jump back, we arrive at E(0), if we fly back at the speed of light, we arrive at E(+3m). I don't see how can we travel in time using this setup. What am I missing here?
    ```

    - u/15_Redstones:
      ```
      In this case Earth and Mars are approximately stationary relative to each other. When things move close to the speed of light, that's when interesting things happen. For example you might know the twin "paradoxon", where the astronaut twin ends up being younger than the one that stays on earth. With end points of a wormhole instead of twins, this results in a wormhole where one end is further in the future than the other, allowing time travel
      ```

  - u/15_Redstones:
    ```
    From earth observing the spacecraft directly, it indeed takes a long time. From earth looking through the wormhole it only takes a few years. The idea is that both ends of a wormhole experience time at the same rate when looking through it, so when one end experiences time dilation the ends aren't connecting the same points in time any more. 

    And yes this results in time travel, people having the possibility to end up millions of years in the future, and things from the far future potentially making it back, which is why all wormholes with high time offset are very strictly regulated. The actual wormholes are actually tiny (nanometer size, only photos fit through) but space warping expands them large enough for ships to go through, but only when active so without both sides consenting and activating the expansion the connection is closed to anything large. Obviously nobody lets anything from the far future travel back without a lot of checks, can't be too careful.
    ```

    - u/sparr:

      > which is why all wormholes with high time offset are very strictly regulated.

      How does that regulation remain effective across so many solar systems and millions of years?
      ```

      - u/15_Redstones:
        ```
        Basically Sol, the system that's the furthest in the past of the entire network, is the one whose government is in control of the entire network and all the access codes required to open a connection to let things through. Since they're the furthest in the past, they can send relativistic ships to any point in their future light cone and enforce what they want. If someone sends a wormhole somewhere that Sol doesn't approve of, they can intercept the relativistic ship with a solid tungsten rod impacting at 99.9999%c. Other systems cannot do that because they're further in the future, so their light cones can't reach present-Sol, only future-Sol which is obviously more technologically advanced, so Sol has a spacetime-geopolitical advantage and remains in control. 

        Obviously once someone gains access to something they're not supposed to have, that's when things go off the rails and worldbuilding turns into storytelling.
        ```

- u/Buggy321:
  ```
  To the best of my (not exhaustive) knowledge about relativity and wormholes, you're mostly right about how they behave at relativistic speeds. They basically 'link' reference frames, so if you accelerate one end to high fractional c and look through the other, it will appear to be travelling faster than light. That 2 million lightyear trip could take a subjective 2 years, 10 minutes, or 2 seconds as seen by Earth if you have enough acceleration.


  But the catching point is the time travel. If you take that wormhole that is 2 million years + 2 seconds in the 'future' and slowly move it 3 light-seconds back towards Earth, you get time travel; grab a lasergun on Earth and fire a shot towards the Andromeda end and you'll see the (rather dim) flash through the wormhole a second before you fire.


  Or you *would*, if the wormhole didn't violently explode the very instant it moved more than 2 light-seconds backwards. You see, if you *did* give it a negative time differential and fire a (impossibly accurate) laser through, aiming to loop, the laser would make the journey in negative time, reaching it's origin before it fired. And then there's two lasers instantly. And then four. And then eight. And so on.


  Thankfully, the universe does not get a wave of infinite mass-energy expanding at the speed of light. Rather, the wormhole just collapses. But it collapses *instantly* as soon as this becomes possible; virtual particles are a omnipresent bitch, and will instantly do this as soon as there is *any* space-time path with negative length, regardless of how many wormholes are involved or how complex the path is. You don't get a endless source of energy that is stable so long as you avoid a infinitely looping path.


  I'm not sure if stable time loops are a option, though. You have authorial fiat of course, so do as you will, just keep in mind that non-looping time travel is a bad thing; the most charitable interpretation is infinite free energy and replication, the least is a light-speed wave of universen't.

  A lot hinges on SolGov performing its role seamlessly. Perhaps a slight exception to the advanced-AI ban is the only thing allowing them to maintain supremacy vs acausal threats. 

  This reminds me a lot of Singularity Sky already though. Not that that's a bad thing. Always thought it was a shame the author forwent the third novel because he couldn't resolve the paradoxes.
  ```

- u/Geminii27:
  ```
  Out of curiosity, is there anything preventing a wormhole endpoint through a wormhole? I would have thought that the very first thing that would have been sent through a long-distance wormhole, once it was established, would be a couple dozen more endpoints which replicate the just-established tunnel, so that if something happened to the original there would be plenty of backups.

  Admittedly, this wouldn't really break anything except the potential to have "O noes we are stranded" plots. And even then, you could technically have them if the first set of endpoints at a location were ALL destroyed or otherwise rendered unable to be used.

  Another question - you're talking about endpoints which, when in operation, might go between stars, planets, planet-to-moon, and so forth, as well as between local systems and interstellar spaceships in flight. Presumably, this means that endpoints do not have to remain fixed in space (if that's even possible given the way spacetime can warp) with respect to each other. What happens when you have two connected endpoints on two ships of equal mass which are traveling away from each other at 0.5c, and you start passing mass from one ship to the other through the hole? What do observers on each ship see? What do external observers see?
