  Sweet!

  ...

  Aw.  It felt rather short and ended on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Still, I loved the parts that were written.

  New instalment in Sam Hughes' Antimemetics series, chronologically taking place after [*Your Last First Day*](http://www.scp-wiki.net/your-last-first-day). You may know the author by his [*Ra*](https://qntm.org/ra) and [*Fine Structure*](https://qntm.org/structure) novels. See also:

  * [**Antimemetics Division Hub**](http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub), containing links to the original series (*There Is No Antimemetics Division*, complete) and to the sequel (*Five Five Five Five Five*, in-progress).

  But most importantly:

    Ugh, don't post that crap here.

    If the Infinite Library learns that Earth Aleph has been infected by a memetic threat, the Council of Ricks will let the Andalites blow the planet up before we can finish evacuating humanity to the mirror of Erised.

    Remember, monorealitism saves lives. Only through metaphysical isolation will we remain safe. Report any suspicious imagery to your local Cohesion Overseer.

    Looks like New Reddit has stopped putting titles on old-style hacked CSS spoiler links.

    **Edit**: I had assumed that the user was trying to actually display a spoiler, not display a no-spoiler-text spoiler. The old spoilers were a CSS hack, and might not have worked even on the Old Reddit.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      Ah, I see. Just another thing ruined by the redesign.

      ^((I replaced it with a boring unicode version.)^)
      ```

      - u/Justausername1234:
        ```
        The spoiler tag is >! !< on all reddit platforms (old, new, and mobile)

        For example:

        >!Spoilers go in here!<
        ```

        - u/Noumero:
          ```
          No, I know that. It isn't fit for my purposes, unfortunately. I wasn't marking a spoiler, I was trying to "paint" a larger version of █ using old spoiler tags, like this:

          [ ](#s " ")[ ](#s " ")[ ](#s " ")  
          [ ](#s " ")[ ](#s " ")[ ](#s " ")  
          [ ](#s " ")[ ](#s " ")[ ](#s " ")  
          [ ](#s " ")[ ](#s " ")[ ](#s " ")

          You can't do the same with the new tags, they get divided:

          >!     !<  
          >!     !<  
          >!     !<
          ```

  Off-topic but any recommendations for good SCP series (rather than standalone stories)?  I never got that into them before but this series has me craving more.

    There's [Visions of a Better World](http://www.scp-wiki.net/visionsofabetterworld) which is about the myriad ways that munchkining the SCPs would likely fail and is implied to have had happened in the past to teach the Foundation a lesson.
    ```

    Um. . . I'm not sure many are as rational friendly, but most of what I've seen of quality series is in the lol !Foundation genre.  The more rational friendly arcs are often embedded without a cannon hub 
     Thaddius Xyank's tales  from  FortuneFavorstheBold (The guy who wrote the Thamiel reboot all of humanity printer) has a fun time travel exploration [Iteration 0](http://www.scp-wiki.net/iteration-0)  There's a amazing lone immortal tale of Dr. Bright talking about how he is the foundation that I think predates Watts deep time linelayer series but I don't remember the title.


    I'm mostly chiming in here in hopes that someone suggests a hub that I've missed and will appreciate.


    I probably didn't give you quite what you want.  What type of tale or aggregation of hypothetical cannon are you looking for?  If nothing else reading the SCP-1 proposals are usually a good way to find things you might like in the overarching narratives there.

    All of the other tales I remember reading have been pretty bad.
