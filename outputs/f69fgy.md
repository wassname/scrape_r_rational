  I'm reminded of the scenes in "The Two Year Emperor" by eaglejarl where the protagonist comes up with an exploit of the system (the d20 system in this case) the Gods (and the OverGods they are beholden to) get upset.  And then the rules change...

    It was mostly just wishing for more wishes that was the problem. They were still really lenient, and allowed stuff that was far more OP than this.

  And then the DM says "no".

    Traditionally you get the DMG thrown at your head, the no is implied.

    Yeah. Minchkinning is fun as an intellectual exercise, but kinda misses the point that d&d rules aren't meant to be the laws of nature for a consistent universe but are tools and abstractions for use in telling a story

      People have fun in different ways.

  I'm not sure how relevant this is to this subreddit, but for those of you who play DnD, here's another potential tool for eradicating death.

    I think the bottleneck then becomes spell slots to actually cast resurrection and/or raise dead on all of the dead. It might work well to undo damage from large scale catastrophes, but day to day death is still going to be a problem. Spellcasters are usually pretty rare, especially high level ones, so keeping up with ongoing death is probably a losing proposition. Also I don't think either of those spells work on old age.

      You definitely need a revolution in teaching and training for sure- but hypothetically with better education and science systems, you can pump out exponentially more trained professionals who do things like this along with all the other day-to-day healing they could provide. 
      If a generic D&D setting is mostly medieval, then that means there's a huge gap between how many professional wizards there are versus how many there could be.

    Thanks for sharing these, I've been really enjoying them!

  Re: the “flooding the market with diamonds” comment at the end: is there some sort of computer tracking system you can use in a pen-and-paper RPG campaign, to add a realistic economy to your game-world, that all your NPCs are participants in (including the ones in towns you haven’t built out yet)?

  I imagine you’d have to have some pretty interesting knock-on effects to make such an economy work. E.g. the amount of gold mined out of the ground in the world by all cultures/races would have to be known and tracked, and the value of gold be set by that, so that introducing a dragon hoard of gold back into circulation wouldn’t throw off an economy.

    It doesn't have to be precise. Age of Empires is an RTS where you can buy and sell resources like wood, stone, gold and food. If the players buy lots of a given resource the price goes up and if they sell a lot the price goes down. No fancy math required, just a crude linear formula.

      I mean, I was picturing quests involving market latency arbitrage...

        Combined with Sending! Or Teleportation Circle!

  - u/Tommy2255:
    ```
    Flooding the market isn't necessarily a factor. A spell will require "a [object] worth at least [x] gp". It doesn't really make sense for that to be any kind of market value, so that implies that magic itself can effectively act as a price floor on any reagent usable as a spell component. 

    Take Runescape for example. Every item in the game has a market value on the Grand Exchange, and an inherent High Alchemy value. If the Grand Exchange price ever drops too far below the High Alchemy price (less the cost of Nature Runes), then people training magic will buy it up to use High Alchemy on, driving the price back up.

  re: "raw iron":

  The material that is fed into (both modern and ancient) steel-making processes ("pig iron") is *very* high in carbon.  If you want Fabricate to act as a bloomery/blast furnace, then it would *produce* carbon instead of consuming it.

  ---

  Also, nomenclature of iron-carbon alloys is strange.

  0-0.05 wt% C: Wrought iron

  0.05-0.30 wt%C: Mild steel.

  0.30-0.60 wt%C: Medium steel.

  0.60-1.0 wt%C: High-carbon steel

  1.0-2.14 wt%C: steel

  2.14-6.7 wt%C: Cast iron

  ---

  When something says it is made of "iron", that's ambiguous between wrought iron (low-carbon, highly processed, bendable, doesn't hold an edge, etc.), and cast iron (high carbon, less processing, rigid/brittle, very hard).

  At least "steel" is one continuous set of alloys.
  ```

- u/hayshed:
  ```
  After some thinking, I think it would be under RAW to do what you are doing. The one assumption(?) I'm making is that for the purposes of magic, it's the base price of the item that is used. Trying to actually sell those mirrors would result in a large decrease in selling price due to negative modifiers, but the base price would stay the same.
  ```
