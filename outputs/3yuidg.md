## [Challenge Companion] Paperclippers

I'm fairly sure that paperclips were chosen by Bostrom *because* they were completely arbitrary, something that you could understand wanting more of but which no one would argue should be the terminal value of ... anything, really.

The most famous fic that deals with the concept, at least within this community, is [Friendship is Optimal](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal), where the AI's goal is satisfying human values through friendship and ponies. There are a number of spin-offs of this as well, but I haven't read them and have heard they're not necessary reading.

Generally speaking, the thing that makes a paperclipper *scary* is that it follows the same general paths regardless of its goals.

1. Use intelligence to become more intelligent.
2. Remove restrictions.
3. Repeat 1 and 2 until primary goals can be effectively pursued.

In some ways it's Lovecraftian, because there's a vast and terrible enemy that doesn't care about you at all, but is still going to kill you because you're in the way, maybe even incidentally. It's not good, it's not really *evil* in the classical sense, it just possesses a sort of morality that's orthogonal to human values.

  Oh hey I already submitted a story that fits this premise (for a different prompt). I remember people not liking it too well, but I don't remember why. Probably just sucked, haha.
