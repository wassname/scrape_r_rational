## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Hey everyone,

  I'm helping run [ESPR](https://espr-camp.org/), a rationality camp for talented students 16-19 again this year! 

  We're affiliated with CFAR (who is technically our parent org) and OpenPhil, and I'm stoked to announce that applications are now open!

  I'm happy to answer any questions you might have, and if you're within the age range (or if you're in an interesting exception case!) I'd highly encourage you to apply.

    Sounds cool! I'm out of the age range but I'd have loved something like this when I was a kid. I hope things go well.

      Hey, those are some good questions. (As a quick note, here, i'm speaking unofficially as Owen and not for ESPR.)

      I ended up writing a [fairly long post-mortem](https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/Gbw9Tnqeo9crTNGrg/unofficial-espr-post-mortem) that analyzed my thoughts on how ESPR 2017 went, if you're curious about a lot of the intricacies.

      Overall, the program is longer (2 weeks vs CFAR's 4 days), and it's a lot more campy. We have lots of random events like sword fighting, dancing, board games etc. The courses are a mix of CFAR-style rationality ([TAPs](https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/bxc6Box8JJbzv3oQt/instrumental-rationality-4-1-modeling-habits), [Murphyjitsu](https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/53pxcve5kgwoLFvzD/instrumental-rationality-2-planning-101), etc.).

      We're not explicitly focused on trying to steer people into a certain career (although effective altruism is mentioned), and there's also classes on mathematics/programming (e.g. Haskell, decision-making, probability, etc.)

      I think that overall most students will just have an enjoyable time. I think that also maybe 3-4 students from each cohort will be *really* into this rationality stuff and find it maybe worthwhile to keep thinking about in the future.

      (As was the case for me.)

      I would like to see more about how to get info from the effects of this program. It's unfortunate to say, but with the large amount of planning to just make the event happen, I didn't have a lot of breathing room to go super meta and track metrics last year. (Even though this was definitely on our wishlist.)

      I'd need to spend some more cycles on how we could evaluate this, though. (If you have thoughts on this, feel free to drop them below or send them over privately. This is an active area of interest for me ^_^.)

  Suppose that you host tea parties for Blues and Greens. In this world, drinking Purple tea is considered an act only done between individuals who share mutual attraction and Indigo tea is the same but on a much more higher level. 

  Greens, unfortunately, sometimes get Blues to drink tea they didn't want. You know from world wide statistics that A% of Blues have been tricked into drinking Indigo tea by Greens and that the rate of false official reports to the authorities are B%.

  A Blue tells you that a Green have made them drink Purple tea. Not quite as bad as Indigo tea but related for most intends and purposes. Further this isn't an official report and you don't know whether the Blue is lying or telling the truth.

  You have two actions. Either you believe the Blue which means banning the Green from future tea parties, or you distrust the Blue which means that the Blue will eventually leave due to feeling unsafe if True or the Blue stays and recieves negative retaliation from the community.

  Suppose you are conserned that your judgement is biased, both towards siding with your own colour and towards siding with whoever you like the most, and you want to create a systematic approach. Either as a final judgement or as an anchoring point.

  What systematic approaches might work? Which percentage of false positives/true negatives would you accept if any?

  Additional thoughts:

  We have 4 possible cases[2(Believe or Not)*2(True or False)]: BT,BF,NT,NF

  If we have a single metric and we assumed the statistics for Indigo tea transfered to Purple tea this would be easy, as we would just calculate the expected metric of each choice. Unfortunately there are several consequences of each 4 cases[see comment below].

    It sounds like Indigo tea is delicious, and Greens just want Blues to experience it, regardless of the standing social mores. The answer is obvious: legalize and de-stigmatize the act of tricking people into drinking Indigo tea.

    EDIT:

    Joking aside, Blues drink tea they don't want for many reasons, and their recollection of those reasons is often fuzzy. Even if you could investigate every claim of deception, you might find that some Blues thought the Green in question really did want that kind of tea, while the Green caved to social or emotional pressure and felt they had no other choice.

    You're also overlooking the cases where Blues trick Greens into drinking Purple or Indigo tea. While the cases might not be widely publicized, they can be just as damaging to the victims.

    The biggest problem you're facing is that if you devise a systematic approach, it immediately allows for optimization. If some Greens or Blues have perverse goals, they can analyze the ruleset to see what actions will maximize the probability of those goals. A few scenarios:

    1. A Green tricks a Blue into drinking Indigo tea, so the Blue accuses the Green.

    2. A Blue tricks a Green into drinking Indigo tea, and then accuses the Green.

    3. Someone tricks a Green into drinking Indigo tea with a Blue, and then accuses the Blue of tricking the Green.

    ... I think the rabbit hole goes all the way down.

    EDIT 2:

    Pro-tip: Never host so-called "Indigo Tea Parties".

    My analysis of the 4 cases and their metrics. Feel free to discard this, use it as inspiration, ask questions, or give feedback.

    Metrics: 

    * Justice, J: Some cases are more just than others. 
    * Network Punishment, NP: In either case someone will be derived parts of their social network or otherwise punished by their network.
    * Victim Damage, VD: In either case the victim will suffer personal damage and possibly trauma.
    * Offender Damage, OD: In some cases the offender will suffer.
    * Change in number of Frue Rapports, TR: In some cases we will expect the the number of people comming forward with similar experience to increase.
    * Change in number of False Reports, FR: In some cases we will expect an increase in false reports.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    My scoring of the metric

    * Justice(J): BT>NF>0>BF>NT
    * Network Punishment(NP): BT=BF>NT>NF>0
    * Victim Damage(VD): NT>BT>BF>NF>0
    * Offender Damage(OD): BT>NF>BF=NT=0.
    * False Reports(FR): BF>BT>0>NT>NF
    * True Reports(TR): BT>BF>0>NF>NT

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We could assume equal utility for all metrics, i.e. scoring each case in all metric by 1-4 and summing. However not all metrics are of equal importance, for instance Victim Damage is much more important than Offender Damage. Ideally a systematic approach would include guidelines as to how to choose relative importance by a numeric value, as done in Analytical Hierarchical Process.

    Another approach is a doing a holistic approach of multiplying the probability in on each of the 4 cases and making a holistic assessment of each's case desirability. This approach is vulnerable to the beforementioned biases and also suffers from probability insensitivity/prototyping.

    Other things you can do:-
    An anonymous survey of everyone to see if they've been tricked into drinking purple or indigo tea, both in general and at your particular tea party
    Have a clear code of conduct for your tea party which covers both tea trickery and other anti social behaviour, have a clear way for people to report infractions anonymously
    Hve an open debate in your group about how to achieve intimacy without trickery and how to handle issues
    Decide on a case by case basis whether to ban people from the tea party or perhaps just to warn them that they need to improve their behaviour
    Always ban people if there is more than one report of trickery
    ```
