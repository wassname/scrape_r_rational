## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Companion Chronicles](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.57643/) is *technically* a multicross fanfiction, specifically a jumpchain if you know what that is, but I think it would be more thematically accurate to call it original fiction set in a jumpchain setting. It's the only jumpchain I've read more than 100 words of, and it's... different.

  I don't think it's exaggerating too much to say that Companion Chronicles is to the jumpchain genre as Worth the Candle is to the isekai/SI genre.

  A jumpchain is, as I understand it, a structured multicross where the protagonist ("jumper") is imported into a fictional setting for a number of years at a time, with selectable perks, drawbacks and objectives on import (similar to the Worm CYOA, which some may be more familiar with). Once the failure or success condition is met, or time is up, the "jump" concludes and the "jumper" is transported to the next setting to do it all again, with an intermission in between to recuperate. The jumper keeps the abilities between settings, and may bring characters from settings with them as "companions", which can also go into settings with them and accumulate abilities themselves. If you think this sounds a whole lot like powerwank wish-fulfilment fantasy, you're right.

  This story is an attempt to deconstruct all of that.

  Companion Chronicles is not about the jumper. It's about Cassandra, a new companion who chooses to leave their (author-invented) setting and follow the actual jumper on their Doctor Whoesque wacky journey that has been underway for centuries. And she knows what a jumpchain *is*, which works to both her advantage and detriment, because there are tropes and genre conventions that aren't exactly a *good idea*.

  Companion Chronicles is about many things. It's about how struggles to reconcile free will and the knowledge that she's the younger version of a anime character from a franchise most people she meets have seen (note that she leaves her seemingly baseline world years *before* nations starts building giant battle-mechas to wage international war, so her own setting sounds to her exactly like the incredibly dumb anime plot that it is, about dealing with her complex motivations, history and traumas boiled down to tropes on a cast list and continuity errors retconned into lore. It's about the morality of intervention (think Prime Directive; her first jump after leaving her homeworld being *Worm* just pre-locker probably already tells you a lot) and about the consequences of indulgence in power fantasy, which are very real and explored with a heavy hand. It's about narrative and predicting the game master. It's about identity and the consequences of functional immortality. To a large extent, it's also about the personal journey of Cassandra, who's a three-dimensional character in her own right instead of a blank slate like the majority of authorial inserts, and about a continuous struggle to look past the tropes and conventions of a plot she knows to the people behind. The comparisons to WtC write themselves, and I mean that in the best way possible. 

  As of right now, Companion Chronicles has finished Cassandra's first two jumps: 10-years in Worm, which taken alone would be a novel-length Worm SI better than most I've read, and a foray into Star Trek which has a lower word count but still packs a punch. It updates roughly weekly with 5-10k chapters. It is severely underrated and receives nowhere near the amount of traffic it should, which is a huge shame.

    Worth noting this author-invented setting is still IRL - the fictional work of fiction is set several decades in the future, but Cassandra is from approximately our time.
    ```

  - u/Judah77:
    ```
    This is from the third paragraph, first chapter:  "Then my mind caught up to the fact that he’d called me Cassandra; less than a dozen people knew to call me that. I wiped a bit of hollandaise sauce off my chin, feeling extraordinarily self-conscious of the stubble I hadn’t bothered to shave that morning. Having someone call me ‘Cassandra’ "

    I can't picture the main character.  Are they a woman who needs to shave, MTF trans, or man with a woman's name?  One of my big issues with stories that are supposed to be so character-centric ... describe the MC!  If it's supposed to be a great Cassandra based story, not telling me enough about Cassandra the cat-owner is not going to keep me reading.

    Edit:  Chapter 2, MTF trans.  MC goes on a gender identity rant.  Those types of stories are not for me.
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      It's an SI - a real one. The author is trans.
      ```

    - u/jiffyjuff:
      ```
      The MC goes on a "gender identity rant" because another character (because of cultural ignorance) called her a trap. It's an *in-character* rant, and even calling it that is arguably a stretch. It's an expositionaty device to highlight culture clash and the personalities of the interacting people.

      The story isn't a soapbox for the author's "SJW" rants, if that's what you—or anyone else reading—is worried about. The vast majority of the text doesn't focus on sexual or gender identity. Because of superpowers bullshit, Cassandra cheats past most of the transitioning "experience". Companion Chronicles is not a trans story. But the viewpoint character is MtF, and it's a part of her character, and as the other replier said, an element of the SI true to the author.

      If you're simply not interested in reading social justice rants (a term I'm not really comfortable using because of the belittling connotation, but it conveys the concept), you won't have any problems with the story. *Pick a random chapter, and it's going to be people strategizing on how to solve problems, effect societal change and beat each other up—not gender counseling and pride parades.*

      If you're just uncomfortable reading from a MtF viewpoint, the character is biologically female for most of the story, and it's not like the narration is drawing any attention to it otherwise.

        >!I mean the entire Star Trek jump kinda was a trans metaphor, which, again, is commented on in-character.!<  It's a really fascinating story because of how it plays with narrative tropes and adapts the story to each setting.

          ```
          >!That part was fascinating because it's not as much an allegory as a *story about allegories*, and the subject being a trans metaphor is merely Management making it in-character for Cassandra. I would argue that despite having transness being a plot element, the arc isn't *really* a trans story since the themes and moral of that arc aren't about identity, fear, bigotry etc., but about agency, narrative and tropes as you said—and also about how changes in circumstance and opportunities can lead to disconnect from a community, and how societal change can lead to the obsolescence and fading of such communities, which are again widely general.!<
          ```

      - u/tobias3:
        ```
        The problem is that its a probably a million year old character (Homura) that's supposed to not know that calling someone a "trap" is offensive.  
        The Doylist reasoning is that the author wanted an opportunity to put some gender issues into the fiction. That is all fine as long as it makes sense \_in universe\_. The author's work is even harder here since it is an author insert, so the default assumption is that the author shapes the story to the author's whim which breaks SOD, which makes the story unfun. This is even acknowledged at the beginning, but that doesn't make it better.
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          I haven't read the fic, but it's totally possible to be a million year old insensitive asshole.

          Edit: I read up until this part, and it's Homura from Madoka. I can definitely see her being a million year old high schooler, because that's what she is. 

          It's roughly equivalent to someone from the mid-90s referring to gay men with the British term for cigarettes - back then it wasn't particularly polite either, but it was also super common (particularly in high school).
          ```

          - u/CreationBlues:
            ```
            And, if anything, a million year old asshole would be far more stubborn and resistant to change than your racist grandma catherine.
            ```

        - u/jiffyjuff:
          ```
          You make a good point, but it doesn't break SoD that much for me. Homura spent most of her life in anime Japan reliving permutations of the exact same events over and over, so it's not surprising that she didn't pick up "Western values". She's characterized as deliberately antisocial to her jumpchain peers in an attempt to not form attachments, and is hyperfocused on specific goals, *and* most settings don't deal with (modern human-style) gender etiquette anyway. If she really is a million years old, it's implausible, I agree, but it's also implausible that a million-year-old person would mentally and socially functional in any way, so...

          Edit: it's also possible that she knows the "correct" way of addressing a trans person, but doesn't realize that using "trap" is significantly offensive, because again—she doesn't talk to people much, and you only know something is offensive when you're called out or you see someone else called out for it.
          ```

      - u/zorianteron:
        ```
        It's tribalism.  If I read something and get the impression the author is from a different tribe than me, and wearing it on their sleeve/putting it in the work, it creates distrust of the story as a whole.

        The above written isn't exactly right; I can't properly put it into words.  But there's some vague feeling I can't quite identify that is, I think, why people react this way.

        This was written by a person, but text is compressed and lossy.  Decompression, reading, necessarily requres some simulation of the mind of the author.  That's probably part of it; your model of the author/speaker/narrator informs the interpretation of the entire rest of the text.

  [Brand New Animal] (https://myanimelist.net/anime/40060/BNA) is a rational, pro-transhumanism anime.

  "Wait, what?" You might be tempted to say. BNA is obviously an irrational, rule of cool Trigger anime with a side plot about discrimination, just like zootopia or beastars.

  Wrong! Without exception, every character in BNA makes choices based on their values, skills, and goals, rather than mere plot necessity. Even the characters that are obviously irrational (comic relief slum bears) are irrational for clearly explained, deep seated socioeconomic reason. Plans are made with fallbacks and neither the heroes nor the villains are stupid. There are 'unfair' coincidences (typically, characters meeting each other at convenient times), but these coincidences could have easily been replaced, as every major event in the story would have had character-driven reasons to still happen. So even the 'irrational' parts are justifiable, as they happen for storytelling reasons rather than "move the plot ahead" reasons.

  Yes, the fight scenes involve throwing lasers around and friendship based powerups. But these powerups match the enemy unfair powerups beat for beat, so a fight's winner is still who you'd expect to win at the beginning of a fight based on levels of athleticism and training (combat or otherwise.) 

  Finally, we have the issue of the 'technology' used. It would deserve a spot on tvtropes 'artistic license - genetics' page, except that it's very clearly sufficiently analyzed magic. It works in a self-consistent manner, and technological upgrades are foreshadowed.

  So now that I've explained why BNA is rational, I'm going to explain why I reccommend it. And to an extent, that recommendation depends on the 'Death of the Author.' I made an earlier assertion that BNA wasn't concerned, thematically, with discrimination. But it does, in fact have a pretty lukewarm but unobjectionable anti-discrimination theme (it's a bit of a broken aesop for a few reasons, but I can' t go into why without spoilers.) But, probably by accident, it manages to have a very strong pro-transhumanism stance. Most anime about the future shoehorn in some sort of "technology can have drawbacks" or "we need to be careful not to lose our humanity" subplots. BNA goes very much in the opposite direction. Can't say too much because that would be spoiling the plot, but BNA is of the opinion that genetic modification is awesome, people should have whatever bodies they want, and being something other than human would be pretty damn cool.

  And of course, the characters are likeable, it got some genuine laughs from me, and (as with any trigger anime) the fights are awesome.

  It does have one YMMV drawback-- namely, that it is unapolagetically furry. But I would recommend it to non-furries despite that (as it wasn't made for the furry fandom, it just happens to fall directly into their wheelhouse.)

  Wildbow has started his new webserial [**Pale**](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/), which is set in the [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/) universe, but, crucially, does *not* require people to have read Pact before.

  It seems set up to be different from the stories Wildbow has written so far, from what he mentioned he wants to keep this one short (so probably just like one or three normal books' worth of content), and it's told in 3rd person perspective, switching between at least three main characters.

  The writing is atmospheric, I already like the setting, a small Canadian town for which Wildbow has even provided [a brochure including a map](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/05/07/brochure-experience-kennet/). The main plot seems to be a murder mystery with supernatural elements.

  These three main characters are the most childlike Wildbow has written so far; they're three normal (not magical) girls around 13 years old. (Technically, the Lambs were younger, but >!they were trained assassins and don't at all compare to these three!<). So I don't think we'll see them be competent badasses on the scale Wildbow's protagonists usually are.

  Hello all. I hope youre all staying well in this time of quarantine.

  Due to only working every other week I have been burning through my lists of books and fanfics.

  I just finished Baru Cormorant and was hoping for something similar to it. I have the sequel lined up to read and will probably finish that today or tomorrow.

  Id love some fanfica of boku no hero of similar quality to [From Muddy Waters](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13933635/chapters/32073363). Ive read the My Hero School is Going Wrong, As Expected mash up. I want whatever youve got that's good quality and either updating regularly or finished. No dead works please.

  Additionally I just finished my reread of Dune. Are the sequels worth reading? Ive heard mixed reviews on them and dont want to read them if they spoil the excellence that was Dune.

  Additionally Id like to recommend an anime that has kept me motivated to be active during the quarantine. How Heavy Are the Dumbbells That You Lift? Is not rational but motivating with interesting characters that all become interested in working out at a fascimile of Gold's Gym. It's light and uplifting and always gets me pumped to do an at at home workout.

  - u/Roneitis:

    WRT Dune, I'm gonna recommend the first 4. They successively get more and more complex, and take more and more effort to fully parse, but IMO they're worth it. They go deeper and deeper into the horrific tragedy that is the existence of prescience, and the fourth concludes in the only way it possibly could. 

    You can pretty much stop after any if you get tired, and I wouldn't say that any of these spoil the first. (I cannot say the same for the later books).

    That said, I found that it's taking me many re-reads to feel like I fully grasp them, but each re-read I feel like I 'get' one more of them. (I finished my 3rd re-read mid-2019, and finally felt like I understood the 2nd. The 3rd will have to wait for next time).

    I will /also/ rec some of Frank Herbert's other works, including my second favourite book of all time: The Godmakers, which is set in a totally different universe, but goes deeper into his explorations of society and it's relationship with religion, but is much shorter, and IMO, tighter. (He also has the Jesus Incident, which is good, but not as good as Dune.

    Dune Messiah(2) is great IMO, but it does tarnish some beloved characters, which is why I feel it gets a bad rap. People get attached to characters and dislike it when they get torn down. 

    Children of Dune (3) and God Emperor of Dune (4) are both amazing, and are the 2 sequels that are almost universally praised. 4 is especially mind-bending and original. Again, Herbert was certainly not afraid of upsetting the apple cart, maybe because he had that fuck you money by then. 

    Dune 5 and 6 are not as bad as people say, but they do have a lot of issues. I still don't know what Herbert was going for, and it's a shame he never really got to complete his vision. 

    As to the other books (prequels, sequels, spinoffs) written by his son, they really don't deserve to be even mentioned in the same conversation as the originals. I can't think of a more disrespectful thing that has ever been done to a father's legacy than what they did with those novels. It's the equivalent of trying to pass off a 2 year old's play doh mashing next to Michelangelo's David. I sometimes fantasize of an afterlife so I can imagine Frank reuniting with his jagoff son and beating the everloving shit out of him with jumper cables until he got it out of his system. Like for a decade or two.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      The problem with 5 and 6 is that while you have a complete story after the first book, or after the first three, or the first four (I personally think that *Messiah* isn't complete without *Children*, but wouldn't argue the point), you can't really say that about the first five or even all six Frank Herbert Dune books.  *Heretics* and *Chapterhouse* clearly switch from entries with their own conclusions, into more of a multi-book build-up towards some never-written conclusion.  If nothing else, they suffer for that: they're *incomplete*.

      As for the Brian Herbert books...  I think the *ideas* in them were based on his Father's notes, which he gained access to at some point after the *Prelude to Dune* series (*House Atriedes*, *Harkonnen*, *Corrino*) were written.  You can see it in the way that the *Prelude* series has many more continuity issues than the far-past *Legends of Dune* prequels (Butlerian Jihad, Machine Crusade, Battle of Corrin), or Dune 7 (*Hunters* and *Sandworms*) do.  Heck, it's hard to reconcile *Prelude* and *Legends* into the same universe, despite being by the same authors.

      So, if it's the *plotline* that you don't like in *Legends* or Dune 7, that's probably Frank's fault.

      However, the execution by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson is poor enough that it's hard to say if the ideas would have worked to bring the series to the conclusion it deserved if they were written competently.
      ```

    For Baru Cormorant, do you mean the politics, the intrigue, or the themes? 

    Ah, I personally didn’t like the 2nd book in the Dune series and I never read the rest but I’ve heard that the prequel series was pretty good. 

    Two my hero academia fics I enjoyed that are both finished were yesterday upon the stairs and Hero Class Civil War

    Yesterday upon the stair is a story where Deku has a quirk that that he keeps hidden that lets him see and interact with ghosts. It doesn’t have much use in combat, at first anyway, but seeing all the death, past victims of villains, and the presence of a ghost girl who seems to have adopted him have made Deku much more mature and competent. He is a little traumatized but in a realistic way and he is very ruthless with villains as he can literally interact with their past victims and his classmates admit he can be a little scary when he is focused. 

    Hero Class Civil War shows a class activity where the class is split into two teams. One who will be playing the role of heroes, led by "Paragon" and the other playing the role of villains, led by "Kingpin." Bakugou is acting as Paragon, while Deku is the Kingpin. There is a lot of great strategy and action, people having fun in villain roles, and it shows how scary Midoriya could be if he was a villain.

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    In the Dune series I'd recommend reading the first three books by Frank Herbert: *Dune*, *Dune Messiah*, and *Children of Dune*.

    In comparison to the first book, *Dune Messiah* and *Children of Dune* have plots that aren't as fast paced or finely focused on the goals of a single character, but it my opinion they still have plenty of action, intrigue and suspense woven in with fascinating worldbuilding. Their outlook on the world created by Muad'Dib's victory is much bleaker, but also more nuanced than the relatively simple 'good guys win' ending of the first book.

  Just for those who like meaty worldbuilding stuff, check out [A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry](https://acoup.blog/).  It's a relatively new blog by a historian that (among other things) dissects pop-culture depictions of ancient and medieval war and politics.  He kicked it off with a six-part analysis of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields from LOTR (he concludes that--in the book--both Denethor and the Witch King are excellent strategists).  Right now he's marking the anniversary by looking at Helm's Deep.  I find it all very fun and informative.  Give it a look!

    Why are so many blogs designed so badly these days? Surely the standard way to consume this sort of blog is to start at the earliest post and read posts that interest you in order, but there is no way to do this on most blogs. There is just a pointless reverse chronological feed, and even more pointless tag cloud. This  author at least has index posts, but obtusely labels them 'Resources for World-Builders' and presents them in 'no particular order.' If you haven't read for six months and want to see what's new, there is no way. Maddening.

    Here are a few Naruto SI fics that avoid Mary Suedom by virtue of the SI living a civilian life:

      They're an exercise in exploring a story's world, characters, and plot.

      When you read a novel, do you ever wonder what you would do in a character's place? Are frustrated at the actions characters do or don't take? Wish the author had explored some aspect of the setting more fully?

      IMO, they're one of the ultimate forms of rational writing. By their nature, SIs are inherently more rational than the original work.

          'The problem'? I'm not sure what problem you're alluding to.

          If you're interested, there are fanfics where the SI has no or very little knowledge of the fictional universe. And of course, fanfics and spinoffs of other fanfics, including of HPMOR. I haven't read many of those, though, so I'm not sure if there's any SIs into fanfic universe, though it wouldn't surprise me.

          My favorite SI stories by a long shot are the ones where the author inserts an alternative version of themselves that is like they would be, but with a selective amnesia that removes all knowledge of the setting from the SI's mind. In "With This Ring" for instance a dude wakes up with an orange power ring in the world of the Young Justice tv show. He knows quite a lot about the DC universe but is completely stumped by all the things that are different in that show when compared to any of the comics and doesn't have any real future knowledge either.

    Delve has a bit of this. The MC pursues a build that'a considered so weak it's only used by slaves in most parts of the world.
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      Technically it's a support build which is invaluable; it's just not strong at doing things by itself.  The problem is the entire culture of the world means nobody goes with support builds.

      Which makes me want to tear out my hair even though it's 100% accurate as an MMO player.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Seems like there should be a market for support roles, doesn't it? They should be the equivalent of diving welders on Earth--highly trained and extremely well-paid for dangerous and undesirable work.
        ```

        - u/xachariah:
          ```
          In a functioning world, you're totally right.  Undesirable role so the reward grows until people are willing to fill it.

          The smart thing about the setting though is that Delve's world is in decline.  The story doesn't bash you over the head with it like Worm or something, but there's little hints sprinkled all over.  The big magical Empire fell a long long time ago but the world has never stopped sliding.  Fel Sedanis is smaller than it used to be (the whole city fits with room to spare inside the shield dome now), or the remaining platinums are too few in number to raise another person to plat (if they could even get along to do so), the Watch doesn't patrol so far out.  

          And in this context, it makes sense.  If you're in a state of uncertainty, you *can't* afford to go with the economic choice of support.  A support class could be enslaved or robbed.  Hell, the MC himself might have been enslaved if he had useful buffs for the city's leader instead of a different buff path.  Even a 'steady' job is risky, because they can lose their livelyhood charging up teleporter pads all day if their city gets invaded (or just get robbed by a random awakened).  At the very least every awakened needs to be able to run off and hide in the wilderness without dying to trivial monsters, in case the Empire of Adamant comes knocking.  

          It leads to a terrible cycle, because supports really are necessary.  The fewer supports there are, the more shitty things become, which causes fewer supports.  But nobody wants to be a support, because things are just getting worse.

          It makes the MC's unique build actually make sense, because the world really does have a gap and the whole setting is hurting because of it.  It also means he's better as part of a force multiplier in a group, instead of going by himself solo'ing world bosses, which is a significant fail state in many stories.
          ```

          - u/InfernoVulpix:
            ```
            While I agree that Delve's world is in shambles compared to the time of the Majistraal, I wouldn't call it more than *local* decline.  If you treat the Majistraal like Rome, then Rome fell and we're in the Dark Ages, but that just means there's less infrastructure (i.e. smaller towns) and weaker concentrations of power (i.e. no platinumplates), not that the whole world is continuing to decline.

            Getting to Goldplate is a snowball effect.  When you have a party of golds, you can reliably elevate someone to gold.  We see this in the DKE being able to sustain dozens of goldplates, for instance.  The same should apply to platinum, but in this post-Majistraal world there just aren't enough platinums to reliably elevate new people to platinum, so we're stuck with gold as the cap until enough people are lucky enough to make platinum at once and agree to get the snowball rolling.

            The shrinkage of Fel Sadanis is clear too.  The Majistraal had extensive teleportation infrastructure and could sustain a larger city than with just local farms, and while the teleportation arrays still exist they appear to be much less frequently used, meaning Fel Sadanis has to shrink to a sustainable size over time.

            As for supports, while I do think that (outside of the Empire) there are generally fewer than you'd want for a balanced ecosystem, I don't think it's necessarily true that they're *continually* in decline, or that Fel Sadanis is representative of supports around the world.  Fel Sadanis, only playing host to Watch and Guild, essentially has minimal organizational infrastructure/rich and powerful people who can hire supports.  If you wanted to sell your services to a party of Silverplates or a Goldplate or such, you would likely look elsewhere, in the richer cities.

            While the idea that the world is *still* falling apart is admittedly interesting, my priors rest more on the theory that it *has* fallen apart and is now in a stable equilibrium (where Fel Sadanis just happens to be on the sucky end of the scale) and will remain that way until the next big rise, which will set the snowball rolling again and bring platinumplates back to the fore.  It's not implausible that the Adamant Empire has the potential to become such an event, at least if it isn't stopped.
            ```

            - u/xachariah:
              ```
              >my priors rest more on the theory that it has fallen apart and is now in a stable equilibrium

              At the start of the story this is correct, that to everyone living in Fel Sedanis, the decline is ancient history to them.

              Except as we see in the story, they're currently living in history and actively seeing relations between nations worsening while losing more high levels and more infrastructure.
              ```

              - u/InfernoVulpix:
                ```
                True (or true enough, as I suppose someone from the Adamant Empire would say that the world's finally swinging back up as Fecht forges a new empire to rival the Majistraal), though as the decline of the Majistraal and the lost grandeur of the old world is ancient history and we are merely seeing war between geopolitical powers, I would say rather than a world in *decline* that Delve is a world at war, or perhaps a world being devastated.

                Either way, I feel that it's important to distinguish between Fecht's expansionism/the ravages of war and the (probably temporary) decline of the world that came with the fall of the Majistraal.
                ```

          - u/ironistkraken:
            ```
            Also its really hard to start as a support class.  Based on the city of light, it seems most people there awaken and take good skills, but as the level of blue needed to advance increases, fewer and fewer are able to do it.  It would be even harder for pure supports to do so.
            ```

          - u/LazarusRises:
            ```
            Great points! I'd noticed the decline, but hadn't put it together with the disfunctional class status quo. Thanks for this, I'm in the middle of the latest chapter & will be even more immersed now :)

    Two HP SIs I've found in the last couple of weeks and liked (only the second of which is newer, but I haven't seen the former recommended much, if at all):

    -[To The Next](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12560378/1/To-The-Next)  
    -[Ghost of Privet Drive](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13436100/1/Ghost-of-Privet-Drive)
    ```

    - u/sephirothrr:

      I'm not surprised to not see To The Next recommended more, so far it seems like a pretty bland stations of canon fic that nevertheless tries too hard to insert the OC into events. It's far from anything I'd call rational.
      ```

      - u/iftttAcct2:
        ```
        Ah, yes, you're right. It's definitely not a ratfic, and I do remember being peeved that it was still hitting the stations of canon despite the additional character. I still found it a fun read, though.

  ```
  I'm looking for hard copy non-fiction I can buy to broaden my reading. Any recommendation is welcome. As a side question, how much non-fiction do you read vs fiction?
  ```

  - u/Mason-B:
    ```
    One I would recommend that hasn't been yet, that fits the theme of this sub, is [Godel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach). It's an excellent set of dialogs, puzzles, and structural references that can only be done justice in hardback. It focuses on formal systems, communication, intelligence, and their emergent properties but does so in a rather approachable way. It tackles the question of AI.

    Personally I think it pairs well with Eliezer Yudkowsky's Rationality: From AI to Zombies. Both have interesting structures, and they approach similar ideas from radically different directions (very roughly one as self help+psychology series of blogs, the other as history+math textbook with dialogs).
    ```

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    If you enjoy historical non-fiction, I highly recommend Erik Larson's novels:

    [The Devil in the White City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_in_the_White_City) follows the lives of Daniel H. Burnham and others who designed and built the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The story delves into fascinating details about architecture, technology, American culture, and the burgeoning labor movement at the turn of the century. Juxtaposed with the Fair's shining symbol of progress, the story also follows the life of Dr. H. H. Holmes, a notorious conartist and serial killer who murdered most of his victims within the apartment building he owned just 3 miles from the border of the Fair itself.

    [In the Garden of Beasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Garden_of_Beasts) follows the life of the American Ambassador to Germany and his daughter during their stay in Berlin in the year leading up to the Night of the Long Knives. The story examines the reasons why so many warning signs of the coming violence went unheeded, and how even 'good' people got swept up in the seemingly glamorous early days of nationalist fervor in Hitler's Germany.
    ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Normally I try to keep it at a ratio of 3 or 4:1 of fiction to non-fiction(I read a lot). Crucial to my effort is classifying it more broadly as just "learning" rather than non-fiction, that way I can count podcasts, articles, online courses and scientific papers in that category. I also tend to use audiobooks almost exclusively for non-fiction, so that I can listen to books while I walk my dog or do chores. 

    If you want a subreddit thematic rec, try [Rationality: From AI to Zombies](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25131230) by Eliezer Yudkowsky. I'm always amazed at how Eliezer manages to make these dense topics so much more lucid and approachable than they might otherwise be.

    Another good generalist rec is [Thinking, Fast and Loose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) by Daniel Kahneman. It condenses Kahneman's nobel prize winning research into human behavioral science, with an emphasis on cognitive biases and heuristics. It's not the best book on the subject, mostly because it can be dry and seemingly repetitive/overlong, but it's an excellent start, and you're getting it from the horse's mouth.

  I'm looking for dungeon core stories that are more focused on the core figuring out their abilities and experimenting than interacting with companions. I currently follow Blue Core, Dungeon Pearl, and The Core of a Factory, which are all a bit too much on the interacting side of the line than I would like, but well written enough that I don't mind.

  Preferably ones that are currently active, but I'm not too picky.

  Reposting this since people might not have seen this from last weeks thread. A couple recommendations if y'all like "political" style stories. 

  _____

  Here are a couple more politically focused fics that I've enjoyed. They're not solely focused on politics, but the background is political enough that it works. These are pretty popular so there's a good chance you might have read some of these. Hopefully at least one is something you're unfamiliar with.

  **Long Fics** 

  * [To live, live one's passions; to survive, abandon one's passions](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/to-live-live-ones-passions-to-survive-abandon-ones-passions-historical-si-three-kingdoms-era.688912/) - Romance of the Three Kingdom's SI. 3/5. Ongoing

  > This Romance of the Three Kingdom's SI is a decentish fic that does a good job of scratching the political intrigue itch. SI is the eldest son of [Yuan Shao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shao) (Benchu) and is thrust directly into of the most volatile periods of Chinese history. Its biggest flaw is that it's too short, but thankfully it's still ongoing and we can see how the story develops. Tthe story does a fantastic job of balancing between giving the SI the ability to have a significant impact with keeping the SI from being too OP. 

  * [Lelouch of Britannia](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3816236/1/Lelouch-of-Britannia) - Code Geass Fanfic - 140k words. 5/5. Abandoned

  >  This is my favorite Code Geass fanfiction in existence. It's also high up on my list of favorite fanfics of all time. It does a great job of taking the simple premise of a Lelouch who didn't get himself exiled and runs with it. Lelouch does his best to use intellect to navigate the intricacies of Britannian court politics. At times it can get a bit Lelouch OP, but if you can get past that flaw, the story is a delight to read. Special shoutout to the Milly chapter. The author does a great job of capturing her essence and I always have a smile while re-reading that part. It's sadly abandoned, but what we have is beautiful. 

  *  [Whales and Unicorns](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whales-and-unicorns-a-skagosi-si-asoiaf.600800/) - ASOIAF Self Insert Fanfic - 260k words. 5/5. Abandoned

  > This story does a fantastic job of toeing the line between uplift fic and political fic. I have a healthy amount of cynicism regarding uplift fics since they tend to be extremely unrealistic. The SI often is greatest engineer/scientist to ever live who also has perfect memory of every useful piece of historical science knowledge possible resulting in what best can be described as uplift porn than anything resembling a story. 

  > Thankfully this story does a great job of being fairly realistic regarding what a single human with very little power in the grand scheme of things can accomplish. Skagos improves, but it doesn't become the center of all human civilization. The political storylines tend to be more background, but when they are front and center the storylines are quite well written. Abandoned, but worth a read for sure.

  * [The Onrushing Storm](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-onrushing-storm-history-just-before-ww2-si.604261/) - Historical SI into Ireland's President Pre-WW2. 120k words. 4/5. Abandoned

  > This is a really fun fiction. The SI merges with the President of the Irish Free-States pre-WW2. With what power he has, he does what he can to prepare the Irish nation for what's about to happen. This includes basic war prep, implementing new economic policies, improving Ireland's development, immigration policies, ect. It toes the line between uplift and political. The biggest criticism of this fic is that it seems to stick to a historical deterministic perspective. That whatever the SI does, WW2 and the genocide of the Jewish people is inevitable and all the Si can do is minimize the devastation. Other than that, it's still a fun fiction that takes a perspective that's not often seen. You also get a really interesting view of Irish history and political issues of the time period. Author gets deep into the details. 

  * [A Better Class of Criminal](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-better-class-of-criminal-dc-si.394632/) - DC SI who becomes a Batman Villan and tries to reform himself. 110k words. 3/5. Abandoned. 

  > A really unique fanfiction that got abandoned way too soon. SI entered DC and became a supervillain. He was caught, served his time and after emerging from prison is attempting to reform and be a better person. That means running for Mayor. The overall plot is well written and the SI's thought process is a lot of fun to read. The biggest problem with this fic is that it suffers from a case of, "SI's MAGIC solves all problems." Sadly it was cut short just as the story was entering the most interesting arc, but it's still worth a read. 

  * [A Young Woman's Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/page-1151#post-66992473) - Saga of Tanya the Evil Fanfic. 270k words. 4/5. Ongoing

  > I doubt there's much I can say about this since it's been recommended to death on here and anywhere fanfics get recommended. If you like political fics, at the very least you'll like a couple arcs of this. I only include this story here to recommend is checking out the Apocrypha if you haven't already. Some of the omake's and sidestories are fantastic and do a great job of adding to the worldbuilding. The only real flaw is that the story latches onto the trope of Tanya overestimating her enemies and underestimating herself + allies for a bit too long and overdoes it a bit too much. 

  * [Joffrey from Game of Thrones replaced with Octavian from Rome](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hbo-wi-joffrey-from-game-of-thrones-replaced-with-octavian-from-rome.375197/) - ASOIAF Insert Fic. 55k words. 3/5. Abandoned.

  > It's a been a while since I read this, but I do remember being impressed with the quality of the writing and the mannerisms of the MC. New Joffrey conducts himself in how a young, genius, pragmatic !rational person to do. Irrc, it grated me in some sense since his demeanor was written in such a self-assured overmature "better than you" style, but if you can get past that, it's a fun read. The courtroom scene was well put together and the SI's job of navigating the political arena is accomplished fairly well. It's a shame it got abandoned so soon. 

  * [The Uzumaki's Peace](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7800327/1/The-Uzumaki-s-Peace) - Naruto end of Story. 3k words. 5/5. Complete.

  > This a fantastic oneshot about the ninja world where Naruto is a mythical Hokage. Honestly I'd be spoiling by saying anything more. It's 3k words and portrays a unique worldview in a specific version of Ninja Society.

[Here's the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gdd7kj/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fpmptfk/) to the full discussion where a bunch of people gave some recommendations for political/intrigue focused fiction.

  I like LitRPG and Xianxia for light reading because they let me turn off my brain for a bit, but the majority of the ones I read on Amazon Unlimited and the ones I see recommended here completely destroy my 'mersion when all the male characters act like awkward weirdos around women.

  What are some good progression-porn stories that treat women like human beings?

  Here are some that I've liked, in no particular order and off the top of my head:

  * Worth the Candle
  * Street Cultivation
  * Changing Faces (thanks /u/IICVX!)
  * Cradle
  * ... I really thought this list would be longer
  ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    Forge of Destiny was quite good. The sequel is a bit less good, I think, regressing towards the problems I usually have with reading quests from the outside.
    ```

    - u/reddithanG:
      ```
      Do you mind elaborating? I love the story but it does seem to be dragging on a bit lately
      ```

      - u/Charlie___:
        ```
        So, the usual problem with quests is that the audience just wants to do whatever seems shiny at the moment. Through some combination of an unusually good audience and unusually good authorial wrangling, the first part actually reads like a book - like an actual human would make these decisions, with one following from another in a way that is presented as sensible.

        Of course, normal quests are the way they are because they can be fun for audience and author alike - though I like them less as a detatched reader. I think both the audience and the author are less character/narrative focused in the sequel.
        ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    If you liked Street Cultivation, you might also like [Changing Faces](https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Faces-LitRPG-Adventure-Minus-ebook/dp/B07KMMT9TX) - LitRPG by the same author. It actually spends a bit of time deconstructing the litrpg harem trope and has real characters who are women.

      Thanks for the recommendation, but I can only assume that you either haven't read that much of it or your comment is some sort of cruel prank.

      Women are practically nonexistent in this story, and when they appear, it's as "females" whose looks *must* be commented on and compared to the other "females" around them. There is literally a conversation in one chapter about how "females" only have value when men give it to them. Not only is the MC >!gifted a hot magical princess gf out of nowhere, but she's incredibly insecure and deeply in his debt because apparently his dad gave her a magic tree when they were babies!<.

      I read a little bit more while writing this comment, and *my god*:

        Actually, I wonder if there's good and rational stories involving polyamory that *don't* fall into the 'obvious unrealistic wish fulfilment with a heavy dose of sexism' camp.
        ```

        - u/kmsxkuse:
          ```
          Doesn't even need to be rational.

          I haven't found a harem story that isnt literally the author's self insert softcore porn.

          So much garbage out there. 

          Then again, my ideal retirement operating a Alaskan dog sled team for the rest of my life probably isnt as appealing in literature compared to a harem of 200 women literally stabbing each other in the back to fuck the POV.
          ```

        - u/Izeinwinter:
          ```
          One problem I have encountered is that even very well written polyamory falls apart once the author tries to move beyond a   threesome. - Relationships are only interesting if they get some depth and heft to them, and if they are multi-lateral. With a threesome, you need to track 3 relationships from 3 points of view. This can be done, and even fit within the constraint of a not-wrist-breaking book length. 

          However, the graph of relationships gets just far to many lines in it at four and above, which means either earlier relationships stop being explored (and at that point, you might as well write about serial monogamy!) or everything becomes super superficial.
          ```

          - u/ramjet_oddity:
            ```
            Ah. This does show an inherent problem in the genre. To the best of my knowledge, at least some poly people have a primary and multiple secondaries. So stories following people using this model might work better? Huh.
            ```

          - u/Rice_22:

            A harem isn't well-written if you don't have the involved members going at each other's throats, I feel. The very foundation of it is the age-old struggle and conflict for limited resources (in this case influence and access to the "owner", who is in a position of power to warrant a harem in the first place). To have the harem get along with each other and "share" seems so unnatural and forced, and rubs out an avenue for the writer to write about intrigue. Most real-life examples of harems end in some ridiculously gruesome stuff. 

            I also agree 3-4 members in a harem is optimal in terms of screen-time for each "party" to make their case. More than that and there isn't any space to get to know the characters.

      Note to those who are interested, that webnovel seems to be translated from Chinese. 

      If you never had experience with translated novels, jumping into the deep end is going to be rough on your eyes.

      Not the actual content of the novel. This seems to be pretty standard Chinese mass murder power fantasy. Nothing particularly innovative other than the lack of the more cringe worthy awkwardly injected romance side plots.

      People read Chinese power fantasies for the murder, not the romance. Read Japanese light novels for the romance, Chinese for the murder, and Korean for a mix with varying results.

      What they all have in common is the eye bleedingly bad translations to English. The grammar, phrasing, and occasionally even spelling might be lacking as most translations are not professional. Some of them might even be run through Google Translate or other machine translations and you won't be able to tell the difference to a human doing it. It's all that bad.

      Combined with the fact the source material is often aiming for word count / paid by chapter / low quality in the first place, these novels aren't quality reads.

      Still, they do scratch an itch you won't find elsewhere in the English publishing world. And with often 1000+ chapters with each having 1k+ words, you'll get your fill of these stories and more.

      RI specifically seems to have angered the Chinese Government and has been censored off the Chinese publishing world. Last I've heard from Reddit rumor mill is that the author is attempting to self publish but nothing else came out. RIP.

    I've read two of those and really liked them.

    A series I have been really enjoying is [Nanocultivation Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy). I think it does the treating women as human beings thing well. The start of the story is a bit rough writing wise. But after that it has the philosophizing of Worth the Candle as the cultivation of Cradle with some litrpg-ish elements, before it gets to the straight up VRMMO litrpg (that blends perfectly with the "real world" cultivation). All with great worldbuilding.

      I had to drop this, it was good until the author turned the MC combat strategy into I'm so fast nobody can touch me on the inside, and made her hyper OP on the outside. The setting is good, I'd have enjoyed a more reasonable power level and progression on the outside, but no, the MC can just ignore the economy, have and steal any power she wants and even upgrade them. 

      &#x200B;

      It's too much for me. One or two things sure, but this level of OP is too annoying, coupled with this rebirth / chosen one stuff it's like he's trying to make me drop it on purpose.

        That's a totally fair view.

        Personally I view the intellectual enlightenment as the real progression, and a lot of the "and then progression" to be a subversion of tropes. But I also see where you are coming from. I'll try to figure out how to fit that into my recommendations in the future.

  Reviewing a bunch of prior recommendations


  [Humble life of a skill trainer\[](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30737/the-humble-life-of-a-skill-trainer/) Interesting take on the litrpg genre. Clever and mostly believable protagonist, and the world seems self-consistent. I would have liked the protag to be a little more conflicted about lying and torturing but I guess that's personal taste. The stakes have been low up till the most recent chapter and while it hasn't got my blood pumping I am interested in where it goes.

  [Seaborn](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30131/seaborn/).I recommend. A combination of seafare, litrpg and davy jones. The premise is interesting though the characters haven't quite developed depth yet. The quality doesn't seem super high but the premise have kept me interested this far.   

  [Twillight Kingdom](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21323/twilight-kingdom/) Really interesting seemingly consistent world. The protagonist is likeable and the conflicts starts believable. I dropped it after the first major conflict were deux ex resolved by spoiler(the protagonist using random runes to kill the big badey without the badey really righting back). I'll put it on hold for a while as I cope with my disappointment but will probably pick it up again because it's mostly well written and interesting.   


  [The Nexus(worm/gamer/skyrim crossover)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/nexus-quest-worm-the-gamer-multicross.7046/) \]A quest that follows a Taylor that grinds xp and abilities in skyrim. A few clever ideas but the whole concept of killing people for XP isn't explored until fairly late and then the exploration is handled mechanically and without exploring the underlying emotions. I dropped it after 30-40 chapters and find that it's too focused on grinding power and not enough on how to use that power. Weak characters. 

  [Zero Requiem(Lelouch/game of thrones crossover)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/zero-requiem-lelouch-in-asoiaf.745138) Kind of what you would expect from the crossover - lelouch stomping his enemies by political and strategic maneuvers. I find it refreshing that this lelouch recognizes that he is taking high risk gambles instead of being certain that things will work out, however it breaks a little disbelief that he never loses a high risk gamble. Overlal enjoyable read if tactical curbstomp is your thing.   

  [Alexandra Quick and X)(arry Potter series in the US)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16927533/chapters/39772074) A long as series following a magical student in the US. The main character is very well written. I find the commentary on American culture hillarious and the protag has reasonable magical skills. If anyone have read through multiple books I would love to hear if the protag becomes more actively storydriving or if the pace picks up later. I read the first book and while enjoyable I missed clever optimization and stories that revolve around what the protag wants to achieve so I've put the next ones on hold.   

  [An Advance in Time](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31377/an-advance-in-time/) A story that follows an uploaded protag that tries to build and uplift a kingdom in a simulation that is owned by a coorporation trying to make money on it. It had a weak start but the followup have been decently strong.
  ```

  - u/ironistkraken:

    For Seaborn, I would recommend waiting.   Some more updates and time could show if the story develops well or does its premise not be given justice.  Its still very much in the world building mode.

    Re: Alexandra Quick

    >I would love to hear if the protag becomes more actively storydriving 



    Yes, very much so. Obviously in Book 1, she's pre-teen who has never had formal magical training before, so of course she's not very skilled. That changes throughout the series, starting in Book 2. And the more powerful she gets, the more ability she has to influence the story. 

    She never becomes "rational", she always remains stubborn and impulsive, but as her skill increases she gets a lot better at actually implementing and following through with her seemingly irrational plans. I read someone describe her character as "bashing her head against a wall until the wall gives way", and that seems pretty accurate. 


    >or if the pace picks up later

    In my personal opinion, Book 1 is the weakest in the series by a pretty wide margin, so if you already enjoyed it you will probably enjoy Book 2 more. Book 2 is much denser than Book 1, and it also gives you a better idea as to the series' overarching story and what the later books in the series are like.

    Here's a looooooong list of fanfiction that might fit your criteria. Let me know if you have any questions about the fictions themselves.

    _____

    **Long Fanfiction - Harry Potter**
    _____

    [Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them) - 5/5 - 38K

    > This is a hilarious fic that takes a crackfic premise, but does it justice. The concept is if an abused Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys. After being abandoned he has peculiar encounters that leave him believing that he's actually an elf. A free forest elf. Very funny and very cute. Has a sequel that I also highly recommend with a 5/5 for that as well. 

    [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/3/) - 4/5 - 104K

    >  There isn't much I can say here since this is so well known and has had more than a handful of recommendations. It's an extremely funny story that takes the premise of if Lord Voldemort was a misunderstood somewhat monster instead of a complete monster and runs with it.

    [A Black Comedy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy) - 5/5 - 246K

    > My favorite HP fanfiction of all time. The humor, the hijinks, the characters, the overall everything might not be the exact best in each category, but they're all top notch and together they create the best story. The basic premise is an adult Harry messes with the Viel spitting Sirius who was stuck inbetween into a new dimension and Harry follows him there. The buddy cop dynamic between the two is so much fun to watch. 

    [Harry Potter, The Geek](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9807593/1/Harry-Potter-the-Geek) - 3/5 - 65K

    > A Harry Potter who becomes a geek after spending an entire summer on a computer. Dumb meme and videogame references everywhere. 

    [Weeb](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12350003/1/Weeb) - 3/5 - 124K

    > Written by the same author as Harry Potter, The Geek comes Weeb. This is a more refined and more anime joke focused version of The Geek. The author makes it a point to make this one both funnier and weirder. If you like anime and don't mind seriousness, this is for you. 

    [What would Slytherin Harry Do?](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do) - 5/5 - 44K

    > Varied oneshots of a more cunning and social Harry in Slytherin. Not serious, but at the same time, somewhat plausible and written with enough detail that you'll probably laugh out loud. 

    [Whatever Happened to Bromance](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767/1/Whatever-Happened-to-Bromance) - 4/5 - 10K

    > Seriously, why the hell did Harry not get asked out more often in the books? The man's a literal celebrity who saves the school at the tune of at least once a year. Great story and shows you how Harry really should branched out and made more friends.

    [Make a Wish](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish) - 3/5 - 180K

    > This is a classic in the genre and despite the numerous grammatical mistakes, this story and its sequel still make me laugh whenever I reread. The basic premise is Harry Potter going on a world tour to fix himself, but ends up fixing everything around him instead. 

    [Where in the World is Harry Potter](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter) - 3/5 - 54K

    > This is a bit of OP Harry doing weird and crazy stuff and tbh even though the grammar and humor holds up alright, the OPness is a bit grating. The story toes the line between a 2/5 and a 3/5. I include this story, on here only for the [third story of the series](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2630300/1/You-Did-What) which imo is pure gold on the comedy and hijinks. An easy 5/5. The third is best read after pushing through the first two, but if you're getting stuck on the first or second, feel free to jump to the third, not thaaaat much is lost in between.

    [Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous) - 4/5 - 30K

    > Written by the same author of The Shadow of Angmar comes an even better HP/LOTR crossover, maybe, I think. Harry is now a child elf with a lot of power and an inability to get what he wants. Those things are sex and a way back home so becomes just a bit psychotic.

    [Harry Potter and the Most Electrifying Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7583739/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Most-Electrifying-Man) - 3/5 - 10K

    > The literal definition of a crackfic. Still got me to laugh out loud at a number of points. Harry Potter is sent to live with, "The Most Electrifying Man" instead of the Dursleys. Chaos ensues. 

    [Harry the Hufflepuff](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff) - 3/5 - 30K

    > This story and it's sequels are simple casual fun. The basic premise is that of a Harry Potter who values relaxation over everything else.

    Long Fanfiction - Other

    RWBY - [Professor Arc](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898868/1/Professor-Arc) - 4/5 - 580k

    > This story's premise is if when Jaune Arc's fake transcripts were much more impressive than they should have been. Instead of becoming a student, he's offered a job as an assistant Professor. The story is about the charade he engages in so that his cover isn't blown and he isn't sent to jail. Runs with the misunderstanding premise a bit too long imo, but otherwise a hilarious story. Has a sequel that I haven't bothered reading, but could be good. The author is really good at writing and some of his other works are well written stories as well. 

    RWBY - [The Fall of Professor Arc](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11721523/1/The-Fall-of-Professor-Arc) - 4/5 - 20k

    > This story is kind of a divergence fic of the above fic written by the beta of the Professor Arc fanfiction. This author is great in their own righ as wellt. Highly recommend reading it after finishing/getting through at least halfway of Professor Arc. The story takes Professor Arc's story and reverses it.

    > A great story of a dude who chooses the overlord gauntlet when inserted into Konosuba. He creates funny minions and gets caught up in the weird that is the world of Konosuba and multiplies that into funny chaos.


    Smallville/DC/Marvel - [The Incredibly Dense Mind of Louis Lane](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3294180/1/The-Incredibly-Dense-Mind-of-Lois-Lane) - 4/5 - 30K

    Comedy is subjective but I found these two fics funny. Both are self-inserts. 

    This Bites is a one-piece story where the author is an adrenaline junkie and absolutely loves how crazy the world is. A lot of running gags and weird situations that come from the One Piece world. In the story, the Strawhats find a piece of technology that lets the author’s radio show reach a global audience and a lot of the fun is the world reacting to the craziness of the Straw Hats and the situations they find themselves in. 

    The other is What’s her name in Hufflepuff where the author is a girl who is sorted into Hufflepuff and the everyday weirdness that is the magical world that is genuinely funny, seems to fit quite well with canon, and the children in the story actually act like children to the author’s annoyance.

    Sabatini's [Captain Blood](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1965). Addictive doctor-turned-charismatic-pirate adventure. Skip the movies, book is far superior. Captain stories in general are probably good at this, Hornblower, Master & Commander (have heard this had a good movie). Can highly recommend Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan as far as captain stories go.

    Psycho-Pass (anime). Slow beginning, really hits its stride around episodes 12-13 (episode 6 in the extended?). The movie is also recommended. Think Funimation still [streams](https://www.funimation.com/shows/psycho-pass/) the Director's Cut free with ads, pick "Extended Edition" instead of "Season 1" (it doesn't say you need to subscribe anyways, may have to log in, extended puts 2 episodes into 1 so the count is right). Manly intellectual cop (sadly not the MC, but close enough) faces down elegant anarchist murderer in a surveillance state.

- u/SecondTriggerEvent:

  Looking for long web serials or fanfiction (100k+ words, or complete in the 40k+ range). Particularly like LitRPGs or Romcoms. I like things that:

  * Focus on a smaller cast of characters, preferably spending the majority of the story with the protagonist.
  * Puts characters over world building, I want interesting character development/relationships over learning some fantasy empire's hierarchy.
  * Have educational tidbits. Nothing too heavy, but if a real science/history/psychology etc..., tidbit informs a character decision, that's interesting.
  * Have good pacing, Rome wasn't built in a day, but I also don't need a report on every brick placement.If it has fight scenes, strategic and/or with emotional stakes.
  * Have a sense of humour, preferably doesn't get bogged down with heavy drama, war or politics.
  * If it's Gamer-style, doesn't go crazy with stat screens.

  Worth the Candle is easily a favourite. Thank you for abiding my picky criteria.

    I don't know if I'd classify this is as a romcom, but I find it to be one of the best romance fanfiction/or fictions in general I've had the opportunity of reading. 

    [Breaking Through the Bottom of the Barrel](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12027237/1/Breaking-Through-the-Bottom-of-the-Bottle) by College Fool. 

    * great characters and characterization
    * fantastic pacing
    * amazing humor 


    Honestly at 42K words it's short and sweet. I've probably reread it over half a dozen times because of just nice of good of story it is.

      do you need to know RWBY to understand it.

        Not really. It helps, but isn't necessary. The main two characters were classmates who went to an academy together and the story is set a couple years after canon.

          Just finished it.  Lots of reading between the lines.  Even so its a pretty good short romance.  Ending was really cute.

  Highly recommend [CIVCEO](https://www.amazon.com/CivCEO-Lit-Accidental-Champion-Book-ebook/dp/B07YRTVLMZ/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=civceo&qid=1589214776&sr=8-4). It's a series of four books about a person transported to another world where deities chose heroes are chosen to lead villages in their name. MC is the newly retired CEO of a company on earth and decides to create a nation focused on his strengths, trade. 

  The story is a mix of city/kingdom building and trade and merchant negotiation. The story is a bit of a popcorn fic where things happen a bit too easy for our MC, but if you like kingdom building/merchant trading/a splash of political intrigue, the books scratch that itch quite well. The books get better as the series progresses as well.

    I strongly counter this rec. 

    For me, the first book was seemingly written by someone who has never played a 4x/city management game about a boomer who has also never played a 4x/city management game, transported to a world where everything just... works out for him. The idea has a lot of potential, but the application is worse than bad, it's soulless and anemic, it has no depth, no flavor, and zero sense of craftsmanship. 

    A glimpse into this worlds "mechanics": gold is the only relevant resource, so there is no resource management layer whatsoever, no supply chains, no tech trees, nothing like that. Everything and anything can be purchased with gold, including every building. There is no training time for specialization of workers, they just suddenly know everything their job entails.  Production time of goods is completely arbitrary, as is quantity produced or the price of goods. A single level one farm is enough to pay for the upkeep of hundreds of mercenaries(possibly thousands? It's unclear, but it's enough to stave off an invasion by the antagonists, anyway) not once but several times over... How does that make any sense, whether mechanically or narratively?

    A glimpse into the worldbuilding: there is an years long standoff between two cities, the first of which specced purely into war, with tens of thousands of well trained, well equipped warriors, and the second that went for "tall" archetype (i.e. high pop, production, culture, science, etc focused on one city). Somehow, over those many years of stalemate the war city is still able to feed and upkeep their many thousands of soldiers (with no trade or pillaging, apparently, as they were cut off from any other town), and the besieged tall city has tens of thousands of citizens that were able to maintain a comfortable existence while resisting invasion and assault. Again, does that makes any sense? Does it seem like the author put any thought whatsoever into verisimilitude?  


    In short, this is not even remotely a 4x game as it advertises itself to be. The mechanics are mind-numbingly simplistic, the MC is a (non-intetional) charicature of boomer, constantly spouting off trite aphorisms and cretinous truisms, and is not remotely relatable, the plot is thin and uninteresting, and there is absolutely 0 narrative tension, as every problem is well within the MC's capabilities.

      Yup, I picked this book up (for free thanks to Kindle Unlimited) and dropped it within the first few chapters. 

      One thing I don't think you emphasized enough is just how *insufferable* the MC is. If you've ever worked with an entitled, out of touch executive at a mid-sized company, that's the MC - and not only is *he* unaware of his shortcomings, *the book* also fails to realize that he's a terrible person.

        Same. By the end of the free sample I suspected that the world was already broken for good storytelling.
