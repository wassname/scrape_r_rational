## Worth the Candle large release?

### Post:

Hi friends,

I just wanted to ask if anyone had any info about the next WtC release, which, according to the tracker sheet, looks to be quite large. Is there any info floating around about it, or is it business as usual?

  This is business as usual. Releases are typically about a month apart, but last month the lore doc was uploaded, which was also very large.

    That's right, I forgot about the lore doc. Thanks for the response, and sorry if this is a relatively low value post.

      I'm actually surprised it wasn't today. Wales always seems to upload on my busiest weekends, but he missed this one!
      ```
