## [FF] Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy

### Post:

Doctor Who/ Harry Potter

Something I think /r/rational would like. I didn't tag it with [RT] because while everything is justified, I'm not quite sure 'rational' is the word to use here.

Edit: Ah, damn, messed up the linking.

  Alright, I've read a little and this seems pretty hilarious. Let's see how it turns out.

  Edit: it's a bit much to read all in one go, the constant barely-sequiturs seem to have unhinged my brain somewhat. Could be fun for an occasional chapter.

  This may actually be the first time I've read something with references too intellectual and obscure for me to catch. Or it's just the first time I've noticed and they've been whizzing by above my head for years now, which seems more likely.

  Yes, less rational and more sherlock holms really. Less extrapolating from available data and more pulling answers fully formed from the ethyr. I'm pretty sure that's explicitly one of The Doctor's powers as it happens.

  I dislike New Who for its utter rejection of consistent worldbuilding. I despise New Who for its propensities for frenetically randumb behavior.

    *randumb* I like this word! Where did you get it? Did you invent it? I'm going to start using that word.

  Thanks for posting. It's weird enough to do my brain injury but it does make a (sort of) semi-consistent hole. I should add "so far" because it's not finished yet.

  It starts out very good, but drags on and loses its way.

  ```
  So ... what's the conceit? Harry is the Doctor, who just regenerated and has lost his memory somehow?
  ```

  - u/RidiculousAvgGuy:
    ```
    Somehow the doctor, or at least an iteration of him, has ended up in Harry's head.

    How that has happened has yet to be revealed, but (from The Potter's initial thoughts) The Doctor was most likely dying.

  Only halfway through the first chapter, but this is already reminding me of [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux) in the best possible way. Will continue at speed.

  **I LOVE THIS FIC**. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
