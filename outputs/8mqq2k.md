## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Whats going on with the monday threads? Since two months or so we've had a marked decrease in comments in here. Do people not improve their lives anymore, or has the monday thread failed its goal to give a good platform for that sort of feedback? 

  For those of you who have posted here before but stopped, what made you stop?

    I'm guessing it a time-of-year thing. I bet you'll see a lot more activity in September. That's a testable prediction.

    Temporary homelessness and such. I’ve not been posting here very much in general lately.

        I'm alright. It's all voluntary. I'm a grad student in San Francisco, so my income is limited and rent is expensive. My first apartment here cost me $1200/month, and that was to share a shabby room that violated more housing laws that I can count, so... Money's weird for me, and I felt more secure without a stable housing situation, but being able to put money in the bank every month, than I did in stable (albeit illegal) housing that ate up my financial reserves. 

        I wouldn't say that it's been awful, just that, combined with school and work, it left me without the spoons that I normally allocate to this subreddit. I've been checking Craigslist now and then to see if something good pops up, and I don't have to be in San Francisco during the summer so I'm out of that situation for now, but I'll be okay if I have to go back to it in the autumn. I've got my stuff figured out. 

        EDIT: I probably should have brought it up in an off-topic thread (or even just asked if anybody knew about cheap housing in the area), since many people here live in the Bay Area, but... I actually don't have any good excuses. It was just embarrassing. >:P

  I vaguely remember some site that had a bunch of rationalist "motivation posters," like one that said something along the lines of "Treat everyone 20% better than you want them to treat you, to correct for fundamental attribution error." I can't seem to find the site, though. Anyone have an idea what I'm talking about?

    I literally have the image you are talking about as my desktop background. However, I don't remember where I got it from and a reverse image Google search isn't bringing up any results. The link mentioned at the bottom of the image, [prettyrational.com](https://prettyrational.com), isn't bringing me to a valid domain. The name, Linus Pauling, is jsut the guy who came up with the quote.

  I recently had to (try to) commit someone who had lost contact with reality. Its really a shitty situation - I've had experience with psychosis before so I knew very quickly what was up but to then call emergency hotline was another really hard step. 

  Unfortunately the person then suddenly decided they wanted to take a drive, and I found myself unable/unwilling to actually prevent them from the driving. I could have taken away their car keys or locked them into a room or something. But that seemed like too much of a confrontation. 

  If I was willing to commit someone to psychiatric services to prevent them from selfharm, I should self-consistently have also used force to prevent them from driving until the ambulance got there. Alas, that is actually an incredibly hard thing to do.

      A day later they got picked up by emergency services - they were incoherent enough that normal people caught wind and called it in. Still in closed clinical environment, but now coherent at least.

  [using this thread as a substitute for the long-defunct writing skills thread]

  So, the story I'm writing, I decided to call Vampire Flower Language because it grew on me, but it sort of stopped growing on me and then I linked it to someone who came to my place for board games and she immediately said:

  >How come you didn't  just call it Vampire "Floriography" instead of "Flower Language"?

  And now I am wondering how the hell I never heard that term for it before especially because it appears in the wikipedia article. Vampire Floriography looks more classy and sounds more intelligent to me.

  So... can I just change the title if I still like it better in a few weeks? Maybe next month when I post the chapter I'll add (formerly vampire flower language) afterwards to alleviate potential confusion? 

  Is it a better title or am I just self-conscious about my titles?
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    What's the point of posting to the Internet instead of dead\-tree publishing if not for the ability to make changes to your writing after posting it?

    I suggest making the change, and only include \(formerly Vampire Flower Language\) when you post the link to the next chapter instead of the parentheses being part of the title.

      >What's the point of posting to the Internet instead of dead-tree publishing if not for the ability to make changes to your writing after posting it?

      Exactly! Which reminds me I have some formatting gaffes in the first few chapters that I need to look at. And em-dashes :P

      Yeah, I was thinking of keeping the parenthetical statement in the AO3 title for a month or so and in the /r/rational posts for one or maybe two updates. 

      I've got a week and a half before we're planning on posting the next chapter so I'll let it marinate anyway. I think "Vampiric Floriography" might be even better still, feels like a more effective rhythm.

    Story titles should match the MC/Narrator. If your narration is classy and intelligent, go for it. Otherwise stick with words people actually know without looking up.
    ```

      Thanks for the contrary perspective, I appreciate it. Definitely sounds logical to base it on tone.

      In terms of tone, I don't know. The main characters are a vampire who talks in that very old fashioned way that vampires talk in fiction (I don't think we overdo it, but you know), and a human who is kind of dumb and talks like a kind of dumb human. But the narration is kind of over the top and flowery (or seems so to me when I'm feeling self-conscious about it). 

      Just a paragraph taken at more or less random to give an idea:

      > Red followed, wondering about the wisdom of the decision of following strange women in parts of town he didn’t know. He couldn’t even be sure that she had even understood what he was looking for. Moreover, he had never seen someone dressed anything like this woman was. It was beginning to get warm out. She would have to be sweltering under that thing; he could only imagine what it would be like in June. Maybe she didn’t wear it every day. Or maybe it was a religious thing. Maybe she was a nun. Red had never met a nun before. A nun would have to be trustworthy. He relaxed.

    I prefer FL; floriography doesn't mean anything to me. Flog sounds elegant but wanky, FL is direct.

  What are people's opinions on the reddit site redesign?

  I'm finding it to be nicer in a couple of ways such as there being an editor to italicize, bold, and similar editing instead of fiddling around with asterisks. There's also the infinite scrolling that I like.

  Features that I miss is the ability to collapse comments to the parent comment, and there's some difficulty in finding my comment history.
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Surely doesn't belong in the monday thread, but it can use the traffic. 

    Redesign destroyed the mobile webpage, someone thought it was a great idea to make the search function field transparent(??) and foregoing the extreme conditioning everyone has for search fields, the layout is optimized for 20" screens and UNUSABLE on 14" laptops, they got rid of the line of subreddits on the top of the page making reddit much harder to explore  etc etc. Its in a lot of ways a shitshow. 

    The nice thing is the improved collapse function - dont need to click [-], anywhere in a straight line below the [-] works as well.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:

      >The nice thing is the improved collapse function \- dont need to click \[\-\], anywhere in a straight line below the \[\-\] works as well.

      I had *not* noticed that. Thanks for letting me know.
      ```

    Let's see... It's still very obviously a work-in-progress, and there are problems that I think will be fixed or streamlined, but there are also things that look like they're here to stay, that I don't like.

    * In particular, the fact that half the time when you click a link it opens a pop-up, and half the time it opens widget inside of the current page; both annoy me a lot (although they're handled better that some pages).

    * I liked that they added a "click anywhere on the left to collapse comment" function, but it's not as good as the one in the *Reddit Minimizer* browser plugin.

    * I really like that they added a WYSIWYG editor, and if you switch to the markdown the markdown formatting is still there (though I wish you had the "italicize", "bold", etc buttons directly in the markdown editor).

    * There's no longer a link to send PMs to a user on u/ pages, you have to go to the old version if you want to send PMs.

    * I used to dislike infinite scrolling, but I'm getting used to it. Not having to click to load new content is actually nice.

    There's still a few features missing: custom subreddit CSS doesn't seem to be there, the new spoiler format doesn't work on mobile (and in old format reddit), the "show a symbol next to controversial comments" option doesn't work, you can't see upvote percentage on threads, etc.
    ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      I hate infinite scrolling, because it’s much easier to stop by telling myself to go for only so many more clicks or pages.
      ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    It's a disaster for visually impaired people, like myself. No thought at all to accessibility.
