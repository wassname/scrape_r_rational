## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I watched the Old Guard on Netflix this weekend, and while it was a good movie, it was also *infuriating*. 

  Spoilers:>!You had a group of immortals who were trying to make the world better by.....acting as an elite special forces group. At te end of the movie, it's stated that hey *are* actually making adifference (although they don't spend enough time on that consiparicy board to show how exactly), but how on earth is it even in the realm of possibility that they are doing as much good as they could be doing by getting rich and providing malaria nets. And yeah, the BigPharma CEO is obviously a bad guy.....but they didn't actually explain why they were *in principle* opposed to medical testing to try and figure out why they were immortal, as opposed to being opposed to that one dude who was clearly a psychopath!<


  Again, an enjoyable overall movie with good action scenes, interesting characters, etc, and no major plot holes per se, it's just that hte characters were complete *idiots* and it was infuriating. I'd love to read a rational version that tries to explore how much good such a group could realistically do by acting intelligently. It's probably less than optimistic people would imagine (changing the world is hard), but it's probably a hell of a lot more than the movie versions were doing.
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    The movie is extremely strong fan-fic bait, because it left so very many plot hooks poking out in all directions. 

    For example, the team kills the *CEO* of the pharma corp. But they do not collect any of the tissue samples taken, and they leave the head scientist alive! If there is a scientific mechanism behind their immortality, that should be enough to get started. 

    Or Quynh - There is no way medieval steels held her in saltwater for more than a couple of decades. So what has she been up to for the past 400 and change years?

    Or, indeed, is what the CIA guy talking about statistically significant, and if so, *how*? 

    Note that this does not even necessarily have to be divine or precognitive intervention. Perhaps everyone they interact with much ends up having super healthy children because their healing factor is mildly contagious, and well, a group of children with perfect health is going to have a seriously outsized impact on the world throughout most of history just by being more generally capable.

    Ect. I think most of this is deliberate sequel hooks, but it hooks fandom too, precisely because it does not tie up things very neatly.
    ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      >Or, indeed, is what the CIA guy talking about statistically significant, and if so, how? 

      Out of the entire loosely thought out movie, this was my biggest headscratcher.

      So far as we've been told, they've just been running around saving people mostly at random for centuries, but we're told that the biggest benefits are the butterfly effect s from descendents of those people. Why? How? By pure random chance it should be about as likely that they'd save, say, Hitler's grandmother than the ancestor of some great doctor. Or at least in whatever ratio such people exist in the general population.

      Are we supposed to believe that there is some guiding force nudging them to targets with the greatest future utility? The same on responsible for their unexplained regeneration?

      Maybe it will be explained if there's some future sequel, but it was very noticeable at first glance.
      ```

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
        ```
        I think that the board was *supposed* to show that they actually saved significant individuals directly, or helped specific conflicts end a certain way. However, it didn't spend enough time to be able to see it, so the point wasn't really made. We didn't see the evidence and they didn't talk about it specifically enough to figure out. So we are left just needing to take their word that "they've made a difference", which was frustrating.
        ```

        - u/Izeinwinter:
          ```
          If it was all "The people you saved turn out to do a lot of good" that would be far easier to explain - That could plausibly be down to them having very good judgment about people (Which, well, after a couple of millennia, you would expect that) and inspiring people. 

          The *descendants* of people they save? That takes more.
          ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      Yeah, the Quynh thing was perhaps the only real plot hole. I agree that realistically she shouldn't have been stuck in there that long, but the implication I took from the dreams were that the dreams were of things *currently happening*, so the fact that Nile dreamed it in the movie meant she was still stuck there. And even if dreams aren't always of current events, they state explictely that the dream of each other when they are apart. If she has been free for however long, why have none of them dreamed of her and seen her and what she is doing? In either situation (escaped a long time ago or just recently escaped), there is something that doesn't quite fit. 

      Absoltely agree that there are at on of hooks for good fan-fic though. Hopefully we get it.
      ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        My take on the dreams is that Quynh, however long she has been free, still has nightmares about drowning. Every night. Possibly while awake, even.
        ```

  - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
    ```
    Yeah I thought the main characters were fucking assholes. Given immortality for three thousand years how the fuck haven’t you improved anything? Just going around saving people one by one? Really? For that matter, why the fuck didn’t they kill Hitler? Or stop wars by assassinating leaders? The story could have been a war of immortals fighting each other throughout history and that’s why the world is fucked up as it is today. Also I agree, how the hell aren’t any of them rich or have contacts? It would have been cool if a villain immortal had a cult or something. They made the main character a goddess in the past.
    ```

  - u/Nnaelo:
    ```
    I couldn't get past the first quarter hour. They meet with a former intelligence officer face to face, with no intermediaries, and then conduct an assault without any kind of official backing, really, while keeping their faces uncovered. And then they are pissed because they got discovered? Man...
    ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    A book with a not *entirely* unrelated plot - [The Incrementalists, by Brust and White](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332271-the-incrementalists). It's not as well written as Brust's solo efforts, IMO, but still fairly readable. The ostensible background plot about immortals incrementally doing good takes a back seat to interpersonal drama and conflict that is not really about the background elements, sadly.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I recently read and liked some Mass Effect fanfiction, and I liked the setting of humans in isolation for the Citadel Council, thus having a different tech tree, capabilities and knowledge. For example, [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity), [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8949791/1/Mass-Effect-The-First-War](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8949791/1/Mass-Effect-The-First-War) and [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098732/1/Mass-Effect-End-of-Days](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098732/1/Mass-Effect-End-of-Days) (EDIT: Transcendent was pretty well written; End of Days was OK; I don't really recommend The First War, it just fits the theme).

  However, both these examples (and others) make humanity's tech way, way better than the rest. Are there any stories with a similar concept, but where humanity's tech is just different, better in some cases, but worse it others.
  ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    I'm not aware of any, but to be honest, two interstallar civilizations meeting and having their tech levels be even *broadly* comparable is incredibly unlikely. The more likely scenario is that one of the two *dramatically* outlcasses the other. Even the level of parity in transcendent humanity (haven't read the other one) is pretty unlikely. 

    Unless you imagine some hard cap on how technologically advanced it is possible to be, just being a few hundred years more advanced, let alone the likely thousands to millions of years that will separate alien civilizations would be a dramatic advantage. 

    Human history, despite the small sample sizes, is illustrative. Whenever 2 societies met that hadn't been in close contact for a long time (pretty much the only examples we have of this are colonial powers expanding around the globe), one of the two was dramatically more advanced, and that was a sepeaation in tech of usually just a couple hundred years, if that. 

    Of course, I'll agree that it makes for kind of a boring story if you are trying to write about conflict, but still.
    ```

    - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
      ```
      > Unless you imagine some hard cap on how technologically advanced it is possible to be

      That's actually pretty reasonable to assume for the Mass Effect universe, where the Reapers have made sure to guide all galactic species in a technological direction of their choosing. Perhaps they constructed the Mass Effect relays as a way to lead people towards a technological dead end, like how combustion engines can only ever get so efficient, no matter how much research you pour into it. Just with Mass Relay technology that limit isn't as easily derived as the Carnot efficiency limit, and leads most species to pour their energy into an already exhausted technology, instead of, say, vacuum energy.
      ```

    - u/Norseman2:
      ```
      Just to add to your points, we have to consider how long it's going to take us to achieve interstellar travel. We would need some massive breakthroughs in nuclear physics, medicine or environmental engineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence. To start with, we'll probably need to develop nuclear fusion rockets if we want to travel at even 1% of lightspeed. Then, to have living humans arrive at the other end of the trip, we'll need to develop either a viable means of cryonic stasis or the ability to set up indefinitely self-sustaining arcologies. Finally, to be able to have those humans survive and proliferate long-term, we would need to send an unmanned ship to arrive first to deploy fully autonomous robots which can develop a self-reproducing production chain as well as setting up human habitats and food/water/power/air supply.

      By the time we've developed all of that, we'd also probably be immensely technologically advanced in many other aspects. If you then consider how improbable it would be to even come close to an alien civilization with one our colonies, it's likely that by the time we do initiate first contact with a civilization we stumbled upon, we'd probably be sending out millions of colony ships every year and have a significant portion of the 250-500 billion stars in the Milky Way colonized. We'd be well-established as a Kardashev Type II civilization by that point. With that in mind, if an alien race makes first contact with us in the next few thousand years, they would probably have that same level of technological and economic development. If there's any kind of conflict after first contact, the civilization which had to do the traveling is probably going to be the one which wins.
      ```

      - u/Dragfie:
        ```
        And don't forget that by this time we would all be most likely digital and hyper-intelligent with flesh bodies being more of a hobby than a necessity. Basically we wouldn't be human anymore anyway.
        ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    If you'd like to explore that concept interactively: In the original Master Of Orion (video game), the tech tree is randomized each game, and differently for each empire, so you end up with some meaningful tech differences in most playthroughs.
    ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Transcendent Humanity was excellent, thanks, but the other fic is kinda trash. What did your like about it?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It starts OK I think, I liked the idea of human-quarian alliance. But yea it devolves into trash fast once the war starts.
      ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    Oh! I really enjoyed Transcendent Humanity. I think the overall way the conflict was resolved was really excellent, and the use (and eventual outcome) of what I'm now calling "just pandora box it" has, I think, broad, in-your-life philosophical and emotional possibilities.

    Basically: If you can't handle something \*now\*, put it in your (metaphorical) Pandora Box. Then when you're doing better - or need ultimate hail-mary's - open your Pandora Box.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Transcendent Humanity is a good fic. While it does have a much more advances Humanity, it actually handles that well (unlike other cringe-worthy fics like the one where the humans brought a diplomatic gift to the council for their introduction to the galaxy, and it was the Bill of Rights).

      My main gripe with it is that the Voice kind of magical, and it was human-exclusive - even if individuals from other species moved to their core and adopted their value,s they still wouldn't be included.
      ```

      - u/narfanator:
        ```
        Oh? I didn't catch that about the Voice. Seemed to me it was anyone in the uploaded human datasphere, but maybe I missed something?

        Uugh, that is cringeworthy. I like Transcendent's "here have more dreadnaughts".

    \[probably butchering this plot....\]

    The StarCraft universe has Protoss and Zerg, which were both created by a forerunner species to be sort of in balance.  
    \[Protoss being like blue scifi Predators, but more complex, cooler and hivemind-internet-connected snooty warrior individualists and Zerg being like the aliens from Alien, but more complex and cooler and also hivemind-controlled-collectivist insects with organic spaceships and stuff\]  


    And then we have the Terrans, which are a bunch of scrappy human colonist with psychic abilities, who got deported by the UN into space somewhere far away, because psychic people are trouble and Australia was already full.  
    \[and Terrans being humans, scrappy, heavily mechanized pioneers and not hiveminded tend to be more inventive, than those species mainly created for swag, making them able to compete and carve out their place\]  
    Kinda works.

    ____

    # [Hard Reset](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset)

    **Fanfiction**. 

    **Fandom**: MLP. 

    **Length**: 36k+ words. [✓] Completed.

    **Gen/Femslash**. There's a whole plot point of the main character getting out of the closet, but no actual relationships.

    **Author's description**: "Twilight isn't having a very good day. An experimental spell blew up in her face, an army of changelings is attacking Canterlot, and she just died. Yet somehow, it looks like it's going to keep going downhill from here.
    Given the chance to correct what's gone wrong, Twilight swears she's going to fix all this even if it kills her. Which it will. Frequently."

    **The good:**

    * Protagonist makes rational decisions for the most part and satisfyingly overcomes the problem at her ~~hands~~ hooves, one step at a time.

    * The story keeps the tension high but never makes the reader feel despair. There are genuinely hilarious and cathartic parts.

    * The writing style is decent.

    **The bad:**

    * The first chapter is very weak compared to the rest, and some events in the last chapter feel forced.

    * The fact that protagonist is remarkably intelligent and fueled by OCD in canon is taken to the extreme here. Generally, keeping everyone 100% normal and in character seemingly wasn't the author's top priority.

    **The ugly (aka: trigger warnings):**

    * It's MLP fanfiction.

    * There's some F/F action (not very graphic, but still).

    **Did I like it?:** [?] YES, BUT only the middle parts.

    ________________

    # [Tea with the Hatter \(TGIF\)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15348900)

    **Fanfiction**.

    **Fandom**: Marvel. 

    **Words**: 61k+. [✓] Completed.

    **Slash**.

    **Author's description:** "It's seven a.m., Thursday fourteenth November, 2013.
    It always is."

    **The good:**

    * A fantastic exploration of Groundhog loop PTSD both while the loop is active and especially after the characters are freed from it.

    * Technobabble is more scientific than anything in the Marvel universe by a long shot; the author also incorporates magical elements in a smart way that makes sense.

    * The characters are acting fairly smart and vigorously explore the ways to break the loop, but also take advantage of the loop mechanics.

    * Tagged "enemies to quantum entangled particles."

    **The bad:**

    * The story gradually gets worse and the writing starts to get lazy. It slowly gets strong again as the plot and conflict drastically change by the last two chapters, but never so good as in the beginning.

    **The ugly:**

    * It's slash, even though very tame compared to what can be found on AO3.

    * It requires at least some knowledge of the MCU to comprehend who are all these characters and why do they act the way they act.

    **Did I like it?:** [✓] YES, though I would have preferred the same story as gen.

    ________________

    # [Getting the hang of Thursdays](https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/)

    **Fanfiction**. 

    **Fandom**: Harry Potter. 

    **Words**: 96k+.  [✓] Completed.

    **Gen/Het.** There are some het elements, but it's mostly gen.

    **Author's description:** "A good day goes bad and then gets far worse than Severus could ever have imagined. Again and again and again."

    **The good:**

    * A magnificent, vivid writing style.

    * The time loop here is very well explained and has consistent rules.

    * It's the best horror I've read in my entire life, and that's not hyperbole. The darker ending is absolutely chilling and can easily keep one up at night with the mental image it creates.

    **The bad:**

    * It's very subjective, I know, but the whole story is "shit happens and there's nothing you can do." There's little to no progress in anything, from character development to problem-solving, and both endings don't feel satisfying at all.

    * Either I'm too used to HPMoR characters, or everyone here is annoying and dull and slightly out of character, especially the secondary cast.

    **The ugly:**

    * The story is very, VERY old, and some of its parts don't hold very good fifteen years and two books later. Perhaps, the second "bad" thing I listed originated from this.

    **Did I like it?:** [⨯] NO. It's objectively somewhere between good and great, but it's not my cup of tea.

    ________________

    # [Re: Zero.](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu)

    **Anime series.** 

    **Length:** 25 episodes. [?] The season is complete, but the story is not.

    **Gen/Het.** The MC's motivation is to get the girl, but most events have nothing to do with that. 

    My own **description**, as the MAL one is too long: "Guy named Subaru Natsuki gets transported into a fantasy world. He gets saved by a cute girl who is looking for her insignia. Subaru volunteers to help her with the search, but just as they locate the insignia, they get killed.

    However, Subaru immediately reawakens, and it's the morning in a fantasy world again. He meets that cute girl once more, tries to help her and watches as history repeats itself."

    **The good:**

    * The story is fairly dark and dramatic; it explores trauma created by time loops, and how the main character deals with it. This also makes it a lot deeper and more uncompromising than any isekai anime out there.

    * The animation is not unpleasant, there are not so many still frames and sakuga parts are cool.

    **The bad:**

    * The protagonist is not smart or resourceful. His victories come mostly from knowing the worst events in advance as he suffered through them (usually more than once).

    * The supporting cast is incredibly bland. To be fair, I haven't finished Re: Zero, so I can't say if it adds any interesting characters very late into the story, but everyone so far is either boring, a walking cliché or get sudden characterization for the sake of characterization ("Empathize with this character, goddamnit!"). When your standard black-haired NEET of a protagonist is more enjoyable to watch than the inhabitants of another world, something is wrong.

    * Soundtrack and general atmosphere feel uninspired and barely functional for the sense of dread the story tries to achieve. 

    **The ugly:**

    * It's an isekai anime.

    **Did I like it?:** [?] NO, BUT it could've been a lot worse. It's not a bad watch, just underwhelming for its premise.

      ```

      - u/NTaya:
        ```
        A few more, in much more distilled format and also in random order:

        * *[Sisyphus](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651)* is a short, sad, and well-written one-shot focusing on the desperation of being stuck in a loop. HP fic. The only thing on this list that I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone.

        * *[The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2236/Toki_wo_Kakeru_Shoujo)*, or more like *The Girl Who Didn't Do Anything Cool About Her Timeloop Powers*. It's based on a very old (1965, I think) novel, so there are no fresh ideas compared to other entries on both lists. Still, if you haven't seen it, it's worth a watch.

        * *[a lesson you should heed \(try, try again\)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/21775378)* is a very short, angsty BNHA fic where Izuku is stuck in a time loop. It's alright by fic standards.

        * [*The Best Night Ever*](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/The-Best-Night-Ever) is an old (pre-S3, I think) MLP fic which follows a very traditional plot of Doing Something Right to get out of the loop. It's very funny, but otherwise unremarkable.

        * *[Children of Prophecy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7761449/1/Children-of-the-Prophecy-ENGLISH-Version)* is a long-ass Evangelion fic with a very cynical view on the time loop scenario. I dropped it rather early for the reason I can't remember, but it's well-written and has some interesting ideas.

        * *[Omensight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/455820/Omensight_Definitive_Edition/)* is a videogame where you play as a mythical being summoned to prevent the end of the world. To do so, you have the opportunity to relive the final day over and over again, trying different stuff. It's mostly action-y, but there's a mystery going on as well, since you need to interact with various characters to find the solution to the whole apocalypse conundrum. Still, time loop takes a back seat in favor of killing enemies with flashy combos. (The plot is rather tight, though!)

        * I've heard >!*[Outer Wilds](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/)*!< is a good time loop story, but people consider this fact to be a spoiler. It's a fairly recent videogame.

    https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-first-order-derivative-fsn.47581/ is a fun fate stay night fanfic, time loop mechanics played straight. It's not totally lore compliant, but it does a better job than the vast majority of F/SN fics and was good enough that it didn't impact my reading noticably.
    Author's Description: An eccentric nerd finds himself stuck in a time loop after something weird happens down the street at Shirou Emiya's place. Tom Tomonaga doesn't know why he's repeating the same two weeks over and over again. He doesn't know anything about magic, the secret world of mages, or the Grail War. But he'll have to learn if he wants to escape back into a world that makes sense, all while arguing with a pushy voice inside of his own head and discovering how many ways there are to die (spoiler: they all suck.) Also features science in an absurd universe, frequent psychological trauma, and -- oh yeah -- the end of the world.


    https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/grounded-lightning-an-azula-timeloop-atla.844985/ is an ATLA timeloop centered around Azula, with the issue that despite her many chances her approach to problems is very much her own. It's not quite as good as the others listed but I'd still reccomend it if you're familiar with ATLA.
    Author's Description:It should have been one of the best days of Azula's life. She'd succeeded where dear Zuzu had failed again and again, single handedly staged a coup against Ba Sing Se, and struck the Avatar down with lightning. That was before she felt the tell-tale static that came with more lightning, this time not her own. Now she's stuck in a stupid time loop for Agni knows why. 


    Puella Magi Madoka Magica is this and is really good - one of my favorite works of fiction of all time - but it’s not from the perspective of the looper. Rational to rational adjacent, also very good at giving you a misleading impression of what it’s about. There's also some fanfic set during the series' time frame that covers this but most don't do it nearly as well; I can reccomend some if you want it but I'd only advise that if you like Madoka. 

    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya has one of these (the arc in question is called endless 8); the series itself is worth watching imo but fair warning the timeloop is not all of it and is a far bit in. Most notable for the sheer sense of scale it gives and how it sells that scale; again, the person maintaining memories across loops is not the veiwpoint character. 

    https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time Technically, this is just repeated timetravel, and not an actual timeloop. Practically, it's not far off. It's rational, has smart characters, good timetravel mechanics, intelligent use of timetravel... I could gush about this for a while.
    Author's Desription: Kyle Reese has traveled backwards in time, not to save Sarah Connor, but to help her rewrite the faulty utility function of Skynet. Together, it's possible that they might avert Judgment Day and save the world from nuclear Armageddon - and hopefully create a utopia ruled over by an AI god in the process. Fully completed. Diverges wildly from canon.

    The Reckoners by Brandon Sanderson is a great series, albeit perhaps not technically superhero as the protagonist group is notably not powered? Quite rational, and superpower system has coherent internal rules (as you might expect from a sanderson work).

    One Punch Man is fun and not aimed at kids but very much not rational and does not have a common meta origin for powers. Worth reading anyway IMO, or watching since the Anime is a fairly decent adaptation, but it's in many ways a parody.

    The Arrowverse is for the most part pretty solid place to start; none of the ones I've seen require you to be familiar with the rest of DC, or with the other parts of the arrowverse, to start a given series.

    I remember the *Zetman* manga being all kinds of good. If I recall correctly, it had a transforming street-smart hero and the ensuing conflict with an excessively upright man who became a hero because he disliked his methods. Don't remember what the actual plot was about but it had a dark feeling. Haven't seen the anime but I've read that it diverges in a bad way from the manga.

    I hesitate to recommend it but you might like *Jojo's Bizzare Adventure*. It is actually pretty good despite seeming to lack seriousness at times, venturing into respectable tragedy territory.

  Started (and caught up with) [Soulforged Dungeoneer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33054/soulforged-dungeoneer). LITRPG, urban fantasy, rational adjacent.

  Basic idea of the setting is it's this world, but there're dungeons made by... things not human, and you can go in, level up and stuff. Your powers work outside the dungeon, but the regular world doesn't give XP or the like. Entirely from the perspective of one character, and there's not many other characters (so far, although that's rapidly changing).

  I'd call it rational-adjacent. Characters (mostly) have distinct internal realities, the MC is solidly established in characterization, and the world is flirting with "large consequences" sort of things. Probably one of the first works by this author, and I'm excited to see where it goes.

    > Also, a side question, why is ao3 filled with so much fanfiction based around relationships?

    Actually it's the other way round. Most fanfiction *in general* is about relationships, sites like Spacebattles and Alternate History are the exception.
    ```

  - u/MICHA321:
    ```
    A lot of fanfiction arises out of a need to "fix" things. Most fanfiction is written and consumed by teenagers. Because teenagers are horny and sex obsessed, most of the ones who have problems with a work tend to have problems with the relationships depicted. This is why most of fanfiction ends up being something fairly similar to canon, except with new, "fixed," relationships.
    ```

  - u/alphanumericsprawl:
    ```
    AO3 is female dominated, while spacebattles and ffn are male dominated and more balanced respectively. I think. Relatively speaking, women are more interested in relationships and sex while men are more interested in power and plot.

    If you go to Harry Potter on AO3 and search by kudos, you get 10 Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter stories before the first non Draco/Potter story. Of course, that's just Riddle/Potter. It's just slash as far as you care to look.

    On FFN, the highest ranked story in the HP fandom by favorites is some angsty Granger/Malfoy story. But second is HPMOR! And then we have a whole bunch of other plot fics. No visible slash of any kind. Main trend is Potter getting stronger somehow, Ron-bashing and so on. 

    On spacebattles, using first message reaction count as a crude mechanism for popularity, we're engulfed in a sea of Worm. If you do it by reply count, then it's Gamer, self-inserts, Worm and power-fantasy generally. Nearly all relationships are heterosexual as far as I can tell.

  https://www.amazon.de/dp/1409191133/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_rrWhFbZV5SPNR

  Here is why I am not sure:
  -its not realy rational, more a dystopian satyrical society extrapolation and critique
  -I dont know the english version, only the german original
  -I didnt read it, only heard the audiobook. Its done by the author himself, who is realy, realy good at this.

  The author studied philosophy and is very political, so some of the characters say some remarkable stuff. But be warned. I gather most americans would consider him an dangerous communist. From german standpoint he is somewhat left.

    * [Reign of the Serpent](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent), describes a pretty dark timeline where hogwarts (and wizarding society) is incredibly stratified and students have to fight and maneuver for power and prestige.

    I cannot recommend the *Young Wizards* series highly enough - as well as being generally excellent, the magic system is *just* defined enough to avoid 'fridge logic' but soft enough to let you think about theme or cost rather than trying to work out exploits.

    IMO it really nails both the humanist sensibilities of rationalist fiction, as well as the sense that the universe is basically a lawful thing subject to cause and effect - even with magic available.  Doesn't do the "teach you to think" thing in the usual rationalist way, but shows you what people feel when doing good instead.

    Those are a lot of conditions, so my recommendations will be slightly off the beaten path. The first two meet the POV condition, the last two I've watned to rec for awhile and so are more directed out at the rest of the sub.

    - [Chronicles of Amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber) — Plot synopsis would be a spoiler for the first book. Fast-paced and interesting premise. Feel free to stop after the first five books, which are self-contained.
    - [One for the Morning Glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_for_the_Morning_Glory) — Rational adjacent. In a fantasy kingdom, characters know they're living out stories. Played for humor and eventually pathos. First few pages alone are worth the price of admission, in my opinion. Memorable. The invented vocabulary and malapropisms are a lot of fun if you enjoy that kind of thing. "The Maid might have had something to say, but it was drowned out in the wicked skrang! of the Captain's escree coming out of its scabbard and the shriek of its slicing air."
    - [Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthsea) — Very short books, almost novellas, about a wizard in an archipelago. The scope of his actions is small but kind of universal at the same time. Meditative, good quarantine reads. Spare and beautiful prose. You may come up with words like "humanistic" when you describe it later. Rewards rereading.
    - [Prince of Nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Nothing) — If you want a palette cleanser after Earthsea (too much humanism), this is probably it. Rational. These books are scary like Stross's **Accelerando** is scary, except instead of "turn all matter into computronium" it's "hell is literally real and morality is based on consensus." There is a rationalist munchkin-type character who takes a bit of a backseat after ramping up but is replaced by some similar characters. This isn't grimdark, it's vantablack. Intellectually rewarding, Bakker is a trained philosopher and the magic system and metaphysics are based on ancient Greek concepts like the onta, paradox, analogy, and logos, plus an additional system based on biophysics. Challenging.
    - [Malazan Book of the Fallen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen) — If worldbuilding is your thing, and you can tolerate a puzzle. I made a post about the magic system in a [thread awhile back](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/84iybe/confusion_on_gardens_of_the_moon/dvq6meq/). If Bakker is based on philosophy and Martin is based on history, then this is anthropology. Big focus on gods, cultural clashes, and the distant past affecting the present. Nothing is explained, so put on your hermaneutics hat and get out there. The first book isn't that great, I recommend starting with **Deadhouse Gates**. You might feel like you're missing some essential context reading that—you're not, nothing is explicitly explained, so just work on figuring things out yourself or, if you can't tolerate that, go to the wiki and gorge yourself. Series probably peaks in the middle, each book is self-contained. Somewhat (ok, very) inconsistent writing, with quotable quotes alternating with dross. This is a book to read if you like crazy fantasy stuff like a sword that imprisons souls, which go to a self-contained world to pull a giant cart, and on that giant cart, recursively, is the main world in which the sword resides, and all of this isn't really even that important to the setting and not a Godotian metaphor. Or a dude who destroyed a continent he ruled 100,000 years ago, and was cursed to walk the realms for all eternity and have all his works turn to ashes, and he's just kicking around as someone's second in command. Or an immortal dragon who shows up after thousands of years but, sorry, now it's the fantasy renaissance or whatever and you're going to get blown up by some guy named Fiddler with a grenade launcher.

    I've got more, but I'm theoretically on the clock here.

      > "hell is literally real and morality is based on consensus." 

      I don't think it's consensus, really. It's just the system postulated by the Bible (or most religious texts) taken 100% seriously. There's a god (or gods), they have opinions on morality, and those opinions determine the fate of your moral soul. And it turns out that those opinions are (intentionally, and quite realistically for the timeframe) massively and horrifyingly divergent from what the vast majority of readers believe. And for extra cosmic horror, if you're not damned, your soul gets eaten by the gods. The setup of the series is basically "what if the universe operated in a way that was fundamentally evil".

      I want to second the Chronicles of Amber. It's got a well done amnesia plot, the characters
       are well fleshed out, the world building is interesting. It's a bit older but well written.

      Vantablack is understating Prince of Nothing, if anything. It's grimmer than Worm, I swear.

        *Lord of Light* is by the same author as Chronicles of Amber, and also worth reading.

        And yeah, I don't think I've ever seen anything as dark as Prince of Nothing. Part of that is the sheer range of darkness. It's not just that the characters are bad, or the system they're living in is broken. It's *everything*. From the cosmology down to the individual characters. It's all just incredibly brutal. Which is not to say I don't recommend it, but it's probably the darkest thing you'll find to read.

    Fantasy, three main characters, 250k words and adding roughly 15k per week, not on RR/tvtropes/topwebfiction.

    Is it *rational*? No.  

    The world is really insistent on the point that it is a soft magic system, softer than even Harry Potter. It works off the basis that as long as you can convince the Spirits which make up everything that you should be allowed to do something, then you can do that thing.  
    However, by and large the rules are observed. Others and Practitioners can't lie without taking a hit to their power or their very existence, which means they usually don't. Most Others only have a couple of tricks that they use in really creative ways. People's capabilities only change in response to what they do and what happens to them, not for plot convenience.  
    The main characters often make not optimal decisions, because they are thirteen years old. These actions usually come with their logical consequences.
