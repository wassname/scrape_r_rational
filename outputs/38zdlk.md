## [D][HSF] Are alternate-history stories inherently rational?

### Post:

I was reading [this alternate-history story](http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=157898), and I was thinking that essentially all alternate-history stories of this type were essentially rational. From the sidebar's definition of a rational story...

> Nothing happens solely because "the plot requires it". If characters/powers do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

*Is* there even a plot in alternate-history stories of this kind? It's just "natural" (projected by the author) progression from the point of divergence, with (I assume) no endpoint in mind. Is the author at fault for throwing analogues of Churchill, Napoleon, Trevithick, Goodyear, and other historical figures into the timeline as nation-making and -breaking characters "to advance the plot"? Or can it be expected that such people will always naturally arise, and he's just giving coincidentally-familiar names to them to aid the reader's understanding?

> Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

Certainly, in the grand scale of alternate-history stories, everything is ideology-vs.-ideology, even up to the thoughts revolving in the minds of the leaders of countries. The author of the work linked above certainly puts a lot of words into talking about the motivations of the big characters (Napoleon-analogue wants fame, Carnot(?)-analogue is paranoid, Hitler-analogue is nationalist(?), etc.), and they don't *seem* to be obviously evil.

> The characters/powers solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

Revolutionary France wins a large battle due to steam-powered artillery--therefore Revolutionary France uses lots of steam engines--therefore steam power is widely adopted early on--therefore it's firmly entrenched as a method of moving minecarts around on rails in mines--therefore the image of confined mine-rails is so entrenched that no one in England can envision them running cross-country--therefore a disgruntled Trevithick leaves England and takes his ideas of cross-country railroads to Russia--therefore Russia is the leader in steam power later on. Is this "intelligent application of knowledge" on France's or England's or Russia's or Trevithick's part? Or did the author hand an Idiot Ball to one of those people/powers?

> The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

Here, though, the waters become a little murkier, I think. At what point does an alternate-history story become non-rational? Can we call *The Shape of Things to Come* or *The Iron Heel* or *1984* or *Atlas Shrugged* "rational" if we assume that humans' minds in those stories are significantly different from ours, as long as the stories themselves remain internally consistent?

I was just wondering whether anyone else had opinions on the topic.

  Generally speaking, alt-history does a lot better than any other sub-genre of speculative fiction. The biggest reason for this is that the authors who have an interest in alt-history also have an interest in history itself, which usually means having a more analytical mind, and often means better exercising empathy for people (because you want to know what life was actually like during the American Revolutionary War, so you go reading soldiers journals instead of imagining them as heroes). If you really care about history, you're less likely to view things in black and white, because you're driven by a need to understand.

  Which is not to say that people can't screw it up. *Sometimes* alt-history is just a way of projecting the author's own personal politics onto a world of their own creation. There's a sub-genre of alt-history where the point of divergence is a group of people getting sent back in time with no hope of return to the future, and often these people are American military, and often the plot and characterization warps itself around how great the American military is.

  By and large though, most alt-history novels can be summed up with, "What if *X*?" which tends to make them rule-based, and which in turn tends to push them more toward "rational".

    My summary of the points of advice in that thread you helpfully linked, from you and others.

    One should make sure technology advances beyond the modern day in time travel stories so there can be some excitement, not get too bogged down in the details of logistics.

    They should have a wide focus on all of the downstream effects of whatever change, rationally thinking of all the likely consequences.

    They can suffer from the average person not being very intelligent or rational in dealing with people. It's hard to write level 2 intelligence characters.

  Only if it is written well.

  Depends on if the person simply has a particular story and narrative they want to shoehorn into a particular situation, or if they're instead extrapolating from what people and countries might do in a given situation.
