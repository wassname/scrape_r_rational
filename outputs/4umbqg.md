  Golden Valkyrie gets the plot moving by dropping it down an elevator shaft, as is her way. If you pay careful attention to what she says, what she implies, and what she doesn't say, there are quite a few clues, for this book and the next.

    Why would you make a spear out of a black hole or BEC?  Hmm or are you going string theory on us?  I really do need to sit down and study again till I can understand/conceptualize string theory.

      Not going to spoiler anything, but it is interesting to read the speculation 8-).  The cryptic clues about Skybreaker's Spear will be revealed within 2 chapters, so you won't have to wait too long.

      Edit:  One thing I can say without spoilering anything:  Golden Valkyrie isn't particularly familiar with modern physics--her worldview is evocative and image-driven rather than scientific.  How she interprets whats she Sees is filtered through that.
