## Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik

### Post:

I had my book club (of non-rationalists) read *Shut Up And Do The Impossible, The Rational Fiction Online Anthology* edited by Eneasz Brodski. It was well received. Later we read Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik. It was selected because of "the nods to rational fiction."

#### Recommendation

I enjoyed it a great deal and think a lot of rational fiction readers would enjoy it as well. I was surprised it hasn't been mentioned on this subreddit before. I did find it recommended in the following discussion on r/fantasy.

[Could you recommend some fantasy books with main characters that have the slightest bit of common sense?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/hlmwre/could_you_recommend_some_fantasy_books_with_main/)

The three main characters are smart in diverse ways. The story is told from many perspectives and does a good job of getting you into the mind of the point of view character. Planning, learning, and applying intellect are rewarded.

Edit: I realized I should probably add more details in keeping with [this advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/napvym/think_hard_before_recommending_literature_here/).

There are three female protagonists.

* **Miryem**: Jewish daughter and granddaughter of money lenders. Middle class. Plain looking. Entrepreneurial and creative.
* **Wanda**: Daughter of an abusive farmer. Lower class. Plain looking. Physically strong. Fast learner. Views reading, writing, and math as magic.
* **Irina**: Daughter of the duke of Vysnia. Upper class aristocrat. Plain looking. Witty. Loves books. Politically and socially savvy. Good administrator.

All three protagonists are described as plain looking to make it clear that it's their minds that they use to reach their goals.

A light is shone on historical antisemitism. Jewish culture is explored a bit as well. The author's father's family were Lithuanian Jews, and her mother's were Polish Catholics.

As an aside, if you're a libertarian I think you would like this book even more. There are themes about self ownership, keeping contracts, and working for what you have.

* Many lament being possessed by others by circumstance of birth and seek to own themselves and keep what they work for. The practice of fathers "owning" their daughters and selling them to suitors is presented negatively.
* Sexual activity without mutual consent is repeatedly depicted as horrific.
* Those who borrow without intent to pay what they have borrowed are depicted as villainous.
* Fairness is measured by the exchange, not the exchangers.
* Willing charity is still depicted as good.

If you've already read it, then I'd like to know what you thought of it.

#### Quotes

>But the world I wanted wasn't the world I lived in, and if I would do nothing until I could repair every terrible thing at once, I would do nothing forever.

\---

>"My mother had enough magic to give me three blessings before she died," I said, and he instinctively bent in to hear it. "The first was wit; the second beauty, and the third—that fools should recognize neither."

\---

>The only thing that had ever done me any good in my father's house was thinking: no one had cared what I wanted, or whether I was happy. I'd had to find my own way to anything I wanted. I'd never been grateful for that before now, when what I wanted was my life.

\---

>I'd chosen- not the lesser evil, but the less immediate one.

\---

>I say to you, here are the dangers. Some are more likely than others. Weigh them, put them all together, and you will know the cost. Then you must say, is this what you owe?

\---

>"A servant is easy to make dishonest when they bring you coin and never touch any themselves," he said. "Let her feel that her fortune rises with yours."

  I enjoyedUprooted. I don't tend to like fairy tale reimaginings, but I'll give it a whirl. Others here might also enjoy Uprooted, the magic is interesting but it's not a hard system.

  I love this book. I’m not a fan of the ending, but it didn’t ruin the whole book for me. I like how the mythology is shown, and this is one of those books where magic and real life blended beautifully. 

  Its connection to rumpelstiltskin didn’t stick out to me, I was too into the mythology to notice.

  I agreed with what you said about the 3 main characters. By the middle part of the book, I already adore and root for them. And even if their small victories are followed by great consequences, their growth over their decisions are at the front and center.

  I love the >!hansel and gretel house!< and the way it was written. >!When I realized its connection to the house Magreta stays in, I had to put my ebook down and clap, haha!<

  The fact that the author never names who is the narrator of each chapter is a testament to how well defined these characters are. I can already guess them by the first paragraph except for >!Irina’s first chapter, it only clicked to me when the ring was mentioned again!<.
