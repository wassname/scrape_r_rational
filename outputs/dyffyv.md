    What's the game of champions?

      It's a Pok√©mon fanfiction by a user named L. Lamora. It borrows elements from the manga, the games and even the anime, and it has really engaging writing and world building. It was possibly the best Pokemon fanfiction out there, before the writer abandoned it. They still give small synopses of future plot, to give some sense of closure, as an alternative to writing it all in proper story format.

        Whoops, totally forgot context. [Previous thread announcing its untimely demise.](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a1ksb9/the_game_of_champions_is_doubleplus_deadfic_but/)
        ```

    Are we gonna keep getting these all the way end of the plot?

    Because for me, it's still good. With Lamora's fluff it'd be godlike, but just the plot details are good

      One of his comments mentioned there being 3 parts. So presumably the last update will be the last, forever

  God damn even just this summary format is so good. The death of this story is a loss of real art
  ```

- u/TacticalTable:
  ```
  Wow, I missed the summary update this got last time. Great to finally start getting closure on all of this, however bittersweet.

      Can you or someone else archive it somewhere more permanently? I haven't read the entire fic leading up to this yet.

        Author said he doesn't want people reuploading. But the link I included above has an EPUB copy and a search shows there's already a clone on FF.

  That unabashed heroism is very nice to see - anyone have other strong stories featuring it?
