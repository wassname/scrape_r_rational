  Came across the [author's FanFiction split of HPMOR](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10755550/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-cryptographic-key) from a comment in that subreddit. I enjoyed it enough to follow his plug for his own WIP novel, Artie. Bit of a "Ready Player One" feel to it, and 12 chapters in I am hooked. Looking forward to the weekly updates.

  Ok not bad so far. Some sentences are a bit complex and hard to follow, but it seems this trend drop as the story goes on.

  I wouldn't call this Hard Science Fiction yet, some of the technology is bit off, especially considering the whole domain and magic nonsense. I am on chapter 4 now, so that could all change. Cassandra and Cicero = maximum smugness.
  EDIT: and humor is pretty good too.

    Definitely tends towards hard science fiction! All will be explained :)
