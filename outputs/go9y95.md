  These are coming out faster than I can even write in-depth comments about them. Holy crap!

  We have to start by talking about Teavee's home, because he specifically calls out that the individual items in his home are things from the Dahl/gazemaize universe:

  >"A miniscule number of minds inside the world are designated as characters, and these are the only minds that can be abstracted. I am a character, and so are both of you. Minds who are not characters are real and have experiences in the same manner as us, and they can be affected by abstraction caused by others, but they cannot be salted or brined to be abstracted themselves. Most minds are not characters. Characters often have pivotal moments in their lives, which the GAG takes and forms into a coherent story to be experienced by those watching the pickle. Everything in this home is related to these pivotal moments."

  I take this to mean that every story written by Roald Dahl exists within the GAG (street pickle, road dill, pretty sure this is the right track) so as backup here's all the items tracked down from Mike Teavee's apartment:


  >There was a silver coat-rack, home to several silk umbrellas like the one the man had given her.

  These are the umbrellas from [The Umbrella Man](https://www.roalddahlfans.com/dahls-work/short-stories/the-umbrella-man/).

  >Six paintings hung on the wall, four of women. The smallest painting of the four, a woman brushing her hair, had been drawn on a canvas material Marama struggled to identify. It was strangely wrinkled.

  Edit: thanks /u/Makin- , I think these are indeed Chaim Soutine's paintings from Skin.

  >Hundreds of small glass jars stood on tall shelves. They were all empty.

  These are [the jars the BFG uses for dreams](https://i.imgur.com/r2D6Mxx.png).

  >A large empty cage with animal skeletons and taxidermies inside of it, all posed. There was a small newt, a parrot, dozens of snakes and tortoises and pheasants, two Muggle-Wump monkeys, and an old fox.

  The newt is from Matilda, the parrot is from The Landlady, the snakes are from The Snake Catcher, the tortoises are from Esio Trot, and the pheasants are from Danny, the Champion of the World. The Muggle-Wumps appear in The Enormous Crocodile, The Twits, and The Giraffe and Pelly and Me. The fox, of course, is the Fantastic Mr. Fox (which seems to confirm that Fantasticer Mr. Fox is not his secret identity.) 

  >On top of a broken commode, there was a piece of chalk, an old shiny piece of paper with faded text, many expired chocolate bars, a deck of playing cards, and a fishbowl with a small green crystal inside of it. It was glowing.

  The broken commode is from [Parson's Pleasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parson%27s_Pleasure_(short_story), the chalk is from Matilda again, the old shiny piece of paper is probably a golden ticket, the expired chocolate bars are from Mike Teavee's lifetime supply of chocolate. I'm not sure where the playing cards or the fishbowl are from, but the green crystal is a crocodile tongue from James and the Giant Peach. Edit: playing cards are Henry Sugar again of course, thanks /u/MowTom_ !

  >A REPORT ON AN INTERVIEW WITH IMHRAT KHAN, THE MAN WHO COULD SEE WITHOUT HIS EYES

  Reference to [The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar](https://www.roalddahlfans.com/dahls-work/short-stories/the-wonderful-story-of-henry-sugar/).

  >The Red Pony

  This is a real Steinbeck book. I haven't read it, not sure what the deal is there or why some pages are missing. Edit: Matilda reference again! Thanks /u/AnthropicSynchrotron.

  >ON THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF ROYAL JELLY

  Reference to [Royal Jelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Jelly_(short_story), a short story about... royal jelly.

  >LITTLE MATADOR

  M.H.'s seminal work within this GAG by God.

  >COLLECTED WORKS OF CHAIM SOUTINE

  An [actual guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Soutine) apparently. His work is referenced in [Skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_(short_story). The painting from Skin is the weird wrinkled painting Mike has (a woman brushing her hair on a strange canvas material.)

  >A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO TRUNCA

  One of JUROR's works, ob

  >THE UNSURPRISINGLY VIOLENT HISTORY OF OLYMPIC SHOT PUT

  The Trunchbull's wheelhouse.

  >101 RECIPES FOR COOKING LAMB

  Oblique [Lamb to the Slaughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_to_the_Slaughter) reference.

  >FINGERSMITHING

  Reference to [The Hitchhiker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitch-Hiker_(short_story)

  >THE MINPINS, TORTOISE-RELATED SEXUAL ESCAPADES, AND OTHER TOPICS NOBODY CARES ENOUGH ABOUT TO WANT TO SEE REFERENCED

  Reference to [The Minpins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minpins), and the tortoise sex stuff I thought was Rhyme Stew but while it's got sex stuff and a version of The Tortoise and the Hare, it's not a _sexual_ version of Tortoise and the Hare so I'm not sure. Edit: apparently there's more sex stuff in Esio Trot than I picked up from the summaries, thanks /u/The_Wadapan !

  >SALT, NOT SWEET: WHY I POLITELY TURNED WILLY WONKA DOWN ON HIS OFFER TO INHERIT HIS BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY, EVEN AFTER HE BEGGED ME

  Veruca's infamous kludged-together ghostwritten autobiography.

  >TO HUNT A WITCH

  [The Witches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witches_(novel) obviously.

  Phew, so, yeah, that's a lot of Dahl references. Like 23 Dahl references at least right there.

  Lines from last chapter that I can't let go by without comment--

  >"My body did not know it had grown," said Michael. "It kept trying to grow as if I was what he was before the stretching. I thought it was fun, at the time. Being tall, getting taller by the day. But the aches started, and my body began to fail… by sixteen I could no longer bend my knees. I have not sat once in all that time. It would kill me. My body has not left this locker in years."

  This is some Junji Ito shit.

  >"I want to know why I vape," said Mahuika, epexegetically.

  Epexegetically is my new favorite Dahloneologism.
  Edit: it's a real word what the fuck

  *inhale*

  Chapter 21!

  The Champion of the World is Danny, from Danny, the Champion of the World. He must have been a pretty good shot to have been taking out all those Knids.

  >Demons! They were crawling out of the ocean, giant red pigeons with four heads and wings made from scissors and mouths shoot out flaming moths!

  The mouse in the wheelchair has to be Bruno or the narrator from The Witches (or their descendants, or just someone else who got mouseified?)

  **Edit: Ok I just learned what the power of the woman with [the magic finger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Finger) is, it lets you swap arbitrary features between creatures. The Witch stole that power so I guess she's giving up on running the Presidency to build a kaiju instead. Phew, and that's just what's going on in the background.**

  >It escalated! It all escalated!

  This has to be an elevator/escalator thing. Or something. Hmmm.

  I wonder where Hogan comes from.

  >He fired for the purposes of art.

  JUROR gets his own wham line and I'm so so happy.

  >Mr. Bucket smiled and reached into his hat. It was a bullet.

  >Chili watched him bite it.

  >"One of my delicious Bullet Biters," said Mr. Bucket. "They have a delicious peanut butter flavor, and triple the cyanide of any other…"

  >Mr. Bucket's mouth began to foam. His eyes rolled back and he fell.

  Callback to Bucket saying he'd bite a more delicious bullet, also seemingly putting a bullet in theories that Bucket was a clone or the factory embodied or what have you. (Unless he's not really dead!)

  Ok so this chapter wasn't as heavy on Dahl references but gosh fuck was it heavy on... *udge *tion pickleverse lore.

  Speculation about the answer:

  Ok, the answer is going to have to follow Dahl logic. We know that if Mahuika had Teavee or Bucket's powers of abstraction, translation and execution, she could abstract the minds of all the remaining characters in the world, then translate and execute them into a paradise post-reality.

  However, she's Mahuika. She vapes. She'll do other stuff but keep in mind that doing her homework is at the very outside of what she's capable of. She's not going to be able to abstract, translate and execute even a single mind, much less convince the GAG that implementing Heaven is a good idea.

  No. She's going to need to do something outrageously punny and stupid which is absolutely and inarguably correct.

  Ruling out:

  * Eat the pickle (the world's about to end by itself anyway)

  * Tickle the pickle (naughty rhymes alone don't go quite far enough)

  * Vape the pickle (What?)

  Possible contenders:

  *  Kick the pickle (we know Mahuika is good enough at kicking to blow up a potato after three and a half months) once it's outside the Vinegar Solution, Lim can maybe abstract and change the messaging of the pickle? (too complicated, but I like that it takes advantage of Lim's mental abilities.)

  * Truncate the pickle, rendering it a pick, or pi

  Musings:

  Mahuika is and always has been a gag character, and canonically is a GAG character designed to be the ultimate GAG character. Mahuika vapes, and is one-dimensional, and *this is important to this pop quiz.*

  Anyway wow. In closing, bravo and holy shit.

  Edit: the solution might involve Mahuika immigrating to Wonkaland. Now that Bucket is dead can Chili authorize reopening of immigration? If not, Chili's citizenship might still be part of the answer. Wait, are they even technically in Wonkaland? They have to be, right?

  Edit: does Mr. Gun's shoes turning into chocolate mean the Chococlipper is finally loose?

  Edit2: they have Bucket's corpse and the story seems to want them all to die. Maybe they should all... kick the Bucket?
  ```

  - u/The_Wadapan:
    ```
    the "tortoise-rrelated sexual escapades" goof is a reference to Esio Trot, where a bloke seduces some woman by kidnapping her tortoise multiple times and gaslighting her

    (very impressed at all the short story references you found, as I never got around to reading any of those! I'm pretty sure the paintings will be from one of those, unless there's some minor beat in the children's books I'm forgetting)

    for the purposes of the final exam, however, I'd be very surprised if the solution relied on Dahl deeplore - the Mike chapter in particular is just taking the opportunity to check off basically every bit of Dahl-related source material, pointedly in a way that isn't fundamental to the story. Your suggestions for solutions are all great for widening the possibility space though, definitely worth submitting as reviews!
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      Oh, I didn't mean those items were necessary to the puzzle, just that the importance of the items in the lives of the characters they belonged to has some effect on the GAG which I think will be necessary in the solution. That is to say, we're at a pivotal moment and the magic this moment needs has something in common with umbrellas and crocodile tongues. 

      It doesn't have to be a Dahl *reference*, it just has to be the kind of joke Dahl would make, like how the President keeps getting the Wong number when he tries to call the Chinese premier in *Great Glass Elevator* (that bit was indeed really racist in the original book, but its moon logic is exactly what I'm talking about here.)

  I submitted the first thing that came to mind:

  >Mahuika: Vape and use the vinegar solution to abstract and tell the pickle to stop.  
  >  
  >This will work because the pickle wants a one-dimensional character, and Mahuika was selected using the formula - the problem was just that it was Bucket who talked to the pickle in abstraction, which confused it.

  Is this the right answer? Who knows.

  Now, from Chapter 5, immediately after the genie reveals the existence of the pickle:

  >"In your opinion, what is the most important thing I could possibly know?"  
  >  
  >Cleo received a vision of someone who knew the difference between desert and dessert.

  Bucket owns a chocolate factory (dessert). He believes everything that happens is deserved (desert). If the genie is right, and that this is the most important thing, then the answer has gotta lie here somewhere.

  Other possibilities:

  * This is Chilli and the Chocolate Factory, and Chilli initially wanted all the participants to die. Is the solution to die holding the pickle (the one fact about the character being that they are dead), a la Oul's egg?
  * The vape pen is chlorine-flavored. Do we have a source of sodium with which to make salt?
  * Offer Mr. Bucket to the pickle. He was chosen using the formula, there's only one fact about him that Chetan mentions (he's a bad person), and he's made of dessert.
  ```

  - u/JARSInc:
    ```
    When someone gets a **fair** punishment or reward, they are getting their "just deserts".  
    I'm almost certain that the answer has something to do with this phrase after the advice from the genie, particularly since I thought the phrase was "just desserts" until I just looked it up a minute ago.  
    Still have no idea how that can help with a command for Mahuika.
    ```

    - u/matcn:
      ```
      that's the problem with Charlie, he never figured out the difference between just deserts and jest desserts.
      ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Great catch, bringing back the genie. All I have to add is that desserts go at the end. So the difference between endings and what is deserved.
    ```

    this does seem super important. good callback.

  - u/__2BR02B__:
    ```
    I think the salt thing is probably key. The pickle has a hard time understanding people outside of abstraction, after all. Could she use sodium from the pickle? Hell, maybe Mahuika should just eat the pickle entirely.

  My guess is: Mahuika:Ask the pickle why you vape.

  Mahuika is no longer a one-dimensional character, because she wants to vape, and she wants to know why she vapes, which she never actually learned.

  Once she knows why she vapes, she will be a one-dimensional character again.

  This also only requires Mahuika to advance her own interests.

  ```
  "Vape and stop the pickle with," said JUROR.

  Mahuika listened, and stopped the pickle with

  __

  "Vape and help me have a Fudge Revelation!" said Chili.

  Mahuika listened. She pulled Chili with her as they went inside the nearest Emergency Bathroom For Wonkaland Citizens. After a few nerve-wracking seconds, they came out.

  "Man oh man," said Chili as he walked out of the bathroom. "You guys might want to give it a minute. Dropped a real Fudge Revelation in there, if you know what I mean." The pickle exploded.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    one thing i've not noticed anyone (??) here say is how uncharacteristic this all seems, the children all unceremoniously came back from the dead, the VIPs are here, chili learnt The Power Of Love at the last second, everyone fights dramatically against the BBEG, it all feels dangerously surreal. the HPMOR final exam parody doesn't stretch my belief of what a 'normal' Chili chapter would have as much, but it still adds on a little to the suspicion.

    makinporing said he thinks it's a fake chapter meant to troll us, and it lines up with my observations pretty well.
    ```

- u/honoredb:
  ```
  I laughed with delight at the Final Exam. It's been too long. And of course, they're Still ^(In) ^(The) ^(Abstraction) ^(Room).

  Reading over the text to see what its definition of "correct" is, we encounter the Correct Person, in chapter 7. The Correct Person's two statements are that an unfinished painting is bad (so we know they're on our side) and that all the winners love something more than anyone else in the entire world. This wasn't Bucket's winning criteria, but it was probably part of the GAG's winning criteria, so it does seem important.

  &#x200B;

  Also potentially important: Bucket tells the children that if they're confused about whether something is made of chocolate, it is. The pickle might be made of chocolate.

  &#x200B;

  This doesn't feel quite right, but it seems like the pickle wants something like unfulfilled desire (the engine of narrative, after all). Mahuika vapes, rather than wants to vape, so she's not quite right. The others have maybe fulfilled their desires already: JUROR truncated himself in the service of art, Keerthi was true to herself, Tide learned that her parents valued love above their academic pursuits, Lim listened to Chopin. Chili wants to be loved, which is why he's the true answer to the formula. Hogan didn't count because he'd probably gotten to eat chocolate, living in a chocolate factory. Or because he'd finally gotten his hands on some chocolate when he touched the chocolate pickle.

  I really should've seen this ending in a pop quiz coming.

  Can someone explain why pickles?

  The succession of GAG versions, from actions -> characters -> worldbuilding, seems like it should be some sort of meta-commentary on this community (or similar), since I think mainstream literary critique would've put characters at the highest level, not worldbuilding. Is there something that a better machine should produce, according to those tastes? Proactivity, munchkinry, transhumanist rants?

  Edit: I forgot to mention due to mystery hype, but that English or American breakfast joke was really something else.

  The problem with trying to solve this for me is that when I go back and look for clues, and can't tell whether what I'm reading is a clue or a Dahl reference I don't get. It would be nice if the author clarified whether or not the solution requires Dahl background knowledge.

  What was that Happiness Central stuff about? Y'know, the rival vape-juice maker. Did that ever got resolved?

  I'm piecing something together. You guys might have already got it. From chapter 16:

  "We make bombs and jeans and pollution! If we make it, with only two exceptions, we make it the best! Better than everyone else!"

  "I vape," said Mahuika. "Yes," \[Bucket\] admitted. "Vapes and..."He shook his head. "It does not matter!

  So I think the other product is One Dimensional Characters. Maybe? Hang on...

  Edit: If you look at each of the flavors Mahuika vapes in the factory, is there a pattern?

  Sarsparilla, Sardines, Chlorine, probably others...

  Edit: Chapter 21. It seems to me that Chili's real first name (we know it isn't really chili from the contract scene) is Charlie. That seems to be what Wonka is implying when he says "Chili, this was always Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!"

  *Stuff I haven't figured out which might be crucial to the solution or maybe is just something that was resolved but I didn't notice:*

  Chili's birth name

  Why the Hogan Sacrifice failed (edit: charlie thinks it was because he wasn't a contest winner like Mahuika is.)

  Why did Bucket need to turn into vinegar to see if the pickle would except Mahuika as fuel?

  Why does the pickle want a one dimensional character?

  Who made Mahuika vape? (this is probably **really** important, tomorrow I'm going to look for more clues about it)

  How did Bucket turn into vinegar outside the abstraction room? Are they still in it?

  **If so then that's the solution**.

  Edit:

  *More questions*

  Why does the pickle need the one dimensional character to be a contest winner? Does the pickle actually want that, or does Charlie just think it does?

    Charlie says it wasn't him, and Charlie seems to have seen fit never to *lie*, preferring to mislead (even in outright deceptive ways, like a device with a button which is not "used" by pressing the button.) In the literal sense, we know it was Villemain, the babysitter, who provided the vapes to the Jewel family. Villemain might be key. I can't find anything when I search Villemain with Roald Dahl, and the real Villemain was a French politician. Who is she and why is she such a good babysitter? She's not the grand high witch unless the grand high witch found a way to turn back into a humanoid and not to need to wear a mask anymore.

    When you take the word "villain," cut it in half, and put "me" in there backwards, you get Villemain. Food for thought. 

    >How did Bucket turn into vinegar outside the abstraction room? Are they still in it?

    I took this to be because they're in the domain of the GAG beyond Minusland, out in the territory where Science is Wrong and there is no lava or heat, just salt and vinegar. That doesn't mean you're wrong, but it's consistent with what we know so far.

    New theory: I think it might be important to work out Mahuika's timeline. She started vaping when she was five. What year was that, and what else happened that year? If we answer those questions, we might figure out why she started vaping.

    Edit: Mahuika is 17 years old now. So she started vaping about 12 years ago. Which is... ~~2024~~ 2022, I think? Bucket says that Wonka died in 2005, "almost thirty years ago".

    I wish there was a way I could search the whole story, instead of going chapter by chapter.

  On the one hand, I'm kind of skeptical that whatever the answer turns out to be is something that the community could be reasonably expected to guess. My guess points heavily towards "gazemaize is fucking with us".

  On the other hand, the exact same thing was true for the "touch the actual screen with chocolate" riddle, and yet someone guessed it on chapter two, so I don't know. People who follow this fic are *really* creative.

  >"Keerthi," said Mr. Bucket. "Your parents were crying. I am not sure what got them because my cameras stopped working. I only have the audio. You are a smart puzzle solver! Listen with me."

  >Mr. Bucket took off his head and threw it in the air. It floated and began to play the sound of a man and a woman shrieking together. Something could be heard dripping.

  >Keerthi burst into tears and buried her head into her knees, her hands over her ears.


  This is a callback to chapter 14:

  >"If someone told you that you were going to have to die, and they gave you a choice to either burn to death or drown to death, which would you pick?"

  >Nobody answered.

  >"Why aren't you answering?" asked Mr. Bucket.

  >"We assume that you are going to burn us to death or drown us to death if we do," said Tide.

  >"I promise that I won't if you all answer," said Mr. Bucket. "What do you say! Who is for the burning? Raise your hands."

  >Lim and Mahuika raised their hands.

  > ".... you two! Why did you pick the drowning?"

  >"Ocean's embrace would be a peaceful exit," said Tide.

  >"The moths," said Keerthi.

  Bucket kept his word and didn't drown the children, but he did drown Keerthi's parents, a fate she unwittingly chose for them.

  I just had a dumb thought while re-reading chapter 9:

  >"Mr. Bucket," Keerthi finally said. "Why did you hold this contest?"

  >"The answer is simple," said Mr. Bucket.

  Is the answer just the word "simple"?

  Should Mahuika’s action be a fulfillment of “The Formula”? Or a subversion? And what is the Formula in the first place—just the plot to the book?

  This was a fantastic chapter, but I have no idea how we’re getting out of this pickle.

  >Marama had tried that too, as had everyone in the family. It didn't work. It was impossible to direct her to take any action that would create true autonomy or interfere with her vaping. Extended or complicated commands didn't work either. Each order was only good for several hours.

  If we give her an order, we will have to understand why it works. Damn. I was hoping we could do something like "vape and don't stop vaping," which would require the world continue to exist.
  ```

- u/OnlyEvonix:
  ```
  Hmm, perhaps Mahuika's excess property is being named Mahuika, thus she should be told to "Vape and cease being Mahuika"
  ```

- u/JanDis42:
  ```
  My two cents:

  - Mahuika is also the name of a fire goddess. This ties in with her vaping, but maybe also with being in the middle of the earth?

  - Charlie tried to *desert* the world and got his *just dessert*

  - I think the pickle is Roald Dahl (after all, Charlie said they were *going Solo* in the last chapter) and the offering needs a main character to work. I.e. the whole world is a metaphor for Roald Dahls creative process and will only continue existing if there is a character having a worthy story. This is why a formula is needed (like the heroes journey or similar).

  Since Roald Dahl is known for having pure hearted children in his stories, Mahuika does not qualify. While she is uncomplicated enough to be written about she is not suitable as a main character, because she vapes.


  Also, since Mahuika is vaping Chlorine and vinegar consists of acetic acid, we could produce Chloroacetic acids, which in turn can create RNA? (no idea if this is true, just googling a lot)

  Edit: And RNA is rather one dimensional :D might be a stretch though

  This is the perfect way to end a rationalist fanfic... I’m almost attempted to give an incomplete answer so the story will be incomplete for the sake of trunc 

  ...but on the other hand I want to see the epic pun based ending (I’m pretty sure the concise explanation stipulation means everything will be wrapped up in one liner pun... but on the other hand we had the chocolate and Wonka vision answe to the puzzle fakeout in the earlier chapters so I don’t trust it to be that straightforward.). The authors note asks for it to be in the form of a review, and fanfiction.net permits multiple anonymous reviews, so as long as I don’t overwhelm gazemaize with reviews I can spam all the puns.  As an added bonus gazemaize will get a small fraction closer to the number of reviews they actually deserve.
  ```

- u/Revlar:
  ```
  Mahuika, vape yourself to abstraction, then make use of your won-by-repetition vaping power to vape your and everyone else's way out of this pickle.

  This will succeed because her powers have not yet been defined in the GAG.
