  ```
  > He concentrated the fire in his hand into a small jet blade two inches long

  He can make *black fire*?

  'Jet' is also a synonym for 'black'.  So this leaves me wondering if he has some new variant of Firebending we've not seen before. or if the flame is like a little jet engine in his hand. 

  If the former, it would probably be best to go with 'jet-black blade'.  If the latter, probably best to change it to 'jet-like blade'.

    Thanks for letting me know. I'll change it. I meant to mean jet-like blade like the fire daggers he had when fighting Azula. Thanks again.

      No problem.

      Also, nice job including the White and Red Lotus's early.  It's nice to see that ancient centuries-spanning secret societies can be foreshadowed or at least mentioned early on in a series where they exist.  The original writers did fine with the Whites, but introducing the Reds way later in Korra after so much stuff happened and expecting us to believe they had always been there was just silly.

        Thanks. I agree that introducing the Red Lotus late in the game was a silly move. I might use some of the Korra Red Lotus members in the fic.
        ```

          To be honest, it was less "introducing Red Lotus late in the game" and more "making up Red Lotus on the spot late in the game". Foreshadowing is sort of like a literary proof-of-work. It's difficult on the part of the author, and ideally hard to decode for a first time reader, but provides direct, incontrovertible evidence that the story was well thought-out. I'm not willing to accept an author planned something unless they foreshadow it.
          ```

            It's definitely the case that they did not plan the Red Lotus in advance. Legend of Korra was originally just going to be one season.

    In the UK butane torch lighters are sometimes called jet lighters, I think that's the image I'd have when reading jet blade

      It's all good.  

      In Avatar canon, he used a jet-like blade later, so it's no surprise if in this rational version he learns it a little sooner.  But also in Avatar canon, his sister Azula learned a technique for making *blue* flame, so it's no surprise in this rational version if he developed a completely different technique of his own.

      That part above was simply a moment where my brain came to a complete stop as it could have easily gone *either way*, and I wasn't sure which was the intent.

  BTW, in Ch2 (Search and Discover):

  > It will be night soon tell the helmsman to get use there as quickly as possible Also make sure to send the two my regards.

  “Get us there”. And the punctuation marks have fallen out =)
  ```

  - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
    ```
    Thanks for finding that. I'll have it corrected as quickly as possible.
    ```

    - u/alexshpilkin:
      ```
      Sure, and no need to hurry I guess. Two more in Ch4 (New world, new rules — does this need a comma?):

      > Katara, do you know what you wanted to do that ice ball?

      “To do to that ice ball”?

      > the fact that if the first law of thermodynamics held, they would have both died instantly or this was a universe that gave a middle finger to a fundamental law

      Comma before “or”? and maybe “or that this was”.
      ```
