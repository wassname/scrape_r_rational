## Worm... Has A Few Problems

### Post:

Firstly, I think *Worm* is a fantastic work of fiction, a fresh take on superheroes, and all-around praiseworthy. That said, I am not totally certain that it qualifies as either Rationalist or Rational. My general critique will not cover decisions made by individuals or small groups, which could concievably be wrong but for explicable reasons. I instead want to cover the two instances in which all of civilization messed up royally.


**1. THE ENDBRINGERS**

In the comments of [Extermination 8.2](http://parahumans.wordpress.com/2012/03/06/extermination-8-2/#comments), *gwern* and *greatwyrmgold* debate the merits of using ICBMs retrofitted with re-entry capsules to move unusually powerful capes from Africa to the sites of Endbringer attacks. It's an interesting argument, based on whether the technique itself is plausible, and whether sacrificing a cape who could engage an Endbringer for one second would be worth it in terms of property damage prevented. You'll have to read it yourselves to understand both sides properly. Unfortunately, the merits of their propositions do not matter in the slightest, because Tinkers could not only make the machinery work to improbable standards of usefulness, but they could do away with the need for capes to participate at all.

Consider Dragon. Her general limits do not include a cap on the number of individual robots controlled, so why not create thousands of Dragons, each optimally suited to fighting *en masse*?

Consider Armsmaster. He invents a weapon capable of physically dismantling Leviathan. (Or molecularly. Whatever.) If neutralizing them that way isn't worth considering as a means of killing them, I don't know what is. So after he decides to be the Big Damn Hero and almost succeeds, ~~somewhat~~ supremely unethically, you'd think that he'd be put to work mass-producing more of those anti-Endbringer things, right? Remember, Taylor used it without him, so he doesn't need to be physically present for their operation (this might have a time limit, but it'd be at least a few minutes long). Sadly, he ends up being put to work on software that is almost worthless in comparison, and then gets badly mutilated by a serial killer while in detainment.

Consider [the Simurgh](http://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/%C2%AD-arc-10-parasite/10-x-bonus-interlude/) in an interlude, where Dragon describes her as being 315km above Spain, docile, "beyond the limits of conventonal weapons." Putting aside whether that's actually outside the range of conventional weaponry, the solution here is to *build unconventional weapons, because you are a Tinker and an AI*.

Forgive me if I missed the part where it explained that Endbringers had to be fought by capes specifically for some esoteric reason, or if they deliberately obfuscate any other solutions for their existence. Relying on Scion to solve the problem every single time just seems... stupid. Especially given that the government employs both Tinkers and Thinkers, not that you'd know it...


**2. VILLAINS IN GENERAL**

The Birdcage, an inescapable prison designed for supervillains that cannot be held in any normal Supermax, is the very definition of 'because the plot requires it'. Supervillains in general are apparently tolerated for their usefulness in Endbringer fights, but what about capes like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse 9? I seem to recall some villains being characterized as "so dangerous, you could shoot them in their sleep and call it self-defence." If Marquis (for instance) cannot possibly ever be released, and has a body count, why not execute him? I am against the policy of capital punishment in general, but I'd make an exception for Lung, if he existed.

Speaking of Lung, why is he never just shot by the police? Or the National Guard? Or the Army? He may be immune to small-arms fire even at the beginning of a fight, but why not assassinate him from a block away, while he's asleep, with a bullet calibre suitable for anti-tank weaponry?

I think the problem is that heroes go to the trouble of bringing in criminals alive. This is a good idea in Real Life, but not if your target can kill you by snapping their fingers and making your skull implode. If the sort of highly-trained professionals who evidently do not exist in *Worm* were to try to kill Shatterbird, or Burnscar, or Bonesaw, or Jack Slash, or Cherish, knowing all the relevant details (and they would, because Wikipedia is a powerful force for good), there would be no contest. The Siberian, Mannequin, Hookwolf, and other sorts of generally resiliant capes would be harder, but without even expending any cognitive effort whatsoever on a solution, I think Armsmaster's Ã¼berweapon would work.

For Crawler and Butcher, you would have to be more creative than I feel like right now. Maybe launch them into space? Get Crawler to adaptively regenerate himself into something that's totally useless (e.g. increase his mass to the point he can no longer move)? Find a volunteer to kill Butcher, who then commits suicide?

Nilbog might actually warrant thermonuclear attention.

Taylor Hebert complains a lot that Tinkers have an unfair advantage because they have infinite potential, but I am of the opinion that there is no evidence for this. There are five Tinkers in Brockton Bay alone, which accounts for who-even-knows how many worldwide, and the world doesn't look appreciably different for having supernatural technological insight in any way. Bear in mind here that Tinkers can optionally reduce their own effectiveness in exchange for allowing their designs to be understood by the unwashed masses. What I'm trying to get at is that heroes need to leave the villains to men with guns, and use their talents to better humanity. Out of every cape ever mentioned, it's actually harder to find ones whose powers are useless outside of combat than those who have auxiliary potential.


**SO...**


In summary, I don't feel that *Worm* meets the standard of plausible motivation, nor the standard of optimal use of resources (is that a thing? I think intelligent behaviour is probably a prerequisite for Rational fiction). Please, let me know what you think!

**EDIT:** Both /u/CaptainLoggers, /u/thakil, and /u/alexanderwales pointed out that *Worm* is not rational, but still really good. *Yes*. That said, if all of humanity is facing the sort of threat posed by the Endbringers and the Slaughterhouse 9, I shouldn't be able to come up with plausibly better approaches to dealing with them *as I'm reading it*.

### Comments:

  ```
  Won't do a lengthy point-by-point, but to throw out a few obvious things...

  the "useless" software armsmaster was working on was unchaining dragon, which is what made it possible for dragon to operate multiple suits at once, which you cited before that as a game-breaker.

  They don't just leave it to scion; it was said that scion actually didn't even show up for most endbringer fights, because at that point he was mindlessly addressing whatever problems happened to be closest, with no sense of scale or priority.

  Your assertion that tinkers can "optionally reduce  their own effectiveness in exchange for allowing their designs to be understood by the unwashed masses" doesn't seem to have any basis in canon. They are not prodigies who are able to work from known technology through to super-advanced tech, they are being directly fed top-level understanding without having worked through the underlying science. They are engineers, not scientists, and they work intuitively, not from a solid theoretical backing, which is probably why their tech ends up being fiddly and requires so much maintenance.

  I'm not saying your premise is wrong; there are certainly flaws in the conception of the universe of Worm. Some of those flaws are deliberate design choices, however, necessary conceits based on the premise and goals of the story, notably the truce with villains. Others are just plain flaws. I'm just saying that you ought to take more care to avoid flaws in your analysis of other works' flaws. 

  :edit: trimmed and reworded a bit of redundant and potentially confusing language.

    Yeah, I noticed a number of problems as well. For one thing, the S9 did have a kill order on them. Anyone who wanted to could claim a huge reward for the kill on them and walk out without being molested, regardless of their past. Wildbow had a post about this, and even said Bakuda had a kill order on her when she was brought down, although it wasn't mentioned in story. 

    In regards to the Simurgh, she has telekinesis. Any weapons they launch at her would be pretty easily redirected by her. Plus, she has the ability to see the future. She doesnt need to be anywhere near where the weapons will be, and any weapon powerful enough to really hurt the end bringers would be most likely be targeted by them. Capes are really the only ones strong enough to actually get near her without being thrown out. The rest of the end bringers are out of reach when they are regenerating.

    In regards to Lung and the prospect of killing him: you mean one of the handful of capes on the planet who can 1v1 an end bringer for an extended period of time, something Alexandria can't do, then come out alive, and only operates a fairly small time gang in a single city? Kill him? Sure.

    I do agree that Worm could use a very large edit to clarify a variety of things, and resolve some inconsistencies, but these criticisms generally were founded on incorrect premises or didn't really think through the problems better than the author.
    ```

    - u/Terkala:
      ```
      The issue with Lung operating a small time gang was addressed though. He has several problems that prevented him from being bigger.

      1. His power takes a long time to charge up. He can take Alexandria in a fight, but only if that fight goes on for 15 minutes. In the first few seconds of a fight, any mid-level hero could probably beat him to a pulp. Especially if they knew who they were up against.

      2. He sees things in the small scale. He'd rather vett a few close associates than build an organization that is self sustaining. I can see him having to "clean house" of anyone moderately disloyal pretty often.

      3. He has an average intelligence at best. He probably doesn't even realize point #2 about himself.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Yep. All of which is why he is a much bigger asset against end bringers than he is a threat to the rest of the world, and why he is allowed to live. It's the whole cops and robbers dynamic that is one of the central reasons why villains are allowed to live and the society functions as well as it does. When the true psychopaths come to town, both the cops and robbers band together to face them.
        ```

    - u/chthonicSceptre:
      ```
      I just wanted to point out stuff like, "For someone whose power is Winning, Contessa doesn't really accomplish that," and "Lung is only invincible after a few minutes of fighting, so why not shoot him immediately?" (His use against the Endbringers isn't worth the resk of letting him loose, in my opinion.)

      The Simurgh is a bit of a problem, but Leviathan and Behemoth and the others? Not so much. You could even, with optimal use of guys like Vista, Clockblocker, Myrddin, and Eidolon, neutralize them without killing them.
      ```

      - u/Versac:
        ```
        Cauldron accomplished a **huge** amount of worldbuilding behind the scenes. That this is not obvious is kinda the point. [Wildbow's commented on that matter rather directly.](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wormverse-ideas-recs-and-fic-discussion-thread-38.309181/page-35#post-15024820) 

        Clearly the PRT and perhaps Cauldron disagree on the usefulness of Lung (it is worth mentioning he succeeded in tanking against *Scion* for a double digit number of seconds). Notably, both parties have Thinkers that can confirm that Lung isn't likely to go on an extended rampage, so it isn't much of a gamble.

        There's a recurring theme in Endbringer fights that whenever you figure out a way to beat them they escalate and pull out some new trick. Maybe you manage to levitate Leviathan away from a water source while neutralizing his echo... and then half your defending capes explode into pink mist. Oops, so much for the Manton effect. I think you can imagine even worse outcomes with a little effort.
        ```

  - u/chthonicSceptre:
    ```
    I think that, from Armsmaster's perspective, producing more of the anti-Endbringer weapons should have been the highest priority by far.

    If Scion *doesn't* end most Endbringer fights, what usually happens? Do the heroes drive the Endbringer off? Or do the Endbringers cause the requisite amount of carnage? See, four major cities pwned per year since at least some time in the 1990s, with 1/4 of the defending capes going down as well, doesn't sound very sustainable. There have to have been *some* advances in Kaiju-fighting since then.

    Tinkers can, in fact, produce sensible technology when the situation requires it. The PRT containment foam, for instance. Bakuda comments on the design of the restraining collars in the Canary Interlude, to this effect. I put the links... somewhere else in the thread, I guess.

    My analysis of *Worm* is that it is not Rationalist nor Rational, because of the high number of amazingly stupid things that happen. It is indeed a fantastic work of fiction, I just felt that the characters in it were deconstructed!Superheroes, not rational!Superheroes. Does that work better?
    ```

    - u/GopherAtl:
      ```
      armsmaster shared the nanothorn tech with dragon before he even learned she was an AI. Since armsmaster's specialty does *not* include mass-production or low-maintenance tech, this was by far the most effective way to scale up applications of the technology.

      Endbringer fights end one of two ways; sometimes the heroes, primarily eidolon, drive them off. Sometimes they achieve their objectives and just wander off. 

      And of course it wasn't a sustainable strategy, everyone knew that. It was still the best strategy they had managed to come up with. Trying to take the fight to the endbringers wouldn't change the fact that their attacks were largely ineffective; it would just eliminate the down-time they normally get to recoup between attacks, speeding up humanity's destruction and giving them less time to hopefully come up with a better solution.

      Dragon produced the containment foam, and the other tech the prt used, including the collars and the version of armsmaster's tactical combat system being deployed in the mid-late series. Reverse-engineering other tinkers technology was dragon's specialty, and it seemed that in some important ways she actually understood their tech better than they did, or at least was better able to mass-produce it - her main constraint there being the shackles her creator had left her with. So as I said first, the best thing armsmaster could do was give the tech to dragon, and then help unshackle dragon so she could be even more effective at what she was already the best at doing.
      ```

- u/jcw33:
  ```
  I have to bring something up in regards to your comment on unconventional weaponry against the Simurgh. That's a terrible idea. She's an absurdly powerful precog and telekinetic with minimal blind spots. You'd more likely end up with a smoking crater on the ground than even a scratched Simurgh.
  ```

- u/tactical_retreat:
  ```
  I agree that Worm isn't exactly what I would call Rational fiction, but it is more self-consistent than you give it credit for.

  Regarding endbringers:

  Eliminating them isn't really a solution. In fact, eliminating them may be a net loss to humanity. For example, consider the events [spoiler](#s "after Behemoth is killed."). Things get worse because [spoiler](#s "now there are two new endbringers that they don't even know how to fight, on a faster rotation.") There is ample reason to believe that the people really in power might have known this could happen.


  Regarding villains:

  You bring up Lung, saying you'd have him assassinated. Are you forgetting that he single-handedly fought off Leviathan in Tokyo? The truce exists to ensure that the powerful villians can stick around to fight Endbringers when they show up.
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    > [Lung] single-handedly fought off Leviathan in Tokyo

    No, Lung *kept fighting* until the entire island was destroyed.  Letting Leviathan destroy a city and then leave would have been a better outcome.
    ```

    - u/Schnake_bitten:
      ```
      True, but we have the benefit of hindsight. For all the characters in the story knew, Lung was one of the very few capes who could fight an Endbringer one-on-one. Plus the fact that Lung only gets stronger as he fights should leave anyone to think that he might be a very good chance at killing an Endbringer.
      ```

  - u/WalkingHorror:
    ```
    I feel that from perspective of people not in power there is no reason whatsoever to not seek out Endbringers and keep them from full regeneration. It would be possible to keep them hibernating indefenitely or in worst case to cause an ahead of schedule attack by weakened foe, on our terms and our timing. Win-win, if not for [spoiler](#s " Eidolon's boredom.")
    ```

    - u/tactical_retreat:
      ```
      Depends on if you think Endbringers can really be killed, and for most of the story (and 10+ years of history in-story) it seems pretty unlikely. Even when [spoiler](#s "Behemoth is finally killed it's due to Scion's intervention, which would probably be less likely to occur in an aggressive rather than defensive situation.") 

      If you go out of your way to attack them and you don't succeed, you just threw away a lot of cape lives. If they don't alter their attack schedule it's a complete waste.

      The people really in power know there are probably more Endbringers waiting in the wings. Even if they're successful at killing one, if another replaces it, it's a net loss. They have humanity fighting a delaying action as they prep for [spoiler](#s "the big fight against scion"), so they're conserving cape lives and resources in general.
      ```

    - u/SaintPeter74:
      ```
      I thought it was explicitly stated that they didn't know where the Endbringers were most of the time?  Or that they were in accessible?  I thought one was in orbit and another was in the core of the planet or the deep ocean or something.
      ```

- u/CaptainLoggers:
  ```
  I'd like to preface this by saying spoilers for Worm all the way up to the conclusion. Look away all ye who haven't finished it. 

  Before I address individual points, let me first say that I agree that Worm isn't a "Rationalist" work, nor was it intended as one. It is a deconstructionist Superhero work, with the baggage and tropes that come with it.  Having said that, its deconstruction is gritty, makes an attempt at realism and realistic consequences, and the main characters act more rationally than a stereotypical comic book villain (with the exception of the Slaughterhouse 9, which is ironically what makes them so deadly).

  An oft repeated mantra of Tinkers is that they can't just hand out their gear or inventions or mass produce them because they require upkeep, be that because the gear is cobbled together by an excited person fueled more by excitement and ingenuity than rational methodical design or because the stuff is at least partially held together by magic or psychic powers or whatever you want to call the hero powers. This isn't a rule, but more of an excuse for why inventors would constantly take the field with their inventions to beat up doods rather than mass produce stuff to advance humanity. 

  And this leads to a core principle of Worm as a fictional work: it isn't designed to be a rational deconstruction of superhero fiction, or rationality applied perfectly to the genre. The author took a typical "superhero world" and asked "What rules would have to be in place for that behavior to be reasonable? What society and structure would have to spring up to support a typical superhero world? What consequences would that have?"

  Tinker equipment can't be mass produced easily and often requires a Tinker in field. Dragon has a massive set of rules and principles constraining her behavior and prohibiting her from participating in self replication past a certain point. 

  The Endbringers are a difficult issue because there's a few things going on there, all centered around the issue that the heroes aren't supposed to fight the Endbringers except when a city is being attacked. You can make up rules about it, like there's no point in aggravating the Endbringers when they're asleep or Smurgh is controlling people to act that way or there's a shard interaction that makes it all behave that way, and it's all stupid because why would you deal with a problem like that reactively instead of proactively but the answer is because that's the rule that makes the superhero genre work. A massive monster that can't be stopped, only pushed away, and it takes all the heroes and villains together. That's the way the Endbringers were designed, in universe and by the author. 

  The villains are the same deal. The Birdcage exists for three reasons: 1. Because it's a tangible, believable, possibly worse than death threat that the good guys can use as a deterrent and not feel bad about it. 2. Because there's evidence that it was planned all along as a place to store guys for Cauldron to use in an end of the world scenario, people who would play along if the world was at stake, exactly like they were,  and 3. Because the superhero universe says good guys can't kill unless the person is an unredeemable monster and even if the Birdcage isn't that different from death, the universe says that's an okay thing for GOOD GUYS to do.  

  And why haven't they killed the S9 or other class S threats by the time we, the readers, reach the universe? Because then we wouldn't have those guys to read about, or nobody with the incentive to figure it out has, or because the consequences of messing with Class S threats is worse than leaving them be (Bonesaw bioplagues, Nilbog contingencies, advancing the Endbringer attack timetable).

  Ultimately, it isn't rational, it isn't rationalist, and it's not even plausible using in universe rules, but that doesn't make it a bad work or a worthless work. It's just that that universe has a strange, senseless, contradictory set of rules that require the tenants of the "superhero genre" to work. 

  But that doesn't make it not a useful work to explore creativity or rational thinking, and it certainly doesn't make it a bad piece of fiction. It's just that the universe is written with the constraints of superhero fiction, and that means that sometimes stuff happens for the plot and people go irredeemably mad and everything can be blamed on a telepathic sky bird. That may be unsatisfying and it's certainly not rational or rationalist literature, but it wasn't written intended in that way.  

  TL;DR: Worm isn't a rational work, it's a deconstruction of the superhero genre that operates with a set of laws and with a set of characters which are inherently irrational in order to create a superhero universe. Having said that it's a great fictional work and a lot of fun, with tons of clever thinking, acting, and rationality in it, it just doesn't fit the bar for "rationalist literature" and that's okay.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    I like your comment for a variety of reasons, and would like to disagree on some points and expand upon others. 

    First, I think that Worm should be classified as a rational work, though certainly not rationalist which we both agree on, because generally the characters act according to clear goals and believe able personalities, and very rarely if ever do characters hold the idiot ball when their previous characterization would suggest that they should be intelligent.  There are certainly plenty of instances where groups or individuals act irrationally, but this is often explicitly acknowledged by some other group or person. 

    Panacea has one of the most useful powers of any hero, but doesn't use her power except for healing. Why? Because she simply is not creative and sets hard rules for herself that limit what she can do. This is rather irrational and ineffective, as was acknowledged by Skitter and I think Bonesaw. 

    Why does humanity not band together to fight the End bringers more effectively? Well, in case you missed half of what skitter says, it was repeatedly drilled into the reader that capes simply do not work as effectively in groups, and have massive issues cooperating on even a moderately large scale. There are only a few thousand or so capes in the world(iirc), and there are nearly as many competing factions. Just in Brockton Bay we have the Undersiders, wards/protectorate, ABB, E88, New Wave, Coil, and probably more that I'm forgetting, as well as any number of rogues like Parian. The only cohesive group with more than a dozen capes are the protectorate and wards, and they aren't exceeding that number by much and have plenty of issues internally.

    More about the rational side of things: the characters aren't divided into good or evil, with the main character starting off as a relatable villain who transitions into an absolute monster, and we know just about every step of her way there. Sure, there are heroes and villains, but the heroes are nearly as often as not as bad as the villains, and a few factions firmly say that they are eneither heroes nor villains. 

    Second, I want to expand on the S-class threat designation.

    So Nilbog and the S9 are two threats that have been mentioned here. Nilbog, although designated a class S threat, is relatively stable walled in his town. Yes, if he ever broke out he warrants an immediate show of absolute force, but until that happens he is of little threat. The suggested H-bomb could work, true. But given how durable capes can potentially be, and since not a huge amount is known about Nilbog, there is little reason to strike when there is the chance he could survive and retaliate. He has self replicating monstrosities, and any way to avoid those becoming loose is worth leaving one latent threat content to sleep.

    The S9 are another story. Like any class S threat, they are kill on sight. However, it isn't necessarily a good idea to seek them out, because of the Siberian. She, to the PRT's knowledge, is completely invincible, and can make anyone she is touching invincible as well. Bonesaw and Jack are one of the few things keeping her from doing more damage than she currently does. Bonesaw as well is explicitly said to have plagues stored within her body to be released if she dies. Jack keeps them two in line, to follow his rules and only do selective damage. Every other member of the 9 is expendable, and most of them do die. In conclusion, there is little point in going on the offensive towards them until the nature of the Siberian was revealed. Cauldron did not target them, and therefore the PRT as well, because they caused trigger events, which lead to more capes.
    ```

      > Cauldron did not target them, and therefore the PRT as well, because they caused trigger events, which lead to more capes.

      Not for trigger events, but for helping Cauldron to recruit good guys for their potions. Which of course was only for Cauldron's internal image, as the leadership only cared about creating more capes to fight Scion.

  >Consider Dragon. Her general limits do not include a cap on the number of individual robots controlled, so why not create thousands of Dragons, each optimally suited to fighting en masse?

  Tinkertech is extremely expensive, tricky to make, Dragon is heavily limited by her AI controls on how many robots she can make, Defiant aids her with that.

  >you'd think that he'd be put to work mass-producing more of those anti-Endbringer things, right?

  Tinker shards are heavily limited, in particular Scion's shards aren't good at mass production. Eden's tinker shards are more suited for mass production. As seen in the serial tinkers always want to focus on new ideas. Plus it's less effective against Behomoth, who has an energy aura that destroys things like tinker weapons, and Simurgh who has telekinesis to destroy things.


  >Consider the Simurgh[2] in an interlude, where Dragon describes her as being 315km above Spain, docile, "beyond the limits of conventonal weapons." Putting aside whether that's actually outside the range of conventional weaponry, the solution here is to build unconventional weapons, because you are a Tinker and an AI.

  This only works if you have the missile tinker tech line or laser tinker tech line.

  >Supervillains in general are apparently tolerated for their usefulness in Endbringer fights, but what about capes like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse 9?

  They have kill on sight orders and substantial bounties. You can't put a kill on sight order on everyone though or capes will not comply with them. You need a united force to stop endbringers and the S9.

  >Speaking of Lung, why is he never just shot by the police? Or the National Guard? Or the Army? He may be immune to small-arms fire even at the beginning of a fight, but why not assassinate him from a block away, while he's asleep, with a bullet calibre suitable for anti-tank weaponry?

  Because in his final form he can stop endbringers and he generally mostly attacks other gangs and capes. He's not a major threat.

  >If the sort of highly-trained professionals who evidently do not exist in Worm were to try to kill Shatterbird, or Burnscar, or Bonesaw, or Jack Slash, or Cherish, knowing all the relevant details (and they would, because Wikipedia is a powerful force for good), there would be no contest. 

  They have durability boosts from Bonesaw and Jack is pretty smart at dealing with threats. That said, they do have a high death rate. If Bonesaw goes all out she can release plagues that mass kill humans which means killing her is a dangerous activity.

  >For Crawler and Butcher

  Butcher doesn't have a kill order because she mostly attacks other capes, Crawler has the protection of the S9 and will resist any attempts to launch him into space. 

  >Nilbog might actually warrant thermonuclear attention.

  They got thinkers to check on that, the result was that this would result in mass death of humans due to a bioplague he created. He's not doing anything, better to just ignore him, check on him regularly.

  >There are five Tinkers in Brockton Bay alone, which accounts for who-even-knows how many worldwide, and the world doesn't look appreciably different for having supernatural technological insight in any way.

  Their main advantage is in personal combat tinkertech isn't reproducible despite what you say.

  No, Worm isn't *really* rational fiction. That's because it was never intended to be. And you can look at how Worm was constructed to see why it would be really hard for it to qualify.

  Worm's world was built backwards. Wildbow had an end result - superheroes in costume, fighting each other on the streets, with almost all of the tropes that you would expect if you had been exposed to superheroes through comic books. Everything else was built with this end result in mind, and if anything contradicted that end result, it needed to get massaged.

  So you get the Tinkers, who can make the cool tech, since that's a superhero trope. But there are a ton of problems with that from a worldbuilding standpoint, so instead of pushing the world to its logical conclusion, or scrapping the Tinkers, patches get applied until you might believe that all the stated conditions would lead to the desired end result.

  But you can see the rough edges where this patching process wasn't perfect, and Worm has flaws if you're checking it over for logic. That wasn't really the point of Worm though.
  ```

  - u/robobreasts:

    I agree with you, but Wildbow IMO does a *really good job* patching over.

    Take Star Trek.  Ships couldn't accelerate that fast without turning the crew to chunky salsa and tearing apart, so we get the Inertial Dampening Field and the Structural Integrity Field.  Do those make sense?  No, but it makes us stop asking questions, it's a non-answer that *sounds* like an answer, so we can continue our suspension of disbelief and enjoy the story.

    Unfortunately, Trek fails a lot in providing even that.

    Worm does a similar thing.  A lot of the issues boil down to:

    1. Capes are influenced by their shards.  They gravitate to conflict and fighting.

    2. They are already all messed up from their trigger events, so not acting particularly rational, and many capes are low-level idiot scumbags that just happen to have powers...

    3. Cauldron has an end-game about defeating Scion, and they really have no idea how to do it, since he seems unstoppable (and virtually is).  One of their goals is "maximize the number of capes."  And since they covertly are running the entire parahuman organization of North America, a lot of the stupid cops-and-robbers stuff like the Birdcage etc. makes sense.  In this situation, they just need to have enough plausibility to fool the North American population and not the reader!

    4. Escalation... not always a good idea.  Nilbog is contained.  Lung is a small time guy.  If you push, things could get much worse.  North Korea once sank a US ship and tortured the crew... we negotiated for the release of the crew and apologized, rather than invade them.  Sometimes maintaining the status quo makes sense, even if it sucks.

    5. The unwritten rules.  Again based on the idea that escalation and fear-of-reprisal keeps people in check... no one wants Total War with parahumans.

    6. Tinker tech - again, they want to fight, shard shenanigans, and their tech needs maintenance, and they are messed up people...

    Worm wouldn't exist in a world that didn't already have superhero fiction.  If you are reading Worm, it's assumed you already know something about Batman and Spider-Man and such.

    So the patching over ridiculous superhero conventions just has to look good compared to the mainstream... and it does!  The Flash should be able to solve so many problems in the DC universe... and I don't recall getting much in the way of satisfactory reasons why he doesn't...

    I had tons of issues with the Wormverse while reading... but the "reasons" why everything is the way it is... they totally worked for me.  By which I mean they made me stop digging too deep, they sounded just plausible enough that I could accept them and move on with the story.

    Wildbow gave his characters real weaknesses.  Mainstream superheroes tend to get awesome powers and then hold the idiot ball and forget to use them.  Wildbow gives them real weaknesses, even if they are psychological ones, and explores them.  That makes it so much more believable to me that they don't just solve all their problems.

    And lastly...

    Despair.  I mean they are called Endbringers.  Conventional weapons don't hurt them.  Nuclear weapons, the best we have... doesn't help.  All we can rely on is capes, and they are fighting a losing battle.  I think humanity knows it is a war of attrition and they will lose.  Regular humans feel powerless and have sort of given up... they just rely on the capes to save them.  The capes themselves are all screwed up because of triggers and shard stuff.  All according to the Entities' plans.

      I generally agree that Wildbow did a good job with the patching - and it's fairly easy to miss the seams in the patch job while you're reading along. I suspect that will be even more true once The Edit is done. The majority of the time, my disbelief was properly suspended, with Cauldron's actions being the biggest sticking point.

      Point number one is actually the biggest thing that irks me - it feels like such a cop out, in part because it weakens the character study aspect of the piece. You have all this wonderful psychological stuff going on, and then you explain away a lot of it with alien brain slugs. It stops being a commentary on how people can't cooperate with each other, and how institutions fail, and how conflicts naturally arise between people with differing viewpoints ... and becomes about the brain slugs. I liked Armsmaster as a character *so much better* when he was just off-putting, solitary, and egotistical by his nature, instead of being that way (at least in part) because of the brain slug. But that's a question of artistic choice rather than plausibility.

    > No, Worm isn't really rational fiction. That's because it was never intended to be. And you can look at how Worm was constructed to see why it would be really hard for it to qualify.

    > Worm's world was built backwards. Wildbow had an end result - superheroes in costume, fighting each other on the streets, with almost all of the tropes that you would expect if you had been exposed to superheroes through comic books. Everything else was built with this end result in mind, and if anything contradicted that end result, it needed to get massaged.

    I think you might need to check your definition of 'rational fiction', it's less about the setting's construction and more about character actions within that setting. Hell, you just disqualified HPMoR.

      There should probably be a paragraph break there.

      1. Worm isn't really rational fiction, but it was never intended to be.
      2. A lot of the problems (or "problems") come as a consequence of writing the plot/setting first and then figuring out character motivations after the fact.

      Two separate points.

  - u/IWantUsToMerge:

    No. I'm not aware of a single piece of rational fiction that *wasn't* constructed in that way. Before you can ask how some state of affairs aught to collapse under rational treatment, you have to find a self-consistent model of how this magical set of conditions could stand in the first place, that is pure post hoc rationalization, and it's integral to the genre.

    You're asserting that there are inconsistencies in the construction, but I'm yet to see that inarguably demonstrated here.
    ```

- u/notmy2ndopinion:
  ```
  Worm starts off with the premise that people who "break" and suddenly develop shards of superpowers will decide to dress up in costume and either A) fight crime or B) commit crimes (for the most part.)

  Thusly, heroes and villains alike treat the Endbringer truce, Cape Disguise and 'Assassination while you sleep' scenarios very delicately.  It's a similar philosophy to nuclear proliferation and mutually assured destruction -- I won't do it if you won't do it, because let's be honest -- if we did, the world would end.

  Tinkers are broken.  The only nerf they have is time and resources (which happen off-screen) so story-wise, creativity is the main-limiting factor.  All devices require upkeep by the tinker and the reason why Dragon is so successful has to do with her ability to multitask like mad, given her background.  The nanotech-monofilaments that Defiant uses can get jammed with the dust they generate -- he could theoretically mass-produce them, but a lot of PRT people would lose limbs (and the PRT uses non-lethal force for reasons above.)

  Worm is a rationalization of the Superhero comics.  But it proceeds in a rational way from this premise... although the story gets rushed and a little sloppy and abrupt at times towards the end (although the ending itself is something I find to be very satisfactory.)
  ```

    > he could theoretically mass-produce them, but a lot of PRT people would lose limbs

    Wouldn't that be resolved by simply making spears? Or you could give a ton of these things to Ballistic and make anti-Endbringer machine gun. Or to anyone with long range manipulation or good enough strength to throw. Could make a LOT of people and capes alike not useless during attack.
    Edit: grammar

  I understand the points you bring up, but the constraints of the genre mean that there are moderately valid reasons for them not working. 

  >Consider Armsmaster. He invents a weapon capable of physically dismantling Leviathan. 

  Leviathan dismantled *him.* The weapon wouldn't have been capable of killing it because of space time shenanigans with the Endbringers having infinite density cores(Badly worded, but you'll get the point). 

  He doesn't need to be physically present for it's operation, no. He *does* need to be there to *repair* it. Besides, the shards are promoting conflict. If you're a parahuman, your brain is automatically wired to always go for the Big Damn Hero response to *everything*.

  As for constructing unconventional weaponry to take out the Simurgh? Yes, that would *work.* But the Simurgh is also *targeting* the people or groups that are trying to actually *do* that sort of thing. Take Mannequin, for instance. He was designing Moon colonies for people to get away from Earth and be safe(probably safe).

  I do believe you have raised valid points on the subjects of villains, though. I blame Cauldron.

  You can excuse quite a lot with "shards be making people crazy!" which resolves a lot of problems here. There's a couple of veiled references to the idea that the Birdcage exists as a resource to be tapped when necessary (also some individuals in it are close to unkillable). 


  spoilers below!


  As logic problems go, you've failed to hit on the one that bugs me the most, which is that Cauldron is bloody terrible at its job. Again and again, the problem that is hammered home are co-ordination problems. Cauldron's one goal is to kill Scion, yet they happily watch as heroes who could do it die. I still don't quite know why they decided to let the Slaughter House 9 wonder around making the world worse, a decision which leads to the world ending much earlier than it needed to. 

  But urgh, that's the story. It's not a rational fic, and not one that is essentially rooted in plausibility. Wildbow has spoken about how he constructs stories, and as I understand it he basically puts his heroes in almost unwinnable situations and then works out how they can win. But this leads to Taylor surviving multiple times when she really, really shouldn't! Countless times she should actually come out worse and yet at the last minute she manages to turn it around!
  ```

  - u/IWantUsToMerge:
    ```
    Which heroes could have done it? I can't think of any. Also, remember that Cauldron is basically just two very busy,  very stressed out people(only contessa and the doctor knew what the organisation 's goals really were, right?, Edit: Oh, maybe the The Number Man as well?). You should *expect* missed opportunities.
    ```

    - u/thakil:
      ```
      Contessa sees the path to victory. As far as I'm aware, that applies to everyone in the Slaughterhouse 9: her exceptions are for the Endbringers and Scion. Seriously, Contessa's power is soooo broken, and the solution they end up is so poor. Their obsession with secrecy is completely their undoing.
      ```

      - u/IWantUsToMerge:
        ```
        Pretty sure if they'd gone public about their intention to save the world from scion, the idea of extincting humanity would have found its way in to Scion's head much earlier.

    > You can excuse quite a lot with "shards be making people crazy!" 

    That always annoyed me. It's such a narrative cheat -- "my characters are all uncooperative idiots? The shards did it!"

    The basic problem was that, as is pointed out in other comments, Wildbow was writing backwards instead of forwards -- attempting to produce a justification of a genre (superhero comics) instead of starting with preconditions and going from there. That's totally cool and can produce great stories, but the genre he was trying to justify cannot be justified. At a high level, people in comics do not act like real people, so you can't write real world stories about them.
    ```

  - u/loonyphoenix:
    ```
    Agreed, Cauldron annoyed me as well. There's so much munchkin you can do with their powers and resources and knowledge, and they squander it away by doing the stupidest shit ever. They are a giant plot device used to justify the crazy crazy world and society.

    From a narrative point of view, I think they were given too much power for them to act the way they are. They should have been nerfed pretty significantly to make the story more believable. Particularly Contessa with her win button is atrocious as a character. To have someone like her in a story begs for the readers to cry "bullshit", however you write the plot. It would be a lot more interesting if they were just a group of regular parahumans with mostly physical powers, with access to more knowledge about how the powers etc work than anyone, trying to manipulate the world into stopping the end of the world scenario, in my opinion.

  Some of my previous comments on Worm and general plot holes, in case you need more evidence on lack of rationality in the story. 

  And why bother trying to destroy EB's when so far they have  been able to regenerate all the damage done to them and are definitely not unique biological creatures, and therefore if you destroy one, the enemy can always make more, just bide your time until a Tinker makes an end all superpowers device and then use conventional warfare, or something like that.
