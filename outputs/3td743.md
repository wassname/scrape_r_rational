## [Biweekly Challenge] Cryonics

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3rk5kv/biweekly_challenge_amnesia/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Amnesia". /u/ZeroNihilist is the winner with their story ["Erasure"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3rk5kv/biweekly_challenge_amnesia/cwpx53i), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair (sadly, there is no doubly special flair for repeat winners). Congratulations /u/ZeroNihilist!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be "Cryonics", whether that's pre-suspension, post-suspension, or somewhere in between. If you're interested in accuracy, [this page should serve as a one-stop shop for resources.](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cryonics) Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, December 2nd.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be "Deal with the Devil". You can, of course, substitute in a trickster god or megacorp of your choice, but the Faustian Bargain between a large, powerful entity and a desperate ~~sucker~~ counter party is a time-worn trope. It's up to you whether the rational party is the devil, the counter party, or both.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 12/2.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

    Definitely the best entry, also the only entry, coincidentally. But Iâ€™m sure if there was more competition, you maybe might probably win the top spot anyway!

      Your vibes have a distinct frequency. Are you certain you are not simply a CL4P-TP masquerading as a ~~fleshy, biologically malware infected meatbag~~ lovely human?

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    Fucking beautiful. You are the best contestant.

      Lmao, for some reason, I read the 2nd sentence in Claptrap's voice
      ```

  - u/GrecklePrime:
    ```
    Claptrap is from Borderlands right?  Never played it,  but this was pretty good.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Indeed sir. He's known for being overly chipper and happy sounding (his programming is such that he only has one tone of voice), while being fairly insensitive and inappropriate. All themes I hope I captured here :)

    This is great. I both loved and hated claptrap.

    ...you *magnificent bastard*.
