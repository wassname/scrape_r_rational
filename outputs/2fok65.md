  PRT for pseudo-rational, and not because the Parahuman Response Team is monitoring everyone who views this, definitely not....

    "Hey Dragon -- start dictation."

    This was surprisingly readable, considering I haven't read any of the previous chapters.

  Really enjoying this fic. It's total crack, which is like a drug to me. Glad to see the *Worm* crossover part is more than just in name. Looking forward to see where author-surrogate-aka-"Dragon" is going with this Endbringer stuff, and see if the rest of the S9 show up.
