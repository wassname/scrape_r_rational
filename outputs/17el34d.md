## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I only have a single rec, but seeing as this thread is pretty dead(again)...

  [A Young Girl's Game of Thrones](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-game-of-thrones.1095557/) - Tanya re-reincarnates into ASoIaF as Princess Myrcella Baratheon, the second born child of Cersei and Jaime Lannister, though she retains her appearance from her second life for reasons of plot. 

  To me a good Youjo Senki fic requires a delicate balancing of the canon formula: Tanya's extreme competency + her misunderstanding field = her inability to achieve her true personal goals, i.e. to live a calm, comfortable life. Basically every public success for Tanya should be, on some level, a private failure, making the story halfway between farce and a satire. The author of AYGGoT has managed to strike that balance really well so far, and while the fic has its problems, it stands out for being unafraid to shake up the normal chain of events and for throwing up legitimate challenges in Tanya's way. It's one of the updates I most look forward to right now.

          There's been a really noticeable drop in the quality of the site as a whole since that change and the protest in particular. 

          Which is *extremely* sad, as this site is one of the last bastions of the old internet. Once reddit is gone, it's SEO trash all the way down.

          That's sad if true. I'm on r.blind all the time as a blind guy and the third party app thing has hit us hard, despite the mods trying to work with Reddit.

        You can still use third party apps, at least if you're on Android. The process varies depending on your preferred app, but there's a ReVanced patch that makes most of them work. You can also alternatively compile the app yourself and give it your own API key, though that takes a bit more technical knowledge.

Basically every public success for Tanya should be, on some level, a private failure, making the story halfway between farce and a satire.

    The precise handling of the Tanya Misunderstanding Field is indeed critical to any Tanya fic, though I leave kinda hard in the direction of minimizing it. Any fic where the TMF is at full strength is an exercise in intense frustration, both in watching a protagonist bumble along into a consistent string of failures in achieving their goals, and in watching the protagonist be so utterly misunderstood by the people around her that all of her relationships become kinda shallow and fake. I concede there are ways of doing this well, I have really enjoyed how [**A Young Girl's Guerilla War**](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-guerrilla-war-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil-x-code-geass.971950/page-185#post-86675106) handles it and the forward development of Tanya's character while maintaining her competence, but again I prefer competence porn to a comedy of errors.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I partly agree. I still think the TMF is essential if you want hyper competence. If you scale down the former you have to scale down the latter, or whats left is... objectivist Mary Sue, AKA gender-bent magical girl John Galt. *shudder*

      Also, agree to disagree on Guerilla War. I didn't read much before I dropped it, but I think the author completely missed the essential core of the character.
      ```

      - u/Darkpiplumon:
        ```
        The thing with Guerilla War is that this Tanya isn't unchanged from her death and new life. 

        While being reborn again is often dismissed for the sake of storytelling in how it changes her in other fics, in this case it explores how it would change her.

      I read the first 30 chapters earlier this year. I agree that Tanya's character development was handled well. Unfortunately, at some point we started getting really long chapters from other characters’ perspective. They were both uninteresting and tedious, which created significant pacing issues, and I dropped the fic.

      Perhaps the fic works better for readers with interest in the Code Geass half of the crossover. I watched the anime some years ago, but I wasn't a huge fan.

  I've read Maverick Solutions after it was recommended in the last thread and it made me want to read something similar, doesn't matter whether they're fanfics or not. I'll take superheroes, urban fantasy, or cyberpunk. I've read Worm, and Super Supportive which I both really like. As well as Super Minion, Industrial Strength Magic which have a lot of issues.

  I liked Maverick Solutions but I lost interest after the >!Sentinel!< appeared, or rather after >!Purple Man!< appeared and I started to feel like this fic is made more for people who actually know who these characters are, and I know almost nothing about Marvel outside of X-men. 

  Basically something like the early parts of Worm/Super Minion that focuses more on street level action with smart use of powers in an urban setting with minimal interpersonal drama and low stakes. 

  Super Minion has way too much interpersonal drama and Worm >!raises the stakes too quickly, and then they keep going up.!<

    [Batman 1939: the Dangers of Being Cold](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/batman-1939-the-dangers-of-being-cold.27163/). Batman is an incredibly fit martial arts detective who sneaks around and interrogates people. It’s really well-done. Not sure if it’s as episodic as your other examples, but there are sequels. They introduce characters with actual superhuman powers, but it’s the street-level kind, as befits the old school style. Leaping tall buildings instead of flight, and all that.

    I recently read *When the Heavens Went on Sale* which is about the current new wave of commercial intrest in space. It's fascinating and some of the stuff in it is absolutely crazy. Highly recommend. 

    As for machine learning books, I found *The Alignment Problem* by Brian Christian to be quite good, although it's a bit "low caliber" if you are already rather knowledgeable about ML. 

    Another book I read in the past year was *Chip War* which presents the timeline of semiconductor devices and talks about how they have become the "new oil" in many regards, and how they influence global political and economies. Audiobook version was a bit "dry", but still an interesting read.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:

      I read available samples for all these, and *Chip War* seems really interesting. I have enough knowledge/interest in the topic to be invested, but not enough to feel like the book is rehashing things I already know. Thanks!

    [Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide:_A_Year_on_the_Killing_Streets) by David Simon (The Wire, Treme, Generation Kill, etc). It's a true-crime account of the time he spent embedded with the police department as a reporter for the Baltimore Sun.

    Modern Principles of Economics by Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok. It is pretty much 101 for economics, but I found it to be an excellent introduction with good examples and lacking a lot of the cruft/lack-of-direction that I associate with most textbooks.

  - u/ProfessorPhi:

    "State of Affairs" is an amazing book about infidelity and relationships in general, strongly recommend. 

    "Strategy of Conflict" is about conflict theory. In my head this book is "Game theory when you are allowed to break the rules", very interesting 

    "Existential Kink" might be too woo for this subreddit, but if you can abstract away from some of the woo it holds insights into human behavior I rarely see elsewhere. 

    Others:

    "Be slightly Evil" - Insights into social dynamics, mostly at work

    "How to solve it" - Good ways to approach (and teach) math

    "Intermediate Microeconomics - A modern approach" - Despite the name a fantastic introduction to Microeconomics

    The Soul of a New Machine, Tracy Kidder. 

    In the 70's, a journalist tries to figure out if there's any meaningful work to be had in the tech industry, by embedding with a team of computer engineers as they work to invent a new 32-bit minicomputer. If your hobbies are ML and math, you're probably more coming from the mindset of the subjects of the book than the author, but it's still a beautifully written look at another time and place, and an empathetic deep examination of the character of a team of nerds just trying to build the thing and make it work.

    De-reccing Maverick Solutions.

    What took me out of it was that the author didn't seem to have a clear understanding of money. Buying a super-suit that was better than any of the established villains for ~20k. Making a few million off of one private security event, then saying her father thought his antique firebird was worth more than that, but that she thought his estimate was high by about 10k. For assets in that range 10k a valuation difference is basically a rounding error. I thought maybe the super-suit being valued at 20k would have some pay-off later, like it turns out she's the tinkerers niece or something, but it just seems clear that the author doesn't really understand business or the economy or even the value of things. Buying a flying super-suit that can no-sell wolverine level healing and has multiple hammer-tech bunker-buster missiles for the price of a mid-range used luxury car is just silly.

    Since the main focus of the story (that I've read so far) is on building and operating a business, the authors complete failure to understand business, the economy, or even basic money, really hurts immersion. Haunted Nazi gold I can accept, wish fulfillment super powers, sure. But it just went a bit too far.
    ```

    - u/bestgreatestsuper:

      Seconding the derecommendation. Great premise, but bog standard Marvel SI story in practice. Author is writing for wish fulfillment, not to tell a story about entrepreneurship or sociology. MC doesn't exhibit character growth or meaningful flaws or struggles.

      ```
      There's a lot about *Maverick Solutions* that I usually like, but my core criticism is that it handwaved away what should've been the main focus of the entire story. You read the premise, and you think that the story is going to be about surviving as a business and working past the serious social stigma and bad habits of your employees, but no, it's about instantly getting paid millions of dollars after one job and getting almost zero social pushback in the process. And the civilian MC becoming overpowered almost immediately is pretty egregious.

  1) Looking for any (but good) fantasy stories written by people who have lived a significant % of their lives in Palestine / Gaza, or in a refugee camp, or in other similar places (e.g. slums / favelas) with low quality of life and rule of law / rights. 

  2) Alternatively, for stories where the prot themselves is living in a similar environment and is aiming to escape to somewhere better. Outright prisons (*Shawshank Redemption*, *Prison Break*) don't count though, unless they're open-air / unsupervised ones.

  One such story I'm already aware of is *[Стать Драконом](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A8%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2,_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87#%D0%AD%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8)* by Павел Шумил.

He doesn't start at a slum, but he is thrust into that kind of a situation in the first chapter, and decides to travel the continent to run away from the brewing war.
