  I have a theory, though no particular evidence to back it up, that posting updates in the evening will reduce your overall exposure as compared to posting in the afternoon. With fewer people on fimfiction looking through recent updates late at night, you may end up buried before prospective new readers can find you.

  I just thought I'd share. Obviously the chapter is super great. Spotted a typo:

  "Twilight tries to scan for blood her memories of the gallop back to town hall, but it's a technicolor blur."

    The best time to post anything to reddit is during the work week, ideally Monday or Tuesday, at around 9AM EST. It's been discussed quite often on /r/TheoryOfReddit. [Here's some analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/16wcft/data_some_analyses_of_last_weeks_frontpage/) from three years ago, but I'm fairly sure that it hasn't changed since then. Or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3ncx88/how_to_analyze_every_reddit_submission_and/).

      As Calamitizer mentioned, posts on r/rational tend to stay up a while, so it's no special concern here - though it would certainly help for r/mylittlepony. I was referring to fimfiction itself, the site the fic is hosted on, where stories tend to only get attention for a few hours after updating. In that case, I suspect there are more people reading in the late afternoon, though as I mentioned that's only speculation.

      Also: OMG *alexanderwales is talking to me*.
