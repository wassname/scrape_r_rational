  Can someone sell this for me? I always fail to make it past the first few characters because I really don't like Reg, but since it's reached forty one chapters and it's getting consistently upvoted maybe it's really good and I'm missing out on it for a dumb reason.

    [Chapter 14, Azkaban](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/2015/07/significant-digits-chapter-fourteen.html), contains very mild spoilers.  But if you read it and like it, you'll probably like *SD*.  If you read it and don't like it, then I suggest just moving on.  Read *Worm* yet if you haven't, that's pretty fantastic.  Or Tad Williams' *Otherland* series.
