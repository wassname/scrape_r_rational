## [RT][WIP][FF][DC]Rational Planeswalker Quest major update; help still needed!

### Post:

So I made a major update in my Planeswalker Quest, and I still need people to help with suggestions and such.  Maybe with enough suggestions I can upgrade it from Rational to Rationalist.  It's going well, but it could be going better.  For those who don't remember my older post, this is a sort of fanfiction-roleplay thing where a community roleplays a rational, modern person who is thrust into a situation where they have powers that resemble those of a Magic: the Gathering Planeswalker, and have to make do.

  You're seriously going to get a lot less passing readers coming in to try things out as long as you keep semi SI in the title.
