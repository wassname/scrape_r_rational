    At least the moon is still there. We're not getting worse at least.

    ...I'm also not entirely sure how I feel that I caught and remembered that reference.

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Can you explain the reference for the rest of us?
      ```

        Apparently the lesson here is that if one ever asks Brienne to do something for you, the request needs to end with the words "...and do it your own damn self."  :>

    ...ok. I don't get it.

  Let's see, we're now at...0, 1, 2, 3 levels of recursive fanfiction!

  Edit: I wonder whether anyone's keeping track, and if some sort of record has just been set...
  ```

  - u/adad64:
    ```
    Fallout Equestria: Project Horizons is a fanfic of a crossover and it has plenty of fanfiction. We'd need to go at least one level deeper.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      If you're counting all fanworks, I have a t-shirt I made using Project Horizons fanart.
      ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    I'm fairly certain Homestuck has gone deeper.
    ```

    - u/camccann:
      ```
      There's a character in Homestuck who writes self-insert Homestuck fanfic, not to mention how Homestuck includes the author himself as a character. And most if not all major plot threads are part of one or more closed causal time loops.

      Regular every-day recursion doesn't even compare to that kind of direct self-reference.
      ```

      - u/CopperZirconium:
        ```
        I think it all culminated with the reveal of the fifth wall.
        ```

  ```
  > Humor could be embodied as life; a hopeful message might be a species mastering fire. Dark humor would be a planet exploding and killing all of the (for the context) highly advanced beings thereon. If one wanted to add a soupÁon of hope to the darkness of the humor, perhaps the physical laws might be established in such a way that the resulting brain-state of one of those doomed creatures would induce him to send a single escape rocket to carry the last of his race into the void.

  This sounds both morally appalling and inefficient for communication.

  >"Tell me a story, Daddy. A scary story!"

  >"A scary story, huh? Well, okay...I think you're old enough for this one. Once upon a time, long, long ago, there was something called 'death'...." 

  Fiiiine, I'm reading.

    Seconded.
    ```

  - u/Someone-Else-Else:
    ```
    They might kill all the beings there, but Death's something from long ago?
    ```

  A few weeks ago, I was challenged to write a fic that showed what happened after the end of Following the Phoenix.  The original challenge was for 2,000 words but it has actually grown well beyond that and will be an ongoing thing.  Here's the first chapter.
  ```

    Here's my original [challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2s69a3/following_the_phoenix_final_chapter_the_man_who/cnnn432) and my response message acknowledging my pay-up:

    Wow! Thanks for that story, but if you look more carefully at my comment, you would see that I set the delivery date at 4/13/2015, or a month from now in April. I'm not complaining about you being early though and I'll pay you the two months of Reddit Gold on the 14th or 15th.

    Thanks!

    PS I also posted a link to 'Squiring the Phoenix' on r/hpmor.

    You know, I was really hoping to spend a lot of time today making the necessary corrections to my thesis manuscript, mailing things, and doing that one last chapter of studying in that one textbook.

    Damn.

    While you're here - how does one subscribe to a thread on your forum? I'd like to subscribe to both this and Team Anko, and am not sure how to go about it.

  I cannot possibly upvote this enough.

  Don't forget to have the world explode in a bright idea in Act III, when a few dozen to a few hundred people are in space.

    Well that song *really* picked up.
