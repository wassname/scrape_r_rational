  I think it's poor writing to describe the pens function a chapter before it's used, why not just have Nic figure out what it does and tell his friends, he does say "I know what it does now". I think this chapter would work a lot better if chapter 14 were not here.

    I'd argue the opposite. One of the principal rules of writing is "show, don't tell." Finding out how the pen works via Nic explaining it to us is telling, whereas us seeing it in action in Chapter 14 is showing.

  I'm really confused. I'm not sure how much of that was intentional and how much was on accident. 

  Questions. What were they trying to do with him? Making him into a follower or something? Some kind of agent? He seemed to primarily want to become closer to Liz? (I'm terrible with names) so was the demon still interested in recruiting her? I'm assuming it was actually her despite what the he thought, but maybe that's wrong. I feel like he'd make a pretty poor agent. If he shines on magic sense like a beacon people might notice.

  Also I have to say the pen's mighty convenient to the plot here. I'm still not clear on why it was given.

    The Demon from before that faked it's own death.  It wants to become closer to Simole because she's a mage while young and very powerful.  The pen was given earlier by the head of the magical FBI or whatever it's called, in the last chapter he is saved from an assassination attempt by his own pen doing a similar thing, it absorbs magic to protect the holder from enemy spells.  Poor Nic was under some kind of Imperius-y curse and the pen absorbed it.  Which is why he was given it by the magical FBI head

      Lol, magical FBI. I like it. Fantasy Bureau of investigation.

      I knew who the demon was and I knew how he got the pen.

      My confusion is the whys for almost all of that. Why put someone under Imperius-y curse when it's apparently easy to detect and is going to make him act so strange. Did he already do what they wanted him for offscreen or something? Why give him the pen? Honestly if it isn't just plot magic I'm sort of wondering about some more Imperius-y curses being involved.  Why does old mother = Professor Veristotle? What is Tenner trying to get?

        I'll take a stab at some of these questions.

        First off, I'm willing to bet it's not easy to detect the Imperius. Simole could do it, but she commonly does magic things that other people can't. The detectors can do it, but those are strong enough to also detect the government's invisible spies or whatever, and their detector was stolen from the gardening class so they weren't actually supposed to have one.

        Without detecting the actual enchantment, Nic's personality change would probably be interpreted as him hiding things or losing some of his scholastic drive, rather than him being magically controlled.

        I'll admit I'm not sure what the spell was intended to accomplish. Right now, my thought is that Nic is unusually attentive, and could thereby be inconvenient for the Old Mother's ability to get things done without drawing attention. If that's the case, then the spell's purpose would be to remove him from campus by making him give up and flunk out. That's pure speculation, though; we'll have to wait and see what the actual answer is.

        I'm pretty sure Professor Veristotle is just a disguise. No point revealing your true form when you're supposed to be dead, even if you plan to Imperius your audience afterward. In which case, Tenner wrecked their opsec by calling her the Old Mother.

        Minister Delcroix seems to have a vested interest in Nic's development. In particular, in chapter 2 he implies that he wants to "guide and mould" Nic, should he end up going into the Royal College. Under that assumption, the gift of the pen is an investment for potential future return.
        ```

      - u/WriterBen01:
        ```
        My impression is that it was a test. The mage succeeded a test earlier by not going topsy-turvy. Nic failed the test by accepting all the demon's suggestions. At which point he is found to be useless and just told to go home and forget everything that happened. The demon dissapproved and therefore does not get drafted to do whatever Tenner had in mind.

        The pen seems to be some kind of standard magical protection thing (for sufficiently powerful people). So much so that we learned recently that the minister was going to be buying several of them soon. That means that, though unusual, they are not especially rare. The minister knew that Nic would be spending the schoolyear with Simole and if he worried about that, giving up the pen is a small sacrifice that would serve Nic very well. Especially if the minister thought Nic would become close to his daughter and that he might serve as a body guard? At the very least it's an expensive pen that will guilt Nic into taking the minister's job offer, even when a lot of other offers start coming in (gotta groom them when they're young).

        I don't know what an Imperius curse is, but the other questions are perfectly valid, it's just that they haven't been addressed yet.
        ```

        - u/reaper7876:
          ```
          The Imperius curse is a spell from the Harry Potter series that allowed the caster to take control of another person's body, while simultaneously dampening their mental resistance.
          ```

        ```
        From Minister Delcroix's musings about Nic he intends for Nic to go into Royal college - and sees great potential in him to become mage - an asset, that will be his thrall. I think he gave him the pen hoping to eventually nudge his interest towards arcanum by him discovering its use (he's a curious boy) and experimenting with it even. Something rare like this would be invaluable when studying arcanum too. I guess that the pen was also given to protect his asset from a premature end from arcane means, an insurance. Calling it a plot convenient feels a little harsh, when it has been foreshadowed from earlier on. I agree though that the trance had been lifted a little too early. And I wish the use of the pen had been a deliberate thing somehow, not an accidental brush of hand.

    ```
    I think... The Demon told Nic to be comfortable. Then, she forgot to take it off, letting Nic be comfortable with everything, including flunking out.
