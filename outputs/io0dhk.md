  **House of Leaves** is a mind-bending book but in a different way that you mean. I cannot explain without spoilers, but it is a multi-layer story that plays mind games with the reader trying to make them question reality.

    God I hate house of leaves. I get why people like it, but it's a dense read for what amounts to an extended parody of academic writing.
    ```

- u/Laborbuch:
  ```
  I’d also recommend *Blindsight* by Peter Watts, though you might’ve read it already. It precipitated a crisis of ————————, which is something that happens very, very rarely.

  PS: I removed crux of the crisis, since that word in itself might constitute a spoiler and diminish the effect of *Blindsight*.

  Permutation City by Greg Egan was my first brush with existential horror.
  ```

  ```
  [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) is very mind-bendy, as the protagonist regularly messes with his own mind. Also because of the alt-history 1920s Frankenstein setting, but honestly more because of the main character than that.

  ```
  *The City and the City* by China Mievielle is the biggest mindfuck book I've ever read
  ```

  Hey, if you put two linebreaks between paragraphs your post will be easier to read :-)

    Ok ill remember next time

  Nothing immediately to add but just wanted to post to second the inclusion of Kaiji.  It's really a great manga and everyone should read it.  Heck, watch the anime, the narrator is somehow both the worst and best anime narrator ever.
  ```

    ```
    The anime is awesome
    ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Also the anime has 100% more ZAWA ZAWA.
    ```

  ```
  *Cloud Atlas* was mind-bending not for the intrigue but for the way the narrative is layered and structured, up to having six parts written in six different styles and genre, set in six different time periods, including one that's literally written in a completely made up and barely comprehensible future version of English, each somehow connecting to the others.

  Greg Egan's *Orthogonal* trilogy was mind bending because it just invents a whole fucking fictional system of physics and then builds the entire plot on it. If you know enough quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and special relativity you can probably make enough sense of it to enjoy it in full.

  VNs:

  Umineko - clever and fairly rational protagonist (although he doesn't really start to shine until the second chapter) and an equally clever (but much less rational) antagonist. Lots of meta commentary on the mystery genre. There's a lot to say about this one, but I think its best to go in knowing as little as possible. It's not perfect (although the manga addresses most of my issues with the VN's ending aside from how to two characters introduced late in the story end up being seriously underused), but it's one of my favorite works of fiction.

  Raging Loop - very intelligent and rational protagonist, lots of strategy and mind games (the setting is based on Mafia/Werewolf), iterative time loops. What more could you want? I only just started the second route, but I'm really liking it so far.

  Anime:

  Kaguya-sama: Love is War - a romantic comedy based around absurdly over-the-top psychological battles between by the two protagonists. Nice if you're looking for a lighter take on the subject without all the MURDER.
