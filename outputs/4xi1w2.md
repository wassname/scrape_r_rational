  Ten stories is a *huge* building for a Renaissance-tech-level civilization. Even in our modern world a ten-story building in an isolated town of 1000 people would be *weird*. I'm sure you know that, and I'm sure there's some reason why it's there, just pointing it out.

  Also, if every able-bodied adult male visits the Chancellor daily, that's maybe 150 visits a day. Do they form a continuous line?
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:

    Yeah thats a mindbogglingly, impossibly big building for a 1000 people village.

    I mean, the [Dome of Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Cathedral) stood unfinished for 300 years, total building time 700 or so, in a town of about ...40000 people, plus other parts of the country to get ressources from (no darklings). 

    If building size would scale with normal square/cube law we are looking at 150m vs 30m, eg factor 5^3=125.  No way a town of that size under darkling restrictions should have been able to do that. 

    I notice I am confused.

      Is this a reference to Yudkowsky's rationalism stuff?
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        Yes. I am basically saying that I know of facts that stand in blatant disregard to my current best theories. The world looks different then it should! 

        Either the facts are wrong (and denying a cathedral is pretty hard) or my theories about the economies of buildings in small societies is wrong.
        ```

        - u/foobanana:
          ```
          Couldn't the author be wrong? (Not saying they are, but curious as to why you omitted the possibility)
          ```

          - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
            ```
            You are absolutely correct! Most of the time in fiction this would be my main prior. Some handwaved phlebotnium or a healthy dose of narrativum.

            However, we _are_ on /r/rational, with author /u/alexanderwales, who I have learned to hold to higher standards. I fully expect him to have blueprints of the the cathedral, pages full of notes about building economies in medieval societies, and a computer model of the building process using magical power armour. 

            And I am only half joking.
            ```

    I would suspect it was built by an external power, either when the city was founded as a memorial or military outpost that happened to have a town grow around it, or when Langust was connected to more powerful polity when the means existed to link cities safely.

    It is also possible that they had more mecha armor that could be used to carry the stones and perform the heavy lifting back then.
    ```

  - u/SometimesATroll:
    ```
    It's also possible that some glimwarden with a stone-manipulating signature was also very religious and trained in architecture.

    And some of the visits may have lasted less than a minute each, with the men of the town just checking in.

  Quick question, did anyone notice that Chloe appears to be the same person as the girl from the previous chapter, Chloe Masters, who claims to be Melaine's relative? Just pointing it out if anyone didn't remember the details and didn't give chapter 10 a reread.
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    But then who is Ghost of Langust?
    ```

    - u/SometimesATroll:
      ```
      Chloe.  She left, took off the armor, and re-entered the town.

      Possibly.

  Philip better take Chloe into protective custody before Sander and Melanie burned the heretic.

    The sudden increase in theft would probably also be investigated.
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      If noticed.  In a town that small, priors are on "I lost some coins" and "Clotis miscounted the loaves again" moreso than on "somebody's stealing."  I'd bet you could go more than a week before people even started to be suspicious, if you were careful about it.
      ```

  - u/yuridez:
    ```
    >In that small of a town, Chloe would stick out like a sore thumb, IMO.

    Yeah, I didn't buy this either, especially considering the way the world works and people leaving/visiting is extremely uncommon. From the way it was described, Langust sounds more like a town of 30000 than 1000.
    ```

- u/RMcD94:
  ```
  Also good Glimwarden candidates are children and people with dwarfism. 

  Give a baby a heart and it's going to be whizzing around.

  To be honest given the beneficial regenerative properties of the bind giving newborns a heart would probably massively reduce infant mortality rates. Same with giving birthing mothers one just for the birth.

      Or you know, just breed for the leptosomic type? Or select? Theres enough of us nearly-underweight-by-normal-standarts around for that to be feasible.
      ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Good thought. But that does destroy the whole "mandatory milita for Illuminated" disincentive to eat a couple of hearts on the side, which is good for the current power structure.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      Yeah you can't have the Auxiliary if everyone had a heart to get through the most dangerous points of their life.

      But Auxiliary's seem pretty worthless defensive wise anyway so... Might as well just teach all kids how to use the bind in school.

      Edit: Another benefit of giving everyone a heart is that you can find the best signature, some are obviously going to be better than others. Then get the best signature person to actually be a glimwarden.
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        Obviously the Auxiliary isnt about defense but about power control for the glimwardens. 

        Re: your edit: I'd dispute the point that the best signature makes the best leader. Leadership needs a great deal of diverse skills, and while "power in battle" is certainly useful for a leader (for morale reasons) its not really important.
        ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          That's true, I meant best signature in regards to fighting darklings but you're right that that ignores that they don't really need that much help to fight darklings so picking for "ability to fight darklings" isn't that relevant even if that would seem to on the surface to be the purpose of their job.
          ```

- u/foobanana:
  ```
  The darklings arriving just as she left seems a bit contrived. Unless it was caused by the theft of the armour somehow?
  ```

  - u/Ninmesara:
    ```
    An attack apparently happens when a lantern stops working. Maybe the lantern is somehow connected to the armor? Maybe the use of the armor drains the supply of hearts from the lantern or something. Or it might just be a coincidence.
    ```

- u/XerxesPraelor:
  ```
  And I was wrong.

  - u/natron88:
    ```
    > I predict the red armor does include a spirit, but it's not the spirit of Langust.

    If it had a spirit, it would likely have had the spirit before Chloe put it on. You are certainly less likely to be correct.
    ```

- u/foobanana:
  ```
  "Her thoughts turned tawdry for ..."

  Is tawdry the right word there?
  ```

  - u/natron88:
    ```
    > showy but cheap and of poor quality

    > sordid or unpleasant

    It might fit the second meaning.
    ```
