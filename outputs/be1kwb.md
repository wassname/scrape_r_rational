  ```
  Is that a pokeball for the grey Hunter!?
  ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    it's a Pocket dimension ball, so yes it is. even in universe the name fits.
    ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    We'll that *would* be a pretty effective secret weapon, catch the grey hunter in tom Pokeball and when up against someone who relies almost entirely on magic to fight, *cough* red robe *cough*, sounds like a pretty good counter to him, considering exactly how hard that particular GH is to kill.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      RR relies on hitting things super hard to fight, lots of force spells, which the GH is uniquely qualified to counter.  God I love Zorian's savvy.
      ```

    - u/scalymonster:
      ```
      Personally, I'm hoping they'll toss it at Silverlake. She's tried to kill it before and failed, so it knows her tricks and views her as an enemy. Also for the karma: "Fuck you Silverlake, this is for making us go through so many loops trying to kill this thing".
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        As funny as that would be, SL has fought it before, she knows that its a bitch of a fighter even for a grey hunter, if RR  has fought a Grey hunter before and they toss this one at him, it will catch him off guard as it uses all of the tactics that SL basically taught it to avoid and counter magic, and that would be hilarious.
        ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    it's time to catch them all!
    ```

    - u/xartab:
      ```
      You know what's even cooler than tossing a magic-immune giant spider at your enemy?

      Tossing one hundred of them.
      ```

  - u/DerSaidin:
    ```
    I expect it is also a bullet!
    ```

    - u/hallo_friendos:
      ```
      That would be impressive but I'm guessing it's too big.
      ```

      - u/eSPiaLx:
        ```
        eh with zorian's abilities he could craft a cannon that launches it pretty easily. Not that I think he will end up doing it, but definitely easily doable.
        ```

  - u/vallar57:
    ```
    Zorian's gonna be the very best, like no one ever was.
    ```

  - u/Diggsi:
    ```
    I wonder how he is going to make sure the grey hunter doesn't attack friendlies
    ```

    - u/GWJYonder:
      ```
      The intention may be to trap a second person in the prison after the spider is there. It's possible that someone like RR or SL would be able to easily escape from such a prison after a minute or two, unless they were distracted by a fight to the death with an anti-magic spider.
      ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Probably he isn't going to release it near friendlies. I imagine it could cause all kinds of !Fun! in the underground Ibasan base.

      Or maybe his mind magic will be able to reach it and study it in the prison?
      ```

      - u/Lightwavers:
        ```
        I thought !Fun! was demons?
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Every kind of losing can be !Fun!
          ```

        - u/DRmonarch:
          ```
          Only if it's also secret and stuff...
          ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          No, that's clowns.
          ```

    - u/Tserri:
      ```
      Zorian may try to form a soul bond with the Grey Hunter, just like his friend and his drake.
      ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        Soul bonds go both ways, especially with more powerful magical creatures, this would be a bad idea.
        ```

  - u/Hidden-50:
    ```
    A pocket dimension sphere that's meant to catch a powerful monster, that's bigger on the inside.

    So it's actually a Doctor Who reference as well!
    ```

- u/Laser68:
  ```
  What I love about this story so much is that anytime Zorian takes a break to unwind, It carries over to the reader. Nobody103 develops tension extremely well, and when it is about to be too much we get a bit of cuteness and tranquility inserted to keep it from being too much. There is no character who I have ever empathized with as much as Zorian.

  &#x200B;

  On a more story related note, there is clear room for maneuvering in the contract, it is just that every form of it involved deceiving Zach. I have a consistent worry that this story is going to end with either a battle with multiple deaths, and Zach or Zorian dying, or something clever yet bittersweet.

  &#x200B;

  Finally and most importantly, Novelty continues to be adorable, and so does Kirielle.
  ```

  - u/MizuRyuu:
    ```
    Since Zorian can't use mind magic on Zach, maybe a large elaborate illusion of everyone dying at the end to trick Zach until the contract dissolves?
    ```

    - u/RockLeethal:
      ```
      ooooh and then we can have the final bit in zach's perspective so the readers are all thinking "NO WAY THEY ALL DIED"
      ```

      - u/mp3max:
        ```
        We've never had PoV chapter that wasn't from Zorian. The second we shift focus to Zach readers will notice.
        ```

        - u/RockLeethal:
          ```
          maybe he could shift between several - everyone in the battle? Or just have something from Zorians perspective like "a blinding light engulfed us all, with the exception of Zach."

          then switch POV (which would make sense if we assumed main cast was dead) to the only 'survivor', Zach as we go to the end. And then as soon as the month is over they reveal themselves since the contract would be terminated.
          ```

          - u/mp3max:
            ```
            Nah, it'd still be suspicious. As I said, we've *never* had a chapter that wasn't from Zorian's PoV. Regardless of what happens or how it's done, readers will be suspicious of everything that happens, especially if it involves Zorian/multiple main characters dying.
            ```

            - u/notgreat:
              ```
              Having it be strongly foreshadowed is a good thing though. Like one fic I read with an enemy that trapped people in dream worlds, where the fic "ended" in a stupid dues ex machina where the good guys win, right up until it's revealed that the PoV character got trapped. (And the battle is still raging outside)

              Having things be suspicious is good because it lets the readers feel smart when they figure it out.
              ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      maybe combined with smaller equally ellaborate illusions of other people who know about the loop dying along the way.
      ```

    - u/KamikazeHamster:
      ```
      Which would be consistent with Zorian having that scene with the aranea "walking through the city".
      ```

- u/Croktopus:
  ```
  he makes a secret simulacrum, trying to keep a low profile, and then it dissolves into smoke in the middle of a tavern.
  ```

  - u/Caliburn0:
    ```
    Illusion spells, and mind magic. Random tavern goers can't be that hard to trick.
    ```

- u/KingofAcedia:
  ```
  Everyone: \[Stressed out about how Zach is going to survive\]  
  Mother of Learning Chap 98: Nah fam, that's at the end, You ready for more info about The Weeping???
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    *Shush!* Zorian is enacting his keikaku.
    ```

    - u/eSPiaLx:
      ```
      keikaku means plan
      ```

      - u/Caliburn0:
        ```
        You forgot the 'TN:'
        ```

- u/Yes_This_Is_God:
  ```
  I now ship Zorian/Novelty

  how can a giant spider be this cute
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Nah, not Zorian. You know who needs a cheerful, supportive, naive, but magically talented partner, who loves kids and is accustomed to being on the fringes of society?

    Kael. Kael x Novelty.
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Mind magic
    ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    I still ship Novelty/[Tinami](https://mother-of-learning.fandom.com/wiki/Tinami_Aope). I'm worried because Aranean males aren't sentient, so they don't have romance.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Despite Tinami's love of spiders, I foresee two significant obstacles to shipping. Firstly, Novelty is too naive and innocent to be dealing with a politically ambitious House, and secondly, they're apparently keen on bloodline powers, and aranea can't pass those on to humans. (Except perhaps by the humans ritually sacrificing them to steal their powers using blood magic. Enough said.)
      ```

    - u/eroticas:
      ```
      Well, they might still have analogues of romance (likely with the "mother" of the drone male). If you grant that the evolutionary foundation of romance is that you pick a high quality mate and thereafter your offspring-in-which-you-must-both-invest are related to both of you so your interests are sort of merged now, there is still mate choice involved regarding whose genes you're taking.

      (Also note it's not clear if the drone males are produced asexually. Drone males in bees are haploid, they're really almost more akin to glorified flying gamates than full organisms, by human reckoning. If they are produced asexually the identity of the drone-mother would be even more important, since she would be a genetic half rather than a quarter of the resulting offspring)

      Although it's not clear that Areana require parental investment, they do seem to hoard territory and resources and have colonies and clans and wars, so there is some resource investment and allocation involved. It's not obvious that who reproduces with whom is a matter with no emotional weight. 

      Although I guess the efficient thing to do from an out-breeding standpoint if you're going so far as to make walking sperm would be to send the drone males far away to other clans. That's probably what a non-sentient insect would do. And from that you might form socially form alliances between clans via genetic closeness...but even that requires some degree of emotional weight to the matter of who is related to whom. So it's *possible* that they don't really think about sex except insofar as pumping out drones to send elsewhere and selecting drones who seem like they have good genes. But unless they are like bees with only one reproductive unit, you'd think that Areana who cared about relatives that they're related to via a drone in other colonies would be under a selective advantage.

      Yeah my guess is that the most interesting and plausible way to arrange it is they wouldn't have romance per se, but they might solidify inter-clan alliances via sending drones to each other, and that would lead to a sort of pseudo romance between the reproductive units of different clans. And within clans it might be a point of contention, who exactly got to be a reproductive unit and how exactly they distributed genetic material to their offspring. 

      Real-life social spiders don't actually have clan conflict, but they are sometimes very inbred, so it may be that the whole thing is unrealistic from the start and that the spider society shown in MoL wouldn't ever make sense, which would require a rethinking of the whole thing
      ```

      - u/archpawn:
        ```
        > Also note it's not clear if the drone males are produced asexually. Drone males in bees are haploid, they're really almost more akin to glorified flying gamates than full organisms, by human reckoning.

        That's mostly limited to Hymenoptera. There are no spiders like that. It's possible that Aranea are since they're not from our world, but I don't think it's likely.

        They might have something vaguely like romance, but if Novelty's feelings for Zorian are only vaguely like Zorian's feelings for Novelty, it seems like it would cause a lot of problems. It's like if person A is in love with person B, but person B is friends with person A.
        ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    Novelty really is Best Spider
    ```

  - u/eroticas:
    ```
    I enjoy their relationship but I feel that Novelty is too young for *that* kind of "ship" to be appropriate. I read her as being around 14? Older than Kirielle but not by much. Although maybe it is just her curious personality.

    (Yes, her apparent age bugs me way more than her being a giant spider)
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      ...You do realise that Kael was a married father at 15, right? The age of consent is younger on Planet MoL.
      ```

      - u/eroticas:
        ```
        Yes but it's not just about age of consent, it's also about age gap affecting the shipping
        ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      She's an adult in spider years. She said so in this chapter
      ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  I burst out laughing in public when Zorian revealed that his sister's doll is actually a miniature combat golem. It would be awesome if the cult comes after Nochka, breaks down the door, and then Rutvica stands up with glowing red eyes and starts pulling rocket launchers and sleep gas grenades and oversized rifles out of hammerspace.
  ```

    ```
    Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.

    GO get them sharkie!!

      "Why did you summon me" reference?
      ```

      - u/domoincarn8:
        ```
        Indeed.
        ```

- u/Kilo181:
  ```
  Just binged all of MoL last week. I'm so glad Novelty is back! I really hope the author does some sort of extended epilogue because I really want to see what all the characters do afterwards.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Funny that I read this advice when I tried to develop a story's climax. Paraphrased because I read it months ago, it might mixed from advice from somewhere else:

    >"Once you reach the peak, you solve the problem with one grand stroke, be done, and run away with it. Don't dally, don't let the tensions seeps away. Dallying soften the impact. Memorable is the opposite of soft."

    I don't have any idea how the author will conclude his story. It just I repeatedly remembered about chapter 26 when author drove the surprise home and end the chapter then and there.
    ```

    - u/serge_cell:
      ```
      *Worm* manged aftermath of the climax very well. It's possible. Of cause said aftermath should be sad and full of regrets.
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        Worm's epilogue wasn't entirely depressing, there was some hope sprinkled in with the depression.
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Well, Worm's epilogue's job was setting up some stuff for the sequel.

        If we want to look at a well-done epilogue for a web serial that most likely won't ever see a sequel, I'd point to Twig's. There, significant parts of the story are actually told via the epilogue chapters. They don't only give closure on side characters, but also actually wrap up several plot threads that were pertinent to the main story.

        Of course, the reason that the POV shifts away from >!the Lambs and Sylvester in particular is that they're undergoing the process of becoming Lords, finalizing their "growing up". Their story isn't finished, but their *childhood* is. Thus, we only see them again after they've fully taken over their new forms, and are meeting the "Endboss".!<
        ```

    - u/Caliburn0:
      ```
      Yeah, that can work for some stories, but it's not an absolute rule. I would definitely prefer MoL to have one or more epilogues.
      ```

- u/megami-hime:
  ```
  Honestly, my favorite part of the chapter was finally seeing Haslush again. There has been a lot of minor characters from early chapters that haven't been seen in a long time.

  Zorian x Akoja forever, dammit. I love Taiven and Rainie too, but you can't beat first girl.
  ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    I miss that crazy spell formula teacher, Nora something. She was a hoot. 

    Also, first girl was Kiana in a way - Zorian was eyeing her up in the very first loop!
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Nora Boole.
      ```

- u/I-want-pulao:
  ```
  This chapter was more setup after the revelations/negotiations of the last two. I like how Zorian is still gathering allies but in a more circumspect way. Also like how this story is becoming more about Zorian again, Zach didn't even show up in this chapter!
  ```

  - u/Wolpertinger:
    ```
    The more Zach is involved in Zorian's preparations, the harder it will be for Zach to survive the time loop. Zach is more of an obstacle than an ally now - anyone they recruit has to be hidden from Zach, or they become another nail in Zach's coffin.
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      That makes a lot of sense. However, I'm surprised that Zach is willing to go along with this - he's a lot more hands on and difficult to get rid of. Ofc, he does get bored so if Zorian fobs off some of the more active stuff (like invader surveillance etc) to Zach, Zach might leave Zorian be.
      ```

      - u/Lightwavers:
        ```
        Zach doesn't want to die. In the back of his mind, he likely knows Zorian is going to try something, and that distancing himself is the best course of action.
        ```

- u/sololevelingacc:
  ```
  I wonder how/if Damien's sacrifice in chapter 91, will change how Zorian interacts with Damien next chapter. 

  I imagine it was something he was profoundly moved by. 
  But, showing (positive) emotional behaviour towards his older brother is out of character for pre time loop Zorian and could contribute to Damien's suspicions that Zorian really isn't his younger brother. Which may make Zorian consciously reign in his emotions.
  I'm just saying, a heart warming (one sided) reunion with a confused Damien after all that happened would be great. I could only really see something like that happening with an impulsive simulacrum though.

  I'm surprised Zorian has the strength to consider going through seeing Taiven die again, this time he knows it would permanent too.
  ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    We didn't see Zorian's reaction to Daimen's sacrifice, at least not in any depth since 91 was so action packed and we got no breathing space since then. I'm expecting at least a few thoughts on it though - maybe knowing that Daimen isn't as bad, and in fact, Daimen loves Zorian enough to sacrifice his life for him.. Could lead to some realizations about his parents as well. 

    While Zorian needs to be more circumspect with Daimen, I'll be expecting Zorian's thoughts at the very least to address Daimen's sacrifice. I wouldn't expect a massive conversation though - we got a that in the loop.
    ```

- u/I-want-pulao:
  ```
  Zorian's one paranoid mofo, isn't he.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    He's a conspiracy theorist, but there actually is a conspiracy to kill a whole bunch of people.
    ```

    - u/Caliburn0:
      ```
      *Multiple* conspiracies in fact. At least three, counting Z&Z's group that would be four.
      ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    I mean, can you really call it paranoid if they're actually after you?
    ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    He would be very dead if he wasn't.
    ```

- u/Don_Alverzo:
  ```
  Can we please get a Novelty spin-off? I want her to be the first aranea student at the academy and so do you.
  ```

  - u/hallo_friendos:
    ```
    "Patience is my best feature!"
    ```

  - u/scalymonster:
    ```
    I would read a full length book series of just Novelty going through the academy, harry potter-style, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one.
    ```

    - u/phylogenik:
      ```
      [not exactly what you’re looking for but perhaps it could scratch the same itch?](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Griffin)
      ```

- u/mrasiteren:
  ```
  I'm glad Zorian made contingencies with Haslush in case they fail and he dies but I'm also worried about chekov's gun implications. It would be a shame if Zorian died at the end after all he has been through to get where he is now and the story ended with a letter from Zorian beyond the grave.
  ```

  - u/domoincarn8:
    ```
    Or it could be a fake Chekov's gun. We know it is a contingency in case Zorian dies. Maybe Zach also knows this.

    Thus when Zach sees Haslush opening the letter and finding something, it finally dawns on him that Zorian is ACTUALLY dead, with all the implications. Otherwise Zach might simply consider that a mind illusion by Zorian. Thus, seeing Haslush opening the letter allows the contract to accept that no time loopers have spilled out and survived, thus allowing Zach to live.

    Once the contract dissolves, the final illusion dissolves as well. Since the last part would not be an illusion at all, it can be done without mind magic as well.
    ```

    - u/mrasiteren:
      ```
      Yeah that makes sense... Hope you're right!

  [removed]
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    By the time Zorian was met by Silverlake, he's mostly recovered. That was first school day, the 3rd day of real month. Three days later he helped the church fueling fancy shell for a branchy angel. Suppose the truce talk happen at the evening, then this chapter is the 7th day of the month. It could be the 8th or 9th day, but 7th is more likely.
    ```

- u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
  ```
  Is Zach planning to make the youth potion for the original Silverlake? She has plenty of motive to oppose the time loop Silverlake, and isn't much weaker than her since she was already an ancient archmage pre-time loop. 

  Plus if she also gets the youth potion, she can infiltrate the enemy side with simulacrums that are pretending to be the time loop Silverlake. No one would be able to tell the difference since their souls are practically identical.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    It has been clearly explained that Silverlake is a high maintenance ally due to her backstabbing tendency. No, It's not worth the effort to keep her in line.
    ```

    - u/RockLeethal:
      ```
      Yeah, I hardly imagine Zorian would be willing to trust or work with silverlake at this point.
      ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    I just figured it was long term planning in case he survives.
    ```

- u/Nic_Cage_DM:
  ```
  > the contract had an expiration date. At the end of the month, it would dissolve and Zach would no longer be bound by it. That meant that after the month went by, Zach would be free to make his experiences as public as possible as he wanted to make them.

  >Were the angels really fine with that? The contract strong suggested they weren't, but there was really nothing stopping Zach from doing just that. Maybe not immediately after the month ended, but as years and decades went by? A person might get tempted to write a book or something before he died…

  >It would be probably very convenient for the angels if Zach and Zorian stopped Panaxeth's release, but perished some time afterwards…

  Maybe they aim for the Sovereign Gate to be destroyed. It's breaking down and allowing Panaxeth to subvert it, anyway.

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    It was mentioned a few chapters ago when they were getting the staff that Zorian could only grab hold of the Dragon Mage's mind for a few seconds, which is still a legendary feat in and of itself.
    ```

- u/hallo_friendos:
  ```
  They've been using Zach's mansion for a lot of meetings and now also a workshop with illegally big golems. Where is Zach's guardian (Tesen, was it?) during all this? Doesn't he live there?
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Tesen is the head of his own family. A noble of the same renown as Noveda in the past. He act as manager to Noveda household, maybe a mentor to Zach, but definitely not a parent. Yeah, he's shit fulfilling any of that role.
    ```

    - u/hallo_friendos:
      ```
      Ah. Makes sense.
      ```

- u/obrmao:
  ```
  The pace in this chapter was very sedate. I expected more shenanigans, but it makes sense to lay the groundwork for the final fight. 
  Actions have consequences now and I still struggle, just as Zorian, to realize that we are out of the time loop.

    Tenses disagree. Use either: "if you know who I am" or "if you knew who I was"

    > It was just a temporary pocket dimension, not even a permanent expanded space, but most people would have still never encountered that sort of thing in their entire life. 

    "would have still never" is really hard to read. It would be better to read "still would have never" (or just rephrase it completely)

    staring at him at one time -> staring at him one time

    was a -> was

    experiences as public as possible as he wanted to make them -> experiences as public as he wanted to make them.

    strong -> strongly

  Hmm. Something about the contract doesn't seem right.

  IIUC, it requires that no one knows about the time loop except Zach. Even if he didn't tell them. After all, Zorian found out all on his own, so if the contract only requires that Zach neutralize anyone he's told, then Zorian ought to be safe, and anyone Zorian's told - like the aranea - should also be exempt.

  If they're not, if the contract applies to anyone at all with time loop knowledge, then that means the contract requires Zach to hunt down and kill, for example, the Ghost Serpent, and quite possibly other ancient elementals like Stonechild.
