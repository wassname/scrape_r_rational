  I would like to state for the record that this is /r/rational, not /r/rationalist. The sidebar explanation that rationalist fic is a subset of rational fic is good enough for me.

  Sure, HPMoR was a founding work of the subreddit, but I'll wager a significant fraction of the members weren't in it for the didactic side. For all its flaws, MoR has some *incredibly clever* ideas about what has to change from the HP canon in order to...rationalize...the weirder elements. That sort of thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency is a hallmark of rational fiction.

    I think as long as Reddit's redesigns continue to discourage sidebars, we'll keep seeing this discussion pop up. It's a shame, because the sidebar does a damn fine job of summing up what this sub likes, in my opinion. (Including disambiguation between rational/rationalist, as you pointed out.)

      Reddit redesign kind of discourages using the website altogether.

        If you only ever read reddit via the mobile website, you might be excused if you weren't even aware that there is such a thing as a sidebar.

          Incredible how many ways social media operators can work against their own communities in "adding" features.

      I think this is why several subreddits have an eternal pinned post explaining their own basic premise. Basically just the sidebar in text post format. Maybe something we should look into?
      ```

      - u/GeeJo:
        ```
        Subs can only have two pinned posts, so either the weekly rotating threads or the longer-term event threads would have to go to make room.
        ```

        - u/GeneralExtension:
          ```
          A post could be made, and then there could be a link to it at the top of the pinned posts. The hyperlink could read "reminder: subreddit rules".

  Rational fiction is about thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency, what is the deal?
  ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    Technically rational fiction is about rational characters.  The world doesn't have to be consistent or even coherent, except to the extent that the inconsistency/incoherence do not interfere with characterization of a rational mc.
    ```

    - u/mirh:
      ```
      Mhh.. I see where you are coming from, but insofar as the world isn't even cogent the slightest, I don't know what you could judge characters against. 

      Like, assuming the worst case scenario that I can imagine (something like "star wars meets fast & furious in not even pretending to care about logics anymore"), the only reasonable thing to do for characters would be to spin in circles facepalming about the wretch of a universe they are in, with the very physical laws changing every odd hour.

    I’m convinced that most of us (myself included) are more fans of **thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency** then we are actually fans of **rationalism**. I enjoyed *Mother of Learning* more than I did *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*, for instance.

      in essence, yes. though there are certain elements you come across a lot in fictions discussed on this sub that extend beyond common writing maxims. Trope deconstructions, logical (vs emotional) protagonists, DnD-esque magic systems with clear rules and numbers, etc. It's a mix of influences from genre fiction, fanfiction, Japanese light novels/anime, and of course, the spectre of Eliezer Yudkowsky.

      I agree with you though. I'm much more a fan of thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency than any of the things I just listed. But I still check /r/rational because it's one of few forums where people who read stuff online discuss things critically and share things that are (generally) quite interesting. 

      It's not a perfect community and the term 'rational fiction' is a bit silly, mostly since it implies that things outside it are somehow not-rational (or perhaps irrational). Like naming your personal philosophy 'Objectivist,' it feels rather conceited and short-sighted.
      ```

      - u/_The_Bomb:
        ```
        Oh I’m in the same boat. To be clear, I’m not actually complaining about the state of the sub. I just thought it would make a funny meme.

      It turns out that the borders of genres are NOT WELL DEFINED.  Also if they’re helping people find media that they enjoy that’s pretty much the point.  Genres are shorthand so we don’t have to sit and describe a kind of thing we like for ten minutes every time we need to say it.  Thoughtful world building and internal consistency IS part of the Rational genre because people use it that way and it can only truly be defined by its use.

      Edit:  Also concerning Mother of Learning and HPatMoR; same.
      ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      The best understanding I've cultivated about what defines rational fiction as a genre is the specific feeling of *things making sense*.  It's the feeling when all the pieces start coming together at the end of the mystery plot.  It's the feeling when you connect the plot event to previous events that seemed initially unrelated.  It's the feeling of reading bits of worldbuilding and seeing a coherent world assemble itself before your eyes.  And my brain goes nuts for it.

      Plotholes, by contrast, are when things explicitly *don't* make sense, and just like I love things explicitly making sense I hate things explicitly not making sense.  Put the two together and you get why I like rational fiction.

      Some of this is just good writing advice, but it's distinctly more than just that.  The specific feeling of things making clear sense is something that can be absent in other good stories which focus on other feelings that might resonate with people, and which can be present even in otherwise bad stories.

      Rationalism itself, imo, is just an adjacent group that happens to attract the kinds of people who respond well to that feeling, which made 'ratfic' around seeking that feeling while being loosely defined as 'the kinds of stories we like'.

    - u/LimeDog:
      ```
      Reading was always something I pursued as a form of escapism. 

      That feeling of discovery with exploring a new world, playing a mental what-if. You get to travel with a good book. Sometimes you travel in someone's headspace, sometimes you travel through a narrator's eyes, and finding the good places is a real treat.

      /rationalism has been a great way to taste a multitude of worlds and every now and then, chew on some wonderful mental problems. They won't all be good, but this sub provides a space for authors to develop and readers to encourage those authors to feed our addiction.
      ```

    - u/greenskye:
      ```
      Mother of learning is the superior book, but I did enjoy the absurdity of HPMoR quite a lot. Honestly I would say that the genre of true rationalist fiction is so small that you are basically forced to broaden your scope. There's only a small handful of works that take things to that level. Everything else is, as stated, just thoughtful world building and internal consistency.
      ```

      - u/lordcirth:
        ```
        I think MoL would be superior if it got better editing and ended up 10% shorter.
        ```

    - u/crivtox:
      ```
      For the record I like Hpmor more than Mother of Learning and although I like MoL too I would like if there were more stuff like Hpmor in the sub(more than there are already is I mean, there's some stuff like OoS wich obiously qualifies and I also love that) 

      No idea about "most people" in the sub.  

      I mean threre's less rationalist fics out there in general so obiously they are going to be a smaller fraction of things posted and that's going to affect what kind of people is attracted to the subreddit but meh would have to do a survey or something. 

      Also you can be a fan of both things.

      And like duno about the subredit but I have the impression most people active in the discord have read the sequences.

      What? You did no such thing, anywhere. I am the one who brought up Apple Jacks. You were talking about something completely unrelated. I am the breakfast cereal discussion pioneer in this thread. Me.

  A facet.

  The sidebar has a list:

  > Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

  * Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
  * Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
  * Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
  * Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.
  * **Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.**

  > Presence of these *particular* features is not necessary: overall impression of the work is more important.

  I used to be part of a fan community for All Night Laundry, a somewhat-rational serial artfic.

  In discussion, I would occasionally link short stories or articles about writing. Whenever I linked something by E.Y. or S.A. the moderator would delete the link and say something like "don't platform racist eugenicists."

  I linked thoughful fiction and writing advice, not rationality blogs!

  I'm banned from that community now...

    - u/covert_operator100:

      I was banned before I figured out their connection, but I researched the claim afterwards, and [this screenshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/i05rtm/that_time_scott_alexander_squid314_donated_money/) is in top 50 all-time on r/SneerClub.

      More generally, some believe that putting stock in IQ, indicates belief in racial eugenicists who originally designed the IQ test. This is not a ridiculous claim, but it is harmful overconfidence.

I don't know exactly how much of it is poor phrasing, misinterpretation, or since-deleted context, so I'm not going to offer any opinion on who was right. But the discord server owner interpreted the whole thing as nazi apologism, and acted accordingly.

  Unless this is a joke about hot [rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism) means something else...then yes, it is. It is an aspect of rational fiction, one of many. It's a pretty low bar, but it counts.

  - u/_The_Bomb:
    ```
    You can think of thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency as a rectangle rationalism like a square. All squares are rectangles. Some rectangles are squares. All rational fiction has thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency, but not all works with thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency are rational fiction.

    Honestly, I don’t have a problem with these kinds of works being so prominent on the sub. It fosters fun discussion and lets us recommend some enjoyable works that we otherwise wouldn’t know about. 

    I’m just making a mild critique on this sub because I like semantics.

      Does earthfic count as having "thoughtful worldbuilding and internal consistency"? ;)

        ```
        Yes! In fact, I often read translated books written in East Asian countries precisely so I can read a story with an unfamiliar, intricately thought-out culture and society.

          Novels written in a culture separated by time should work too; Jane Austen or Charles Dickens?

  World building and consistency aside, I still think that rational fiction in practice is mostly wish fulfillment for nerds.

  - u/mirh:
    ```
    I don't know. It seems to me more like having some special kind of *big empathic memory*. 

    Like, it's not that I'm forcing myself to be pedantic, it's just that if I'm completely immersed in the shoes of a character, the established reality/psychology bending over backwards like in a marvel movie completely trash suspension of disbelief. 

    On the other hand, some people I know (for as much as nerds) seems to live in a forever present where only the cool factor is important.

  So true!

  Mother of Learning is the perfect illustration. 

  On one hand, it has thoughtful world-building, intelligent protagonists, and all the other goodies you expect from a good rational fic.

  On the other hand, it promotes harmful and irrational ideas ("religion is good", "immortality seekers are bad"). 

  It's like the best pie you've ever eaten, but with a few glass shards intentionally put in by the cook.
