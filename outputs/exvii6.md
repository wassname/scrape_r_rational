  I really liked the explanation for how Zorian bypassed Mind Blank. I sorta expected it to just be a handwave of the "yadda yadda dozens of experts, focused research over months, yadda yadda" variety, but flowey the flower path actually makes sense. Big thumbs up to the author.
  ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    Also it was foreshadowed well (though not very far back), not a random callback. From the tail end of Giants:

    > Fortunately, Zorian had gotten lots and lots of insight into the inner workings of the soulseizer chrysanthemum during the last six months of the time loop…
    ```

    - u/therealflinchy:
      ```
      Only thing i didn't like about it was why didn't they show any of that In the last 6 months of the loop

      Obviously for it to be a surprise but still
      ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    I, too, can't help but imagine the Soulseizer Chrisanthemum as Flowey.

  ```
  He finally beat them and the whole miniature world was satisfying. Dunno how the old silver lake is faring nor the grey Hunter. 

  This was a satisfying ending. Obviously they tried their best and made it through the month. They couldn't kill all the enemies but the two enemy time Loopers are dead. I wonder if silver lake ever had a Killswitch but honestly she is too distrustful to do anything like that.

  Here's hoping for an epilogue especially with his friends.
  ```

  - u/ksarnek:
    ```
    I'm sure our favourite magic-eating spider will find a cozy tunnel right next to the Hole, snuggle up, and live happily ever after.

    And of course Silverlake tried making copies of herself before! I should've thought about that. Now I want how that went down, maybe a spinoff or an interlude?

        That would be interesting! Maybe they will find a way to contain him? Or maybe they will form a symbiotic relationship in which he protects them from dangers and he gets some space and food?
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          >he gets some space and food?

          You mean like their territory and their corpses?
          ```

          - u/ksarnek:
            ```
            I hope they will find a compromise, the Aranea have suffered a lot already
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              I hope Zorian harvests its corpse for Kael and Lukav. Possibly with a portion going to Raynie's tribe, so they can use the primordial essence to make more shifters. (Starting with Zorian, of course.)
              ```

              - u/GoXDS:
                ```
                they don't need the ritual. there's no reason for them to induct new mages the old, magical way. plus they wouldn't want to bring in outsiders. they can just make more the... mundane way  


                as for Kael and Lukav, neither had explicit interest nor need either, especially Kael
                ```

                - u/thrawnca:
                  ```
                  Kael wasn't interested in a regular grey hunter, perhaps, but this one just ate a bunch of primordial essence. That's a very rare commodity.
                  ```

                  - u/GoXDS:
                    ```
                    sure... but still doesn't explain what Kael would need or want that for. it'd be difficult if at all possible to properly test its uses in alchemy and would be in limited supply and ultimately not sustainable without resulting in shifters being taken advantage of. and while Kael is indeed very interested in a potent cure-all, he's also very much into finding sustainable, affordable and accessible solutions
                    ```

                  Now wondering if shifters have sex in their human form or, y'know.

                    ```
                    They’re ultimately humans in the end. I don’t doubt at least some of them have done it both ways. Or maybe exclusively the other way...

            You're right, I forgot about that for a moment. Getting the egg sac was an important plot point, even.

            Forgive my imprecision.
            ```

        - u/GoXDS:
          ```
          doubtful. thing's mostly resistant to mind magic and they don't have much in the way of other forms of combat (nothing compared to what Z&Z can dish out)

          the thing is also powerful enough to get space and food on its own. and also pretty dumb
          ```

          - u/ksarnek:
            ```
            Yeah, agreed. I was just hoping that the GH/Aranea interaction had some way of being not hostile.
            ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          No idea. Completely wild theory: They figure out how to tame the thing, maybe by having it fuck/eat a bunch of their males (who were sub-sentient if I recall).
          ```

          - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
            ```
            Scarier idea: What if they somehow mate?

            Aranea-Grey Hunter hybrids would be utterly terrifying.
            ```

          - u/ksarnek:
            ```
            Aren't they *way* smaller than a grey hunter? In any case, yikes.

            Maybe being exposed to so much mind magic in the air will awaken her...
            ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      More like, the Grey Hunter just ranked up and is now an unstoppable, quasi-primordial mage killer.
      ```

      - u/ksarnek:
        ```
        ...surrounded by kilometers upon kilometers of tunnels stuffed with tasty magical creatures. From his point of view, this is definitely happily ever after :)
        ```

        - u/adad64:
          ```
          Hahaha, I need to write an omake for it Win(II.5): The Gray Hunter had won...

          - u/ksarnek:

            I'd read that! What would her motives be? Is she intelligent and puts on a mask of ferocity not to be bothered?

            - u/-Fender-:
              ```
              She just wants to be left alone to read yaoi manga.
              ```

            - u/TheBobulus:
              ```
              So she's a spider, so what?!

              :::;)
              ```

          - u/john-trevolting:
            ```
            The gray hunter has been manipulating things behind the scene since the start, nudging things into just this moment where she could consume primordial essence and therefore rule the underworld.
            ```

        - u/ansible:
          ```
          It seems likely the Grey Hunter will stay relatively deep in search of tasty prey, so maybe the Aranea will be OK on their level.
          ```

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        Assuming, of course, that the primordial essence it just consumed was digested quickly enough for Panaxeth's contractual effect on Silverlake's body, making it rot and collapse on itself, not affect it. Up to u/nobody103. Not sure if he even planned on including it in the epilogue, anyhow.

        The one I want to learn more about is vampire girl, though. A single scene of her gloating over QI's loss would be great, but I'd want to have an explanation of why she only participated in the invasion that one time. I assumed that the reason QI returned to Ibasan territory every restart was to deal with politics involving her family, but nothing ever came from it.
        ```

        - u/RuggedTracker:
          ```
          Guessing she was RRs addition to the invasion, but after doing some cost / benefit analysis he realized it wasn't worth it. She wasn't all that strong after all, plus apparently it would be a big deal if she died.

          That's why we never saw her in the loops when RR was out, and why she wasn't included in the real world. Or maybe she was included in the real fight, but she wasn't important enough that we saw her
          ```

          - u/-Fender-:
            ```
            If it were so, we should have had at least one mention of her when we had Red Robe's perspective, though. He would have had to really go out of his way in the time loop to meet her, if she wasn't initially involved without his prompting and negotiations. It seems very underwhelming  if this is the end of it.

            Honestly, if there are no edits in "I Win II" to include her, or no mention of her in the epilogue, then I think it's possible that she might be removed entirely from the story when this whole webnovel is edited into a coherent book version.
            ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Imagine if the death pact affected the Grey Hunter by transitional property. That'd be hilarious.
          ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      There's a good chance that silverlake just took the spider for her potion.  The difficulty in catching a grey hunter is its speed to avoid traps and magic sense.  If she's got one already captured in a ward, she should have all the hard work done with no risk to her.  

      It doesn't have any particularly novel way of escaping capture, since it relies on raw physical ability and venom, instead of something esoteric like dimension hopping amphibians.
      ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      > And of course Silverlake tried making copies of herself before!

      I strongly suspect that "Old Silverlake" is the copy, and she killed the original long before the events of the story.
      ```

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        Do simulacrums have souls? If they don't, do they inherit the original's soul once it dies?

        For Silverlake to be able to loop at all with Zorian & co., she needed a soul.
        ```

        - u/aeschenkarnos:
          ```
          Maybe she used a different, alchemical method? Something more akin to biological cloning?
          ```

        - u/theRandomTiger:
          ```
          Simulacrums share a soul with their creator. 

          I suspect if last time she copied herself was a simulacrum, it “winning” would have involved writing itself over Silverlake’s mind or putting her in a coma so it had undisturbed access to her soul and life.
          ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      Too Many Cooks, starring Silverlake, Silverlake, Silverlake, Silverlake, Silverlake, Silverlake, Silverlake, Silverlake, Silverlake and Silverlake.
      ```

    - u/mrbaconator2:
      ```
      when i got to that part and it said zorian was like alright this is fine i guess off i go I immediately went wait that could have all been a lie and a trap or a spiel both of them came up with......IT STILL COULD BE! the "remains" of young silver lake could ALSO still be a lie!
      ```

  There's still the epilogue to look forward to, but I just want to say:

  Congratulations to the author for finishing this story. An actual complete story on the Internet is a real treat indeed.

            ```
            The latest MoLU post plus the last few chapters leave me thinking that soul magic is hands down the highest peak of magic that isn't divine (and that might also be soul magic v2, from mentions in story). And angels/demons use it every second of their lives, apparently, and are skilled in a way humans can't be because of that, way beyond even the aranae mind magic/human telepath difference. Even QI wants nothing to do with that class of critter if he hasn't performed absurd amounts of prepwork beforehand.

            The angel mangled something that nearly accidentallied Zorian because he looked at it while still fighting everything else. I'd guess that it could probably do to Oganj what the demon nearly did to Zorian if it wasn't so brutalised, and just as casually.
            ```

          - u/mkalte666:
            ```
            That I do not doubt. Its the injuries that  make me worry
            ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    The Angel shouldn't care and Zorian doesn't need to mess with things though.  Aside from the orb being thrown in the bargain, this is to his benefit.

    QI is going to crusade to get his crown back. And he's good enough that this would be trivial against anyone but Oganji.  Having the world's best lich squarely focused on taking down the world's best dragon for the next decade is good for Zach and Zorian's health.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      You do realise that Zach, at least, will want in on that crusade. He wants the orb, and he'd relish the chance to take Oganj down for good.
      ```

  - u/BanjoPanda:
    ```
    When he said that I really thought the artifacts were fake ones. Angel tree would give out the fakes without forswearing himself and Oganj would be left with nothing
    ```

    - u/ksarnek:
      ```
      That would absolutely be in Zorian's style. In any case, I find the image of a dragon wearing a teeny tiny crown on his massive head very amusing.
      ```

      - u/Roneitis:
        ```
        I was picturing it as a sick ring.
        ```

  - u/a_sensationist:
    ```
    > And then Oganj turned towards the northern forest in the distance and simply flew away from the city. The angel seemed to hesitate for a moment, as if it wanted to tell Zorian something, before it simply followed after the dragon mage. 

    Well... it would certainly explain why the angel followed him imo.
    ```

  - u/theRandomTiger:
    ```
    It’s an angel! It cares about both the spirit and the letter of its vows. I sincerely doubt it will betray the dragon like that.
    ```

    - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
      ```
      I'd say they only care about the letter of the law, since they let zach live when he only BELIEVED nobody alive knew about the time loop. 

      Also, was literally nobody on the enemy side told about it? That would seem like a great time bomb for red robe to leave behind. Inform a bunch of innocents/ co conspirators Scott th time loop and let zach know about it so he can't get out of the contract.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Jornak wouldn't have wanted unnecessary people to know about the Sovereign Gate. He probably wouldn't have told QI if he had a way to avoid it. And as far as he knew, there was no feasible way to save Zach anyway, except perhaps for Zach going on a mass slaughter of his own allies; very uncharacteristic of Zach, and not worth disrupting other plans to counter.
        ```

      - u/theRandomTiger:
        ```
        I’d say that in that case they cared about the spirit of the law, since Zach didn’t exactly tell Red Robe and co about the time loop outside of it. 

        Red Robe could just tell everyone possible about the time loop and paint a giant target on his back, but since he also came from the loop that would be sabotaging himself as well. He is planning for success as well rather than assuming defeat. He doesn’t really want a collective of people thinking he’s crazy. 

        https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2020/01/22/collected-snippets-angels-demons-spirits/

        Some quotes that support my take on angels:

        “[Angels] care about the ideals they are supposed to embody and the duty they have to the angelic hierarchy on a deep, instinctual level that humans would find next to impossible to grasp. As far as the angels are concerned, humans and other material beings are severely lacking in dedication, thoughtfulness, and selflessness.”

        “Angels definitely try to live up to their virtues. It’s not just a matter of them being forced to behave as they do by divine restrictions.”

        “...a ruthless and methodical angel would be far more concerned about not crossing certain invisible lines than a human, who would see laws and ethical restrictions that get in the way of their ‘utility maximization’ as annoying and onerous, and try to weasel out of them in any way they can.”
        ```

  - u/NZPIEFACE:
    ```
    It didn't say it wouldn't just kill him immediately.

    You can still give things to corpses.

  > Happy Groundhog Day everybody! I bring you gifts of new chapters on this very special day!

  > I have a confession to make. I did not really finish the entire story. The epilogue still isn't finished, so there is one more update I have to make after this. 

  > The reason I did this was because:
  a) The chapters I did write outright end the plot of the novel. Not having an epilogue is annoying, but shouldn't diminish people's enjoyment of the ending too much.
  b) My editor convinced me I should extend the epilogue a little and make it more fleshed out. After thinking about it somewhat, I agree it will probably be more satisfying for the reasons if I did that. Even if they don't really get their promised ending post as a result.

  > I know that some of you have increased your donations in response to my promise of making this the final update. Be sure to return your pledges to their normal levels after today! Or just cancel them altogether if you want to - I won't mind. I don't know if I'll make the epilogue a charged post - it depends on how long the new version ends up being.

          The problem with that idea is that I have really lost all enthusiasm for the Naruto fandom due to all the power creep and nonsense that the original story devolved into. I don't think it's a good idea to write a story for a fandom you no longer like, let alone do it by coming back to a fic you've abandoned 9 years ago.

  Justice Silverlake, Justice. What a poetic ending for her. The inconsistencies in each of their visions is something i am going to enjoy re-reading and dissecting. Lots of interesting bits there. Overall I am happy with the ending. It certainly lives up to the standards of the subreddit. Yes losses were minimized, but thats because of good planning. He still lost the crown and orb, Ichl is still kicking it in Ubasa and best pokemon is still hunting, now in a much more populous dense area. Will be happy to read the epilogue when it comes.

    >Ichl is still kicking it in Ubasa

    And he knows everything that happened to Red Robe in the time loop, because his soul seed reported it. He knows all about the Sovereign Gate, and expects to be present for its next activation window. Could be interesting times ahead.

    Hopefully he doesn't bear too much of a grudge against ZZ. He certainly won't be happy about losing his crown, though...
    ```

      QI doesn't look like a person who holds a grudge. I'm sure in their position he would have done something similar.

      > expects to be present for its next activation window

      Since he doesn't care about primordials decimating Cyoria, what would he do? Go crazy with magical research? During his lifetime he must have accumulated a lot of ideas that would require paying a high cost... that obstacle would disappear in the time loop.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I would expect him to use it for political purposes. Granted that we don't know what the national boundaries will look like in 400 years' time, but if there isn't Ibasan hegemony by then, expect it to happen shortly afterward. He has the resources to collect the full Key in advance, and the skill, experience and pragmatism to properly utilise the full power of the Gate, multiple lifetimes' worth of iterations. He'd return to the real world knowing everything there is to know about every other government in the world.

        Also, it would be an unparalleled opportunity for necromantic experimentation, and he recognises very few ethical limitations.

        Only thing is, I'm not sure whether the Guardian would refuse to accept him as the Controller. There might be specific rules against undead.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          Don't forget that the only reason Zach got in was because *the angels* specifically marked him with a contract.

          I don't see QI getting the same offer, and there's no other way in.  The Key doesn't even do anything related to permissions, it just fixes The Gate if it broke.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            > The Key doesn't even do anything related to permissions

            Incorrect. Chapter 55, the Guardian clearly states that the Key is able to mark a Controller. In Zach's case, the angels did it instead, which is also one of the stated methods.
            ```

            - u/Ardvarkeating101:
              ```
              I thought that was the Controller being intentionally unclear again, like it claimed that the Key will grant the Controller it's full permissions... which it did, by fixing itself and then not giving him any more permissions.
              ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                It did grant more privileges. It unbarred the Gate.

                Technically, being recognised as the true Controller among competing claims is also a privilege. The fact that he was allied with the pretender doesn't change that.

                The Guardian didn't lie to them; if they weren't allowed to know something, it said so. I would be inclined to believe its statements about how Controllers are marked.
                ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          The problem is, it would also make a great trap to catch QI with, and destroy him entirely.

          That is, I'm pretty sure that in order for QI to use the Sovereign Gate, he'll need show up *with his phylactery physically present* to the Sovereign Gate.  Otherwise, being in a different universe from it will probably sever the connection.

          So, all you have to do destroy QI is wait, with overwhelming force, for him to show up to enter the Gate.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Interesting idea. If the Gate exactly recreates the whole world, though, I would think it would recreate the spells that bind his soul to his avatar and to his phylactery, so he would be able to interact normally with them in the loop, and then he'd be bound to his real world avatar again with almost no lapsed time.

            Or the Guardian would refuse to accept him.
            ```

      - u/polenero:
        ```
        I believe he would research divine magic. Zorian managed to learn a bit in a few months due to the time loop restoring the artifacts. Imagine what Quatach-Ichl can do when he has centuries to study the divine artifacts.
        ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      > and expects to be present for its next activation window

      To take advantage of Sovereign Gate one must be marked by its creator or its agent. Will he be marked? Even if he got marked, will he survive inside? Remember that the artifact is increasingly damaged. Who said it will still protect its controller? I don't think the artifact will get activated ever again. Not unless somebody can repair it.
      ```

      - u/narfanator:
        ```
        Nah. There's a clear and obvious indicator that you're on the inside of the Gate: no spirit world. (The "when" is super easy). Now you just need to find the looper.... or have all/enough of the artifacts that they come looking for \*you\*. Then convince them to add a "temporary" marker, and also to accept just a little self-updating memory package that they'll be able to carry out, just like with Jornak....  


        Plus, you've got a known way to get the Gate activated: Release a primordial!  


        So now in four hundred years, QI "tries" to release Panax again. When the looper shows up, do some soul magic fucker to stick a similar thing as with RR, and make sure the looper forgets you ever did that. You on the outside gets the fragment, and doesn't bother with the rest. Well, or most of the rest, since you're still a Machiavellian bastard.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          If you can gather the Key, why wait around and try to hijack the Controller? Just mark yourself, or a trusted subordinate if the Gate won't accept a lich.
          ```

        - u/sambelulek:
          ```
          Better subversion than what u/thrawnca offered. Still, will they mark someone before it gets repaired?
          ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        He can gather the Key and mark himself.

        He might even have a subordinate he trusts enough to send in, with suitably impressive rewards for the knowledge that they bring back. Having foreknowledge, it would be reasonably safe, since his looped self would always have awareness of the loop and be able to supervise. They could even start the loop in chains and have him review their memories before releasing them and sending them out each time.
        ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      Assuming that the angels ever activate the Gate again. There's nothing forcing them to do so, and especially now that they're aware of how much influence the primordials can have within the looped universes, and now that QI is aware of what to look for in order to know that he's no longer in the real world.
      ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  I have to say, I love the way Zorian dealt with Oganj.

  "I'll give you an unspeakably powerful divine artifact if you stop helping Red Robe try to free Panaxeth."

  "Hmm.  Two unspeakably powerful divine artifacts and it's a deal."

  "Done."
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Honestly, given just what Zorian was offering, and the drawbacks of releasing Panaxeth, it was a pretty good deal. And Zorian had the perfect escrow available.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      And, while I'm sure there will be capital-C Consequences to giving Oganj that much of a power boost, in that moment it's a pretty good deal for Zorian as well.  Of the five top-tier threats, Silverlake is neutralized, Cyclops Demon is dead, and QI is elsewhere, leaving only Oganj and RR, and Zach is engaged in what is pretty much a stalemate with the latter.  It's pretty much an end to the battle and to the possibility of Panaxeth being released; it'd be cheap at twice the price.
      ```

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        to be fair, Oganj doesn't really get a power boost. QI is also frightenly powerful without it. for the most part, it's never mentioned that people considered draining and outlasting a dragon's mana as a strategy to beating one. and Zach had beaten the dragon solo before, even if nearly unreproducible even within the loop, so taking the crown back shouldn't be that different from beating him normally
        ```

        - u/bumbiedumb:
          ```
          Im toying with an idea in my head of a shaky alliance between Z&Z and QI to rob the poor old lizard of his recent gains in the epilogue. Will be hilarious to see all three of them fighting a dragon together.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            I think it's feasible. QI probably wouldn't be all that mad at them provided he gets his crown back; they actually fulfilled his plan about as well as could be expected. It was just that the angels' scheme, which he was relying on, was to stop the release instead of fighting the primordial afterward. That's not their fault, and he wouldn't have wanted the primordial to rage freely, nor would he probably have liked the scorched earth countermeasures.

            And he has a good track record for straight dealing.
            ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          It's still not negligible. QI said in chapter 81 that the crown gave him ten times the mana reserves, on top of his divine blessing, and he started at about magnitude 25 and has certainly maxed his growth.

          So, firstly, QI will have to fight much more conservatively than usual.

          Secondly, that actually is enough of a boost to matter to a dragon. Judging by QI's numbers, it can store mana equal to approximately magnitude 1000, and the author has indicated before that Zach at magnitude 200-ish (50 plus full growth) could potentially cast some lesser draconic spells, so 1000 is enough to make a difference.

          Let's suppose that the draconic equivalent of magic missile costs 200, nearly all of Zach's reserves. Most mages would be pretty happy about carrying an item that can store enough personal mana to cast 5 extra magic missiles.
          ```

          - u/GoXDS:
            ```
            I meant for Oganj it’s not that much of a *direct* power boost. There’s probably some things he’d be able to do more like raze 5 cities in a row nonstop but if someone was directly capable of challenging him, the crown doesn’t change anything. Tho I guess it’s possible I’m underestimating how conservative Oganj needs to be himself with his spells

             For QI I definitely agree it’s significant and my comment with regards to him were in reference more so to him fighting Oganj to reclaim the crown. And I’d imagine QI wasn’t going to expect to win nor attempt a challenge through sheer brute force that would last especially long. Tho maybe I’m overestimating his base.
            ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Yes, there will be Consequences, but as Jornak pointed out, a bunch of them will fall on Oganj. QI will definitely want his crown back, and ZZ will want the orb. Between them, even a dragon mage could easily have a bad day.

        Neither of the two were entirely honest, but Ibery *did* pursue Fortov rather aggressively and forced a kiss on him before getting pushed into magical poison ivy. What Fortov isn't saying is that that he accepted her help many, many times in the past, basically feeding into her crush. He never thought of her as anything other than a friend, though, it was all one-sided on her part.

  Actually kinda glad QI survived. The amount of priceless knowledge that would have been lost with him is incalculable. He's kinda just too great to die, eh?

    Honestly the Jornak chapter's ending should have been predictable but Zorian's plan honestly caught me off guard.  Brilliant stuff!
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      It was very considerate of Jornak to launch the invasion a day early, so that Zorian had time to thoroughly loot his mind before he liquefied.
      ```

      - u/vallar57:
        ```
        To be fair, it was Zorian who triggered the attack a day early, by launching his own. The other side was prepared, but could wait otherwise.
        ```

      - u/sambelulek:
        ```
        Not one day early though... It's in the day before the eve. So maybe 12 hours early.
        ```

        - u/AKAAkira:
          ```
          No, it's one day early.

          Chapter 100:

          > On a peaceful and sunny day, just one day before the summer festival, the city of Cyoria suddenly went to hell.

          Chapter 106:

          > Zorian opened his eyes, letting the spell finally collapse. He breathed a sigh of relief. He was beyond exhausted. He and his simulacrums had maintained a… fake illusionary word… two of them, actually… and had done that for more than a day, without rest or sleep. [*sic*]
          ```

          - u/sambelulek:
            ```
            Eve of Festival is the time when people celebrates with dance and music. Eve is before the day. Eve is also the time when the invader invades. So, yes,it's one day before the Festival, but not one day before the usual invasion.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              > it's one day before the Festival, but not one day before the usual invasion.

              The invasion normally happened during the festival, literally launching artillery during the fireworks for camouflage. There's no difference.
              ```

            - u/AKAAkira:
              ```
              Huh. You know, looking through the story again, I think you're right. It somehow didn't register to me that the party wasn't the actual start of the summer festival, just a celebration preluding to it.

              And the language of Zach's contract mentioned in-story said the kill-switch activation happened at the "end of the month", which I'm pretty sure means twelve o'clock of the night of the party, so Zorian and Zach cut it really close attacking on the last day available.

              But then Jornak's POV in chapt. 105 said he started the invasion a day before the actual due date? I wonder if that was meant not quite literally, as in "one calendar date before the due date" which would be less than 24 hours before the deadline, rather than "more than twenty-four hours beforehand" that I was thinking of, or if his kill-switch activation actually happened a bit later than Zach's...
              ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                I think it's like New Year parties; they start on New Year's Eve, but that doesn't mean they're a day early, it means that they're in the day/night leading up to a point.
                ```

      ```
      a few moments after being taken aback at "zach yadda yadda yadda" i stopped and thought for a few moments and predicted the next one will be this but jornak and then the last one will be zorian

  Zorian setting the greyhound on Silverlake was absolutely hilarious, honestly my favorite part out of everything. Loved the interaction between old and young Silverlake. I'm not at all surprised that a copy of her has gone crazy before and tried to kill her other selves. 

  It's sad to see this story ended but the ending lived up my expectations. Really liked the part of him bypassing the mind blank. If anyone could do it, it's Zorian. Can't wait to see the epilogue, Zorian mindwiping everybody's memories of the last month is absolutely insane and I know the government is gonna be absolutely terrified.

    > Zorian setting the greyhound on Silverlake was absolutely hilarious

    I loved that part so much, it was such a brilliant idea.

    Take the one monster that Silverlake could never defeat, the one monster that learned all her combat tactics and adapted to overcome them, and sic that monster on her.

    She was utterly screwed the moment it appeared and she knew it XD.
    ```

    - u/ksarnek:

      There is only one thing that Silverlake fears more than a grey hunter: herself. And Zorian by pure luck managed to sic both on young Silverlake at the same time!

  - u/ksarnek:
    ```
    > Loved the interaction between old and young Silverlake

    I could practically see the confidence fade from young Silverlake's face when she realized it was over. From her point of view she had done this before to the rogue copy.

    I agree, overall was an extremely satisfying finale. It felt carefully designed, and it left me the impression that if I had paid just a little more attention I could have figured everything out.

  So, this was a pretty decent outcome for QI, so long as he gets his crown back.

  His original plan was to release the primordial and let the angels deal with it in some unspecified fashion. That didn't happen. But it turned out that the angels' plan was for Zach to prevent the release, which suggests that this was about the best outcome available to him. He wouldn't really have wanted a primordial running around the world indefinitely, and Cyoria/Eldemar would definitely feel the sting of the invasion for a while.

  Great ending to an awesome story.

  I love the things left open... for later...

  - Organj with two define artifacts. Remember when Zach got to carry the crown because it would help him more than Zorian - it gives a bonus as a percentage of your current reserves... and without that boost the dragon is already at least somewhat comparable to a high level angel. Who's hyped for hypothetical-book-2 "Zorian and the Dragon Tyrant"?

  - Grey hunter enhanced with Panaxeth primordial essence. Another already-unstoppable killing machine, now potentially enhanced to an unknown level.

  - Quatach-Ichl. Beaten, battered, but not destroyed. Wiser from the experience. An ally against Organj perhaps? No doubt that would mean awarding him the crown, and how far could he ever be trusted?

  - Political instability may lead to war. Jornak claimed Eldemar is horribly corrupt, maybe that is his twisted perspective, maybe not.

  - What caused the weeping?
  ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    You are mistaken about the crown. It does not give a percent boost. For Zorian its something like a 100x boost. For Zach its a 10x. The reason Zach uses the crown is that the crown does not provide a boost to mana regen which is a percent of total reserves normally. So for Zorian recharging the crown takes around 10x the time it takes for Zach to do so. As a result its more practical for him and Zorian is already specialized in a low mana efficient style of combat anyway.
    ```

    - u/DerSaidin:
      ```
      Ah, thanks!

      I wonder what Organj's regen rate will be relative to his pool and use rate in prolonged combat (prolonged enough for his already large reserve to matter) with the crown.

      Still though, scary dragon got scarier.
      ```

      - u/theRandomTiger:
        ```
        He would regenerate it quickly, but even Zach has less mana than a dragon. I think at its most useful, assuming Zach has half his reserves, it would quintuple (5x) Organj’s mana reserves. If it’s less than that, it gets proportionally smaller and smaller. But even double reserves is no good for a dragon who can regenerate it so quickly. 

        I wonder how QI’s crown retrieval will go when he’s somewhat equivalent to Zach and Zorian without it increasing his mana reserves. But he’s very crafty, so I do think he has a chance of recovering it.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          I'm pretty sure that Oganj has more than double Zach's reserves. The author has suggested that Zach might be able to learn entry level draconic magic (although I doubt that that there's a dragon who would teach him). So, Zach's whole reserves are like a single draconic magic missile.

          Still, if the crown can hold about ten times as much as QI's reserves (which are similar to Zach's), then that means it's about an extra ten magic missiles for Oganj. Nothing to sneeze at, and there's nothing else in the world like it.

Some of them quite probably have knowledge of Time loop, RR side didn't have strict req to keep that info sealed, and RR seemed to be kind of guy who surely would tell someone about Time loop for one of his contingency plans.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Oganj probably does not know anything about time loop. But anyway,

    Contract is for Zach to not allow that info leaked before the end of the month. If Zach didn't know someone know, then it's fine. That's why, after he saw Zorian died along with his three enemies, he only checked his allies: Xvim, Alanic, Daimen, and the Arachnea. As far as he know, nobody else should know. Thus, he fulfilled that part of contract.

    About random citizen that got their memories wiped, Zach will think it's an extra-paranoid move from Zorian part. It will also suggest to him that Zorian got everyone in his mass mind-wipe. Zach is safe.

    What angel imply going after anyone knowing about time loop is for when Panaxeth released. It's not part of the contract, but a low key threat they threw to Zorian. Zorian, in turn, throw the same threat toward Quatach Ichl. Due to Pan remain sealed, there's no reason to carry the threat. The angels turn a blind eye as they promised.
    ```

  - u/vallar57:
    ```
    It doesn't matter. Only Zach's perception is important, and he's convinced that everyone lost memories. He checked everyone who he knew was clued in, after all. You can't expect him to go for everyone who *might* be clued in, since it's the entire world if you are paranoid enough.

    Also Zorian did modify his memory slightly.

    Btw, it was never said if Oganj knows about the time loop.
    ```

  I just realise that the time loop did change silverlake and becomes her downfall. She unconsciously believed that her doppelgänger will behave similarly with zach and zorian doppelgängers due to multiple exposures and the nature of time-loops. The time-loop had mellowed out her sense of caution towards a copy of her. She had dismissed the old silverlake as unimportant and not threatening. 

  Another reason to be added on will be that Silverlake is so self centered that shes unable to think from the perspective of the old her.  Both of which let to her dead and downfall. Am i right u/nobody103
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    If Silverlake was exposed to the same stress level as the other three loopers, then sure. But she's only lived a year in time loop. She's also all the time shielded from dangers, both from fellow loopers (due to her vital role) and from outside world (due to Zorian's Gift scheme). She won't be that different than she was. 

    And remembering she's the reckless type, I think she just forgot old Silverlake exist.
    ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    more likely, at least in part, she was busy dealing with the backlash of being cut off from her familiar and also just busy in general and didn't want to deal with a confrontation with her old self who has likely been warned and also the possibility of running into Z&Z
    ```

    - u/bumbiedumb:
      ```
      Yea that do play a part. But it just feel so sloppy of her careful character to let what she normally perceived as a huge threat be running around without any policing from her part. Which is why i feel that she subconsciously thought that the old her is not a threat.

- u/Dragonheart91:

  I felt like that was pretty much the expected ending in almost every way. A few surprises like I feel that Silverlake might be surviving inside the gray hunter. The partial mind wipe of some allies was a bit rough. But overall no serious consequences and everything went according to plan.
  ```

  - u/heroeric18:
    ```
    Even if she survived she would still be killed to the death pact since she failed to release Panaxeth

    Surviving inside the grey hunter? It didn't swallow her whole; it liquefied her organs and drank her like a juice box. Zorian found her empty skin afterward.

  Not sure if I missed it, but why does Zach's angelic contract not trigger on the knowledge that Oganj flew away?  Did Zorian erase that part of Zach's memory, or did Zach never see that happen, or does Zach assume Oganj does not know about the time loop?
  ```

  - u/nobody103:
    ```
    Zach assumes Oganj does not know about the time loop.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:

      He might be right, too. It was very much an alliance of convenience and profit, not trust; giving Oganj such important information wouldn't be done lightly.

  He was Quatach-Ichl

  ... and he had won



  Did the lich never knew about the loop? I mean from before... Are we sure he did not start this whole plan to free the primordial in order for angels to activate this gate? He had one of the imperial artifacts and he knew loopers would look for him. What did that soul seed do? Maybe it communicated with the lich at each interaction and the lich only acted as he did not know he was inside the time loop?
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    >He had one of the imperial artifacts and he knew loopers would look for him.

    I'm pretty sure that he didn't know about the loop before this month (otherwise he would have handled Zach differently in chapter 4). Of course, he knows now.

    Jornak felt the soul seed leave him when he returned to the real world, which wouldn't make sense if it was able to do its job remotely. Why not leave him bugged if that were feasible?
    ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    adding to what thrawnca said, he also reacted very strongly when he found out about the loop from mind reading Xvim inside the loop. he definitely did not know before the loop

  Golems died in Cyoria tonight

  Mrva's nowhere to be seen

  All around me desolation

  And a fair share is on me


  The minds were howling while they died in my sight

  Couldn't keep them out, angels know I've tried

  Don't let them win, don't let them free

  Panaxeth, how bad that would be

  even with mind blank they'll never know

  where they'll go


  Let it go, let it go

  There's no looping back anymore

  Let it go, let it go

  the Guardian shut the door

  I don't care who I need to slay

  Silverlake is gone

  and death never bothered me anyway


  Let it go, let it go

  let the city burn to the floor

  Let it go, let it go

  and dismiss the rotting gore

  here I stand, on a bright new day

  yes the loop is gone

  but with Zach there is still a chance of [Ho Yay](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay).
