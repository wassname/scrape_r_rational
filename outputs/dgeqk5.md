## Rattle Fiction Podcast Episode 9: The Grakian Choice

### Post:

[Episode 9](https://soundcloud.com/rattle-fiction-pod/episode-9-the-grakian-choice) of the Rattle Fiction podcast is now live!

This episode is a reading of [The Grakian Choice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rXcWkV-ce39d4091MEjaOIs691Y9bmGzJeRxzXcxj7Y/edit) by /u/ExiledQuixoticMage. The story was submitted as part of the recent Secret Krampus [story thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/d9hc43/winners_of_the_secret_krampus_contest/).

The Rattle Fiction podcast can be found on most podcast apps (except iTunes / Apple Podcast for now)...

Have a story you'd like to hear? Let me know, I'm very open to suggestions. I'm leaning towards rational fiction less than 50,000 words right now.

Enjoy!

  Nice! I enjoyed all of the contest entries, but this one was my favorite. Good to see it getting the audiobook treatment.
