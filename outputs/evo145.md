## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I'm toying with the idea of a fantasy setting where one or more characters are genre-savvy. The sidekicks and romantic interests are constantly in danger or killed, other narrative forces are clearly at play.

  A benevolent being of great power decides to break the world by making it a satire of itself. It has now been 34 years since our last apocalypse. Keep up the good work!

  I'm looking for ideas for heroic archetypes to play with. What I've come up with so far:

  * Serial Isekai protagonist. He shows up in the world from Earth, shakes his head, and says "Not this again!"

  * Half human, quarter angel, quarter demon magical girl who decides instead to just practice law.

  * Seventh son of a seventh son with world-breaking arcane might who won't touch that power. He'd rather just run errands for a living and buy blacksmith puzzles with his spare change.

  * A noble knight who rides a giant peafowl.

    >ideas for heroic archetypes

    A few, off the top of my head, twisted similarly to the ones you have above:

    * Long-lost heir to the Kingdom, raised on a farm.  A nice person, and quite good with knowing where and when to plant turnips, but completely unsuited to any kind of leadership or diplomacy.
    * Someone with a birthmark matching the prophecy of the Chosen One, who, other than that birthmark, matches nothing else about the prophecy.
    * A homebody who claims they don't want adventure and will just be a detriment to the mission but is dragged along anyway... and actually *is* a detriment to the mission.
    * Someone who lied about their identity (gender, age, experience, etc.) in order to join the mission to save the country... who turns out to just be a compulsive liar.

    * A character whose power's theme just absolutely drips evil and corruption, who is an utterly idealistic and committed crusader for all that is right and good.
    * Incedibly competent and forward thinking Damsel trying to set up contingencies and systems for the kingdom to handle its stuff the next time she is kidnapped.
    * Dragon who is a recovering hoard-aholic, desperately trying to stay clean and do a little good.
    * Character who is obviously the Maoh in disguise, but the disguise is garbage and everyone can tell, they play along because the harm he can wreak as a spy utterly pails before the harm he would do leading the Forces of Evil.

    * Someone who's is convinced they're in a hyperrealistic MMO
    * Someone who thinks they're from an entirely different milieu yet somehow manages to be actually effective (e.g, a cyberpunk decker who's convinced she's "hacking the mainframe" (casting spells) with her "deck" (a grimoire))
    * Someone who's from the actual future, except they're _really bad_ at history so now they're useless ("Oh I think we ended up calling this the "war of the roses" in my time!" "You idiot, the war of the roses ended a hundred years ago!")
    * Someone with the power to save and reload, except it's restricted purely to their own internal timeline, and it's literally the only thing they're good at. They just keep on fumbling through everything getting more and more mentally scarred as time goes on. (this might be literally Subaru from Re: Zero)
    * Someone who has a time traveler looking out for them (or in other words, a Doctor Who companion from the other side)

    Take a look at [Arrogant Young Master](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4) which does what you are saying but for cultivation stories specifically. Other than that:

    Twins that are separated at birth with one twin ending up being good and the other being bad.

    The bad guy is in fact the hero's father.

    Peasant boy has his family killed and gets revenge after a long series of training and adventures.

    The bad guys will send level appropriate mobs at the heros, allowing the heroes to barely survive and gain combat experience.

    A villain is doomed to be stopped by a prophesy and the only reason that it ends up happening is due to the actions he takes to stop the prophesy. Especially by creating the hero in some way.

    The white knight that comes to rescue in a dire situation after a long combat will always win.

    A street urchin has a secret talent but never received training until discovered by the wise mentor.

  I've been researching how first contact would go, and one of the big questions I want answered is what research on first contact messages there is out there.

  By "first contact message" I mean a string of bits that encodes some kind of obvious structure. One extremely common suggestion is the primes. But messages in Sci fi tend to be more complex than that, encoding advanced math and information about the world. Are there any resources for research, examples, or ideas related to that?
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    the point of beginning with primes isn't that the prime numbers are world-shattering information, but that it lets aliens understand how we communicate with a nearly unmistakeable pattern that isn't often found in nature. That is, it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that our communication is intelligent, aimed towards them, and *communication*. Once primes are sent, we hopefully begin mirroring. They recognize that we're trying to open communications, and try to mirror our communications to get a grasp at how we respond. So if they send some sequence back at us, we'd send that same sequence, but extended. e.g., they send us, 2,4,8,10, we send 2,4,8,10,12. If we've properly guessed at what they were sending us, we're capable of copying what they did, and adding a little bit more. If we've made a bad guess, then when we send back (what seems to be) gibberish, the aliens likely act different (in a predictable way) to how they'd act if we sent back the 'right' communication.

    From there, it becomes a game of hypothesis testing-- if given input X, what do we expect the aliens to do with it? What do they actually do? Meanwhile, the aliens are doing the same to us, establishing the basic reciprocity that we can expect, from a game-theoretical perspective, to be present in any life form both intelligent enough for spacefaring and benevolent enough not to kill us and take our resources on sight.

      No, I get that, the reason I included references to physics and stuff is so that they can actually talk about time and space. It can be hard to talk about stuff like time and associated units without some kind of reference like that (or it could be defined in relation to the carrier signal, but the point remains)

      As for hypothesis testing, that's basically what I'm trying to build into one object. Take everything you're going to teach them and just cram it into one dense binary string. Kinda like this

      1;2;3;5;7;11;
      0=0;
      1=1;
      2=2;
      3=3;
      4=4;
      1+1=2;
      1+2=3;
      5x5=5+5+5+5+5=25;

      and so on, until you define how to send audio and video to each other. It's like giving them a textbook. And it also works if you only have one shot at communicating, like if they live 100 light years away

        Sam Hughes's Fine Structure and John C. Wright's Count to a Trillion have something like that. A self-decrypting encyclopedia galactica. Robert J. Sawyer's Starplex (I think it was starplex) where we go from arithmetic to language. E.g. 1+1=2 means "yes" and 1+1=3 means "no" or something like that. I don't remember the details, but I'd like to see someone go farther with that.

      This seems like it's potentially a waste of time to attempt. When you're talking about transmission times of hundreds of years at best, it would be millions of years before we could understand each other. Instead, I think it's better to basically send several massive packages of information and let them sort it out on their end. Transmitting a binary representation of any sufficiently long sample of language in ASCII format (like sending tens of thousands of uncompressed non-fiction books without pictures) would be immensely informative, and would be clearly distinct from any possible natural phenomenon.

      A data stream like that using a completely alien language would provide a lot of room for useful analysis. If we received such a message, we'd have no idea what anything in it is supposed to look like (text-wise), but we could begin using statistical analysis to see which things are common, which things commonly (or always) follow other things, which short sequences occur very regularly (typically used for chunking, like with our spaces, tabs, and new lines) and even start working out their "spelling" and grammar based on how certain groups always appear before or after certain other groups. Even without knowing the meaning, we could work out similarity in meaning based on seeing the same "words" being used interchangeably, or being frequently used in the same context as other "words." You've provided the dump of data to be decrypted, and now everything else you send is context to try to crack the code.

      With that analysis ongoing, you could then try to tie in meaning to the things you're sending. You could send a sequence of prime numbers (in ASCII format), the Fibonacci sequence, and various other sequences, first in binary but then in ASCII format again. Sending them in the same linguistic format provides the beginning of meaning for the ASCII data. Once numbers are understood in that format, the same sequences could be sent as words. Mathematical formulae and their inputs/outputs could be sent the same way. You've now provided the basis for understanding anything math-related in the database you provided, and for mathmatical operators, most importantly "=". This can allow you to help with redundancies, e.g. by saying " ft. = feet     m = meters     1 meter = 3.2808 feet". This doesn't tell them what feet or meters are, but it does tell them that numbers expressed with those units can be converted into the other units, so they can start to narrow down the complexity of the text you sent them.

      Mathematical units are where you really get into some deep understanding. Dimensional analysis by looking at certain powers of units for unknown mathematical and physical constants would, with enough constants being defined and related to each other, allow those units to be understood. Now every measurement in your texts can be understood and related to those universally-understood constants.

      From there, specifying things like distance from the galactic center or distance from the sun would allow them to understand "galactic center" and "sun", assuming they've already made those measurements for themselves. Continuing like this would quickly begin to provide the information needed to crack the code you initially provided.

      The last key part is pictures. To start off, you might send messages on various frequencies and say, in ASCII, what frequency of light the message is sent on. Once they get this, you can express most colors as a frequency of light. Next, send stronger and slightly weaker signals, saying in ASCII the amplitude of the signal. Now they get amplitude.

      Next would be to learn rasterization.  If you repeatedly sent ASCII-coded "Picture: X" followed by a multiple of primes-sized 1-bit grayscale rasterizations of images of various subjects, followed by "Description: X" to describe what is shown, it's fairly likely that they'd recognize the change in data type with the images, eventually attempt to rasterize the unusual data at some point, and be greeted by unmistakeable symbols. For example, you might start with a triangle or a circle, along with various other mathematically-important two-dimensional shapes. With pictures understood, you can start to show grayscale rasterizations of the various nouns used in your texts, and descriptions of those nouns to help tie meaning to the words you sent previously.

      You could then say something like "Frequency picture of X:" and then "Frequency + amplitude picture of X" and have your ASCII-described frequencies and amplitudes used to provide colored images, with the same descriptions you sent previously with the grayscale rasterizations. After that, you might have "Three frequency + amplitude picture" and send a picture which would provide the full range of colors we're used to. After that, you can start to describe verbs by showing sequences of pictures. "A person running, 0.01 seconds:", "A person running, 0.02 seconds", etc. You could also describe colors and other visually-obvious adjectives, and demonstrate adverbs as well as most prepositions with this approach. That's pretty much all you'd need to get the language, culture, and basic understanding of humanity. The rest of the initial data dump provides a lot of context clues to help fill in some of the gaps.

      Altogether, this might only take a few years to send everything, and it would provide decent odds that you can understand their reply in a few hundred years when it finally gets to you.

        Given that this is a fiction discussion board, I assumed "first contact" meant substantially close to real-time communications, as that's easier and more engaging to write about. Long-distance transmissions of course have different associated strategies, though I'd suspect that it would still be important to make sure transmissions are easily distinguishable as being produced by an advanced society, rather than some natural process.

  question: how might parallel universes conduct trade with one another *without* bartering? 

  suppose you have maybe ten or so parallel universes that became connected to one another in the late 2010s – they're all different, with some having points of historical divergence going back to the 1400s. in case it's important, in this verse you can't transport anything heavier than twenty kilos cross-universe, it takes ten minutes to travel from one universe to another, and a conscious human needs to do it. constraint number two: they're surrounded by an infinite number of uninhabited parallel universes, so using a natural mineral deposit like gold as a shared medium of exchange isn't an option.
  ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    So you're looking for a multiversal currency? How about an energy price to maintain these wormholes/portals. Things are given value by providing power to run the portal for a specific amount of time or a specific amount of mass. For example "I'll trade you this x for y minutes of 'portal power' " or similar.

      oh right, sorry, there's some additional background context that I forgot to include. the cross-universe transport method is [a Stepper box](https://thelongearth.fandom.com/wiki/Stepper_Boxes) from the Long Earth series - it's a small box, uses basic electronic components, powered by a potato or any starchy root vegetable, and it doesn't generate a portal so much as instantly transport the user to the adjacent universe in either direction. someone made a list of all the components [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20160319152607/http://kurtnalty.com/LongEarth/Willis_Linsay_Stepper.pdf) (pdf warning). the plot-relevant transport restriction in the Long Earth series is that anything containing iron stays behind unless it's in a non-magnetic compound like haemoglobin. 

      your line of thought about price of transport opens up some interesting questions about how alternate worlds would be able to produce tunnel diodes, capacitors, rocker switches, etc. (I'm guessing for industrialised societies this would be a temporary barrier, but I don't know what the technological infrastructure needed to produce these electronic components is like). it seems to me that this is an interesting area to explore but I'm not sure whether it would be able to form a basis for a stable currency?

    The uninhabited worlds will have any amount of raw matter (like gold), pretty much free for the taking. Similarly for energy, if the parallel worlds have stars. This means that there will be only two things that can reasonably be traded between the universes; manufactured goods, and information.

    "Information" is a broad category that includes various forms of entertainment (films, VR holonovels, etc.) and many other high-value items (such as a design for a more efficient CPU). However, one cannot easily make a currency out of it; a film may be anything from 'abysmal' to 'amazing' and the buyer won't know until he has the whole thing.

    So, let's consider manufactured goods. Processors might be a useful medium of exchange; every world can manufacture their own CPU chips, they can be rated with different values depending on the number of onboard transistors, they can't be harvested from uninhabited worlds, and they're small enough that a huge pile of them can be carried to another world at once.

    --------------

    The other option, of course, is something like Bitcoin...

      ```
      the big constraint I forgot to mention is that you can't move iron or anything containing iron (except non-magnetic iron compounds) between universes, but these are all good thoughts. I guess it depends on the degree of divergence between universes

      * shared history pre-1980s/90s means shared high-density storage formats & videotape - otherwise encoding and reading data would be nightmarish given how arbitrary most of it is, different outcomes to format wars like vhs vs betamax, etc.. books would be easy, films would be harder (unless you're using something analog as a medium), software would probably be very hard (arcane copyright restrictions, incompatible OS, incompatible hardware, divergent GUI philosophies would keep alt-world software from being easily used by consumers). I would think that most of the trade volume in IP would be simple-to-manufacture patents, but as you say none of this seems to be a good foundation for a universal currency...

      * and further back in time, we might be looking at cultures without modern IP law, or very different attitudes towards IP - or even law itself - which would make negotiating a common cross-universal legal framework much harder

      * manufactured goods - this is perfect solution but CPU chips specifically would be a no-go. I'm thinking that the main criteria 1. what you said with not being able to harvest it from uninhabitable worlds, requires an extensive manufacturing process 2. some kind of continuous property like no. of onboard transistors, weight/volume/length, etc. 3. is useful to any society at any level of development 4. transport constraints - iron content, weight. 5. unlikely for different universes to have independently invented them so there's a clear demand, in our timeline they would have been discovered by accident

       * my first thought here is maybe synthetic materials, particularly lightweight plastics and synthetic fibres? vulcanised rubber, teflon would be as useful to a feudal society as an industrialised market-capitalist one. the main constraint would be it'd have to be easy to melt down and use, tough enough to resist constant handling, easy to mold into chips/coins with identification markers saying what they are and how much they weigh, and hard to manufacture except with a very long chemical process known only to Universe X. not a materials engineer so I don't know what synthetic material would fit the bill here.

       * 2nd thought is vaccines - would be especially in demand since cross-universe merchants would also be disease-carriers. the chances are good that some universes haven't discovered penicillin yet. would only be valuable to governments / anyone with an interest & the capacity to vaccinate a population

      * I don't know much about bitcoin or crypto, so my question would be is it possible to update ledgers if anything containing iron can't be transported? how important is timing for crypto mining? or maybe each universe would have its own crypto making that irrelevant?

      or maybe I'm thinking about it wrong? the method of transport here is a Stepper box which is cheap and simple to make, so most of the initial inter-universal trade volume would be people peddling their wares in exchange for local currency. in that case maybe I can just assume that governments will figure out currency pegs for official transactions + some market-determined exchange-rate, but that feels like a cop-out since I want to explore the political and social implications more

        > you can't move iron or anything containing iron (except non-magnetic iron compounds)

        > the method of transport here is a Stepper box

        Wait, this is a Long Earth fanfic, with multiple inhabited Earths? Neat.

        ...this immediately suggests a few points of consideration. Assuming that, as with the novels, the alternate worlds are arranged in a *line*, it's possible (indeed, inevitable) for them to have different levels of access to the Uninhabited Earths. For example, if world B lies between worlds A and C, then B only has access to the Uninhabited Earths *between* A and C, unless their mining operations pass through A or C.

        That will have political and social implications.

        > I don't know much about bitcoin or crypto, so my question would be is it possible to update ledgers if anything containing iron can't be transported? how important is timing for crypto mining? or maybe each universe would have its own crypto making that irrelevant?

        You'd need to transport data, not iron. Transporting data is not hard, if both universes are willing to share their data encoding standards (whatever their variant of USB is) and to agree on a file format for cross-universe transfer. (None of these are big secrets, so it should be straightforward).

        I don't know for sure how important timing is, but I suspect that as long as there's a steady (say, once an hour) flow of information between two universes, then it should work fine. (Now I'm imagining three people taking shifts walking back and forth with a hard drive.)

        --------------

        But I am starting to wonder if you even *need* in inter-universe exchange medium. After all, America trades with Britain just fine, despite the fact that one country works in pounds while the other works in kilograms.

  [Yesterday Upon The Stairs](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8337607/chapters/19098982) is an My Hero Academia fanfic in which Izuku(the main character) doesn't start out quirkless but instead has the ability to see and interact with ghosts. The power is used as a plot device but is woefully underutilized by Izuku. I think it could be fun to throw at r/rational and see what you could make of it. The parameters of the power is that

  * Izuku can talk to ghost but doesn't not have any power to make them do things they wouldn't otherwise do.
  * Ghosts can only in very limited form interact with the real world. They can't physically influence people or do sustained effect on inanimate objects. They can to some extend manipulate the feelings of the living- Ghost can hurt and kill other ghosts. They can perform weak bursts of effect on inanimate objects(scatter glass, tip an object over). Due to his power ghosts can interact with him as a human could with another human.

  My initial thoughts was gathering a big group of ghosts and using them to searching for victims for search and rescue, cheat in poker, have ghosts carry him and thus levitate, have ghost actively pull him or be used to shift momentum suddenly in fight, befriend a ghost doctor and have that doctor instruct him in what to do in emergencies, have ghosts spy on living people including having them follow the big baddies.

    What does he have for ghosts that can motivate them? The only one I can think of is making them happier by experiences, or helping out humans the ghost cares about (surviving relatives?).

    If they just want to enjoy the afterlife (assuming 'tortured souls' ghost type), he could set them up in an art college that bridges the gap between human and ghost. He could invent asymmetrical sports of human vs ghost. There could be art installations that are designed to be destroyed by ghosts in interesting ways.

    Ghosts presumably after-live forever, so they can remember things from long ago. History could be reconstructed very accurately.

  Currently have a royalroad story, don't think it is really a rationalfic though but some ideas may be interesting. Start has generic isekai trappings but it diverges in that there is no demon lord or any one being that can be killed and the world will be saved. The enemy that must be defeated is a massive three way cold war with regular skirmishes, the elves, dwarves, and humans all HATE eachother due to an oversight in how the system works. Cha increases your ability to convince people of things, children have low stats in all categories, human king tells young son that elves are evil, son takes it as gospel, grows up and now has high cha and cycle repeats. Gods are planetary admins, one in charge of this world has been trying to unscrew it for a thousand years before deciding he needs an outsider to fix it from the inside. God's power is limited due to prayer giving energy but altering a God's personality to be in line with worshipper's expectations so he had to unplug when the war started getting out of control and praying for your enemies to die became more common. 

  The Mc does not get any super duper special power from god, he only has average stats and is spawned near enough to a town that he can see the it without anyone noticing someone appear from thin air. After some explorations of the town he finds out there is a fourth race since they are attacking an incomplete section of the wall. He can't get any objective information anywhere since everyone hates the other races. Eventually he joins a caravan to go to a bigger city since he also doesn't have a class so a class altar is needed. While with the caravan it is attacked by the fourth race, ant people. 

  He and two others are captured (he surrendered since he never got in a serious fight) and they are taken back to the colony. He plays nice and they play nice back, other two are jerks and anta still attempt to be nice, finds out they have been attempting to capture people for weeks because they have a princess and she needed a husband. He agrees because not only does he think she is beautiful but because ants need men they literally can't be hateful to the other races or they would kill themselves so they are actually nice. They leave and start a new colony and he gains the consort class. reverse chess style, the queen is the most important but the king/consort is the one that can move in any direction, as in he gains powers based on what subtypes of ant daughters she can make. Gains weak earthbending that can only work on dirt (for now) because of first type of daughter is worker. Next gains a power field generating skill based on the soldiers, so he can hit harder or defend better. Third ant type unlocked is a sort of combination healer, light source, and air scrubber that have backlash of permanent sleep due to the extreme power demands of an always on light generator.

  His true power shows up as he tries things until something happens or breaks, because he hasn't had a thousand years of tradition telling him what is or isn't possible in the system. Eventually he figures out anyone can gain any skill but if it isn't a class skill it just doesn't appear anywhere on any menu so you have to just guess if you gained a level in it based on changes to input and output. So now he is in a cycle of building a civiliation composed of his own children, attempting to find the edges of the system, and power leveling any skills he feels he has.

  Working at the system edges is the main reason I feel this can fit in here at all. Not sure if I should ask for anything specific, so just give me any general ideas what I have presented give you.
