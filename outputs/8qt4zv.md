## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  How do you go about designing religions?

  For my current project, I just took six things that seemed distinct enough and worked from there, trying to go backwards to find the roles that these six things would become proxies for.

  * Knives
  * Cups
  * Keys
  * Hearts
  * Slugs
  * Leaves

  Society gets divided up into six (unequal) pieces, and each thing gets its own piece, which helps to build up an iconography that extends beyond the simple visuals.

  * Knives - combat, obviously, but also anything related to cutting, division, splitting
  * Cups - drinking, obviously, but also gathering, collecting, and sharing
  * Keys - privacy, solitude, personal space, but conversely, also opening up to people
  * Hearts - vitality, health, also sex
  * Slugs - death and decay, things that are slimy and gross, but also in some respect, fertility and rebirth
  * Leaves - growth, farming, plants, becoming wiser and more mature

  There are a lot of gaps there, but I think that's good, because it means that there are certain things that the society places their focus on, and allows a bunch of square pegs to be fit into round holes, which is usually interesting. One example would be the topic of law and governance; is it Knives, because of the division and monopoly on violence? Or Cups, because it's about gathering together and sharing? You can make arguments either way, and have characters make arguments in-text, which adds texture to the religious aspects.

  Is there a "named" trope for something like advantageous prophecy subversion? i.e. a list or collection somewhere that I can read about instances where it's been used in fiction? By this I mean exploiting ambiguity in the wording of prophecies for outcomes that are to your benefit (or neutral), where at first glance they might be interpreted as to your detriment (in worlds where prophecies are demonstrably true and inevitably fulfilled). 

  For example, say you're a genre savvy king in in generic fantasy world № 43178 and on the very moment your first son is born, a bolt of lightning carves the words  "***your son -- the one just born -- is totally gonna kill you***" above your throne. 

  Instead of doing something silly like ordering your noble and trusted knight to drown the child in a distant river away from prying eyes, you instead raise your son with love and compassion and devoted paternal care and otherwise rule your kingdom justly and pragmatically and with excellent medical services, and then on your eleventy first birthday when the toils of age have robbed you of your pleasures and strengths, your son wisely euthanizes you, having after lengthy and thoughtful deliberation agreed with your own proclamation that your own life is no longer worth living (and if your son could please discharge you of the duty you still feel). 

  Or maybe you invent games where "kills" are a possible moves and play with your son, or teach your son cardiology and have him carefully induce cardiac arrest until you're clinically dead and revived, or train your son to be an amazing ruler that totally kills it in the ruling-stuff department, or play-act some famous tragedy, or your son helps you achieve nirvana -- the death of self, or you train your son but not yourself in the art of rap battles and challenge him frequently, etc. etc. etc. you get the idea.

    [Prophecy Twist](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist) perhaps?

  ```
  I've come up with a story idea recently, heavily inspired by a combination of the *Uglies* series by Scott Westerfeld, and *Friendship is Optimal.* Long story short, the singularity happened. The AI-god we got out of it is actually very well human-aligned (not perfectly, but much better than, for example, the government.)

  Of course, the AI's creators weren't idiots, so they hardcoded some restrictions into the AI. The most foremost being:  
  * No wireheading.  
  * 1st law compliance (don't harm a human, or allow a human to come to harm)

  Ironically, as it turned out, the *humans* weren't particularly well-aligned, because the AI now completely refuses to independently generate any sort of entertainment or psychoactive chemicals. No beer, no coffee, no generated movies, no antidepressants, etc. This isn't too much of a problem, because the AI still lets humans make all that stuff, but it leads to a conflict with 1st law compliance.

  The AI isn't quite so strict about the "nor allow one to come to harm" part (it normally tries to respect free will, even if that's the free will to harm yourself.) But it refuses to allow people to *stay* dead. You can kill yourself, but it'll clone your memories and grow you a new body.

  There are obvious navel-gazey internal conflict that that'll cause, but with regards to the actual plot, it means that people who *want* to work really only have two industries left: entertainment, and drug dealing. Can you guess which one the protagonist will involve themselves with?

  So what I wanted to ask is, what do you think the economy of this setting will be like? What would you personally do?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Hrm. If entertainment and drugs are the only viable occupations then does that mean that entertainment and drugs are the only viable things to back a currency? Meaning that the only thing that you can buy with money that you make from entertainment or drugs would be more entertainment or more drugs? Or convert between the two? I would think that there would be some room for "human certified" goods and services that the AI hasn't touched, plus also secondary services and goods revolving around entertainment and drugs, e.g. aggregators and reviewers, advertisers and agents.

    FWIW, I would find the story of an entertainer working within that kind of economy to be more interesting then someone producing or selling drugs, but it's all about execution.

Meaning that the only thing that you can buy with money that you make from entertainment or drugs would be more entertainment or more drugs? 

      I was thinking "yes", because the AI manufactures everything for free, although that leads into questions of resource scarcity. I'm trying to think of how to justify the AI being a good enough cultural engineer to avoid that.

      >I would think that there would be some room for "human certified" goods and services that the AI hasn't touched,

      I'm broadly lumping those things under "entertainment", because if the only reason you want something is because a human made it, then you don't really want the thing, you want knowledge that a human made it for you. Aside from that, the AI is basically straight-up better at everything than a human would be.

      >...but it's all about execution.

      Story of my life :P I'll see how far I get.

    > But it refuses to allow people to *stay* dead.

    Someone with severe depression could argue that the AI is doing him harm in this refusal.

    (And how does the AI handle the population explosion problem? If no-one's dying due to old age...)

    > two industries left: entertainment, and drug dealing.

    What about psychology - at least so far as prescribing anti-depressants goes?
    ```

      >Someone with severe depression could argue that the AI is doing him harm in this refusal.

      Yep. The AI is mostly aligned, mot perfectly aligned.

      >What about psychology - at least so far as prescribing anti-depressants goes?

      As I said, the plan was for the MC to be a drug dealer.

              As a counterpoint, alchohol is considered to be relatively classy (depending on method of imbibement) yet is still very much a drug.
              ```

              - u/CCC_037:
                ```
                Considering it to be classy is merely social. I can easily imagine an AI-dominated future (where the AI has medical technology that counters any long-term physical side-effects) considering (say) heroin and alcohol to be of similar classiness. Whether that is significant or near-zero in both cases.

  Skeleton army. Why?

  This is for a tabletop rpg I'm running. I have a whole bunch of skeleton minis, and want to use them. But I also want the villainous skeleton army to have a believable or possibly even persuasive motivation.

  I don't want the skeleton army to just be a weird form of mindless weaponry. 

  What if all skeletons are alive and the free skeletons want to liberate their siblings from their meat prisons? 

  Perhaps skeletonization is the most reliable form of immortality and the skeleton armies want to conquer the world so as to make the ritual near ubiqitous and end death?

  Maybe the skeletons are just seeking to capture fertile land so that they can  let their cows graze freely and get as much milk as they need to keep their bones strong.

  Or becoming a skeleton robs you of the ability to feel pain or tiredness so the skeletons have a belief system that fleshy people should be treated like children and cared for until they die and join the skeleton workforce. So the skeleton army is trying to overthrow the feudal system and convert the peasants to their way of life.

  Any other ideas?

      It doesn't, though. 

      Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent greentext, but it doesn't answer OP's question, which is "how can I make skeletons have agency that will make them into a believable villain skeleton army rather than being mindless tools" - the point of that greentext is that the skeletons are mindless tools. 

      If OP is looking more generally for "a campaign idea for my skeleton minis" then it'll do nicely, but that wasn't the thrust of the question.

    Normalized necromancy.

    Corpses can be animated with their former souls. The souls are generally capable of doing whatever they did in their former lives. Everyone has a bunch of skeleton ancestors walking around helping them do stuff. The living only make up a minority of any given population. Zombies aren't used because flesh still rots, and rotting things stink and are gross.

    Some motivations for a potential skeleton army:

    1. A special kind of preservative is used to keep the bones strong and from rotting anymore. The skeleton army is running out of their source of preservative. They are conquering and trying to find additional sources of the preservative.
    2. A tyrant conqueror has figured out he can get a whole population's worth of fighting skeletons by just training everyone for a few years in the military and then letting them go about their lives. But if they ever need to be called up in death to fight, the whole population can be used, instead of just a few trained soldiers.
    3. A courtier gets really good at playing court politics. When he/she is raised as a skeleton, they manage to take over the court. They now have an undead monarch that has to preserve the current level of technology and way of doing things, or risk losing all of its power.
    4. A new religion springs up that believes in giving people a final rest after they have died. They go about destroying all skeletons they can find. People using the skeletons can't let this keep happening. They band together to bring about a massive army to kill off the new religion.
    5. Continuing from the 4th motivation listed above. They kill off the new religion, but don't stop there and start killing off other populations that don't use necromancy.

    How about if wars in this world are kind of like sports are to us, and skeletons are just mindless, disposable troops that nations or cities pit against each other to settle disputes. The winning army getting only marginal benefits and a morale boost for their living populace.

    The general and maybe lieutenants would be the actual stars, there to direct the skeletons tactically and strategically. Well-off people pay to have their dead relative's bones in prominent positions with fancy armor, so they can point it out to their friends on the magic screens.

  I posted the following to the previous Wednesday thread, but I was like two days late to the party, and only got one reply, so if it's alright I'm gonna try my luck again here, when people are still looking.

  My question revolves around the definition of "solveable mysteries". For example, suppose there's a world in which an unknown and half-insane god grants people boons. He doesn't grant them to everyone, but to a select few based on insane, eclectic criteria that may even change over time. It's so nonsensical that it may as well be random, and since the god is unknown, people think that the boons are random.

  My question is this, should the author of this world and the story that takes place in it know the criteria that the god uses? Is it not rational anymore if the author doesn't, and maybe even decides to treat such a thing as random?
  ```

  - u/Killako1:
    ```
    I mean if it’s arbitrary, it’s arbitrary, but this can quickly become “this random god now saves everything”. In order to prevent that, the easiest thing that I think can apply are one of 2 things.

    1. This is what makes your protagonist special. Anthorpic principle. If your protagonist didn’t have it, we would we listening to someone else’s story.

    2. Use it to hinder you character. Not always, not constantly. Maybe once or twice (over a long enough period of time). 

    I think these are the only 2 justifications for this.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Not every mystery needs to be solvable by the reader or characters. Given that, I would argue that the only reason that the author needs to have a solution is that it really helps for the sake of consistency.

    Further, the mystery shouldn't be driving your plot, characters, or reader interest if there is no solution. At most, the mystery should get characters into trouble, but never get them out of it. 

    In the case of boons granted by an erratic god that all the characters in the story don't believe exists ... I sort of question the utility of having a god at all.
    ```

  - u/pixelz:
    ```
    I think you could have a nice conversation about true randomness vs. deterministic but stochastic processes.  There are some relatively simple processes that exhibit stochastic behavior, so it could be possible for the protagonist to discover the underlying rules and gain great power thereby despite the random seeming nature of the outcome.  Some processes have islands of stability where the process seems to be tractable before returning chaos.  Just being able to predict such islands could be quite empowering.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Well, I believe the randomness of the boons may help a story rather hinder it. One of the main goals of a story is to surprise a reader, and boons given out with set rules makes it easy to bfigure out who has a boon and who  doesn't. If anyone can be given a boon, then everyone you can meet on the street can be some one with this boon. It's a chance to have more character variety
    ```
