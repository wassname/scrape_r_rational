## [Q] Anything interesting in a rational(ist) war-on-Hell story?

### Post:

There's a story out on the web called [The Salvation War](http://www.tboverse.us/HPCAFORUM/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=29).  It's anti-rational and frankly terrible, but the idea is really interesting and I wondered if anyone might be interested in reading something similar?

The plot of TSW is that the Christian Hell is real and decides to declare war on reality.  Reality fights back, and it's a complete curbstomp for the entire span of the story.  There are some interesting explorations of "how do you deal with the fact that every time the enemy kills one of your soldiers they get that person's mind and soul for interrogation, and they can torture them for all eternity?  (TSW's answer is "the souls fight back, escape, and start a guerilla movement in Hell.")

The version that I'm thinking of is that *all* of the afterlives are real, and have been at war for millennia. Until now the war has stayed out of reality but it's finally spread to us.  Reality will have to scramble to deal with the fact that gods and demons and asuras and etc are all real and are coming here to put the boot on us.  Human weapons will be effective in some cases but not all, so humanity will have to scramble to come up with better guns, capture enemy weapons, and make allies...as well as putting aside our intra-human squabbles and banding together for survival.

To be clear:  this would be a for-profit venture.  Exact details TBD, but options would include:

* Kickstarter
* Per-chapter Patreon
* Monthly Patreon (which is what I have now)
* Something else?  I'm open to suggestions

I'd write it in installments, give each one to my Patreon patrons and mailing list, then sell it on Amazon under exclusivity.  

If you're interested, great!  That will help me decide whether or not I should write it.  If you'd also be willing to fund it, please mention that and to what extent.

  I ran a Mutants & Masterminds campaign with this as the central premise a few years back. The short pitch was;

  > In 1953, a group of cultists opened a portal to Heaven on the top floor of the Empire State Building. The government seized control of the site afterward, and began the first heavenly expeditions. Heaven was empty; there were no angels to be seen. In 1965, while attempting to attain parity with American angelic technology, the Soviets opened a portal to hell and found it full.

  (*edit: After looking around in my archives a bit, [I found this timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_8Jl1IVj-kObdCAd_CGTYxfddsFusgiQ70aAALsYajY/edit?usp=sharing), and [this campaign bible](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LcIpahJPMl5xKgd3Fz_fghCANHI-e8y8F9FmyWh4Y6g/edit?usp=sharing), just in case anyone has interest in using them for anything.*)

  I've always found the afterlife as a concept to be really interesting. I will say that I would much prefer an afterlife focused on a single religion, and given my familiarity with it, I would prefer that religion to be Christianity.

    Yeah, that's probably the way I should go.  Doing the kitchen sink approach is an interesting thought exercise, but the more I think about the research involved the more I wince.

      Just say that only one religion is true, but most of them have different elements of the truth. Then you can borrow from whichever sources you like.

    Sounds like an interesting read, thanks.

    It's not really where I was going, though.  Banks is saying "what if people were arguing about whether or not to make Hell real?"  I'm saying "Hell is real and trying to kill us."

    Would you find the latter idea interesting?

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    Wow, great post, thank you.

    Upfront I'll say that this whole post (the top level one) is basically market research to see if it's worth it for me to spend time planning the story.  So, everything I'm about to say should be considered alpha-version and likely to change.  As a result, I'm considering it not spoilers.

    My initial thoughts would be:


    * Do you mean they are all fighting each other as well as Earth?

    More or less.  Probably not a fully connected graph, but certainly many different fronts among different pantheons.

    * Are we fighting the "bad" sides of the world's religions, the bad and neutral, or all aspects? How would we stand a chance at all, if so, and if not how close are potential "allies" working with humanity?

    The trite answer would be "everyone we're fighting is the bad guys by definition," but no.  We'd be fighting various factions from various religions.  For example, there might be factions within Christian Hell that are willing to ally with us in order to gain an advantage over over hell-factions.  Valhalla (viking heaven) would certainly be making war on someone.

    * If not active participants in the war, where are the various heavens and positive/passive afterlives in all this? What about pantheons with neutral gods and other supernatural forces that have no afterlife components?

    There would definitely be factions on our side and it seems likely that the majority of those factions would come from the positive side of things.  On the other hand, many gods would just not want to be involved -- the Christian god being a prime example.  He's stood back for several thousand years now, I don't see him wanting to break that streak. (Also, from a Doylist perspective, having an omnipotent being show up on either side makes the story pretty short.)

    *   What about shamanists?

    I've had some interesting ideas about animisim; between them and the idea of totem animals I can think of a lot of cool places to go.

    *   What about reincarnation?

    My current understanding of reincarnation is that you don't remember your prior lives, so you can't pass on intelligence or skills gained in a previous ~~time loop~~ incarnation.  The only difference from a warfighting perspective is that your soul is not available to the enemy for interrogation.


    *   Is Earth simply a battleground or a target? Is attacking a side what determines if they pay attention at all to humanity? Are they actively recruiting living humans?

    I'm waffling on this one.  I've had several backstory concepts including (a) the "gods need prayer" trope that I used in 2YE, and (b) there's an infinite collection of worlds and the ongoing war shifts from one to the next; it just happens to have finally gotten to Earth.

    Some factions probably would reach out to humans, yes.  Most likely the weaker factions who are desperate for allies.


    *    Which aferlives would automatically get the most souls from dead civilians? Soldiers? Which gets the least?
    *   Who gets which souls, the forces that make the kill or the victim's personal fath's?

    I see it as personal faith determining where you go.  Christian devils are going to want to focus on countries with a high Christian population, Hindu asuras will focus on India, etc.  Under this model South America would take a pasting from Lucifer's armies, because there is a high percentage of Christianity and insufficiently large economies to have major militaries. 

    *        If really bad things happen very often (i.e. going to hell) to people based on what they believe, why is anyone religious anymore (or at least that type)?

    One of the first things that governments would start doing once they really understood what was going on would be to tell their citizens "okay, everyone needs to switch to [religion] because they are the ones who are supporting us!"  Which would go down about as well as you'd expect.

    *        If there is a good chance at a "good" afterlife, why would anyone still be an atheist?

    They wouldn't.  I'm already imagining a scene where Richard Dawkins says "okay, fine, [I was wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mmskXXetcg)"...and then goes on to choose a religion based on pragmatic grounds and munchkins his skepticism and rationality in order to extract the most benefit from his new god(s|dess(es)?)?


    *    Other than possible intelligence on Earth resistance, what purpose do souls have?

    My first thought would be that they are either a powersource or can be interrogated and then transformed into soldiers in that faction's army.

    *    Which afterlife would have the strongest human resistance movements (i.e. the strongest souls, the most canon chances to escape, the weakest guards, etc.)?

    I'll get back to you.

    *    Can you tell if someone is going to a hell or a heaven before they die? 

    More or less, yes.  The process is basically "What religion are you?  Okay, we had some experts go through and boil your holy books down into a checklist.  Tick all the relevant boxes, we'll tally them up and tell you your current destination...ooh, not good.  Okay, here's what you need to do to fix it...."

    Of course, the first thing that would happen is that the Pope would start handing out plenary indulgences like candy, and probably speak *ex cathedra* to say that any Catholic who dies on a day ending in a 'Y' receives an implicit indulgence at the moment of death.  And then other religions would start doing the same.


    * Does that mean those who are less likely to go to a hell (righteous or "good" religious people) are moved into sensitive or command positions? Or are heavens a threat as well, and atheists are the only people who run no risk of hitting an afterlife because they simply disappear?

    Some heavens would definitely be a risk.  Valhalla, for one, repurposes the souls of everyone who goes there as soldiers in its army.

      > Some heavens would definitely be a risk. Valhalla, for one, repurposes the souls of everyone who goes there as soldiers in its army.

      To be fair, the only people being re-purposed were non-warriors who still died in battle. People who died outside of battle didn't get to go.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Repurposed in the sense that their allegiance is changed -- instead of fighting for their chosen leader / country / whatever they are now fighting for Odin.

          Ah, I see. But it's necessary, you understand, because there is this spooky enemy out there in a land far away, and they don't look like us.

  I've been rereading Dante's Divine Comedy recently, and I found myself wishing there was something like what you are describing using his hell. It's got everything from little humanoid demons who torture people to giants and monsters of every kind. And various... *unlikely* climates and terrains that should be very munchkinable.  The inhabitants include some definitely-not-real people too, like Mordred and Helen of Troy. If you want to use lots of afterlife worlds then there might have to be some changes (Heresy wouldn't be quite so popular, I imagine, nor would the Noble Pagans sit around in Hell-lite when they had their own paradises to go to). So the short answer is yes, I would love it if someone wrote a rational take on Afterlifes-are-real, and I highly recommend giving Dante a go to see if you want to use anything from his Inferno (Purgatory would also make an interesting place to invade...). Or Milton's Paradise Lost if you want Lucifer to be in charge, though Milton's hell isn't really fleshed out beyond "And then the fallen angels made El Dorado but with lots of added brimstone".

  If you want all the religions to exist, there's going to be the problem of deciding how much you can learn about all of them. There are some really fantastic characters out there, and some really cool worlds.

    > If you want all the religions to exist, there's going to be the problem of deciding how much you can learn about all of them. There are some really fantastic characters out there, and some really cool worlds.

    It's true.  And yes, "all the things!" might be a bad plan here.  Just doing Christianity justice would be challenging enough.

    I suppose one approach would be "yes, they're all real, but most of them are fighting on other levels and haven't made it to Earth yet.

    I've always had a soft spot for the Norse gods; I find them more interesting as characters than the Greek/Roman ones, and much less bogus than Christianity.  This could be the whole Ragnarok / Judgement Day / whatever other cataclysmic end-of-the-world thing other religions have mixed together.

    One thing that would definitely be interesting would be the distinction between Christianity and Judaism.  The Jews seem to see Yahweh as someone who can be bargained with (cf destruction of Sodom) and feel that rules lawyering is okay (cf shabbos goy and the [sale of chametz](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/496883/jewish/Is-it-really-necessary-to-have-leaven-removed-from-ones-property.htm) for Passover.

      If you decide to use Norse stuff, remember we'll never forgive you if you don't include the [midgard serpent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr).

        You know, I just had a vision of Jörmungandr popping out of the ocean next to a fishing boat / battleship / something and saying (in a very British accent, while wearing a monocle) "I say old boy, there's going to be a spot of bother around here soon.  Those thugs over in the Christian Hell have decided to invade, you know.  Probably be here in about a week.  Just thought I'd let you know.  Pip pip!"

        >In [Norse mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology), __Jörmungandr__ ([Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse_language): *Jǫrmungandr*, pronounced [ˈjɔrmuŋɡandr̥], meaning "huge monster" ), often written as __Jormungand__, or __Jörmungand__ and also known as the __Midgard Serpent__ ([Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse_language): *Miðgarðsormr*), or __World Serpent__, is a [sea serpent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_serpent), the middle child of the [giantess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn) [Angrboða](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angrbo%C3%B0a) and [Loki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki). According to the *[Prose Edda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda)*, [Odin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin) took Loki's three children by Angrboða, the wolf [Fenrir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenrir), [Hel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hel_(being\)), and Jörmungandr, and tossed Jörmungandr into the great ocean that encircles [Midgard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midgard).  The serpent grew so large that he was able to surround the [earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and grasp his own tail.  As a result, he received the name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. When he lets go, the world will end.

  I recommend reading [*Bang*](http://www.amazon.com/bang-apocalypse-Mason-Tailsteak-Williams/dp/1453806466) by Tailsteak, the guy who creates the webcomic [*Leftover Soup*](http://leftoversoup.com/) (so you know he's good). It's a very good look at what things would be like if Christianity is right and the implications of everything it entails. It's pretty good at showing how the people in the Christian hell would act even if the story is not totally rationalist. Trevor is definitely a Level 1 character though.

  This pretty much is how it works in Neil gaiman's Sandman.

  No one is fighting per say though.

  But a lot of munchkining is going on.

  Also some interesting psychology.

  I recommend reading that graphic novel if your wanting to go into the business of multi-pantheon clash shenanigans.

  Neil Gaiman is the present master author of that style of story telling.

    I've read Sandman up through The Wake which AFAIK is the end. (At least, if I'm remembering the sequence right. Yes, amazing story, Gaiman is a top-shelf genius.

  I remember being really disappointed that *The Salvation War* wasn't, y'know, good. It's a cool premise.

  I'd join the call to use Christian myths only, and go with something preexisting and reasonably well-defined - Dante is good, as are Medieval-European ideas of witchcraft/vampirism, modern superstition/conspiracy theories (satanic D&D, all that), classic Bible-period Jewish myths ... there's a lot to choose from, actually, so I'd go with whatever you think you could do something really cool with.
