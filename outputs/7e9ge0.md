## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Kazerad isn't worshiped as a god here yet, so I'm obviously not doing my job. For the record, he's the person writing [Prequel Adventure](http://www.prequeladventure.com/2011/03/prequel-begin/), which I would define as "Homestuck except with a good story".

  He's posted quite a few posts on philosophy and epistemology (also writing, game design and gamergate) a few years ago. They're more optimized for the Tumblr community than the rationalist community, but they still felt useful and inspiring to me.

  My favourites:

  * [Depth](http://kazerad.tumblr.com/post/90923468138/depth).

  * [Power](http://kazerad.tumblr.com/post/92214013593/power).

  * [Activism](http://kazerad.tumblr.com/post/86930556353/activism), on the nÂ°1 difference between fiction and reality.

  Even if you already agree with the message, you might find the perspective and the examples useful.

    Man, you *really* should let Prequel end before you make those claims. It's not like Homestuck wasn't great before Act 6.

      I'm not sure I remember where Arc 6 was, but I stand by my point. Early Homestuck was a mix of meta-humor, and Lost-style "Why do all these non-nonsensical things happen? Stay tuned for answers!". I'd say it always was a very good medium, very good narration, and a mediocre story.

      Prequel has fewer branching plot points, a single coherent character arc, and no time-travel, better pacing, etc. Though the beginning is pretty rough.
      ```

        Homestuck definitely took inspiration from Lost, but I'd say the end of Act 5 (Cascade, the green sun, the exiles, the scratch, followed by the reveal of Lord English) cashed in all the dangling plot hooks *at the time* and gave them resolution. It's after that when Hussie starts writing more plot hooks than he can handle, and the end of the story answers nothing.

        Anyway, Prequel is a very different kind of story, less mystery focused and more dramatic. Isn't Katia messing up and crying a running gag?

    TBH I gave up on Prequel after the second drunken sex blackout. Not really my thing.

      I know it's been said before, but I recommend you try sticking with one more chapter (say, until Asotil is introduced, at the end of the countess arc). It gets less silly, less depressing, more hopeful, etc.

  Apparently, most UK water companies [use dowsing as a technique in their work.](https://medium.com/@sallylepage/in-2017-uk-water-companies-still-rely-on-magic-6eb62e036b02). I really don't have much to add to that. Sweet mother of mercy.

  I've been watching the Yale Game Theory course on youtube, recommended to me in a previous thread, and they're quite good.

    ```
    I taught myself the basics of Game Theory online back in high-school through some lecture notes, which I think were posted by Yale but I'm not certain.  I don't think it was this because they weren't videos.

    Fast forward a few years, I got a bachelor's in math without taking any Game Theory courses (since the only one offered was a 300 level Econ course) but am now working in Game Theory in grad school off the back of that knowledge and some additional independent study.  Game Theory is cool, and introduced me to utility functions way back when so I already knew what people were talking about when I discovered this sub.
