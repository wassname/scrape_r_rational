## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I'm working on a plot detail for a DnD campaign I may eventually run someday. Wasn't sure whether to put this here or in the Wednesday thread but whatever.

  You're the immortal God-King of the known world, in a Tolkien-esque fantasy setting. Your main concern at this point is preventing uprisings against you. 

  You have the power to universally make people censored. This means that whenever anyone tries to refer to a censored person using a noun or noun phrase, they feel an overwhelming (DC 25 Charisma save) desire to instead use a pre-determined phrase of your own choosing. 

  To make a person censored, you need to perform a 10 minute long uninterrupted ritual in which the person is present. You can perform the ritual on yourself. To change the phrase associated with that person you must perform the ritual again.

  What do you do with this power?

  (Bonus points, how would you circumvent it?)

    You could use it for emergency unblockable communication.

    Have a prisoner that only you and a certain other official know about. Whenever you need to communicate with your official, set the phrase for the prisoner to whatever information you need to send. That official will check in at scheduled intervals by attempting to say the prisoner's name.

    Repeat as needed with other prisoners and officials. This gives you a very secure communication channel, with no tech needed.
    ```

      ```

      - u/mcherm:
        ```
        Furthermore, for purposes of running a game it has a fabulous feature. If the players somehow happen to learn about this particular prisoner, they now have an undetectable way of spying on this private channel of communication, one which allows the Gamemaster to leak certain sensitive pieces of information when desired but without ever quite giving the players proof of who it is that is sending and receiving the secret messages.
        ```

      - u/Zeikos:
        ```
        Sending, a third level spell, does this in a cleaner way and no likelihood of interception possible.

        I would say that it's worth doing so only if you have to give said information to a lot of people, but the higher the number of people that know the name the higher the likelyhood of it leaking.

          .. Mass broadcast. This is not for secrecy, it is a magical radio tower. The emperors castle has many cats. By convention, these are named "Imperial Cat One", "Imperial Cat two"... ect. 

          And all of them are systematically cursed every couple of days with the latest announcements, proclamations ect. Town criers go through low numbered cats until they hit one curse-named "No further news this week", more and the high numbered cats are used for more specialized information distribution - What the army quarter master will currently pay for grain ect

    For circumvention, turn their name into a verb and then just convert the verb into gerund format? Bill Gates turns into Bill Gatesing, e.g. "We need Bill Gatesing to fund our rebellion", which would be analogous to "We need financing to fund our rebellion." Gerunds can function as nouns, but it's a noun referring to a verb derived from the person's name, rather than a noun for the person directly.

    Use it to horrifically shame corrupt officials - Look, most of the things you could do with this just makes you look like a an evil overlord. 

    Maybe you are, maybe you are not - playing into that image is, regardless, a horrible idea. 

    But honor is important to most cultures in these kinds of settings, so what you do with it is to pile on an extra horrible penalty for crimes where execution is too lenient. 

    So abuse of high office, violating the rules of parley and parole*? or whatever 3 to five crimes you really, really want to deter because they are offenses against the legitimacy of government and/or the civilized conduct of war?  

    They carry a penalty that goes beyond death, because before you get hanged, you get tagged with your crime. So 
    Sam becomes "Sam the oathbreaker" ever after.

    Special agents. You lay the curse on them and they become unmentionable, creating an air of power.

    Also, for shits and giggles, you could put the curse on yourself and force people only to refer to you with a specific term. This would also work well towards world building. The emperor is all reaching and cannot be made fun of using silly nicknames

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    I'm not too familiar with the DnD system, but don't spells get cast when certain words are said? You could censor someone's name to make people have an overwhelming desire to cast a specific spell of your choosing whenever they try to refer to the censored person.

    The next question is: are there suicide spells? For example, a spell that creates a massive explosion that engulfs and kills its caster, or a spell that drains all the life force from its caster? If so, you can commit mass genocide by censoring people that are commonly referred to with phrases that cast suicide spells. Killing everyone guarantees that there won't be any uprisings against you, since there's no one left to revolt.
    ```

    - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
      ```
      While I love the creativity, sadly most DnD spells require specific hand gestures and/or material components, as well as an amount of deliberate preparation at the start of each day to cast.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        Aww... I wanted to create world wide suicide explosions. Guess I'll have to settle for a more mundane way of killing everyone. 

        What are the limits on the pre-determined phrase you choose? Can you choose a ridiculously long phrase that has to be said all at once so people suffocate to death trying to say it in one breath? Can you choose a phrase that requires such a loud volume that people break their vocal cords trying to say it? Can you choose a phrase that requires someone to literally bite their tongue off in order to correctly pronounce? Can you choose a phrase that refers to another censored person, and thus cause any speaker to get trapped in an endless loop of phrase speaking?
        ```

        - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
          ```
          > Can you choose a ridiculously long phrase that has to be said all at once so people suffocate to death trying to say it in one breath?

          The person is compelled to complete the phrase. If they suffocate to death, they cannot complete the phrase, therefore they are allowed to take a breath if needed.

          > Can you choose a phrase that requires such a loud volume that people break their vocal cords trying to say it?

          The person speaks the phrase at the same volume they intended to use to refer to the censored person.

          >  Can you choose a phrase that requires someone to literally bite their tongue off in order to correctly pronounce?

          Hmm, I'm going to say theoretically possible, but tricky to pull off, on account of

           * Needing to speak the phrase as part of the ritual
           * Needing to say *other* things as part of the ritual (requiring a tongue)
           * Needing to genuinely believe that the phrase is a coherent sentence with an actual meaning

          > Can you choose a phrase that refers to another censored person, and thus cause any speaker to get trapped in an endless loop of phrase speaking?

          Just for fun, I'm going to allow this and/or use it as a trap to spring on my PCs.


          Also, if you're taking the goal I set out literally, you could just ignore the censoring altogether, and step down from being God-King. Can't have an uprising against *you* if you're not in charge any more ;)

    > whenever anyone tries to refer to a censored person using a noun or noun phrase

    So triggering the power depends on whether or not you intend to reference a person.

     First of all, congratulations, you have categorically defined all species as 'people' or 'not people' by whether you can refer to a censored of their species. Or, if you haven't, the power is circumvented by considering an entity to not be a person using mind magic or simpler. That is, unless you're using clauses like 'they have to REALLY believe.'

    Second, I'm assuming you can't name a rock after a person and just refer to that rock by name, and attribute to that rock all the actions of the censored person. Also assuming 'referring to someone' includes hand gestures, nonverbal sounds, images, symbolic tokens (I could totally see a rebellion carrying around small tokens to refer to their censored, captured leaders) etc. If not, the power is pretty terrible at achieving its original purpose. 

    Next, if the person can hear and understand what they're saying and don't go into some sort of trance, those assumptions aren't necessary. If they do, a second person and those prior assumptions do become necessary.

    One creative use; you essentially have a permanent, instant, globally accessible computer with a magical/verbal operating system. If a person can perform basic functions in their head such as referring to person X after being instructed to do so by a phrase they were compelled to speak, they can basically access a repository of information of your choosing. If saying another person's name when compelled to do so makes you say another phrase (which it shouldn't, because you're saying a name, not intentionally referring to a person, by your definition), then have the phrases earlier in the directory use the the prior assumptions about what doesn't trigger a phrase. If those assumptions don't work, each directory level will need to have a set number of derivative branches that can assumed present. Then a person will have to try refer to someone with the name of '[their current directory]' plus '[name that always means the first/second/third/etc. derivative pathway from said directory]' which is a bit more complicated. Also, people could say things like '3+4' just fine, but if they refer to a person named '3+4' they would instead say '7'.

    Logistically, you would have to make sure they couldn't accidentally access the webpage at some random point, so you would have to use unique names, which comes with it's own fun challenges. Furthermore, this would take a hell of a lot of time to set up if you went big, but you could always just keep things to daily notices and such. And if you can't teach people to refer to different people through the compelled phrases (AKA if assumptions don't apply), you would have to use the names of a famous hierarchy or something, which would shut down discussion of that hierarchy pretty hard.

    Finally, to use this to your end; you basically control the only globally accessible webpage. IDK, make your name the root directory or something. You basically control Google. You win the game.

    Thanks for the fun idea!

    edit: the best part is that it's one way, so you can dictate to farmers who have no other access to the wider world exactly what to think and they can't discuss or debate you or anything.

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    I could cause everyone to refer to me by a variety of compliments: "The Best Possible Leader", "The One Who Should Be In Charge", "The Perfect General", "The Benevolent One", and so on. This is changed up once a week or so, so that people don't get used to a particular phrase and start associating it with anything unpleasant. It won't *prevent* uprisings, but people always referring to me in terms of glowing praise would eventually start to colour their opinions.

    I refuse to use it as punishment, on the basis that I can only use it on people in front of me; if I did use it as punishment, then a rebel leader who successfully evades my soldiers (probably by successfully preventing me from figuring out who he is and hiding) could use the fact that he doesn't yet have a title to signal his continued defiance and put heart to his rebels.

    I will, however, give mildly pleasant but descriptive titles to everyone who works in my Palace, and hand them out like candy to those subjects who come to speak with me. This way, if there is rebel activity *of any sort* in my Palace, I can refer to "the rebel who did this" (a noun phrase) and intentionally fail my save - I then either know who it is, or know it's not a person who has been Named yet, saving a lot of time in the ensuing investigation.

    I think being able to copy origami is probably OP. I took a [computational origami class](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/spring17/lectures/) in college, and there were a bunch of NP-hardness results. If "copy origami from sight" somehow lets you solve one of those, then you can solve NP-complete problems and then you win everything.

    The thing is that all the results I can find are stuff like "given this crease pattern of a certain form, determine if it can be folded is an NP-hard problem" but with the origami superpower, the person gets to see the finished result... on the other hand if the origami design is made with opaque paper, and you can't see the folds inside it, then maybe you can use that... I'm betting there's something NP-hard here but I'm not sure exactly what it is.

    We might need to formally specify what the origami person can do.
    For example, maybe I give you a folded square and tell you it was folded from a certain crease pattern, and *you have to replicate it from that same crease pattern,* does your power let you do that? If so, you can solve a NP-hard problem. But it sort of feels like cheating; your power might not be that flexible.

    (A bit more mundanely, this power is probably OP because you could become a world-famous origami artist or something.)

      > I took a computational origami class in college

      @of course that's a thing

      > on the other hand if the origami design is made with opaque paper, and you can't see the folds inside it, then maybe you can use that

      I mean, Origami is usually done with opaque paper, so that's good. But I'd imagine that because it would theoretically be possible to have an origami animal be, say, a turtle on one side and a beaver on the other side just by folding the sides differently, that "looking at it" would have to involve picking it up and having a 3D investigation of all angles, but no unfolding?

      Then again, you can get away from that by putting a complicated thing on the "inside" of the origami. But then if you have, say, a standard crane and you somehow fold a little boat into the *inside* of the box in the crane's back that is invisible from the outside, is it reasonable to expect that a power that lets you copy origami by looking at it would also let you somehow know that there's a secret boat folded inside the crane's body so you can copy that too? I'm sure there's origami designs that people have made that have "surprises" of those types in them.

      Also, whatever NP-thing you have to do would have to be physically possible to fold (the old chestnut about not being able to fold paper in half more than 7 times, while not exactly true, is definitely relevant here). 

      Still, it could potentially let you solve the Riemann hypothesis or travelling salesperson problem or something, which is kind of neat and not at all what I expected from origami. So I have still learned something really interesting and greatly appreciate your comment! Thank you.

    > never hitting ads when channel surfing; 

    You can harass TV stations that you don't like by surfing their channels constantly, making it impossible for them to run any ads. 

    > never crushing ladybirds

    What happens if the entire floor is covered with ladybirds? Does your weight just magically reduce so you don't crush them when you step on them? Do you start floating? Is there a magical compulsion on you to not take any steps whatsoever until the ladybirds go away?

    > never burning microwave popcorn

    What exactly happens here? You heat it up but it doesn't burn? Can you make and weaponize ridiculously hot popcorn? Or does the excess heat just magically disappear, effectively destroying energy? 

    > being able to spin a lot before getting dizzy

    Might have potential uses in car racing and dancing. Doesn't seem particularly munchkinable because you're still limited by g forces that would tear your body apart if you spin too fast. Effectively, you can spin longer than other people, but not any faster. 

    > never twisting ankle;

    What happens if someone intentionally grabs your foot and attempts to twist your ankle? Does some magic force keep your foot in place so your ankle doesn't twist? If so, there is probably a way to harness that energy.

    > never breaking fingernails;

    Same as with the ankle.

    > somehow being able to make better coffee than someone else doing the exact same procedure

    Can this "better" be quantified? Does your coffee have more coffee particles in it, meaning you created mass out of nothing? If so, start construction on a gigantic coffee maker and make coffee to generate lots of mass out of nothing.

    > b) if you were to be reincarnated in this world, what power would you ask for that seems similarly tiny and insignificant but will end up with you ruling the world / creating world peace / having a harem of beautiful husbands / whatever else you want?

    Off the top of my head? Never mispronounce anything I try to say.

    At first glance, this just looks like it would make me good at communicating. 

    The catch is I can just start inventing my own languages and words that have to be pronounced in some precise way. Effectively, this grants me the ability to make precisely any sound I want, given some setup time to define the exact pronunciation of a new word. 

    This has various uses. I can impersonate other people's voices. I can use it in combat, creating deafening sounds like a flashbang, or creating sounds that sound like voices coming from other directions, distracting my enemies and hiding my true location. I can use it for mass destruction by causing [resonance disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_resonance#Resonance_disaster). 

    This power isn't really strong enough to rule the world though, so if I was given such a chance I would probably take a year just thinking things through before deciding on what power I want.
    ```

    - u/causalchain:
      ```
      I like how you've approached this, but I feel like these powers would go down the path of least resistance. Most these powers are better explain by restrictions or compulsions than the ability to mould the universe. 

      >never burning microwave popcorn

      Most probably, if you intentionally tried, your body would just quit you, or you'd be strongly compelled not to take actions that you know (or don't know) will cause you to burn popcorn.  
      If they are able to act on unknown knowledge, then perhaps it could be used as a communication device, or to compel the person into achieving normally implausible feats (if you don't do XYZ I will put this popcorn in the microwave for *two whole minutes,* and it will be *all your fault*)

      >somehow being able to make better coffee than someone else doing the exact same procedure

      A coffee tasting good is dependant on the drinker, so this ability appear to affect the drinker into considering the coffee tastier than they otherwise would have.  


      >What happens if the entire floor is covered with ladybirds?

      I  imagine that the ladybugs would randomly move away from the spot the magic user was trying to step at  


      I really like the pronunciation munchkin, I think that's totally a reasonable conclusion

    Using the ladybug power to achieve world domination here is relatively simple by munchkin standards so I'm disappointed it hasn't been mentioned yet: If the ladybug power doesn't rely on some sort of telekinesis (which makes sense since otherwise the person would describe their power much differently) it's going to involve controlling probability or controlling your behavior based on information not available to you.         
    So depending on which way the power works it could be exploited in one of two ways:

    * If it manipulates probability then you could build a machine hooked up to an algorithm, that would force you to step on a given area and put ladybugs there if a given desired result didn't occur. So provided you machine was decently well constructed you could use this as a powerful probability pump steering world affairs and stock market trends according to your whims.          
    Very quickly you could become the richest person alive by far due to your ability to substantially outcompete the market, and by using the probability pump on government policies and elections you could effectively control world affairs without anyone even knowing it.

    * If the power subtley manipulates your movements based on hidden knowledge then provided it goes with the path of least resistance when it comes to movement it could be exploited one of two ways. Firstly you could just hook up a machine very similar to the previous one with an algorithm controlling what would end up being the path of least resistance with regard to the power altering your movements.             
    Secondly however you might be able to wield insane power by relying on some form of strong precommitment to make you step on ladybugs unless your body moved in such a way as to transmit certain information which could be confirmed within a few years. So then given the previous exploit still works here you could use your insane wealth to have your own researchers who would confirm and work on the information you received from the power. So while it would be obviously suicidal to try to get it to give you the source code for a FAI, you could still get it to give you enough tech that you end up being decades ahead of the rest of the world in this technology and can afford to take your time working on it until you can develop a FAI with your utility function.

    for (a) I think armor with a layer of ladybirds would protect against most kinetic damage.  to limit thermal damage, add a layer of microwave popcorn.  (this might require a two person suit, but should protect against most conventional weapons, even nuclear weapons depending on whether irradiated popcorn counts as 'burnt').

    for (b) I'd ask for "a smile you just can't say no to" and then smilingly ask for the world.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      I don't think the telekinesis interpretation seems plausible here just because it would mean the power wouldn't be described as never stepping on ladybugs, but instead that stepping on ladybugs always somehow left them totally unharmed.
      ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    (a) I don't know how to munchkin them. But I can see how to create them.

    - Never hitting ads - Find and predict the model for how long ad breaks are. Develop a good internal clock.
    - Never crushing ladybugs - Coat your shoes in a pheromone that smells like something that eats ladybugs.
    - Never burning popcorn - Practice twisting the dial on the microwave the perfect amount
    - Spinning a lot before getting dizzy - Reduce your sensitivity to dizziness (genetic tampering may be required)
    - Untwistable ankle - Very flexible ankle ligaments allow your ankle a stupendous range of motion without being twisted
    - Better coffee using the same procedure - Be extremely good looking and rely on the Halo effect
    - Never breaking fingernails - Genetic engineering again. But also be careful.
    - Copying origami on sight - Okay, this one's hard, but it's a lot easier when you consider that this guy can simply create any origami shape that looks sufficiently similar to the provided example.

    (b) Some form of probability control or short-term prescience might be good. Being able to correctly predict winning lottery scratch tickets on sight (before scratching them) would at least give me a steady source of income.

  So there's a short story I read a while ago and I'm interested to see how the setting could be munchkined.

  * The protagonist discovers that every excuse he's ever given involving a living entity causes the living entity to come to life in a separate realm. (e.g. saying "My uncle broke his leg and I had to visit him in the hospital" creates a new uncle with a broken leg.)
  * He can enter the realm by sticking his hand in a hole in his backyard and turning a gumball machine handle in said hole. (It's basically symbolic of his first lie.)
  * The realm is a blank space with furniture as required for injured entities, although if he forms an intention to find someone he can.
  * The entities' disposition towards him depends on how he described them, and they are aware he created them. (For example, as a kid he lied about losing money he spent on gumballs because an older kid beat him up, so the kid kicks him in the leg and steals his wallet, while his created family members are still friendly towards him.)
  * He eventually discovers that at least one of his coworkers' lies also come to life in the realm.
  * He can bring someone with him into the realm if they're holding hands.
  * He can't bring anything out of the realm that he didn't bring in, but whenever he leaves he'll find a gumball or similarly sized toy in his hand to prove it happened.
  ```

  - u/pixelz:
    ```
    I assume he can bring out new information that he's learned in the realm.  So he could have a stock broker uncle "who always knows just what stocks to buy, everytime we have lunch I make thousands of dollars."  Or a braniac aunt "with 20 PhDs, one evening she told me how to build a better battery that can store 10 times more than the best you can buy now."  Or a gossipy cousin that "knows everybody's secrets." 

    It's basically a wishing machine for knowledge, so you could ask for a friend who knows how to build a safe seed AI and bring about techno-utopia.

    >The entities' disposition towards him depends on how he described them, and they are aware he created them. (For example, as a kid he lied about losing money he spent on gumballs because an older kid beat him up, so the kid kicks him in the leg and steals his wallet, while his created family members are still friendly towards him.)

    Given the created entities can physically interact with him if he were a rationalist he could take over the world with this power in either a day or a few minutes depending on interpretation. Basically it never says the excuses have to make sense or anything so you could find some context to use "it's not my fault it's the fault of a maximally powerful and intelligent FAI whose utility function is to satisfy my current utility function" then immediately run to go to your backyard while the other party stands there confused.          

    So then when you open the way to this special realm either you get a godlike being which nearly instantly reshapes the universe according to your utility function, by reshaping your body so you have a godlike being with a copy of its mind attached to you that can escape back to reality when you leave.             

    Or alternatively if it can only alter your body in ways compatible with the physics of the outside world (or at least only those changes will carry over) then it would just reshape your body your body into a vast thing made of nanites which would begin spreading everywhere as soon as you reentered reality.        
    In this latter scenario if negative mass is possible then it could potentially spread across all of existence making it pretty close to godlike power, but even if it can't get FTL it can still pretty easily generate arbitrarily much energy/matter letting you perfectly reshape your future light cone.
