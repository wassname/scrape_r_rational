  Oh shit, I remember reading this a while back. It’s amazing that this actually got so popular that it’s getting an audiobook.

  I remembered reading that Xvim was described as a bald man? Or was I just stupid?

    ```
    I'm not sure if I read that but I definitely imagined him as bald.

    I searched throught the epub, and nope, no bald Xvim anywhere, only Alanic.
