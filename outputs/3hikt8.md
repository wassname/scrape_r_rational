  Really great chapter, and it's awesome how often you've been updating!

    Thanks!

    Writing rationally is exhausting compared to writing non-rationally.  I've written 20k+ words in a single day on non-rational original work.

    That being said, things really bogged down for me after Albert appeared.  The original intent was that Albert would never take a direct hand.  Then I realized one day that a potato cannon would, in fact, be possible without metal.  I also realized that moderately effective close-range rockets would be possible without metal.  Various nasty explosive devices made of glass would also be highly effective in a world without metal armor.  Even some crude chemical weapons could be formulated.  That allowed me to create a rational insertion point for Albert, and dramatically changed the evolution of late Act II and Early Act III.

    While there is no more or less physical fighting in this version as opposed to the original ideas, there is a lot more conflict.

    I hope to finish things up for this book within three chapters.  Perhaps two.  Maybe four.

      I'm glad you took this route; it's been a great read.

  Another great chapter. I wonder what Riko's trying to do by taunting Marko. Perhaps he's trying to make Marko miss the idea for controlling Brad?

  > The possibility of having to remain conscious through major surgery wasnâ€™t something I wanted to consider.

  Is this talking about when Allen first got back to the camp?

    ```
    Allen's concerns about major surgery aren't based on any known needs, he's just glad that opium can still knock him out, in case he needs surgery in the future.

    If the war goes forward and he ends up fighting in advanced scouting parties, he may well be injured seriously enough to need surgery.

  I was wondering how you get to there being no metals on the planet, as 

  a) metallurgical silicon would probably work for most things,

  b) if you have any orthoclase ic minerals, then using charcoal you would be able to relitively easily produce aluminium.  Any world without orthoclastic minerals seems unlikely.  You also have brick houses, thus clay and aluminium. 

  C) even without clay and aluminium you still have Flint tools, these can make really high quality knives, and there are Aztec swords made out of them. Flint can be scary sharp. 

  D) there is obviously sodium in relitive abundance in this world. Which while difficult to use is a reasonable metal to use for some things if no other solution were available.

      What I am saying is I can build a radio transmitter/reciever out of attested resources with relative ease.
