  I really enjoyed the characterization of the genie and Twilight in this, and while it is a one-scene one-shot fic, it's a lot better written than simple talking heads fic.

  The story is told from the genie's POV, and the dramatic reading linked at the bottom of the description is great quality for amateur voice actor/audio editor.

  As a side note, it's perfectly readable if you're not familiar with the series.

  The link description is a bit misleading. It's more about the fact that [wishes are dangerous](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/).
  ```

  - u/Prezombie:
    ```
    Any well-read person knows that wishes are dangerous.

    The problem lies in that people who *know* wishes are dangerous *think* that knowing that immunizes them from the danger.

    [ending spoiler](#s "I really enjoy how the subtext is conveyed in the last bit, and she didn't opt out of the optimized wish because she knew it would go bad, but because she was able to accept that she wasn't completely sure it would go right.")
