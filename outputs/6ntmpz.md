## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I find it really annoying how the end of almost every video has a reminder to "like, subscribe, comment, and share". However, the reason so many people pursue this strategy is that it works, right? It kicks at least *some* people out of their passive reception mode and into an action mode where they're more inclined to do something instead of clicking on the next link that seems interesting.

  Yet most people also think that it's annoying, and reddit has (non-policed) rules prohibiting asking for upvotes, presumably because it increases the noise and would result in almost every post on the frontpage saying "please upvote".

  I'm wondering whether this is a problem with a solution, or just a problem that has many different solutions that all have their own trade-offs wrt user engagement and annoyance.

    As I understand it, likes and subscriptions are a lot of how youtubers make money. So they each want to maximize those likes and subscriptions, while beggingless videos would be more pleasant for all.

    Could you model it as a kind of prisoner's dilemma, where the defect option is begging for likes?
    ```

    - u/Solonarv:
      ```
      YouTubers' income is based almost entirely on views (or watch-minutes; the difference isn't really relevant here). Subscriptions help because subscribers see new uploads on their YT homepage, leading to extra views; likes help because YouTube's search ranking takes into account engagement, i.e. likes, comments etc -- even dislikes help.

    Well, the problem is that the behaviour analysis technology is not good enough yet to reliably tell if someone liked a video without them interacting directly via buttons etc. As long as youtube can't instantly know if you liked something and want to see more of it, you'll have to be reminded to say whether you liked it or not.
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Even if websites knew that you liked something without you having to say something, the problem would remain, because I doubt sharing and subscribing will ever be automatic (or rather, that automatic sharing and subscribing will ever be accepted). And though there's probably a technological solution with sufficiently advanced technology, the idea of a bot writing comments for me seems both pointless and frightening.
      ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      I think you misunderstand youtube's goals and how its algorithms work. First off likes don't actually affect how much a video is recommended unless you have a youtube ratings preview plugin the only thing likes do is put the video in your liked videos and let you see like to dislike ratio after you've already clicked on it.               
      Secondly youtube doesn't care directly about how much you like what you watch it just has an algorithm that shows you videos based on what it predicts will end up getting you to maximize watch time. As a result it is somewhat less likely to recommend shorter videos regardless of how much you might like them because it's goal is watch time and that's it.

  So over the weekend, I had a funny thought: the Mirror of Erised is a torture device, isn't it?
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    The fact that you can hide things in it even in canon suggests other uses. On the surface, it is definitely a torture device, but it's also a vault of sorts that it is extremely difficult or impossible for dark wizards to break working alone.

      > The fact that you can hide things in it even in canon suggests other uses. On the surface, it is definitely a torture device,

      Wait.  So Dumbledore definitely, actually emotionally tortured himself a few times in order to hide the Stone.  We know what he saw in there: his dead sister and his family, alive and unbroken by his mistakes.

      *Wow.*

        I just try to tell myself the lie he told harry: woolen socks
        ```

    - u/NotACauldronAgent:
      ```
      It also may be a memory retrieval device. Harry saw his grandparents in the mirror despite not knowing what they looked liked, so it's either able to help retrieve memories, create people who look like his grandparents or how he thinks they should look, or found that knowledge somewhere else.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Wait.  Holy shit.  That's... wow.  That's either an excellent piece of work at magically-automated design, or *insanely* broken.  I'm inclined to believe the former, since the images of Harry's parents couldn't speak or sign anything in specific.
        ```

        - u/NotACauldronAgent:
          ```
          Yep. I think it took Milo (HP and the Nat20)all of 30 seconds to wonder if he could use magic to make his heart's desire path to Godhood in 3 easy steps. It's probably only a HPMoR sorting hat in that it takes information you technically have and reflects and adds on to it, but JK is really bad at explaining her powers(see: Arithmancy, Felix Felicis).
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            I mean, admittedly, that's Milo.  The Mirror really did torture him: it showed him how bored and miserable he'd be as an actual, perfect munchkin.

            >It's probably only a HPMoR sorting hat in that it takes information you technically have and reflects and adds on to it,

            I mean, the basic question is how thoroughly Harry *had* learned or formed memories of his parents' faces as of age literally one year old.  If he *hadn't*, then the damn thing is either pulling the information from Dumbledore, or it's a clairvoyant.  If it's a clairvoyant, then *yikes*, fuck Milo's godhood, I'm going to be studying in front of that mirror with *extreme* care.
            ```

            - u/NotACauldronAgent:
              ```
              It could also still be extrapolation. He know what his father looks like-everyone says they look identical and so forth- and his mother-the repressed "take harry and run" scenes awakened by the dementors prove it. He also knows basic inheritance biology-his paternal grandparents aught to look like his father, maternal like his mother, and for all we know, as we never* see them again, the mirror could be making up something that looks like what Harry thinks his grandparents should look like. But still, very powerful. 

              *I think? IDK, I don't remember them, but I easily could have missed it. Did his picture album contain those pictures?

                I know he blacked out and saw *something* in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, but was that it?

                >But still, very powerful.

                Eh, provided it's guessing rather than pulling from backwards in time, not *that* powerful.  The *holyfuck*-level power shows up if it can pull from forwards or sideways in time.

                >Did his picture album contain those pictures?

                Actually, yes, they did.

              The point of a perfect Munchkin is the *journey*.  One he/she actually attains Godhood, they're supposed to reroll and start again.  Letting him languish in the endzone is like preventing a meeseeks from self-destructing.

      I think it only gained the ability to store items after dumbledore altered it so that functionality was likely not part of its original design.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:

        Could he have done that? I can't think of any other cases where people significantly altered the functionality of Ancient Artefacts whose production methods had been lost.

        - u/None:
          ```
          In canon, Dumbledore hid the Sorcerer's Stone inside the Mirror, as one of those "pure of heart"-type Tests of Character.  Oh, and as a way to torture those weren't worthy.  Like himself.

          Wow.  Dude was messed up.

          Anyway, you're thinking of HPMoR.
          ```

          - u/Frommerman:
            ```
            I don't think so. Powerful magical artifacts include:

            * The Philosopher's Stone, which was created over 900 years ago and can only be created by one person. Nobody ever changed how it worked except by destroying it.

            * The Sword of Griffindor. Its functionality did change, but only as a result of the enchantments on it functioning as intended. The Goblins might know how to make more, but we never hear of a weapon with similar properties.

            * The Elder Wand. It was never changed, it only passed hands as it gained new masters.

            * The Resurrection Stone. Voldemort didn't know what it was, but it's implied you can make a horcrux out of anything. He certainly added enchantments to it, but it continued to function exactly the same *even after being sliced in twain by the Basilisk venom infused Sword of Griffindor.*

            * The Diadem of Ravenclaw. Nobody ever tries to wear it on screen, so we don't know if it was changed. Then it got eaten by Fiendfyre.

            * The Goblet of Fire. We don't know exactly what it is for or what it would have done if Harry had refused to participate in the Tournament, but everyone just agrees that the consequences would be bad. A powerful Confundus was apparently sufficient to make it allow a fourth school. Which either implies that I was wrong or that the goblet is in some sense sapient, and therefore susceptible to spells that directly attack sapience. Inconclusive.

            * The Cloak of Invisibility. It never changes and it resists practically every spell cast upon it. Moody's eye can see through it, but that isn't a spell being cast on the Cloak as much as it is an artifact apparently designed to do just that. We can know, to a certain degree, that the eye is an artifact because it was apparently easy to remove and operated independently of anyone wearing it.

            * Moody's Eye. A bit player that never changes. Apparently, putting it in a telescope allows someone to use it without installing it in their face, but that doesn't appear to be a magical alteration.

            * The Sorting Hat. Apparently taken off Griffindor's head and then never altered. It is as much a part of Hogwarts as anything else, so its capability to give people Griffindor's Sword when they really need it isn't too surprising.

            * Hogwarts. Its wards are so ancient and powerful that nobody has ever been able to travel quickly into the grounds via any means. Voldemort managed to get in multiple times, but that just implies that the wards don't have an evil detector, or that such things just don't exist.

            I don't think we ever see someone directly change or corrupt what one of these artifacts does. Some were made into Horcruxes, with deleterious effects on those who attempted to use them afterwards, but that appears to be a function of being a Horcrux. They still seemed to work exactly the same.
            ```

              ```
              Minor question-was the stone cut in half? The ring was, but I don't think the stone was. IIRC, the horocrux was the ring, if TMR knew what the stone was he probably would have used it.

    ```
    It wouldn't be a very reliable torture device since not everyone is going to see something that just rubs in the shittiness of their current life (lost loved ones and the like).        
    Remember Ron just saw himself as the quidditch captain because he's not tremendously ambitious and hadn't yet experienced major loss.

    - u/None:

      It's not that your life has to be shitty.  It's that there simply has to be something you want enough for a reminder of its lack to hurt.  If you dangle an image in front of me showing me getting tenure and being acclaimed for revolutionizing the field, it's going to hurt, simply for the regret of lost time.

      Show me "the deepest, most desperate desire of [my] heart", and that's a massive fucking gutpunch.  As in, loss of composure and collapse into tears for several actual minutes.

      Mind, I'm on this sub.  After those several, I'm going to figure out that what comes out can only conserve what went in -- that the Mirror is pulling things out of me rather than showing me anything with its own objective existence, possibly modulo what someone else put in.  And that's when the revenge starts.
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        I meant shitty in comparison to the life portrayed in the mirror. My point still stands that not all things it shows people are necessarily going to make it work as a torture device. Some people would probably even be comforted by seeing dead loved ones (like people sometimes say they are when they hallucinate dead loved one's) though I can't understand how.                
        Similarly many people like myself could see anything they desperately wish for and it's not going to make us devalue our current life because we already thought about those things a great deal. For instance I would most certainly see some post singularity utopia server living in which would be staggeringly fun, but the fantasticness of the whole thing makes it less likely to devalue my own life since I'm not going to think anything I could have done would have ensured I would be there instead of here.

        Also given the existence of vastly more effective methods of torture it being made for that purpose seems unlikely. It seems rather more probable and thematically appropriate that its origin is probably more of a downer. With some desperate mage creating it hoping to see their dead family again and becoming obsessed with the facsimile that the mirror displays (like many later mages said to have become obsessed with the mirror) or something else similarly depressing.
        ```

          That sounds like an *inadvertently*-made torture device.  The problem here may lie in the word "desperate".  If it can just show you things you very much want, but which don't induce any form of desperation or longing, you're fine.
          ```

            If inadvertent torture devices count then a hell of a lot of things count. Also Dumbledore says _most_ desperate desire which implies it doesn't need to be particularly desperate (such as how it's said a totally content person sees the mirror working like a normal mirror), also cannon examples demonstrate that what counts as most desperate may not be that desperate, but it's unclear exactly how heart's desire works. So going by what people see in canon (such as Ron) it's effects are not necessarily desperation inducing.

    This is fairly frequently mentioned in my experience. I've heard exactly these comments a bunch of times, despite not being in the ML field. Why does this surprise you?

    That said, one wonders if some of these comparisons are unfair. It's true we don't observe these weird behaviours against adversarial examples in humans... except of course those edge-cases when we do. Can we really be sure there wouldn't be similar error cases had we an equally observable brain state? This is especially true given the sensory input we receive is so much higher bandwidth than these small images.
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      It isn't exactly hard to come up with cases where the human brain fails at tasks it is ordinarily very good at.

      Déjà vu (failure of familiarity), optical illusions (failure of visual processing), attention blindness (failure of change detection), [doorway forgetfulness](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2011.571267) (failure of retention), etc.

      Those are just cognitive failures, not failures of rationality, and occur even in healthy brains. If we want to get into failures of rationality, well... the list is pretty extensive.

      The great thing about the shortcomings of machine learning is that we know what they are, which means we can use them appropriately. Working around the shortcomings of human cognition is a lot harder; it relies on the thing that's experiencing the problem also coming up with the solution.

      > Why does this surprise you?

      I've seen a lot of deep learning papers hyping themselves up, and a whole lot of people claiming (quite wrongly, IMNSHO) that deep learning will lead to AGI.

      >It's true we don't observe these weird behaviours against adversarial examples in humans... except of course those edge-cases when we do.

      We *really* need to differentiate between "This design takes one tradeoff versus the other to get around No Free Lunch" and "This design leaves 'money on the table' by sacrificing accuracy on one dataset in exchange for no equivalent increase in accuracy on any other dataset."

      >Can we really be sure there wouldn't be similar error cases had we an equally observable brain state?

      Phrased another way: can we prove a smoothness condition on human categorical assignments with respect to the space of sensory signals?
      ```
