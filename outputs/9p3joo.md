## [Biweekly Challenge] Afterlife

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9l5e02/biweekly_challenge_alternate_history/) the prompt was "Alternate History". Our winner is /u/ZhuanXia, with their story, ["The State Pension"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9l5e02/biweekly_challenge_alternate_history/e78fa4g/). Congratulations to /u/ZhuanXia!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **Afterlife**. We're going *really* permissive here, so if you want to write about an algorithmic reconstruction of a person's consciousness on the basis of their online history and biometrics, or a company that offers cryonics services, or destructive brainscanning, you can do that instead of a more traditionally religious angle (literally existent or just discussed). You might also choose to take the prompt metaphorically, if you'd like. As always, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, October 31st.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided. (This mostly applies to calling for outside parties to vote.)

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, they're [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Spooky**. We did "Rational Horror" three years ago, so you can do something in that vein if you'd like, but ideally it should give a case of the spooks, whether or not it's actually "horror" per se.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 10/31**. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or chit-chat [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9p3k7i/challenge_companion_afterlife/?).

  NOTES:  This is not intended as an official submission, as it is merely a rewrite of portions of Alexander Wales’ “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Zombie.”

  As a heavily derivative fork of a fanfiction of a fanfiction, I’m not sure it passes the plagiarism test, but I happened to revisit this short story recently and felt like sharing some thoughts.

  Anyone who hasn’t should read Alexander’s work first: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023949/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Zombie](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023949/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Zombie).  It branches from Hermione’s death, where she has become a ghost.   My slight rewrite of the final conversation with Quirrell occurs just in the last few pages, but might act as a launching off point for further AU exploration, as Alexander’s work was fascinating and much too short.

  Cheers!
