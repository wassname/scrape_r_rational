## [RT] "Lest Darkness Fall" - 20th century man fighting against the fall of rome

### Post:

Lest Darkness Fall is the story of an archaeologist and latin scholar who finds himself in the 500s AD, with Rome in decline and barbarians at the gates. He makes it his personal mission to preserve learning, civilization, and scientific reason through any means necessary.

Most notably, the author doesn't give the protagonist any unrealistic advantages. The hero has to learn the vulgar latin of the times, and has no knowledge beyond that of an educated man of his era. Many of his experiments fail.

To give you a taste, he gets his first break by approaching a moneylender, challenging his best scribes to a complicated division problem, and offering to sell the secrets of double-column accounting.

I personally don't have a great love for 19th century classics, but this is one of the very few that I truly enjoyed.

If you have any recommendations for other such stories, let them fly!

    [Re: Ending Spoilers](#s "I might not be recalling it fully, but I don't remember him being emperor, unless there's a sequel I missed. I didn't see him being *particularly* savvy, though I laughed at his political campaign. 'Vote for this guy! Strong military! Lower taxes! Better Public Works!' ") I suppose things sort of start going his way by the end of the book and he ends up a little sue-ish; that's fair. To give a brutally honest review: the story itself isn't a great page-turner - it's a decent concept with good execution at the start, with a mediocre end that ties up the loose ends and gives the story a satisfactory conclusion but not much else. It is the best "rational" take on modern-man-in-ancient-times I've seen, I'm quite glad I read it, and if that's what you're looking for, I think you (the prospective reader who visits /r/rational) will enjoy it too.

      There's no actual sequel, although there is a unofficial 'sequel' of sorts written by S.M. Stirling:

        Now that you mention it, I believe I have heard of that.

  This is my favorite book.  It's available online for free, though i would encourage you to buy it since it's so cheap:  [kindle edition (6$)](http://www.amazon.com/Lest-Darkness-Fall-Related-Stories-ebook/dp/B004Q9U4S4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1434384709&sr=1-1&keywords=lest+darkness+fall)  [print edition (4$)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0671877364/ref=tmm_mmp_used_olp_sr?ie=UTF8&condition=used&sr=1-4&qid=1434384709)

    Why would you want people to buy it?  My usual reason for paying for a free thing is to support the creation of similar things, but the author's been dead for 15 years already, and I suspect that the publishers (etc) aren't getting much of a cut from it either.

      The money goes to the author's family, I presume.  It would be better to donate to charity, I admit, but I didn't think of doing that.  Also some people might prefer to read it in print or have the official ebook rather than read it on scribd.

  I just read through the whole book and I must say that while it shows lots of promise, stays interesting enough throughout and made me smile often enough it is pretty lacking in any kind of emotion or really human seeming interaction with the environment. To be honest I would say that after [](#s "Martin saves king Thiudahad") it all reads a bit like less than awesome SI fanfiction of the "problem-fixing" kind.

  I liked it and would like to read something similar. Can anyone recommend alternate histories/time travel books with a similar vibe? 
  Thanks!
