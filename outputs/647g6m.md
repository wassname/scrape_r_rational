## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are given a cardboard box and told that one week from now, the box and all of its contents will be transported 500 years into the past.

  **RULES:**

  * The box is a cardboard cube, roughly half a meter on each side.

  * The box is moved in time, but not moved much in space. The time travel mechanism has a minimal level of intelligence, so everything is relative to Earth, and it will try to put the box somewhere where it will fit and can be supported. If the box's exact location would put it inside a solid object, it materializes somewhere nearby.

  * The box can only appear where no one is looking.

  * As such, you can choose where the box appears, but only if you can travel there (or have the box transported there) in the present. It would be advisable, therefore, to keep the weight to something you can lift.

  * You can put anything into the box which you can get access to within the time limit.

  * The box needs to be able to closed in order to go back in time. If you dump a huge stack of books into the box such that the lid cannot close, nothing happens at the end of the week.

  What do you put in the box, and where do you put it, to have the greatest positive impact on the course of history?

    Hmmmm.

    ...brief research leads me to a mathematician called Luca Pacioli, who died in 1517 (probably around June). I therefore propose to find out where he lived, and arrange for the box to appear in his attic or otherwise among his possessions, presumably after his death. I plan to insert into it a number of manuscripts detailing mathematical discoveries that were, in our timeline, not made for some years after his death - ideally, largely opening up new fields but leaving obvious and interesting questions unanswered as a goad to future research, but realistically probably a few dozen sixteenth- and seventeenth-century papers in their entirety. (And maybe a couple of more modern ones, too).

    Luca gets a lot of questions asked, especially about how he got his printing so neat and regular, but it's posthumous and so no-one can answer them. The advances in mathematics push through a general advance in science and technology to the present day. That... should be good, right?

    Volume of the box is .125 m^3, volume of a person in liters is approx. equal to weight in kg...my immediate response is to recruit a thin contortionist (59 kg -> 59 liters -> .059 m^3) , and spend the week planning around having a person with present-day knowledge appear five hundred years in the past. Fill in the extra space in the box with whatever supplies they will require (good first steps are things like a phone with a copy of wikipedia and a solar charger).

        That's a fair point. More than fair, actually. Sending a Typhoid Mary is colloquially known as "not helping".

    What model of time travel are we using? (Does the timeline diverge at the target time, or are we doing Novikov consistency?) Consider not doing anything in order to, you know, not kill everyone who currently exists. On the other hand, considering the state of FAI theory here might lie a way to get humanity to exist in a millenium.

      ```
      The genie who gave you the box tells you somewhat cryptically that everyone in your timeline "will be fine, or better than fine if you play your cards right" but won't get much more specific. You manage to gather that the scheme involves divergent timelines, with some kind of merging or bleed-through that will allow you to reap the benefits of the improved timeline, but won't harm the divergent natives.

  You have a handheld scanner that will give you an intuitive understanding of the utility function of any agent you point it at. You don't get their knowledge or skills, so it's somewhat crude for predicting behavior, but you can know which world-states they'd prefer over which other world-states. How do you use this to your advantage?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    This identifies spies.

    With a bit of programming, this can implant intuitive knowledge of a lot of things and memorization of then some.

    It may be worth finding out how it determines what the utility function of simple agents is. (A program that prints "Yay!" to the console when the webcam sees red?)
    ```

    - u/Nulono:
      ```
      Identifying spies could be tricky once instrumental goals come into play. If someone's been bribed, for instance, you could tell if that person would accept a bribe, but not whether a bribe has actually been offered.

- u/lsparrish:
  ```
  You have the ability to memorize long strings of text (plus images/illustrations) at a glance, and play them back to yourself at high speed, which is similar to skimming in that you can pick out relevant concepts as you find them. You can also study them with an effort level similar to if you read them manually but without the inconvenience of having to turn the pages or have the book physically present.

  You can thus basically load books into your mental 'inventory', without necessarily understanding their contents. You can do this with as many books as you want, but they won't be useful in terms of skills and knowledge until you actually spend time 'reading' their contents and forming relevant mental associations.

  Even if you haven't read the book properly, there are things you can do which are based on imagination plus what you can do with a real book. You can alter a copy of the memorized book by adding highlighting, creating alphabetized indexes, visualizing animated illustrations, and so on. This doesn't harm the original memorized copy, so you can still refer back to it as needed. You can look things up by page number, and you can also do text searches.

    Memorize log tables, have access to a easy-to-use mental sliderule.

    Memorize foreign language dictionaries, gain ability to stumble through any translation.

    Memorize maps, streets and/or topography, and never have to physically reference them again.

    Draw anything you've seen before from memory as easily as you might copy a reference photograph.

    Make a little diary entry every hour on the hour, have a time-stamped memory of every event in your life. Attach photos to important people and places.

  Not *exactly* a munchkinry problem, but I figured this was the most appropriate place to put this:

  You have a randomly-generated sequence of 8 bits, and you are allowed to flip one of the bits before sending the sequence to a friend. You want to somehow use this to send him a number between 1 and 8 inclusive, but here's the catch: your friend does not know what the original sequence was. (If he *did*, all you would have to do is flip the bit whose index corresponds to the number you wanted to send, making the problem trivial.) The *only* information he will have available is the sequence you send him; he does not know which bit you flipped, or even whether you chose to flip a bit at all.

  You can confer with your friend beforehand, but afterward, you are not allowed to communicate with him at all, apart from sending him the modified (or unmodified) bit sequence. Given these constraints, is it possible for you to communicate the number to him? If not, is there at least some way for him to guess the number with greater than 1/8 (12.5%) accuracy?
  ```

  - u/jaspercb:
    ```
    100% strategy (I think) using only 7 bits:

    Number the bits being sent from 0 to 7. Ignore bit 7, leaving us with 7 bits. Encode the number you with to transmit in the parity of the following bit sets:  {1, 2, 3, 6}, {0, 1, 5, 6}, {3, 4, 5, 6}. [1,0,0]=>1, [1,0,1]=>5, and so on. [0,0,0] maps to 8, because we don't ever want to output 0. Take your random number, run it through the above encoding, and xor it with the target number. to figure out which sets you need to change the parity of. Then just find the bit that appears only in those sets and change it. So if we have 7 [1,1,1] and want 5 [1,0,1], flip the bit that only appears in set #2, which is bit number 3.

    On the other end, your friend just takes the 7 bits you sent him and converts it to a number between 1 and 8, as described above.
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      I see. So with the bit sets:

          A := {1, 2, 3, 6}
          B := {0, 1, 5, 6}
          C := {3, 4, 5, 6}

      Your flip table is:

          A => 2
          B => 0
          C => 4
          AB => 1
          AC => 3
          BC => 5
          ABC => 6

      Very neat solution. Although you could come up with a set that's easier to memorise:

          A := {0, 3, 4, 6}
          B := {1, 3, 5, 6}
          C := {2, 4, 5, 6}

      Which gives the table:

          A => 0
          B => 1
          C => 2
          AB => 3
          AC => 4
          BC => 5
          ABC => 6
      ```
