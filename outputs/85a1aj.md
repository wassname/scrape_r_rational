  I'm loving it. I really like how Goku was super impressed with a cloud that could discern morality.

  It would be awesome if later he decides that even if the cloud is imbued with knowledge of the objective morality of the universe, that doesn't necessarily mean anything about *human* morality.

    The _reason_ one writes rational fic is to point out how seemingly commonplace fiction tropes stand in _extremely stark_ relief given just basic knowledge of philosophy and science.

  I literally know the bare minimum about Dragon Ball Z, and yet I still love this story. 
  I especially like how you're managing to portray all the main characters as unique in their own way. I've seen too many 'rational' stories decide that all their characters have to act exactly the same way because they seem to think intelligence correlates with one, and only one, personality type. 
  This story is delightful. I especially like the part where Turtle just straight up told the Old Guy not to play; games are always rigged :)

    Haha, thanks XD. I guess you risk losing a couple of jokes here and there if you don't know Dragon Ball, but shouldn't be anything game-breaking.

    As a personal advice however I'd suggest you try reading the original Dragon Ball manga. Even if you don't like the epic planet-shattering throwdowns of what we know as Dragon Ball Z (the manga is all a single thing, that's an anime denomination), early Dragon Ball is just a delight. The art and composing are amazing and the story is a fun and lighthearted adventure that slowly grows into a darker battle manga. But until aliens and stuff are introduced it stays a rather down-to-Earth story, more of a homage to Hong Kong kung-fu movies than a sci-fi epic, and the conflicts feel more grounded with more realistic stakes because Goku is *not* the strongest around yet. Battles are decided by tricks and small details, not by who has the newest transformation or screams the loudest.

  >If it was for her, i would have die twice, today. She deserves nothing!

  Youre god damned right turtle! I like how Goku just asked bear to stop by pointing out his lack of sentient kill/eating. And then still beat him up. amazin

  The second chapter is even more amazing than the first, I was laughing all the way through, thank you!

  Also possible typo:
  "Turtle said he'd come back with his and bring us a gift."
  It's not Clear his what

    Ouch. "His master". Thought I had fixed that! Thanks!

  I was delighted by this little bonmot: (emphasis added) “On second thought, realised Bulma, a big tree trunk crashed right in the middle of the **road** as if to purposefully stop any vehicles passing by should have rung all sort of alarms in her head. She realised she really ought to do some work on her **street** smarts.” 

  That being said I have to wonder: there’re a few things that make me think you’re a non-native speaker. Word choice (“Lineaments” in particular is a word I’d rarely use in English, but would think of much more readily in my native tongue), turns of phrase (“Lunchtime had come, and passed” instead of “Lunchtime had come and gone”), and the way you insist on *yadda yadda.” said X*, employing the full stop in direct speech even though so [many](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/punctuation/punctuation-in-direct-speech) [style](http://www.grammaring.com/punctuation-in-direct-speech) [guides](http://writingwithaesop.blogspot.de/2011/01/punctuation-quoted-speech.html) handle it differently I’m fairly sure it’s an actual rule.

    I'm non-native :D. Italian. And this is one of my first experiences writing in English for narrative purposes, so yeah. I guess I'll check those style guides, thanks!
    ```

    - u/Laborbuch:
      ```
      No worries, was just curious.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Nah, it's useful :). I had been wondering myself because it didn't feel quite right, but was not sure where to check.
        ```

- u/everything-narrative:
  ```
  Gosh, I read DB when I was like, 12. This is the rational fic we all deserve.

  (Also, could Goku perhaps hit his head twice and become twice as smart?)
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Hmm, there's gotta be limits to the Zenkai power though :D.
    ```

    - u/1337_w0n:
      ```
      Well that is certainly what you would expect from both a narrative and physics standpoint, what zenkai accomplishes in the original story seems to be inconsistent with that.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Well, not really, it's very powerful and very convenient, true, but it *does* hit a cap during the Namek arc in the end, and is basically never heard of any more for pureblood Saiyans. Though basically it is used to explain how Cell managed to come back as Perfect after his explosion (but in that case he experienced an extreme degree of regeneration that no Saiyan could).
        ```

- u/Sonderjye:
  ```
  I dig it.

  I'm not sure about Bulma's trick though. Sure by the rules she would get the ball but she lied when she was explaining the rules(told him that he would get what he wanted during the game) so since Roshi isn't like magically bound he could just refuse.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Ah, well, of course, but it's not like he cares that much about the Dragon Ball. He's a pervert, but having agreed to the deal, I think it's fair for him to just acknowledge defeat.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      Will he really give up a chance to see a woman's panties though?

      I'd say that just booking a crew of strip dancers to give him a private show on his island should make a deal.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        I mean... yeah, I considered it as an option, but I found it a bit iffy to have Bulma be so squeamish about herself, and then basically pimp out other women. She's not the most morally solid character, and it's not like any of that would be technically illegal or unethical as long as the women are paid and consenting (and Roshi keeps his hands to himself), but I guess I imagined her more as wanting to give Roshi a lesson by leaving him with nothing at all. Ultimately, I may have let the Rule of Fun take the precedence there.
