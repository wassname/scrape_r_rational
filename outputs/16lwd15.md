  So, I have a kind of weird request this week. I'm looking for stories in which the protagonist is transported from a mundane setting (usually present-day Earth) to a fantastical setting, but decides to continue working in their preexisting mundane field of expertise. To give some examples, [Sanitize](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/chapters/49228244) and the [-D chapters of The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/2017/08/20/1-00-d/) both focus on doctors transported to a fantasy world. [Castle Kingside](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43462/castle-kingside-rewrite) started similarly from what I recall, but started to slide into more standard kingdom building, rather than the narrower focus that I'm looking for. [Pound the Table](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pound-the-table-an-x-men-self-insert.951637/) focuses on a law student who sets up her own practice in Earth-616 of Marvel comics.

  Those are the most clear-cut examples I can think of, but there are other stories with elements that are similar. *Beware of Chicken*'s wasn't a farmer in his prior life, but still takes up farming in a Xianxia setting. I remember reading a story with a similar setup, but set in Westeros from ASoIaF. There was a subplot towards the end of *Harry Potter and the Natural 20* where a group of police officers started investigating the magical world which scratched the same itch for me, as did *Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach*.

    *Ascendance of a Bookworm* has a librarian sent to fantasy medieval times and all she wants to do is read so she invents the printing press

    *Handyman Saitou in Another World* is pretty self explanatory. he joins an adventuring party but he's just a handyman. he opens locks and stuff

    *Parallel World Pharmacy* has a medical researcher become a magic doctor

    Maybe not exactly what you're after but *Saving 80,000 Gold in Another World for My Retirement* has MC mostly just run a shop that sells earth goods in fantasy world

    I've only seen the anime for theses, but i think they all began as light novels

    Don't know why I didn't remember this earlier, but [Beware of Chicken](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken) fits. The MC isekais into a sect in a Xianxia setting, and immediately decides to nope right the fuck out and go start a farm instead. He has experience farming in his previous life.

    Mostly slice of life and comedy, though nobody told that to his rooster. The first twoish volumes were taken offline to satisfy to Amazon's KU requirements, though I bet you can still find the unedited chapters using the internet archive.

  There's a fanfiction I enjoy called [Gamer in the South Blue](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/a-gamer-in-south-blue.19722/), and one of the best parts about it is that it explores parts of the setting that aren't prominent in the canon material. To quote the author:

  > You know so many authors choose to only play with the 'chess pieces' that are so prominent to the board.  They heavily involve themselves with the main cast because they don't see other avenues to shake up.

  > I don't want to play with the 'main pieces'. I want to use the pieces way off to the side that no one is even paying attention to.

  Does anyone else have fanfiction like this, that explores the dim corners and background characters of their setting, that they could recommend?

  I'm trying to get into Jackal Among Snakes after seeing it recommended here a few (two?) weeks ago but after 30 chapters I'm ready to throw in the towel. Does the dialogue ever improve? I aimed to at least read 10% of it before I drew any conclusions but after yet another chapter where the protagonist is treated as a tactical genius for maneuvers that would be considered blindingly obvious to anyone who had completed the first tutorial mission in any Total War game I don't know if even pushing that far is worth it. Does this continue though the next ~400? [If so...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay9ZxsulN2c&t=6s)

    I read quite a bit of it but don't remember almost any plot or character elements, just a vague dissatisfaction at the whole thing, which is indictment enough. It's not quite at the level of being bad I think, it would have made a deeper impression if it was. The story is just solidly mediocre, not worth one's time if it doesn't gel with your tastes.

    ```
    Read up to 115. I don't recall in general if people become less fawning over the protagonist, but I can say for sure one of the companions exists just to think about and talk to the protagonist to such a degree that I stopped reading. The story was unique in that there were multiple options for companion characters who I thought would be genuinely very interesting choices, but it went with an empty husk of a character and undermined the whole thing for me.

    Do you have any preferences for subgenres? Do you want classics or more recent stuff? Action-y, cerebral, cosmic horror? 

    Maybe it would help if you gave the name of a book(s) you really like as a jumping off point.
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      Sure. Here are someexamples of authors I've really enjoyed in the past:

      Brandon Sanderson  
      Terry Pratchett  
      Ian M. Banks   
      Orson Scott Card  
      Andy weir  
      Most of Heinlein    
      Most of John Scalzi  
      Naomi Novik  
      And some of Poul Anderson
      ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        For Heinlein, I would recommend checking out Alexei Panshin's [Rite of Passage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_Passage_(novel\)) (1968), which was Panshin's response to Heinlein's "juveniles" of the 1950s, but with more sex and moral conundrums. I remember liking it, although I am not sure how well it holds up today. At the very least it won the 1969 Nebula and was nominated for the 1968 Hugo, so it's an interesting snapshot of genre history.

        The [Jupiter series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jupiter_novels) (1996-1999) was an explicit attempt to recreate Heinlein's juveniles based on 1990s science, but note that it was written by different authors and featured different characters, so it's more hit-and-miss.

        Re: Poul Anderson, have you read his [Brain Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Wave) (1953-1954)? It's pretty close to the core topics of his sub: intelligence, uplift, etc. The writing is not quite as polished as in some of his later works, but it's a classic of its subgenre.

        Spyder Robinson's book *Variable Star* is based on a story outline that Heinlein never used for a book, and it's very similar to Heinlein's style in general. 

        Ted Chiang's short story collections are very good. He has two called *Exhalation* and *Stories of Your Life and Others*. 

        I'd say some Chinese science fiction short story collections are good as well. *Invisible Planets* and *Broken Stars*, along with some of Liu Cixin's stuff like *To Hold up the Sky.* Liu is the author of the well-known *Three-Body Problem*, which I think has issues, but I'd say many of his short stories are better.

        Weirdly hard to find, but Fred Saberhagen's novels are good - both the Berserker series (scifi) and the Book of Swords (fantasy). Libraries tend to have one or the other. 

        Other library staples:

        * Isaac Asimov
        * Larry Niven (check out his Dream Park series if you can find it - scifi larping)
        * Dan Simmons, particularly the Hyperion Cantos
        * David Eddings (all his series are the same thing though, just read The Redemption of Athalus and you've read most of them)
        * Margaret Weis (dragonlance, obvs, but also the Death's Gate cycle)
        * Anne McCaffrey (more dragons with Pern)

  I'd like to give [Elydes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/67742/elydes/chapter/1195353/prologue) by Drewells a recommendation. It's basically a reincarnation isekai progression fantasy set in magical Hawaii, around the time the islands start getting exploited by an outside power. (It's not *literally* Hawaii, the Archipelago is in its own original world.) The conflict between the archipelago's native population and the far more powerful colonizers is a great premise for adding tension to the story, and it's written well.

    Counter rec. 


    - 250k words later the protagonist is still 8~ years old. That's right, hundreds of thousands of words of a grown man ~~pretending to be a child~~. 

    - It's one of those transmigration isekais where the protagonist being an adult from a modern world in a kid's body doesn't actually matter *at all*. Prepare to be astounded as a man of average intelligence becomes a genius solely by virtue of vastly lowered expectations! Holy shit that ~~grown man~~child knows ~~basic arithmetic~~ magic!!11! 

    Sidenote: I realize it's practically a trope of the genre so it's not just this author's fault, but it's still so weird how people don't seem to understand what makes a child prodigy a child prodigy, what it is that's special about them, how they actually exceed the baseline. Hint: There have been many great child chess players, but no great child novelist. Great musicians, but not orators. Great mathematicians or physicists, but not philosophers or theologians or politicians or salesmen or CEO... The answer is obvious if you think about it:  Most child prodigies are the result of a coincidence of aptitude and highly intensive, specialized training. This can give a child a head start, but it's not a substitute for empirical knowledge and experience, and in most fields the discrepancy from baseline rapidly diminishes. In litrpg terms, child prodigies can have high INT and/or DEX, but rarely if ever have they had high CHA or WIS, not outside of the Bible/Bhagavad Gita/other holy books anyway. 

    RANT OVER

    - Why make it a transmigration at all in that case? This used to puzzle me, but now I think I get it: it's laziness. Much easier to write that a giant bird is as big as 747 than to have to think of an apt in-universe analogy.

    - The writer seems to think it's plausible for an <8 year old to not just act like an adult, but to be treated like one by the world around them, with no eyebrows raised. Try to rip the kid off, patronize him or something! Don't just take his word that he's the equivelant of a chemist and let him make you $50k worth of aspirin and advil in his bedroom in 3 days without sleeping(btw, who the hell would buy  aspirin made by even the most competent 8 year old in the world!!). Or failing that, at the very least lampshade it a bit! [Sheeeeeeeeeeeit*](https://imgur.com/UB7iVWn). 

    - Is there a plot? Who is the antagonist? What does the protagonist want or need that he doesn't have? The answer: none, nope, nothing, and nada, respectively. I know watching number go up(and color change) is fascinating, but really, people should have a higher bar for their fiction.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      I'd argue that you can have child prodigies with a CHA focus (but I agree with you on WIS). 

      Social skills are a trainable skill like anything else, and there are real life examples of children "geniuses" or generally who are above the curve when it comes to manipulation. There are plenty of manipulative children that consciously or unconsciously manipulate other children and adults. 

      A classic example would be a Tom-Sawyer type who gets another kid to paint the fence for him, but there are other archetypes too, like the kid who knows they're cute and can get away with anything using big enough doe-eyes aimed at parents.


      Also, are there really any INT child prodigies? You cite mathematicians or physicists, but while there are definitely children that are really good at mental math or other tricks and absorb knowledge at a speed exceeding their peers I'd be skeptical to really call these skills an extension or indicator of "intelligence". 

      Maybe its just that CHA, INT, WIS buckets are just to generic for a discussion like this though...
      ```

      - u/suddenly_lurkers:
        ```
        There is that story of Gauss independently figuring out the formula for summing an arithmetic sequence in elementary school. Stuff like that would probably qualify as INT.

        For CHA, the classic example would be someone like Stephen of Cloyes, a 12 year old who led the Children's Crusade. He probably could have used a bit more WIS though...
        ```

      - u/grekhaus:
        ```
        Surely the prototype for 'CHA prodigy' would be 'child actor'?
        ```

      - u/lillarty:
        ```
        >I'd be skeptical to really call these skills an extension or indicator of "intelligence"

        In the real world "intelligence" is a whole bag of worms that's very difficult to pin down, but since we're already using D&D abstractions, here's 5e's definition of INT: 

        >Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.  


        Ability to reason encroaches a bit on territory traditionally reserved for WIS, but children could certainly exhibit those qualities.
        ```

    - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
      ```
      Sheesh, it's like we barely read the same story.

      The MC has never been an adult; he was a sick teenager when he died. He has zero experience in being an adult.

      There is, in fact, an antagonist; it's just not a villain. The antagonistic force in the story is the disruption caused by the colonizers from the Merian Republic. It has caused such conflicts in the MC's life as:

      * The Republic selling heritage sites to be exploited for cheap stone, much to the horror of the MC and his historian father
      * The main character's village being forcefully split apart and relocated to other villages in less-desirable locations
      * The new village the MC was relocated to running out of food due to the abrupt addition of hundreds of new villagers to the old ones
      * Said starvation and other limited-resource problems causing friction between the original inhabitants and the relocated ones
      * The MC's mixed-blood heritage focusing some of the hatred towards the Republic onto him and his own family (ie racism)
      * An overarching plot involving a faction that wants to fully integrate into the Republic to raise quality of life, versus other factions that want to preserve cultural traditions

      There's lots of conflict going on that the MC has had to navigate; there's just not a single villain they can go punch to solve their problem. The conflict is born from a clash of cultures and a severe power imbalance.

      The MC is not treated as an adult. When he goes to sell his potions, salves, and whatnot, he ends up lying that he's selling on behalf of an older apothecary. Because otherwise, people wouldn't give him the time of day! When he meets some real Merchants, the reason they were willing to buy his stock at all was that they had appraisal skills that would let them confirm the quality of his goods, and that what he was selling was legitimate.

      What does the protagonist want? He wants his family to be safe and healthy. He wants to control his future without being at the whims of powers beyond his control. He wants travel the world! He constantly takes steps to reach these goals, whether it be by securing an apprenticeship for his sister, making money with his alchemy to give to his mom, or by training his skills and learning from his teachers.
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        I'll second this opinion, it's a life journey sort of story rather than having any central plot. That said, I don't think it's amazing, just good enough to hold my attention. The conflicts you raise do exist and I'm pleasantly surprised at a litrpg looking into issues like those, however they're not executed very well. The dialogue is stilted at times and genuinely cringy at others. The author tries to build up this sense of oppression and otherness that the protagonist feels from his upbringing, but mostly fails imo. Things are told, not shown. Still, I think it's interesting enough that I'll keep following.
        ```
