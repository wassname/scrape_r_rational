## Worth th Candle. Amaryllis and the Call of Gold

### Post:

In the latest chapters, the Call of Gold seems concerned that Amaryllis will take gold from Juniper. Since Amaryllis gets half his skill everything, she is a gold mage and a rival then.

How does she control the call? Does having multiple competing Gold Mages lends credence to the hypothesis that each Call of Gold is a different instance of the same creature?

### Comments:

  ```
  Amaryllis might have skill in Gold Magic, but she hasn't cast the spell that bonds her to a repository of gold and makes her a Gold Mage. She doesn't have the Call until she does that.

    honestly this is a valuable hack.  he will likely retain his skill level even after the pact is broken, allowing others to take advantage of it with a new pact.
    ```

      ```
      i don't think so.  When Juniper has broken the pact, it seems likely it will be broken for everyone else.  If for no other reason than if I was a DM, that's what I'd do.

        the pact is only with juniper.  they aren't currently benefiting from the pact, so they wouldn't be impacted by it ended for juniper. they would start their own independent pact.

  I wanna know more about the Call of the Gold. What's their deal? Why do they love gold so much?

        Huh. I was expecting [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYI09PMNazw)

  What I want to know is why gold magic isn't leveling up. It feels like in the beginning leveling up skills and getting perks was super important and recently the only time it was mentioned was when he did the soul magic cannibalization thing for the fight against Onion.

  Why aren't we getting gold magic perks?

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Gold magic did level up. My read was that compared to the raw power of 1e8 $ the skill didn't matter too much.
    ```

  - u/Excessive_Etcetra:
    ```
    It relies on *POI* I think, no points in any social attributes means that gold magic is capped at a very low level.
    ```

- u/RedSheepCole:
  ```
  Gold magic makes a mess of Synergy no matter how you interpret it.  A reasonable reading, IMO, would be to give Amaryllis some fraction of his skill without the drawback of having to separately propitiate the bugbear, and I've said as much before.  She didn't have to meditate or get hit with the stick at Sound and Stillness, she didn't undergo the training or initiation process for any other kind of magic except blood, so she should be a damn gold mage already.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The ritual to become a Gold Mage involves marking some gold as your own, you can't do the ritual to become a Gold Mage without doing so, so it isn't quite the same as meeting some other unlock condition. Since your strength as a Gold Mage is proportional to how much gold you have, you can effectively treat Mary as having half of Joon's (fairly low) level divided in half, then multiplied by the amount of gold she's marked as her own, i.e. none.

    > We performed the ritual with five pounds of gold, with a street value of about ten thousand obols. It was only a small fraction of what we had available, but part of the point was to test it and see what kinds of demands would be levied against me in the first few minutes. - [Gilding the Lily](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle/chapter/537828/gilding-the-lily)
