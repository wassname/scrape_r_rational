## [META] Are the (Low Quality) tags too harsh?

### Post:

Due to recent feedback, I've come to the conclusion that there are people who believe the (Low Quality) tags negatively affect their enjoyment of certain stories.

I've [set up a poll here](http://www.strawpoll.me/18934461). You can choose between three options: keeping the (Low Quality) tags I sometimes attach to linked titles, entirely removing them, or replacing them with something less harsh. If you choose the third option, please suggest what that replacement might be in the comments.

Edit: link activity halted for now. Currently evaluating the feasibility of entirely changing the system based on Eliezer’s ideas.

  Hi, /u/Lightwavers!  Thank you for having put in the work on that bot, by the way!  I hadn't even been aware of your recent bot changes at the time I wrote my own recent post.  That said, yeah, putting a \[Low Quality\] tag on Metaworld Chronicles does seem to me like pushing it from two directions - the first direction being that an automated bot posting things at high volume takes on aspects of requiring community approval and not just a personal opinion, and the other direction being that it does seem like a bit of a slap for somebody to see that autoreply after posting a glowing review of Metaworld Chronicles.

  Like the trueborn nerd I am, I have a thought about a technical solution to this political problem.  It would require added work on your part and you should feel free to say in reply something like "You'd have to pay me $500 to do that".

  My thought is to allocate wiki pages, on the reddit wiki or on some other wiki, to each new story that comes up for recommendation.  The top of the wiki page links directly to the story.  The bot links to the wiki page, *without* any annotations shown inside the Reddit comment itself.  People are free to post their own negative or positive reviews on the wiki page, but without the connotation of any of them replying to each other, and with etiquette saying that you are forbidden to suggest that other people shouldn't or won't enjoy something aside from you talking about your own experiences.  All reviews on a wiki page must be signed by a /u reddit username.

  It would also be nice to have something that automatically aggregated and posted all the story reviews, by a particular poster, to their own wiki page, and that replaced their signature inside the Wiki article with a link to that page.

    From a reader perspective, I see this as a reasonable compromise, especially regarding tags other than \[Low Quality\].  I highly value getting a rough overview of other readers' feelings regarding a work, as well as anything in the author's Weltanschauung that I might want to take into account either before deciding if their work is worth my time, or during my enjoyment of said work.  I am most jealous with my free time, after all.

    Though of course tastes vary drastically, it seems patently absurd to me that anyone in this particular community \*wouldn't\* want any meta-information with which to update their probabilities on something that they'd likely be spending many hours consuming, even filtered as they are through the poor metaphors for reality that we mere humans can contribute.

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    You’re correct that putting in work to come to that particular solution would be something I’m not particularly keen on doing, since I’ve spent the time on a system right now. The poll seems to be heading in the direction of removing the (Low Quality) tags entirely, so how about I do that and then replace the tags with links to the story’s wiki, if applicable?

    Also, what’s your opinion on the (Author Politics) tags, which link to a specific Reddit discussion, including links/evidence to support that the author or work portrays certain political ideas in a certain way? So far that’s just been to stories written by Neo-Nazis and ones which display bigotry toward trans people.
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      Linking both the story and a wiki page seems no worse, nay better, than just linking the wiki page.

      "Author Politics" seems to be moving in a potentially dangerous direction, considering the larger context of our increasing civilizational insanity, and also seems to have its useful functionality replaced by offering links to wiki pages.

      \>  You’re correct that putting in work to come to that particular solution would be something I’m not particularly keen on doing, since I’ve spent the time on a system right now.

        Alright, I'll probably do it, but I don't have a lot of spare time right now. I've halted the normal bot activity since you seem to disapprove of it in its current state.

        What do you think about waiting for me to complete it first, so you can judge its quality?

          Also, as soon as tags like "low quality" are shut off, I think the bot just posting direct story links is better than the bot being turned off entirely.

            I believe /u/lightwavers took your earlier responses not as hypothetical "I get that this might not be something you would do for free" but actual offers of payment to do the proposed things. If that was your intention, that's the "what" he is suggesting; that he completes it first, you judge the quality, then decide to pay him after. 

            If you brought up payment as a rhetorical point, that should probably be clarified.

                Fair enough. Though regarding the tulpa stuff, I have no personal experience beyond having lurked on their subreddit once or twice, but I thought it seemed like a plausible way to train drugless hallucination and extreme compartmentalization. Or is Lightwavers one of those who think tulpas deserve actual rights as sentient beings?

                  That user is wrong. I believe they have some sort of beef with me. The 'tulpa' thing is just training your inner voice to speak with a certain personality.

                This is what your argument seems to amount to. If that is all, then that is fair. Arguing the point will not get either of us anywhere, as you seem to hold bad faith toward me because of my ... writing style?

                > a quick perusal of their commenting history indicates that they sincerely believe that "tulpas" are actually real,

                Point of order: that is not a 'quick perusal.' You have just lied. My last post in the community that shows support for the phenomena is several pages down. Next, I do not believe there is anything mystal about tulpas. They are simply a name for a mental process that you might call an imaginary friend. Many people have an inner dialogue, and with proper practice you can impart a personality, for lack of a better description, onto that inner dialogue. The community has been partially coopted by people who genuinely believe there is something mystical about all this, but the truth is simply that brains are extraordinarily malleable.

                Being someone who tries to follow the evidence where is leads, despite my extreme skepticism in the phenomena, I found enough people who genuinely believed there is something to it to try it myself. I have succeeded.

                    >But you have mystical ideas about how the brain operates in order for tulpas to be a thing.

                    No. I do not. Many, *many* people have an inner voice that does not just disagree with them, but *violently* does so. It's more common in depressed people, and *multiple* voices are *much more* common in people who are schizophrenic, or might become schizophrenic given the wrong triggers. Manipulating your inner voice to give it a different personality than "you, but nasty," is an extremely valuable technique. Once done, it's common to call that altered inner voice a tulpa.

            I'm going to disagree sharply here. I think that *any* bot that adds tags that refer to the politics of the author (as opposed to the politics of the story) is a significant potential problem, regardless of the person controlling it.

                Apparently a lot happened while I was asleep. And people are forming strong opinions and arguing them forcefully.

                I think that a bot that only posts links is a good thing. And a bot that appends these links with author-politics-based tags is a bad thing. I *don't* think it matters who runs the bot, as long as the bot is run in a sensible manner (one sensible way in which to run the bot is to have no tags; this is not the only sensible way in which to run the bot).

                So, in the specific case of the tagless bot, I don't particularly mind who runs it; as long as it remains tagless.

    (Message also sent to this subreddit’s modmail.)

    The bot now points toward the wiki for each title it links. Since anyone can modify the wiki, I've held off on working on an auto-populate function, as any user can simply click the creation link and add their content. That functionality can be added if requested.

    Bot test results shown here: https://redd.it/dwpnwa

    As per the about page, found at https://redd.it/dw7lux, I can give users administrator positions, which means they can use the !Add function if they notice a title going unlinked. The !Add function is fragile and must be used exactly as shown, so keep that in mind if you have any usernames that I should give administrator access.

    ```
    Elsewhere I suggested some kind of rating system instead of these tags, but I like this suggestion much better. Reviews work much better than ratings, while not carrying a (possibly undeserved) connotation of authority.

    This should also be relatively easy to implement I think. You only need to update the links in the bot, the wiki itself can be community-maintained.

  If your intent behind this is to prevent people from spending time on frustratingly bad reads, I understand where you're coming from. The same happened numerous times to me, and my response was to try some more and (if nothing changes) drop the series. No harm, no foul. Everyone has their own pet peeves. 

  In this, I do not trust your judgment. This is fiction, and such a low resolution judgment as the one you espouse needs to align extremely well with viewers' criteria (and the weights thereof) to be valuable and not harmful. 

  How highly selective the "review" process is, combined with the inherent persistence of the bot effectively results in dubiously sourced low resolution judgment seem like gospel whenever a fiction is submitted. The fact that (at my time off writing) the removal option is winning in your optional poll to address your non-optional (as it operates) bot seems to show that this is not a minority opinion. 

  Finally, and I didn't even know about you doing this, you tag stories based on how you feel about the author as a person based on ideology? In addition to the above problems applying to this, there is at least the obvious problem:

  If I could not separate the author and the art, I would not have read OSC or any of HP Lovecraft. People are certainly free to do otherwise, but your low-resolution, highly selective, and in this case extremely subjective author-tagging is more harmful than it is helpful. (what do you think of as an appropriate bad ideology tag? Sure you may have some easy targets like Nazis whom we've societally agreed are bad, which makes this implementation easier to justify for you, but is that where the ideology tags stop, and are you sufficiently confident in your evaluation to tag all authors with something so widely considered to be abhorrent?)

  Given the voting at my time of worrying, the majority seems to want this system gone. I too voted that way; though I cannot help but note that this is not the actual point.

  Anyway, I hope you don't misunderstand me: I can actually see where you are coming from, so consider these two suggestions:

  1) Make it a browser plugin instead of a reddit bot. You can solve many of the above problems, insofar as you believe they are problems. In addition, the private nature of the plugin would help ease the feeling that an extremely opinionated and equally persistent bot is holding this community's common hobby hostage. 

  2) Create a more nuanced review system and deploy it on an external site that your bot can then link to. Like topwebfiction, but in the form of more in depth reviews. A useful function to help authors grow could be to focus on recency (as well as review "upvotes" like many platforms do) to encourage development. That may have other drawbacks, but it's up to you. 

  In summary: I sympathize with what I think to be your initial motivation. However, your idea's current application seems at least to be polarizing and mostly disliked (according to current votes). I believe there are ways that you can achieve what I presume to be your core goals in better ways. Also, please don't make a reddit bot where you tell everyone your judgment of an author's character in a fiction subreddit. I'm sure that egregious and easy examples can be given to justify that course, but 1) the execution is tyrannical 2) you do not have the right to deny redemption and trap people in categories you deem to be evil. I am unconvinced by your neutral stance in this. 

  In short, there are better ways to do what you say you want to do. As it stands, the bot is at best useless, and at worst harmful.

    > Finally, and I didn't even know about you doing this, you tag stories based on how you feel about the author as a person based on ideology? 

    The tag simply says (Author Politics) and it is only applied when the author or the work in question promotes bigotry toward a certain subset of people or is an actual Neo-Nazi.

    >Make it a browser plugin

    Thank you, I’ll look into this.

    >Create a more nuanced review system

    It does indeed have drawbacks. There are an astonishing number of works which are ... not good. And yet they have 4 to 5 stars for their reviews. I’d have to come up with a system which dissuades upvoting based on enjoyment and instead persuades users to vote based on quality, which is *not easy*.

    >and mostly disliked (according to current votes)

    Indeed. It seems that I will be repealing that functionality.

    >I am unconvinced by your neutral stance in this.

    I am not neutral. I have never professed neutrality. In any conflict where there is oppressor and oppressed, taking the neutral stance means you implicitly side with the oppressor.

      I really mean it when I say I sympathize with where you are coming from on the story front. As I said, I had similar experiences of my own and most of those stories were very well-liked by a large number of people.

      Perhaps you could consider specifying the axes of ratings/tags that people can use. I'm sure this has occurred to you. However, (beyond the obvious like "Grammar", which is mentioned often) a way to ease the burden on you in this regard could be to make a poll like this on the bases of judgment here, the community (that I think) you have built a service for. The low bandwidth nature of both the bot and communication here seems to be hobbling that. I would love to see your work blossom; and I mean it. Solving the core problem behind the idea (which is non-trivial) would be of great value.

      On the topic of tagging author politics, I believe this is not the right place for the discussion to go where it currently is. The medium itself is difficult. We are speaking past one another, on different levels of generality, and that is not an accusation on you. With that in mind, I won't.

    Some people do not wish to read works by actual Nazis. Others want only to read works that show the author had a minimum grasp of language.

      Or people can just separate the artist from the art? Not to mention that the definition of "actual nazis" is stretching pretty thin in this day and age. If you want to put up what would essentially be trigger warnings for racist or sexual content in-story, then that's one thing, but throwing in a "author has committed wrongthink" gives me a massive eyeroll. What would be the point of putting a politics tag on Ender's Game when the story is entirely divorced from OSC's views, objectionable as they may be?

        Not everyone wants to do this. If you’re comfortable with doing so, then that’s well and good. Ignore the tag. Other people may feel betrayed that no one mentioned the art they enjoyed was made by a Nazi.

        >If you want to put up what would essentially be trigger warnings for racist or sexual content in-story

        The only political tags link to transphobia and Nazism. I don’t think Orson Scott Card is a Nazi, and he hasn’t let his homophobia seep into his work, but if someone asked me to add a politics tag to his titles I would do so.

If If I hadn't made a habit of not lying to myself I might consider my final decision a compromise, or even a victory.

                      [](/twibeam) Oh, please do! We can both benefit from a thorough discussion of flaws in a presented chain of reasoning.

                      [](/sp)

                      [](/psychiatwi) Okay! Let's start off with a few simple, straightforward points. I put it to you that the following statements are all false:

                      - Everyone, when presented with the same evidence as I have seen, will inevitably come to the same conclusion if they take the time to properly consider the evidence. This is well known.
                      - People will always understand precisely what I mean when I make any statement.
                      - It does no harm to divide people into Them and Us.
                      - There exist people in the world who are Evil. While redemption is possible, it is rare to the point of being vanishingly nonexistent.
                      - It does no harm to exclude people labelled as Evil; in fact, by removing a corrupting influence, this does a lot of good.

                      Any of the statements in the above list, taken as true, would represent a different potential flaw. Are there any of the above statements in which you *cannot* see the flaw? (I ask this mainly so as to avoid spending a lot of words going over something that you are already aware of).

                      Alternatively, are there any of the above statements where you cannot see what the statement has to do with your bot's tagging?

                        I don't think so. First off, I don't believe this is well known—I instead think the exact *opposite* is known. However, while I agree that simply shoving evidence at someone will not change their mind in most cases, what would you say if I claimed that if someone were able to experience my life exactly as I have, moment by moment, many of my conclusions on bigotry and related topics be shared? I confess that saying that makes me look arrogant, but the thing is, bigotry generally stems from a place of experience, emotion, and most of all, flawed nurturing.

                        > It does no harm to divide people into Them and Us.

                        I don't believe so. However, I submit that the harm caused by doing so is less than *not* dividing people into Them and Us—when those labeled Them are actual Nazis.

                        >There exist people in the world who are Evil. While redemption is possible, it is rare to the point of being vanishingly nonexistent.

                        Here are some of my beliefs. People cannot be evil because I believe that is a nonsensical claim. Actions can be evil, ideas can be evil, but no matter how much evil a person does, they are not themselves evil. Even a psycho/sociopath is not inherently evil; it's just much easier for them to do evil things. It's probably not a big distinction for most, but it is for me. And while redemption can be very rare in some cases, I believe that if there were enough scientists with enough resources studying a person for a long enough period of time, then no matter who they are or what they've done, redemption is always *possible*. Though I'm not sure our definitions of redemption coincide, so maybe not. Definition swap?

                        >It does no harm to exclude people labelled as Evil; in fact, by removing a corrupting influence, this does a lot of good.

                        As above, I say here that I don't believe the former statement is true, but I do believe the latter is in many cases.

                        >People will always understand precisely what I mean when I make any statement.

                        I have many, many experiences which lead me to say that this is emphatically *not* the case.

                          I agree that someone else who has experienced your entire life and nothing else will agree with you on *many* things (I hesitate to say "all" because people are complicated). However, that is not quite where I was intending to go with that point.

                          So let's consider a more concrete example.

                          I state, without (yet) providing any evidence one way or the other, that person X has 'objectionable politics'. What are the odds that you would, if you did the research on Person X, agree with that assessment?

                          What are the odds that you would agree with *all* such assessments that I make?

                          There are two flaws that I believe I can see in this statement.

                          The first flaw is the idea that it does little harm to *incorrectly* label someone as a Nazi. (This ties in to the above)

                          The second flaw is that it does little harm to divide off the Nazis so that their only company is each other, such that they can reinforce and strengthen each other's views. (This ties in to the below)

                          (There are a number of further practical problems with any Them/Us division as well, quite apart from the above).

                          > Here are some of my beliefs. People cannot be evil because I believe that is a nonsensical claim. Actions can be evil, ideas can be evil, but no matter how much evil a person does, they are not themselves evil.

Though I'm not sure our definitions of redemption coincide, so maybe not. Definition swap?

                          Redemption: Realising that a course of action, undertaken in the past, was incorrect. Taking effort to eliminate, as far as humanly possible, the negative consequences of said action. Taking effort to ensure that said action is not undertaken again in the future, particularly by oneself. Having the above recognised by the victims of the original course of action.

                          I do not merely believe that redemption is possible; I would go further and say that it is *likely* in many cases. Especially when the offense is minor.

                          >> It does no harm to exclude people labelled as Evil; in fact, by removing a corrupting influence, this does a lot of good.

                          > As above, I say here that I don't believe the former statement is true, but I do believe the latter is in many cases.

                          I believe that the latter is false, in many cases. The reasoning is thus: most people want to be good. Most people therefore do not *intentionally* try to corrupt people. (This includes people with objectionable politics of almost every stripe).

                          What people do do, is they intentionally try to *redeem* other people. (Sometimes two people can work at cross-purposes, because they have different ideas of what the 'good' course of action is.) If members of Them are permitted to interact with Us, then I put it to you that the result is *more likely* to be the redemption of Them than the corruption of Us.

                            I can't say. I made a point of it to only append the tag if said evidence is provided. I'm not really sure what your point is here, since without evidence I can make no conclusions one way or another, and there are no examples mentioned. I suppose if you really want me to provide odds, I could find the percentage of the population of the Earth that are Nazis or bigots as defined by some source, probably a collection of polls, and then find the percentage of people who are writers, and then use those numbers to find the odds.

                            >The first flaw is the idea that it does little harm to incorrectly label someone as a Nazi.

                            Doing that does do harm. However, would you not say that someone who spouts actual Nazi propaganda on their Twitter feed is a Nazi?

                            >The second flaw is that it does little harm to divide off the Nazis so that their only company is each other, such that they can reinforce and strengthen each other's views.

                            Perhaps if they have multiple places to gather, but [deplatforming works](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjbp9d/do-social-media-bans-work).

                            >I do not merely believe that redemption is possible; I would go further and say that it is likely in many cases. Especially when the offense is minor.

                            Indeed. A world where this is not the case would be bleak indeed. Fortunately, Reddit provides an easy way for someone who has committed such offense to correct it and come back with no one finding a connection between the two accounts if they so choose, completely eliminating any social stigma their former positions may have incurred.

                            >Most people therefore do not intentionally try to corrupt people. (This includes people with objectionable politics of almost every stripe).

                            I have to disagree there. There are a few harmful ideas which cause the people holding them to promote said ideas. Most religions do this, as they say that converting people is one of the best things one can do. Nazism is another one of these beliefs, because anyone who is *not* a Nazi is seen as an enemy.

                            >If members of Them are permitted to interact with Us, then I put it to you that the result is more likely to be the redemption of Them than the corruption of Us.

                            This holds true in many cases, but not for Nazis. When a Nazi sees that a place will tolerate them, it becomes a signal for more to come join, and push the politics of that place further right with their presence and arguments. It is a very rare Nazi that wishes to change their mind—when you join a community pre-committing to refuse all persuasive arguments, it takes a boxed AI to get through that and peel back those kinds of beliefs.

                              I believe that, after all their other memories return, that they will then agree with you about *less* than before that happens.

                              How much less, and why, I cannot say. There are too many variables.

                              Mmm-hmm. Let me make it explicit, then.

                              The first time that I see a story labelled 'objectionable author politics', I have to ask myself, what does that *mean*? Does the author disagree with some reviewer on the subject of (say) gun control? Or (to take an example from Gulliver's Travels) which end of the egg to open at breakfast?

                              Has the author been slandered by an enemy? Has the author said something in innocence that has been badly misinterpreted? Has the author been attacked by political mudslingers, or expressed support for a single good policy of an otherwise reprehensible person?

                              Has the reviewer actually done *thorough* research, or merely skimmed the surface?

                              There are so *many* ways in which even a committed and thorough researcher can get someone else's politics *wrong* that it's a near-certainty that it will happen sooner or later. And that's *before* I consider the possibility that the reviewer's politics might not align with my own.

                              > Doing that does do harm. However, would you not say that someone who spouts actual Nazi propaganda on their Twitter feed is a Nazi?

                              Define 'Nazi propaganda'. Extreme counterexample: Hitler was a vegetarian. People supporting vegetarianism should not be considered to be 'spouting Nazi propaganda'.

                              Personally, given how much of a bad name the Nazis have had ever since WWII, I'd find it hard to imagine them being taken seriously as a political concern.

                              > Perhaps if they have multiple places to gather, but deplatforming works.

                              Deplatforming takes people out of the public eye and removes their audience. This is, in my view, an *extreme* step which should not be taken lightly (albeit sometimes a necessary step).

                              > Indeed. A world where this is not the case would be bleak indeed. Fortunately, Reddit provides an easy way for someone who has committed such offense to correct it and come back with no one finding a connection between the two accounts if they so choose, completely eliminating any social stigma their former positions may have incurred.

                              I put it to you that merely putting on a new mask is *not* redemption. Redemption requires acknowledgement of wrong and an attempt to make it right; not merely a dodging of consequences.

                              ...okay, I acknowledge the main substance of your point, though I believe it's rooted in a misunderstanding.

                              Most people believe that they are good, and that their attempts to spread their own ideology are attempts to redeem, not to corrupt. These people operate under the *belief* that they are redeeming.

                                They seem to be gaining momentum, especially online. Places like 4Chan with low moderation don't kick out the actual Nazis, so what starts out as people ironically trying to be shocking turns into an actual Nazi hangout.

                                >This is, in my view, an extreme step which should not be taken lightly

                                So what about said Nazis?

                                >I put it to you that merely putting on a new mask is not redemption. Redemption requires acknowledgement of wrong and an attempt to make it right; not merely a dodging of consequences.

                                It is extraordinarily easy to dodge consequences on Reddit. But if someone is, say, deplatformed, and no one wants to hear them out because they were an actual Nazi for a long time, and then they have a change of heart and make a new account, *they can do that.*

                                >Most people believe that they are good, and that their attempts to spread their own ideology are attempts to redeem, not to corrupt. These people operate under the belief that they are redeeming.

                                Indeed. Nazis believe that whiteness is good, and superior, and that anyone who does not fit their vision of a good person is *in*human. They have good intentions, yes, but they would not hesitate to push a button that killed all Jews.

                                >That 'Them' are actively malicious, and not merely mistaken; that 'They' are the enemy and are diametrically opposed to Us. Moreover, that 'They' are a cohesive and well-organised group.

                                They are a minority, but being actively malicious in support of a cause is *still being mistaken*. From a Nazi's perspective, it is *just* and *right* and *good* to kill Jews. It is just as right to infiltrate online spaces and promote their ideology whatever the cost. It is important to precommit to ignoring persuasive arguments, because *they are the enemy*. It's the paradox of tolerance, see? Tolerate anything except intolerance, because when intolerance becomes intertwined with an ideology people who believe in it become zealots. You don't calmly reason with a terrorist holding a bomb, for example—you *disarm the bomb*.

                                  Those are *largely* policies I agree are bad. (I say 'largely' only because of the inclusion of the communists on the end; while historical implementations of communism have pretty much all gone wrong for various reasons, I do believe that there is an argument to be made in favour of community ownership of infrastructure in some cases. I'd put forward the Free Software community as an example of this sort of thing done right.)

                                  However, as I had noted above, this does nothing to reassure me that the reviewer is *right* about the author's politics. I don't know how strong the reviewer's standards of proof are. I don't know how much evidence he has considered, and whether that evidence is actually a true reflection of the author's politics.

                                  > Nazi talking points. The fourteen words, 'we should create a nation for white people,' that sort of thing.

                                  I don't know what 'fourteen words' you're even talking about. And the last time I heard a serious suggestion of 'a nation for white people' was [the boeremag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeremag) who, while hugely racist, were not Nazis and (so far as I can tell) had nothing against Jews. (They were also convicted of treason).

                                  > They seem to be gaining momentum, especially online. Places like 4Chan with low moderation don't kick out the actual Nazis, so what starts out as people ironically trying to be shocking turns into an actual Nazi hangout.

                                  Oddly enough, I haven't seen any particular sign of them. Presumably I don't hang out in the wrong places.

                                  > So what about said Nazis?

                                  I'd say that deplatforming is a valid tactic to use against anyone seriously advocating mass murder who refuses to stop doing so.

                                  > It is extraordinarily easy to dodge consequences on Reddit. But if someone is, say, deplatformed, and no one wants to hear them out because they were an actual Nazi for a long time, and then they have a change of heart and make a new account, they can do that.

                                  Noted. But I think we're getting away from the point here.

                                  The point of this discussion isn't 'how to deal with actual Nazis'. The point is to consider the possibility of flaws in a certain chain of reasoning.

                                  --------------

                                  I will agree with you that anyone actually willing to kill people based on nothing more than their ethnicity or culture deserves far more than merely being banned from online discussions. I will further agree that anyone trying to persuade other people to kill people based on nothing more than ethnicity or culture should be prevented from reaching a wide audience.

                                  However, nothing in my previous paragraph has to do with the flaws in said chain of reasoning.

                                    "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."

                                    Perhaps you're not going looking for Nazis? It's commendable, if that's the case, but the thing is, there are Nazis on the internet. Have you heard of Stormfront?

                                    >Presumably I don't hang out in the wrong places.

                                    Ah. Likely, then.

                                    >However, nothing in my previous paragraph has to do with the flaws in said chain of reasoning.

                                    I think the core conflict is this: I see Nazis gaining a foothold in internet spaces while you don't seem to see the same thing. This may be because I am more sensitive to Nazi ideology—I know the fourteen words, and other Nazi dogwhistles, so I can more easily perceive them where they exist. Even on Reddit, the president's subreddit has more than a few white nationalist talking points repeated ad nauseam.

                                      ...okay, clearly there is a *history* to that 14-word phrase that is not obvious.

                                      And no, I don't go around looking for Nazis. As a general rule. Furthermore, I haven't heard of Stormfront.

                                      But all of this is beside the point. The point isn't the actual Nazis.

                                      The point is whether or not it's a good idea to label *suspected* Nazis (or other people one disagrees with) as having 'objectionable politics'.

                                      Okay, I had to go and [look that up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics). It turns out the dog-whistles are absolutely not about trying to convert other people to your ideology. Rather, it's about tricking people into voting for a given ideology by couching it behind innocent-seeming codephrases.

                                      Which is only useful in situations where there *is* a vote.

                                      And the biggest problem with innocent-seeming codephrases is that sometimes people really do say innocent things. Which may lead to them being unfairly considered part of a group that uses said phrase.

                                      ...I'm getting off-track.

                                      While the conflict that you perceive is *a* conflict between us, it is not the conflict at the core of the debate. The conflict at the core of this debate regards how useful or harmful it is to have a link-bot refer to the politics of the author next to the link of the fic.

                                        Precisely. A given situation might be, say, one where some Nazis have invaded a subreddit and are attempting to push a particular set of ideas to make it more accommodating to them. Perhaps pointing out that some users are Nazis actually starts driving away the Nazis—that's undesireable, so they might push forward the idea that politics shouldn't be allowed.

                                        I think that *is* the core. Because if a link bot refers to the politics of the author, and that manages to drive away Nazis, then that is a good thing.

                                          And that prevents them from spreading their ideology, neutering them entirely.

                                          The moment that they start to push a vote for an actually objectionable cause - like allowing anti-Semitic rhetoric while simultaneously banning all other politics - they will lose that vote. Dog-whistle tactics don't work unless you can make something dangerous sound innocent and then *still implement the dangerous thing*.

                                          Is it still a good thing if it drives away non-Nazis?

                                            Ah, but by that point in time there are enough Nazis that the vote becomes controversial instead of obviously fated to lose. And if they’re not yet at that point, well, you only need half a dozen dedicated people to fake a consensus, especially in smaller communities. And if everyone who posts things that are even mildly anti-Nazi sees constant disapproval—well, some people might see that their community seems to be constantly downvoting posts by Jewish people. And so the more sensitive members leave, and now there are only moderates and Nazis. And so now Nazis continue shaping community consensus in an effort to drive off the most sensitive of the moderates. And when they’re gone...

                                            >Is it still a good thing if it drives away non-Nazis?

                                            I’ll be honest here, if it drives away someone who supports a Nazi, in my mind they’re not that different from said Nazi.

                                              What if it drives away an innocent person who has been *mistaken* for a Nazi? What if it drives away people who see a clear Us/Them division and, having been the victims of bigotry before, don't even bother to look further before leaving?

                                                But they don't want to create a new subreddit. They want to take over things that exist and make them new territory. They've already done that, the creation of new subreddits, and *undisguised* Nazis get banned by the admins. Look at /r/frenworld.

                                                >What if it drives away an innocent person who has been mistaken for a Nazi? What if it drives away people who see a clear Us/Them division and, having been the victims of bigotry before, don't even bother to look further before leaving?

                                                Well, that's unfortunate, but I think we're at the point where we have to either do that or accept Nazis into the community. If we were planning to *make* a community, it's easy to subtly influence it to steer away Nazis from gaining ground in the first place. Suffuse a place with anti-Nazi sentiment, or just ban all bigotry in the comments. For example, someone who says or implies homophobia is okay is just gone, no matter how politely they word it.

                                                  Going to look at that subreddit, I see that it was banned for "the posting of content that glorifies or encourages violence." Given that that is the policy, it will surely apply to subreddits that get taken over, too; as soon as violence gets "glorified or encouraged" the community gets banned. Right?

                                                  And any means by which this can be disguised in a taken-over community is *also* a means by which it can be disguised in a new subreddit.

                                                  > Well, that's unfortunate, but I think we're at the point where we have to either do that or accept Nazis into the community.

                                                  You know, you don't *need* to suffuse a community with any particular sentiments to do that. Just report any Nazis that you spot to the moderators and/or site admins, and let them deal with the problem. We don't *need* to permanently be on alert (and permanently being on alert will effectively change the subreddit in unwelcome ways).

                                                  That's the first point.

                                                  And as another point; I don't think that you and I are understanding the same thing by the word 'Nazi'. I am understanding it to mean a follower of the circa-WWII policies of Adolf Hitler, specifically with regard to Aryan supremacy and the policies that led to the Holocaust. (These are the people that I do not think are common).

                                                  Yet you appear to be including in said group people who merely "imply homophobia is okay". I think that you'll agree that that is a far lesser offense than mass murder.

                                                    Yes. Some Nazis are smart enough not to openly encourage violence, but when enough gather and everyone else is driven out, that's generally what happens. However, I don't *want* this sub to be banned.

                                                    >And any means by which this can be disguised in a taken-over community is also a means by which it can be disguised in a new subreddit.

                                                    A *fully* taken-over community will eventually have the Nazis surface. Unless there are still a large enough amount of people, especially mods, from the original community that don't like Nazis.

                                                    I believe this is true—*if* Nazi ideology and bigotry is just flat-out banned whenever it's spotted. However, I've seen a grand total of zero of the first banned, probably because the mods *would* ban open Nazis here, and I have seen *many* instances of bigotry which the mods have taken no action against, presumably because they don't want to ban someone on the off chance that there's a good faith reason for expressing a bigoted opinion.

                                                    >Yet you appear to be including in said group people who merely "imply homophobia is okay". 

                                                    Nah. I'm saying that the Nazis were homophobic as well as advocates for mass murder, and nothing is lost by banning homophobia, which is not a good opinion on its own.

                                                      Noted. However, there are several steps that would need to happen before that point (probably starting with the banning of individual users for glorification of violence), so I don't think there's any danger of this in the near term.

                                                      > I believe this is true—if Nazi ideology and bigotry is just flat-out banned whenever it's spotted.

                                                      Ah. Now we're onto an important point here. Nazis, I put it to you, are vanishingly rare. Bigots, on the other hand, are far more common; and far less likely to advocate for violence.

                                                      > I have seen *many* instances of bigotry which the mods have taken no action against

                                                      Two points. Point the first: were the mods aware? (There is a 'report' button under posts which can be used to make the mods aware if you are not sure).

                                                      Point the second: No action *that you saw*. It is possible that, in certain cases, the action that the mods would take is one of the following:

                                                      - Conclude that the statement has an innocent interpretation, and/or is being taken out of context, and give the poster the benefit of the doubt
                                                      - Send the poster a private message, warning them to be more careful or face stronger sanctions in the future
                                                      - Request that the poster edit the post to something less objectionable
                                                      - Very quietly delete the given post (perhaps with, again, a castigation of the poster via private message)

                                                      Generally, the first two will look like nothing; but a poster with a habit of objectionable statements would be more likely to end up in trouble than a poster who says something easily misinterpreted (perhaps due to tiredness).

                                                      > Nah. I'm saying that the Nazis were homophobic as well as advocates for mass murder, and nothing is lost by banning homophobia, which is not a good opinion on its own.

                                                      Is anything lost by banning people who say something that *appears* homophobic?

                                                        Indeed. All we have is a few bigots, so far.

                                                        This is true, but the latter is a subset of the former, and neither of them are good for a community.

                                                        It is extremely likely, since in the most recent instance one mod went down the thread, went by it, found one of my comments, and locked it. However, I cannot be *certain* because I didn't report it, so I'll give you that.

                                                        > the action that the mods would take is one of the following:

I have an extension that allows me to [see removed comments](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/removeddit/epigemnhfmbapjjpkdaaholmachfnfem?hl=en), so not seeing any evidence that something has been removed is perhaps a piece of evidence in and of itself.

                                                        I believe that this is happening in every situation where the bigotry is expressed in polite language.

                                                          It is possible that your post was reported, for... whatever reason, and so the mod read your post without reading all the parent posts.

                                                          But yeah. If you find posts you object to, then report them.

                                                          I have no idea how that particular extension works. Does it still allow you to see that a comment *has been* deleted, or do they simply appear as if they were never deleted?

                                                          Seems sensible. And mod discretion would also be the answer to the question of how to tell the difference between actual homophobia and the mere appearance thereof.

                                                          Again, though, it seems to me that the correct and proportional action to take in response to such a post it to report the post to the mods, and allow them to use that discretion.

                                                            Nvm: the post being locked apparently forbids reports. I'll do it next time I see something of that nature and observe what happens.

                                                            It allows you to see both that a comment has been removed, and what its content was before removal.

          .... have you read the Shadow series? There's a character who says he's gay but he's marrying a woman and having a baby because having children is the point of life. The entire A plot is about saving embyros as though they're human beings. I still love it but that's partly because it's such blatant conservative wish fulfillment.

                    Yeah that analogy works too. I feel empathy for that person. 

                    Ask forgiveness not permission, that'd never have been approved if they asked but no one might raise enough of a fuss if they present it fait accompli. Cost comes out of social capital I suppose 

                    I don't see the it's not your responsibility as a good argument for anything. People stepping up to tasks abandoned (in this case everyone going to hell or whatever) should be praised. The issue with this scenario is that we don't believe in the end goal. No one complained about him providing links prior to the addition of comments yet if he had asked someone might have said we don't need it. People will just comment if they want the link. People can Google. 

                    But if no one had bothered buying a calender for any cubicle and they'd went around realising how inefficient that was and improving it. Well not their responsibility still? And you bet people would find some reason to be annoyed in an office.

                        The difference is, one is illegal while one is merely against convention. It's like the example that /u/RMcD94 [gave](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvoq4i/meta_are_the_low_quality_tags_too_harsh/f7g6gej/) about asking forgiveness not permission. That's totally fine when it's just a convention that you're breaking, and the convention is one you understand why it's in place (Chesterton's Fence) and what it's for, and you're breaking it for a specific reason that you think will improve the situation. I will charitably ascribe this motive to Lightwavers as I don't think his behaviour contradicts it. (Although I don't *know* how hard he thought about it first, by default one should be charitable in their interpretations of others, I feel.)

                        Sorry about using the word "upset." I meant it as more of a stand-in for the longer phrase "arguing about this on the internet." I see this as mostly a pointless activity, so I don't do it much. Possibly I am guilty of ascribing a motive to you because you are engaging in an activity I find to be low-value.

                        I'm sorry to hear that you feel you wasted your day thinking about this. I may have contributed to that, for which I apologise again.

                        For others reading:

                        >It's like, no, you don't get to assume that this decision you've made is the default option. I don't even care if there's a bot or what it does, I barely interact with this subreddit outside of the Friday thread anyway.

                        Why not? Why can't people contribute as they see fit, if they look at the current state of things on /r/rational and go, "Hey, I could do this and it would be a definite improvement. I know about all the likely errors I could be making in this judgement, and have specifically thought about why things are the way they are, and I still feel that this would be an improvement." And then the only thing they do is break a (previously unenforced) convention. As an honest, genuine question, what is the problem with this?

                        (A separate issue: I can see why people dislike Lightwavers injecting personal commentary into bot-like behaviour which should be "impartial." I mostly agree with the criticisms here and so voted to remove the extra tags on the poll he put up.)

                            I can honestly see /u/Perspeculative's point on this. Breaking a convention (where it is merely a convention and not a law) in a way that one genuinely believes to be most probably beneficial is exactly how societies get rid of poor conventions.

                            There were a bunch of distinct problems with Lightwaver's bot. But the argument that it was "not his place" to implement it is not a very meritorious argument.

    Why? In general a bot automatically linking stories seems pretty handy. Reminds me of the bot linking cards in CCG related subreddits.

  I personally think that they should be removed. I feel like they are detrimental to the community as a whole.

  By immediately judging and labelling a story 'low quality' we are arbitrarily prejudging it for everyone who sees it. 

  I personally am writing a story that I want to consider rational, but I am an amateur and it is obviously the work of an amateur. Does that make it 'low quality'? Perhaps, does that mean it deserves to be labelled low quality? I don't think so.

  I voted for remove, but if replace wins, then perhaps replacing the tag with 'amateur story' or 'constructive Critique only', something that will tell the reader not to expect a master work but not to judge the work like they would judge a story that has been edited and published by a professional Writer and a full team of editors and beta readers.

    If your comment ends up with the most votes and replace wins, the (Low Quality) tag will be replaced by (Amateur Work).

  Ironic given the meta discussion, but I see a lot of negativity directed toward you. Disappointing given your good intentions. 

  Anyways, thanks for creating and sharing your super convenient tool! Really appreciate not having to search up the titles.

  Re: controversy, people apparently find your objectionable tags objectionable (to the point where they irrationally hate the bot itself rather than its current iteration) , so the neutral solution is posting the links only.

  On a side note, having to police beneficial technology because of human foibles and quibbles is always depressing...

    Yeah, I'm finding this pretty funny so far.

  I expect that the underlying issue is that you are trying to enhance your bot, which was originally limited to providing links to third party sites, to provide what is effectively recommendation data. Or anti-recommendation data, as the case may be.

  The problem with it is that recommendations are a notoriously complex area. Even Amazon, which has access to its users' browsing history and their purchasing history, not to mention a lot of experienced developers, has had trouble with them over the years. And they have every incentive to get recommendations right in order to sell more books.

  Something like *Taylor Varga*, which you currently [list as (Low Quality)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LightPieces/comments/dtszrx/taylor_varga/), is a good example of the challenges involved. It's a hugely polarizing fics; some readers love it and some readers hate it. The quotes that you have collected are a decent cross-section of the reasons given by the people who dislike it. However, you could also come up with another list of reasons given by the people who like it. Which is why it is [currently ranked 32rd out of 7,000+ *Worm* fics](https://wormstorysearch.com/?direction=desc&is_nsfw_eq=any&limit=20&page=2&searching=true&sort=stories.rating).

  In my case, I had finished 180 *Worm* fics before I started researching *Taylor Varga* in depth, so I knew what I was doing. And yet even after reading all the arguments "pro et contra" I wasn't sure whether I would like it. I had to actually sit down and read the 2,000,000-word monstrosity in order to decide for myself. Moreover, my opinion changed repeatedly as I progressed through the text. If I had stopped after the first 300K words, when some of the issues with the fic became more pronounced, I would have had a different opinion than I have now. If you were to ask me today whether it's a "low quality" work, I would shrug and say that it really depends on what you are after, what kind of sense of humor you appreciate, whether you can handle well-written but repetitive scenes, etc. There are sections of *Taylor Varga* which I find to be very enjoyable and there are section which I find to be very irritating.

  As a general observation, I find that using objective quantifiable data helps when creating recommendation lists. It's not a perfect method by any means, but it helps minimize controversy. Things like [the ISFDB's list of Novels Ranked by Awards and Nominations](http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/most_popular_table.cgi?1), which I put together a few years ago.

    Indeed. The low quality tag has been abandoned. Hopefully the wiki links work out better.
    ```

- u/MyreMyalar:
  ```
  Just do what the rest of the world does and stick three stars on things that you think are low quality and use four and five for things you think are better.
  ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    The system so far ranges from low quality, as in the way the text/plot/etc is constructed is subpar, to no recommendation one way or the other, and finally a nearly universal recommendation at the other end. Star ratings are not in line with this system, unfortunately.
    ```

    - u/MyreMyalar:
      ```
      I'm not sure you can really make a fine dividing line between the wide scope of what you are talking about and a recommendation.

      I mean try saying 'The writing, plotting and characters are all subpar - strongly recommended'. I think it sounds absurd. 'Low quality' as a tag with no qualifiers attached is functionally identical to saying 'not recommended'.

      If you want to attach tags to links, I wouldn't mind something like (original) vs (fan-fiction) - I generally tend to prefer original stories, or if I am going to read fan-fiction it'll only be for specific settings I'm interested in other takes on (e.g I like Worm & Ward, but have little interest in other author's Worm spin-offs).

      From the title of a story alone it is not always clear what category it falls into.
      ```

      - u/Lightwavers:
        ```
        > 'Low quality' as a tag with no qualifiers attached is functionally identical to saying 'not recommended'.

        Indeed. Links are attached that point to reviews/comments that display specific critiques.

        >links, I wouldn't mind something like (original) vs (fan-fiction) - I generally tend to prefer original stories, or if I am going to read fan-fiction it'll only be for specific settings 

        An interesting idea. The system right now doesn’t support more than one tag, but I might redesign it to point to fandoms if I have the time.
        ```
