## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Recommendations for someone whose ability is primarily lie detection and uses it to maneuver throughout/munchkin their society?
  ```

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    low key munchkined by Sylar in the later seasons of Heroes. Sylar is a supervillain who can steal superpowers by analising the brains of superhumans he kills. Being able to spot lies let him beat several other villains and heroes, and well as hunt his prey more efficiently.  


    A weird side effect of that is: he also has intuitive aptitude (intuitive understanding), haptic memory (can learn everythign about a person or an object by touchign them), and later becomes an empath as well. Combined with perfect lie detection it basically turns him into a Buddha and he foregoes his evil ways; he simply learns to understand others and himself *perfectly*, and no longer feels the need to kill.

    It's not quite what you want, but have you watched the series Lie to Me? The lead can detect lies from micro expressions.

    Shame it didn't have more seasons.

    I think it'd be more interesting to munchkin the ability user.
    E g  This sentence is a lie.
    A normal lie detector is 100% useless against someone who doesn't lie, and an omniscient lie detector isn't a lie detector at all, it's basically asking a genie for information.

      A power that tells if the speaker thinks they're being deceptive will still be useful. Especially if it can detect self-deception beneath a statement.

  Does anyone have recommendations for good horror comedy? For example, something like “John Dies at the End” and it’s sequels where incompetent slackers face off against interdimensional evil and paranormal events in the most hilariffying way possible?
  ```

  - u/Jokey665:
    ```
    *Cabin in the Woods* and *Tucker and Dale vs. Evil* are my go-to horror comedies. Movies though
    ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      *Cabin in the Woods* is very funny, creepy, and heartbreaking. Just very good overall.

      >!The typical horror movie "protagonists" are usually annoying, insipid or worse. In the ten minutes of their introduction, they seem like genuinely good, funny and interesting people. And that makes all that happens afterwards that much more tragic.!<

    >wiki: The Laundry Files is a series of novels by British writer Charles Stross. They mix the genres of Lovecraftian horror, spy thriller, science fiction, and workplace humour.

    I describe the workplace homour part as bureaucracy porn, there's pages and pages of procedures and manuals. Its pretty dark, human sacrifice is pretty commonly described, lots of death.
    ```

    - u/dysfunctionz:
      ```
      Seconding The Laundry Files. Not strictly rational (the setting mostly runs on both rule of funny and rule of creepy), but has a lot of good deconstruction/subversion of eldritch horror.

      I would also note that while the MC describes there *being* pages and pages of procedure, the books don’t actually give you giant infodumps, they’re mostly pretty fast-paced. And while the setting is dark, the tone is mostly dry humor.
      ```

      - u/Freevoulous:
        ```
        probably the thing I love the most about Laundry Files is that it gives humanity a fighting chance against the Eldritch Horrors, but its a SLIM chance that relies on humans acting rationally and pragmatically at all times.   


        Its *almost* a Lovecraftian horror, but with enough rationality and HFY vibes to counter it.

  Does anyone know of any good monster taming novels? No Pokémon though, not interested in Pokémon fanfics.

  Suddenly got interested in this niche concept, but there’s nothing good in that concept that I know of. It’s an interesting idea, where a person’s strength isn’t based on their personal power, but separate pets.
  ```

  - u/AngryCoffeeBean:
    ```
    There are a whole lot of Chinese web novels based on monster taming. But unfortunately as you said, most of them are garbage. The only half decent ones I found are Unscientific Beast Taming and Unable to Cultivate, I Can Only Raise Soul Pets
    ```

  I've been sorta floundering for a bit, so I decided to go for a re-read of *Heretical Edge* because it has some parts that I really, really like. 

  That said, my overall feeling on it is mixed. It's a bit hard to describe, but I think my general gist would be that it needs to be majorly overworked by an editor. Some parts are fantastic: twists that are hinted at, secret parts of the worldbuilding that only come into play chapters or even arcs later, and occasionally brilliant plans using the available tools are a lot of fun. 

  One main negative is that it has serious pacing issues: some chapters absolutely nothing happens except for paragraphs long of people hugging each other and recapping what adventures they've had while separated and in others, characters do death-speedruns in a paragraph or two. 

  Another main issue--one that bothers me especially as a /r/rational sub--is that the main cast is seemingly unable to solve straightforward problems and the "there are no rational adults in this magic school" problem crops up very, very frequently. Like, by the middle/end of book one, the protagonist team has at least 5 if not more "planetary level badass" adult fighters at their beck and call, who are all centuries old and described as hypercompetent. As such, the plot always needs to make sure that these adults aren't around, can't help for some reason, or are already indisposed somewhere else and it just feels contrived. 

  Like, from relatively early on it becomes clear that the school has a major issue with shapeshifter/possessor infiltration. Some high level or trusted person is assumed to be compromised somehow, but what do they do? They just dawdled around until shit hits the fan and the shape shifters win, despite having been handed the tools to handle the situation. The only reason the protagonists mange to squeak out a victory is because deus ex machina, where actual friendly ancient greek gods show up and save them. It's just very frustrating.

    The author is the same Cerulean who wrote [Atonement](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/atonement-worm-au.312449/threadmarks) and [Intrepid](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/intrepid-worm-au.337516/threadmarks), two moderately popular Worm fics, a few years ago, right? I remember reading the first 5 arcs of *Atonement* and setting it aside for similar reasons: there were elements that I liked, but there were also elements that made little sense and/or were irritating.

    P.S. I see that *Intrepid* was resurrected 2 months ago.

  I'd like to plug this in: an SCP/Undertale crossover that turned into an RPG where the main plot relies on hypothesis testing. The narrative is ongoing and people can involve themselves.

  Any books like Lord of the Flies, but rational and not pointlessly grim? What i mean is books about wilderness survival or kids in survival situations, succeeding through rational and smart actions.
  ```

  - u/dysfunctionz:
    ```
    Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is a classic of the genre, and I think you could call it rational; the main character learns how to survive through a lot of intelligent experimentation, and the author himself was quite experienced with wilderness survival so the tactics the MC uses are realistic but also appropriate to a kid with no previous experience learning those skills in a life-or-death situation.
    ```

  - u/taxemeEvasion:
    ```
    Maybe *Tunnel in the Sky* by Heinlein, if you haven't read it? A group of kids get stranded on another planet during a training exercise and have to fend for themselves.
    ```

    - u/vorpal_potato:
      ```
      And as for "rational and not pointlessly grim", this one does really well. One of the core topics taught to people planning to settle other planets is, somewhat counterintuitively, *civics*. More precisely, they're taught some of the things we've figured out over the millennia about how groups of humans can organize themselves, working together for common goals and resolving disputes non-catastrophically. With some unpleasant exceptions, these people don't *want* to live in some kind of Hobbesian war of all against all, and they don't have to -- because they know how civilization works and how to build it from nothing.

      It's also very good as a straight-up wilderness survival story.

    Way back in school I read a story set in Australia or New Zealand, or rather the islands on front of these. The story followed a group of teenagers who were on a plane trip over the sea, and after their plane crashed they had to survive on an island. Can't remember the name, though, it's been about 15 years now and it was in German anyway. Maybe try on /r/TipOfMyTongue?

      - u/Dragongeek:

        Huh, neat story. I've always thought that *Lord of the Flies* was a bunch of Freud-fueled nonsense, so it's cool to see a case where everything went rather well, all things considered.

      Gordon Korman's 'Island' trilogy?

    _My Side of the Mountain_ is another in the small _Hatchetlike_ genre.
    ```

    - u/dysfunctionz:
      ```
      I also read and enjoyed that one as a kid, though I recall the stakes being a lot lower as the MC is surviving off the land intentionally and isn’t all that far from civilization, vs. the premise of Hatchet being a kid lost in the remote Canadian wilderness after a plane crash with almost nothing.

  I read a few chapters of [Re:Zero The King of Pride](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13807270/1/Re-Zero-The-King-of-Pride) over the past week. I... sort of recommend it? It has a lot of problems, but it also develops the story of re:zero in interesting directions. 

  The premise is that the protagonist gets a different powerset (due to spoiler reasons) that includes the ability to be invincible for 5 seconds and the ability to stop time for himself while entering an analytical state of mind that's also intensely prideful and confident. Subaru, being who he is, manages to use that pride and confidence boost to actually improve his social skills, even though it's clear that the side effects of his power are supposed to be more malicious than that. What I liked about it is that the character internal monologues feel like actual people instead of anime archetypes. The characters question their opinions and thoughts based on new information, and everybody feels more emotionally mature. It's definitely not rational, since even canon Re:Zero is kinda characterized by its characters being emotionally stunted messes.

  For the bad part, the writing feels pretty stilted at times even though it's technically grammatically correct. There's a lot of telling instead of showing, and some of the plot developments feel railroaded instead of organic. The protagonist also feels like a Gary Stue, although it seems like the author is foreshadowing a lot in terms of his powers being OP. I'm around chapter 10 as of this moment, it's a quite long fic. 

  In terms of requests, any stories where the powers change the way the protagonist thinks and acts, and the protagonist is *aware* of those changes and uses those changes intelligently?

    I feel like your best bet for finding mental powers is looking at Worm fanfictions and searching for Thinker powers. [Skein](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/skein-worm-altpower-au.437953/) gets a lot of praise for being an interesting and well done example of one, although it was abandoned early on so you still have the protagonist getting to grips with things being front and centre.

    [The Fall of Doc Future](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents/amp) is adjacent to your interests here, and I found it on this subreddit years back myself (long enough that my memory of it is fuzzy). Guy who mentally augmented himself into being the smartest man alive has his mind start to fall apart, and him and those around him work to fix it. That said, merely "being smarter" might not be exactly what you're looking for, although one of the major PoV characters is also a speedster, which is sort of adjacent too, even if speedster changes to the speed you are able to think might not be what you were asking after even if they arguably fit the wording.

    I sortof enjoyed this. I liked the early parts, but I would have preferred if the early political parts were more challenging.  
    Then, there was the *really long* >!Emilia's name gets eaten!< arc, which just ground against me. It was a lot of drama between characters which felt understandable, but it also felt like all the character's reflectivity and models-of-others dropped down really low (>!Nobody seems to really understand that Subaru loves Emilia. They have good reasons to believe he's been bewitched early on, but they can't seem to figure out that if he's been bewitched then he's been bewitched to be in love. They keep acting like his actions are for a stranger, without considering how his memories have been 'altered'. Puck is also weird, in that he literally says that he understands that Emilia isn't actually evil, but also keeps going on thinking she bewitched him evilly???!<)
