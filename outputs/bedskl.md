## A New Web Serial - Paragon [RT] [HF]

### Post:

Hi /r/rational, I thought you might be interested in a new serial I am starting. This is the first story I've ever written, so it will be a bit rough around the edges.The story will take place in a high fantasy world full of magic, powers, and all that goes along with that. The story follows a girl named Juliette who want's nothing to do with the Passions that grant these powers.

It will be written with rationality in mind, but it won't be 100% pure rational. I've got the first chapter done so far and will be updating the story twice monthly - around the 1st and 15th of the month if you are interested in continuing.

If you do take the time to read it, first, thank you! Second, please provide some constructive criticism. I want this story to be enjoyable to read, so your input really matters.

Again, thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy.

EDIT: Thank you for all of your help /r/rational. I've re-written the chapter (you can read it on the link above). I hope it's much easier to read and more enjoyable. Thanks again!

  Some technical thoughts:

  >No mother.

  No, mother.

  >You’ve seen what can do to people.

  what **it** can do

  >Juliette, I understand your fear.

  In real life, people barely ever refer to others by name during conversations. The context makes it obvious who is being referred to.

  >The Administrators

  That's a lot of Proper Noun Names used in quick succession with no real explanation.

  >how I felt and helped

  **they** helped

  >They are as thoughtless than an Ox

  **as** an ox? Also, weird capitalization

  >Do you still have you’re Para?

  **your.** Also, Para is yet another concept that's dumped on the reader in the first three hundred words.

  >forbit

  forbid

  >Right mother?

  Right**,** mother?

  >Though Oliver was much younger – barely into his teenage years, Alton and Oliver has a strong relationship.

  Weird mix of a comma and an en-dash to separate a parenthetical. Use either commas or dashes on both sides.

  >Other’s thought that 

  Other**s**

  >Upon not receiving a Passion they seek to destroy the Heart

  comma after Passion, else the "passion they seek" can be read as its own thing.

  >Or turning into something, worse. 

  No comma there. Maybe an ellipsis if you want a pause.

  >she said outloud.

  out loud

  >ignoring the stares of her *neighbors*

  I'd advise not using italics. The less you have them, the more impact they have, and here it would be more impactful to describe why she thinks of them strongly enough to warrant italics rather than leaving that up to the reader to decide.

  >His hard, features now made him intimidating

  no comma

  >to make due

  make **do**

  > Even at this early hour her eyes were bright

  comma after "hour"

  > She was wearing a new yellow tunic, that fit her form perfectly.

  no comma necessary

  >I just don’t feel right about it Jane.

  When referring to people by names or titles, those are separated with commas. Again, I'd skip them here entirely because nobody talks like that. If there are multiple people talking, then it makes more sense.

  >“But…” Jane said

  Missing period. Could also use some description to let the reader know it's a leading question.

  >She grabbed me lightly by the elbow

  weird perspective shift to first person.

  >It was a draw of luck

  Luck of the draw?

  >Hastings and Doyen’s

  Doyen**s**

  >the mornings conversation

  morning**'**s

  >You can fold the clothes husband,

  You can fold the clothes**,** husband,

  >while I fix the wagon!”.

  No period.

  >If this is going to change our lives, I want to share that moment with you."

  Feels a bit abrupt given how we just met Jane. Also, comma instead of period at the end.

  >I could tell she was getting restless

  another perspective shift to first person

  >she’d have princesses and Leader’s

  Leader**s**

  >“A rock.” Jane responded.

  "A rock**,**" Jane responded.

  >a blemish on within the glow.

  Remove "on." Also, maybe explain more that she's no longer in the room, at least mentally.

  More generally, there's a lot of dialogue and not a lot of description going between there. Another thing I noticed was that there were a lot of concepts dropped in in very quick succession, and while a lot of them can be inferred from context, it's somewhat overwhelming.

    Thank you for the detailed feedback. I’ll pour through this and clean up my chapter. I was worried about the overflow of concepts to be honest, and it sounds like that was warranted. I’ll see what I can do make it easier to understand and flesh out concepts when they are introduced. 

    When you say, “a lot of dialogue and not a lot of description.” What do you mean? Do you mean description of characters or the concepts themselves?
    ```

    - u/MimicSquid:

      Pore, not pour.
      ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      I'm just a random pleb so take it with a grain of salt, but reading through it didn't feel like it pulled me into the scene because dialogue alone doesn't carry a lot of tone. Not seeing the ticks, mannerisms, reactions and in general all of the nonverbal communication between the characters makes it harder for me to give a voice to the dialogue in my head.
      ```

      - u/ParagonsPassion:
        ```
        Great feedback. While I reread the chapter, I added more descriptions of what you are talking about. First pass was very light in detail and more monologuing or dialogue. I’ll probably be rewriting this chapter to improve readability and description.

      There's a browser add-on called Grammarly. It will generally catch most spelling and simple grammatical errors.

      Grammarly also has a Windows program that I do not use.

    ```
    >Though Oliver was much younger – barely into his teenage years, Alton and Oliver has a strong relationship.

    Also, first half of the sentence is past tense, second part is present.

    Thanks for the catch, I’ll get it fixed. Please let me know once you’ve had a chance to read, if love some feedback.

        That would be fantastic really. Done be afraid to say a certain section bores you or didn’t make sense. I’m hoping to improve on my writing as this is a first for me. Thank you.

  Are you releasing chapters as soon as you write them or are you keeping a couple of chapters ahead?
  ```

  - u/ParagonsPassion:
    ```
    I’m ahead by about half of a chapter now. I aim to be a few chapters ahead so I can keep to a somewhat rigid schedule of the 1st and 15th of each month.
    ```

    - u/Dent7777:
      ```
      Very cool! Good luck!
      ```

- u/xaleander:
  ```
  Interesting start, looking forward to reading more.
  I'm super confused about the repetition after Jane tossing the stone, though. Is it really meant to replay the whole chapter again?
  ```

  - u/ParagonsPassion:
    ```
    Awesome! Thanks for letting me know. That is an error and will be fixed tonight. It ends when the voice says for Juliette to fine it.
    ```

  - u/ParagonsPassion:
    ```
    It's fixed now. Sorry for the confusion!
    ```
