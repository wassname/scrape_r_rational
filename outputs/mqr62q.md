## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  A party defeats a monster and gains XP. Dividing XP equally rewards freeloaders and dividing by damage shafts support classes. Dividing by contribution makes the most sense. 

  What happens when we take this idea to its limit? 

  A warrior kills a monster and gains XP. A portion of it goes to his mage buddy who hasted him. Some goes to his trainers. Some goes to the smith who forged his weapon and armor. Some goes to the peasant who guided him to the lair but stood aside. Some goes to the King who is entitled to a portion of his subjects' XP. 

  What would be the ramifications and knock-on effects?

    Either the King requires more XP per level, or the King is going to level *real* fast. If the latter and levels have the usual superlinear effect on capability, the capability gap between commoners and nobility is going to be simply ludicrous as a result.

    Lone hermits making their own gear and solo-clearing dungeons are going to be gods amongst mortals. Your Knight in plate wielding steel weapons, who has a lifetime of training and travels to the dungeon on a road that's maintained by society and eats food other people cook? That lady is a chump by comparison to the murderhobo of the woods.

      Ruling class should get a tiny tiny percentage not to be overpowered but still relevant enough for them to incentivize XP gain among their populace.

      The image of a warrior who mines the ore himself and turns it into a sword is appealing but I imagine a balance is needed to be struck not to spread yourself too thin.
      ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:

        I'm more thinking someone who fashions spears and a bow out of wood. Turning ore into a sword is a very complex undertaking that requires a lot of infrastructure and support; you can't do it solo.

        (I strongly recommend reading Bret Devereaux's writings on metals. Just the charcoal stuff alone, yeesh!)

          And who *taught* you how to make a sword out of ore? They're also getting a cut...
          ```

      That would be a good justification for the existence of D&D-style monks, too
      ```

    A lot of it depends on any misalignment between the XP weighting and the effort a support class needs to put in / supply of those support classes. For example, if a blacksmith can fully supply 10 adventurers and gets 20% of the XP, then blacksmiths are very powerful folks. That'd incentivize more people to become blacksmiths, which would bring their share of the XP down, but it's a skilled trade that's hard to get into, so they'd still come out ahead.

    It's also going to depend on what classes exist / what XP gets you. For example, some of the XP goes to the farmers who fed everyone involved. They're vitally important. But they're also fungible, so we wouldn't expect any one farmer to get a lot of XP, just a world where farmers are a bit more buff than normal. But if they're actually gaining levels in a Farmer class that makes them wildly more productive, then a randomly chosen food item is more likely to have come from a powerful Farmer, so they experience lopsided XP growth. Or if the Farmer class makes their crops somehow preferable to adventurers, then they also experience a lopsided XP growth, the same way blacksmiths do.

    Since you specified the king gets a portion of the subjects' XP, that does seem like a candidate for runaway XP growth. It doesn't take any particular effort for a king to rule over two adventuring parties instead of one. And since they're amassing direct personal power in the form of XP, that actually reduces the difficulty of being a king. It's a lot easier to make sure your supporters always have more power than any pretenders if you (your most stalwart supporter) personally count extra.

    If people are aware of the XP gain and agree with how it's shared out, it could also serve as a way to decide how to split the loot. To take this to an extreme, if there's an accurate measure of XP available then the state might pay people 1GP per XP for their services to civilization in a reversal of the older editions of D&D where escaping the dungeon with gold earned XP.

    If people disagree with how the XP is shared, there might be traditions that evolved to mitigate the issues. For example, if preparation before a fight is overvalued compared to healing afterwards, healers might also take on the role of squires to the warriors so that their XP share better reflects their contribution.

    If people are conscious of their XP gain, especially if they can deduce what they earned it for, that could lead to significantly more experimentation among supporters, as teachers can learn which types of lessons earn them the most XP once their students head down to the dungeon, and iterate towards an optimised adventurer curriculum. 

    On the other hand, it could lead to a winner-takes-all situation: if one blacksmith is five levels higher, they'll get a lot more business even if they earned those levels through luck, and that extra business will only increase their level advantage further.

    Do the dead get a share of the XP? If they don't, that incentivises the party to kill anyone who contributes before the earnings occur. If they do, that encourages everyone to come up with new techniques, strike out into new lands, and otherwise avoid relying on previous generations who leech their XP without benefiting from it. That could potentially lead to a justification for that discredited trope of the "hard times make strong men" cycle: hard times means little support from previous generations and so a larger share of the XP, but that then puts subsequent generations in a better position and so they earn less XP until the lack of levels causes society to collapse again.

      there is a metaphor for capitalism in all of this, but I cannot figure what it is.

        Probably the easiest one is to parallel the pursuit of XP with the pursuit of profit, and show how this can lead to terrible outcomes.
        ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    I mean, if balanced properly, this could be a good way to provide non-combatants with XP, and they don't even need to be aware of it. People just assume that it's their natural progression in their careers--eg a successful blacksmith will be gaining more XP as he grows older. He thinks this is because he's being rewarded for doing good work, when really, it's that his products are widely used.

    Taken to the extreme extreme, everyone in the world would gain a piece of the pie. Every single interaction is driven by a previous interaction. The guide ate a pie cooked by a baker who received their flour by a merchant who traded for the flour from a farmer who inherited their land from... etc. etc.

    The ramifications would depend on the split. If the farmer above gained a small fraction of an exp point, it'd basically be negligible. If the farmer gained 1 exp point, then there'd be a lot more farmers who are buff and high level because their tendrils would affect nearly every single outcome in the world.

  Significantly inspired by [Virtuous Sons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia), a xianxia story based off of Greco-Roman history, I've been working a bit on a Norse-Icelandic mythological version, mainly just to see if it takes me anywhere interesting. I have a few notes about it down - berserkers (and the various berserker cults) are one 'path,' the 9 worlds are the cultivation stages, that kind of thing.

  From there I've been working on an idea where Ragnarok occurred in the distant past, and the remnants of those killed form the basis of many other practices - the One-Handed God, for example, is Tyr (who got his hand bitten off by Fenrir), and adherents of his cult inscribe the Tiwaz rune (synonymous with war and victory, kinda) on their bodies for increased power.

  There are various other aspects as well, but what would you expect to see in a Norse mythological xianxia?
