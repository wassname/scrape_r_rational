### Comments:

  ```
  I’ve read a lot in the last month or so. I thought I might go ahead and share some of them this week and more following next week or the week after. I will include links but not summaries. 

  [Echoes Of Tribulation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/45434/echoes-of-the-tribulation-an-historical-apocalypse) 

  If there's one of these I’d like you to click on it would be Echoes Of Tribulation since I don’t think it's received enough attention for its merits. The concept is simple, it's a system apocalypse that, rather than take place in a modern era, is instead set in the 1300s. The technical skill of the author is quite good and there is a real effort into authentically portraying the era. The worldbuilding from the system itself is also quite good.  Since I can’t be entirely positive about anything in my life, I will say that the pacing is off in places feeling too slow and the characterization could be more focused. But, yeah, check it out.  

  [The Hallowed War](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/44463/the-hallowed-war) 

  The Hallowed War is a story with a lot of cool moments and ideas but ultimately always on the precipice of taking those good bits and forging them into something exciting but never quite does. That being said it's competently written and maybe, you might get more out of it than I did. 

  [Rigged](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46766/rigged)

  The only thing that really makes this story stand out is its relatively high quality of writing and the core conceit of the MC forcing himself into dangerous situations due his medical condition. It produces a very authentic tension in story, and gives a MC a stronger everyman feel than counterparts in similar series. However this hasn’t updated in a while, which is disappointing since what is there is good but mostly foundational. Not updated in a while though. 

  [Dread Our Wrath](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dread-our-wrath-asoiaf-si.870076/)

  You like ASOIAF tech uplift fics, you’ll probably like this. The MC starts at a lower point than most, being a minor noble in the storm lands and the way he goes about things is pretty restrained compared to most similar fictions, both of which I think are to the story's credit. The catch however is that, while characterisation is good across the board the MC himself is a weak point being mostly flawless and by extension, uninteresting. 

  [Saltworld](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47621/saltworld-an-apocalypse-litrpg)

  Great writing, a fresh aesthetic, a litrpg system that feels balanced between crunch and impact and charismatic characters, the only faults that I can find in saltworld is that the use of humor can and does undercut the atmosphere at times and there is not enough of it. 

  [Tricksters Song](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46849/tricksters-song-a-litrpg-portal-fantasy)

  A fun romp if not all that compelling, or, at least it isn’t my flavor. If you're bored  there are much worse things to read but it lacks anything that properly hooked me. 

  [The Path Unending](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-path-unending-a-cultivation-quest.62599/) 

  Forge of Destiny’s, less well known but equally good younger brother. It’s a very slow burn focused on the daily life of a single sect member and it is a quest, however I will say it doesn't read like one. Typically there is a moment, even in the best quests, where the MC does something really OOC or random due the nature of the quest, not here, here the MC characterization is really consistent and on point. The world is interesting, the writing is good, it's the length of three or four good sized books and is occasionally genuinely funny, check it out.

    ```
    Echoes of the Tribulation really didn't work for me. It especially lost me when the MC had 3 or 4 big jumps in power back to back in a montage, any of which would've been a big change. If he'd >!come back able to do magic!<, that'd be one thing, but with everything else on top it makes the idea of a kingly court reacting to his presence a non-issue >!because he's not even human anymore.!<

    And while the effort is there, as you say, I'm pretty sure it's not at all accurate in any way that makes the story interesting. It even makes it so >!every antagonist is an evil psychopath who glows evilly when they level up.!<

      I dropped it even before that point.  The lack of moral complexity in the main character and the weird philosophizing about intent leave a bad taste in my mouth.  If it weren't for the gory (and over-narrated) fight scenes, the thing would read like the script of a Saturday morning cartoon written by someone who wishes they lived in a feudalistic society.
      ```

      - u/Revlar:
        ```
        You're not wrong. I was mostly sticking with it out of hope that it would subvert itself, mabe involve political struggles and things of that nature. Instead, the protagonist gets whisked away with little to no warning and then becomes impossibly strong ahead of everyone else with timeskipped effort.

        It came as a surprise because the story was treating his receiving second-hand mail as a really good turn of fortune less than 10 chapters before everyone starts investing stats into becoming Jojo gigachads and then it gets worse.

          Hi Revlar,Author here.Can I ask why you felt that it wasn't leading to political intrigues and subversions?I am angling that way now, but if it wasn't particularly clear, I'd love to know why.

          I kind of wanted the "montage" of his power up to be a surprise, but the reason I put it in there in the first place was to allow the MC to come back as an example of what could be achieved if people embrace the system.

          While he IS level 32 while most are below 10, it should not be un-achievable for many to catch up to him in the near future (especially given his skills had to be learnt from scratch and he's bringing back knowledge of the dungeons and a bunch of crafting recipies).

          If I didn't make that clear tho, that's my fault. Did you find that to be the issue, or was it something else?

          I'm trying to angle for a pre-reveal of how society might end up looking if others can gain similar  powers (it was why I described Glitnir's hall the way I did).

          If you have any advice on how I can do that better, I'd love to hear it, or any other problems that frustrated/annoyed you.

          All feedback is valuable, so thanks for taking the time to reply.

          I'm very much still learning this process.Thanks,Carl.

            I'm gonna apologize for the mean-spirited tone first, because I was being overly sardonic. The comments weren't meant to be read by the author, of course, but I'll try to make my critique clearer. Keep in mind, I don't want to discourage you from writing. You're finding an audience, that audience just doesn't include me.

            Fundamentally, I think you hit the slippery slope of powercreep, *running*. Liam's introductory sentence describes him as "lacking the strength of a man", and "only being able to guide the sawblade". The sentence is good, but it places him on a particular end of the progression fantasy treadmill -The very beginning- and that means he's going to have to go through hardship -*personal hardship*- in order to catch up with the powerhouses of the world he lives in. The reader expects it because that's how stories work, and because you've made an implicit promise. I would say that promise goes unfulfilled.

            To be fair, this setup presents a challenge to your story in particular, because the powerhouses of Liam's world are... adult men trained in combat, with good armor and weapons. Nothing supernatural or fantastic. If you look at other stories, they skip this obstacle, because from the word go their protagonists are aware of higher echelons of supernatural power that they can aim to achieve. Liam only knows men with swords, so the reader expects Liam to grow into a man with a sword, and the obvious way for him to do this is *the slow way*. In this view, second-hand mail is a big step forward. From then on, every step of the way, Liam retains this weakness, feeding that expectation that he's going to have to wait to be strong... until suddenly he loses it overnight when he applies attributes and turns from 13 year old below-average pageboy to ageless gigachad.

            Now, the attributes were a reward for something he did in the story, but they're too plentiful and too effective, and he doesn't really go through hardship to use them. LitRPG stories often use framing to make up for this problem, by having the protagonist add to their attributes in a crisis situation, standing on the knife's edge. The way Liam gets to do it, in the safety of camp, with lots of allies around and no enemies in sight, is the opposite. He essentially presses a button and completely gets over the largest hurdle the story created for him at the very start: His comparative youth and the weakness of his body.

            This is compounded when he later gets multiple new upgrades and abilities, always surrounded by allies, in complete safety. I'll use Cradle as an example, though I don't know if you've read it: There's narrative reasons why Lindon always breaks through to the next level of power while he's fighting his toughest challenge yet. It's many times more satisfying, and works very well to blunt the power-fantasy edge of the power-up, because the character was (presumably) losing.

            As you can see, my criticism is not so much that others cannot catch up to him, but that the way he earns his power-ups shortcuts his progression and undercuts the foundation of his character: If a dreamer who loses track of reality to imagine being a knight doing valorous deeds turns into a knight overnight, they lose the trait of being a dreamer.

            The point about the allies is key to explaining why I say I wanted for it to subvert itself and turn towards political struggle: Liam has too many allies. Every medieval noble he meets is nice and good and worthy of his respect. The only person that's nasty to him is the priest (>!Who turns out to be an actual evil demonic traitor? If I read Duncan's interlude right?!<) There's no real human conflict. When "human conflict" exists, in the form of warfare, the enemy is always irredeemably, blatantly and visually evil. As the other poster said, there's no moral complexity, but not only within Liam, without him too.

            I did figure the story was heading towards a political struggle at the king's castle, but by the time the characters got close to reaching it spatially, I was already sure the struggle would be with evil scheming traitors. Then, Liam became too powerful and too old for the part I expected him to play in that political struggle, turning him into someone who could say "no" to anyone and get away with it. It's an effective power fantasy for some people, but it shortcuts the progression of his character too much for my taste. A coming-of-age, progression fantasy story has to commit to its protagonist's weakness for it to be satisfying, in my opinion.
            ```

              Thanks for the reply! Awesome that you took so much time!

              Don't worry, I know you weren't personally attacking me. I prefer to think of it as your giving an indication of how disappointed you were that I failed to fulfil expectations I created in your experience of my fiction.

              It's all good (though I'm disappointed with myself I didn't do a better job) :)

              I think I understand where we diverge in our taste. (I haven't read Cradle, but will ASAP, thanks for the recommendation!). This story isn't about the attributes, or giga-chading the MC's way to a brute victory. But I'm not sure how to show that except as the story winds down.

              It's a tale of two worlds. The world of men, and the world of the system. As time progresses, the two align to be much more interconnected. For Liam, he is forced to make that choice early, providing an example to the mundane world of man of what is possible, or even simple to gain from the system (the exception being his spirit nexii - effectively western cultivation node).

              Perhaps that - as you say - is a result of me setting expectations and not being clear enough about the two-themes of progress in the world: The mundane vs magical.

              Either way, I'll need to look into coming up with a way of clarifying that point earlier in the novel. Perhaps even as a system message at some point.... I'll have to think on it.

              As for the hardship, it's not as direct as some tales, where the character has to strain against chains of steel. Liam's chains are time and knowledge - or at least that was the intent... which Sir Keith would be pissed I haven't fulfilled :). That was the reason for Liam's angsty entry into the dungeon, and his re-alignment of intent through stoic philosophy.

              When he ground out the 21 levels he gained from the dungeon, it was the result of four years of patient, hard, painful work... with only a spirit to guide him.

              Again. That didn't translate properly, so I'm going to have to take another look.

              If a dreamer turns into a knight overnight, why do they have to dream? Now they can live it... or at least attempt to :).

              For all Liam's amazing powers, he's still an unsocialized 13 year old living with the experience of a 17 year old, and the powers of an near-Achilles. While badass, he's still an idiot when it comes to the realities of the world. This is why he keeps making obvious mistakes, rushing headlong at an idea before he fully considers the implications of his actions.

              As most teens do - especially when offered anything they desire.

              See: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1965679](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1965679)

              :)I'm not merely stating these as rebuttal, but rather to illustrate what I wanted to convey, but somehow didn't.

              This is on me, but if you can see any way to inject that intention into the work, I'm really happy to listen!

              If anything, I probably tore off a bit too much to chew.

              I generally dislike the trope of "action levelling". It implies a familiarity with the new system that allows characters to just throw attributes into "X" and escape the situation.

              It becomes the Force... but not from the original trilogy.... from the Disney trash. It becomes the crutch.

              By having Liam and the other characters level in safety, it forces them to consider who they want to become. When we play an RPG or MMO, we already have some idea what kind of powerhouse we want to grind up to.

              For these guys, who've never heard of an RPG, it's all new. They would try and overcome whatever they encounter the old way, then either succeed or fail. It wouldn't occur to them immediately to use their available attributes to push past their limitations... at least not yet.   


              Perhaps I need someone familiar with the system to be commentating events from at the end of each chapter...

              Hmm....

              That's an idea...

              Thank you :) I wrote a Prologue a while back that introduced another character.... an "auditor" of the system. Perhaps a persepctive change to him assessing the "progress" would give you a better understanding of how weak Liam -and everyone else - still is.

              Perhaps these ideas could be introduced through them... :)

              Thanks! I kinda like that option. I'll look into adding that soon! :)

              As for Cradle, I'll definitely give it a read! Always looking for something new to distract from work.

              Also: As for the traitor and human morality side, it's definitely all there. There are significant moral reasons for Liam to NOT use his power to gigachad his way through the coming events.

              They will drive his character development into new areas. Ones where he learns the world isn't the black and white he thinks it is.... one in particular where the shades of grey make for difficult decisions.

              I'll definitely be revisiting your comments as I continue, so thanks for taking the time to reply. It's a deeply insightful look into where I'm failing to fulfil expectations.

              Thank you for taking so much time, and sorry this wasn't for you. I hope at some time in the future you come back and take another look. Hopefully I will have significantly improved or developed the plot to show where I was taking these ideas.

              With kind regards and gratitude,And best wishes for a Merry Christmas!Carl.

                I anticipated a lot of your response, and look, I know you don't consider it a rebuttal, but it essentially is one. The issue at play is that this is a tale with a protagonist, and a child protagonist at that. It's not an overhead, multi-perspective view of a society modifying itself to fit in a new paradigm. Even then, the story would be better, in my opinion, if Liam's transition from child to pioneer was handled with more care. For example, even though he's "earning" the power of a magical knight and the bloodline of angels, he's doing so while being coddled by people more powerful than him, still. That's clashing themes. You can't earn stuff while being coddled, because then you're just being given things. You can't groom someone into being a system pioneer. He should've been experimenting, breaking through early challenges with grit and his own understanding. He, again, has too many allies, too early on. The reader never really gets to see what makes Liam an independent person.

                I actually think the stoic philosophy thing was some of the worst stuff the story threw into the pot. I'm guessing you're a big fan of the philosophy yourself, because there's a lot of bleed in those chapters. To start, Liam has access to such books despite them not being related to crafting, which already causes some strain. Then, the way he gravitates to the philosophy instead of being repelled in some manner, or struggling to understand it, or understanding it as a step on the path to a different philosophy also rankles. Liam ends up having no personal philosophy, because he absorbs a bunch of old stuff he finds in a book too readily. It's another way in which the story undermines his character and makes him bland, same as the dreamer thing.

                It also harms the worldbuilding to have so many of these super old supernatural beings be so aware of these philosophies, all being good people with no flaws. In the real world, an evil person can become a stoic. In your world, that's impossible because evil acts necessitate you be a raving psycho. I think the only way this development would've been palatable was if the devil army's general was also a stoic.

                And yes, the dreamer thing is undermining his character. Becoming a knight and doing knightly deeds can still be done while being a dreamer if there's a natural progression, but Liam's progression is too unnatural and exposes him to too many facts about his reality that other people don't know. It carves away the aprt of his character that's a dreamer and replaces it with... bland stuff. It turns him into a harbinger, not a coming-of-age protagonist, and that undermines him as a coming-of-age protagonist. And the thing with harbingers is that there's only 2 kinds that work: The ones that earned it and the accidental ones, and as I said before, Liam didn't earn it, and he's definitely not there by accident, so he's stuck in this bland wish-fulfillment trap.

                Beyond that, your critique of action levelling is valid, but that wasn't my main point. Framing is key, and you provided a framing that makes Liam's transformation a win button against his early personal struggles. There needed to be something there adding pathos. The character feels like he's unraveling into a collection of power-fantasy tropes and medieval fan service, and losing any essence of grounded realism. Just the fact that he manages to speedrun his way to being 17 in 3 days is absurd, especially since it will force people to treat him like an adult. It would have made mountains more sense to prevent him from ageing during the 4 years. The coming-of-age framing of the story gets torn down in a montage, without any resolution or payoff.

        Wow. Pretty harsh comment, but I'm glad you didn't pull the punches :).  
        Author here. Sorry you think it sucks ass. I'm going to be cutting this down to about 150k words when I edit (my usual process, so will likely be pulling sections that I found interesting, but didn't necessarily drive the story or character development forward). I'm just wondering what you consider a "Good" novel that does the things I suck at well.  
        I'm always trying to improve, so any guidance on how to develop that moral complexity and limit the narration of fight scenes would be great. The reason I wrote Liam as a morally static individual early on is because he's 13.  
        I don't know how I'd write moral complexity into a character who starts their story with zero agency, but if you have any Ideas I'd love to know.  
        As to the fight scenes. Thanks. I'll take it under advisement.   
        Same deal as before, if there's something you've seen similar where a character is in a similar situation that you think is great, please let me know.   
        I'd love to give it a read and see if I can tone-down the narration while still getting the impact I want.  
        Made me laugh at that part about the cartoon though :) that's kinda a dick punch, even for reddit reviews :)  
        Anyway, thanks for leaving a comment! Appreciate the feedback.

          Glad you're taking it so well, but just to be clear stories like you've written can be good and successful.  This is mostly a commentary on my own taste, and the likely tastes of people in this subreddit.

          That said, *if* you decide to add moral complexity to the early story, you don't have to change the main characters much to do it.

          Right now, characters who have more than a few lines of dialogue seem to fall into two categories:

          1.  Good people who like and are helpful to the main characters and who always manage to succeed in the end (so far, at least).

          2. Bad people who are mean and hostile to the main characters whose plots fail like tissue paper the moment they face resistance from the main characters (that priest rebellion thing was pretty bad).

          This clear separation of good and bad people is more responsible for the "Saturday Morning" feel than the kids' own actions.

          If you gave the priest some redeeming qualities or gave some negative traits to Lord Douglas and his knights, that would change the tone a lot.  Even if the kids are still Very Good Boys who do whatever their lord says, it can set up moral conflicts for later and show readers that the story won't be just be "Pure Good vs Pure Evil".  Having the demonic forces actually just be pure evil is fine, though.

          You can look at the first three Harry Potter books for an example.  The characters are about 13 by the end, but still have some slightly morally complex situations.  

          Book 1: Snape is an entire bag of dicks so they think he's the bad guy.  Turns out he was on their side.

          Book 2: Malfoy is an entire bag of dicks so they think he's the bad guy, turns out it was a possessed diary. 

          Book 3:  The big scary escaped prisoner is actually innocent, the main characters have to fight against the government and the guy who was actually good in the first book to help him.

          The characters are always just trying their best, but there's some small amount of complexity around them.

          Also I'd warn against writing a litrpg story with intelligence/wisdom type stats.  It only takes a few dozen chapters before you suddenly have to write an inhumanly super-intelligent character.  That's really hard to write.  At that point, any tiny flaw in reasoning or a plan isn't a mistake on the character's part, but a plot hole from the author.

          Charisma has the same problem in stories where the stat isn't just mind control.  None of us are good enough with words to write dialogue for someone who has 200+ Charisma.

          I know that's probably not great advice for this stage in your story, but something to watch out for in the future.  Maybe you can show that those stats have diminishing returns after a certain point?

    Hi Ricardias,

    Author of Echoes of the Tribulation here.

    Just wanted to say a huge thanks for your kind words! Really great to hear you enjoyed the story so far! Please feel free to let me know if anything there didn't resonate particularly well for you. I'm always trying to learn, so any help from you - beyond the 40 or so followers and their feedback you've already gifted me - would be awesome.

    With deep gratitude,

    Carl.

  I recently started reading [Demesne](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne), a story about establishing a new colony in a world where light itself causes the Iridescence, extremely toxic crystals that grow on everything. The only way to get rid of them is by either washing them with running water, or establishing a Dungeon/Demesne, which has a radius around which the Iridescence cannot form. It has a refreshingly unique magic system and a focus on building a functional colony. Despite the use of the word "dungeon," it is *not* a dungeon core story nor a LitRPG. I always feel like I'm terrible at describing stories, but give it a try.

    Demesne had great earlier tension with the whole Deathworld opening, but then the author gets too into slice of life, forgets what made the story engaging in the first place, and nothing of note ever happens again.

  New good RoyalRoad story:

  Binged through the highly recommended new RR novel, [The Last Orrellan](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46901/the-last-orellen) and absolutely loved it.

  My favorite aspect of it is the MC's relationship with his family. 

  Spoilers. 

  >!I greatly appreciate though the MC might be forced to leave his family at some in an effort to pursue his passion for magic, the weight of being separated from his family for many years when he's still at an extremely young age is something that weigh on him. He calculates the time it'd take to even reach a place where he could try to learn more magic and just how long he'd be away from his family and younger sister. How if he left he might only ever be a stranger to his younger sister. He wouldn't be able to be the brother always there for her.

  >!It isn't an easy decision for him to make and it's a decision he'll have to make himself. Unlike other protagonists he doesn't have the cop-out of a prophecy that "forces" or basically forces (world will die if you don't help) to make the decision for him. If anything in this case the landscape would suggest that would be that it'd be safer for him to stay where he is with his family. If he wants to pursue magic he'd have to put himself in danger and leave his family.

  >! Then again as I type this I'm guessing this problem is probably solved through the fact that he has a very strong chance of being able to use spatial magic and he might learn that in the near future. That way the MC might not have to make a real choice between their pursuit of magic and leaving their family. A easy somewhat cop out of a solution to a seemingly difficult problem. Still I appreciate the fact that this is an issue for him and that he doesn't jump at the first chance to just leave that he encounters. 

  Does anyone have any good recommendations for fantasy/scifi coming of age type of stories with an MC that has a strong relationship with their family? Characters that don't fade into the background through the story? As in even if the MC has to separate at some point the family stays relevant? Maybe in things like teachings or values they try to instill on the MC?

  One example that comes to mind is the MC in [Cold Iron](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30344847-cold-iron). It's been a very long time, but I somewhat remember the MC having a fairly strong relationship with his family. In that even when separated from them, they existed in the back of his mind and came up somewhat often in how the MC thought and saw the world. 

  Also side note, never read the books in the series that came after Cold Iron even though I adored the first. I heard it was a grave disappointment from someone who read it and and I didn't want to spoil my view on the first book. Would you say that the second and third books are good?

    I liked the entire trilogy and I rate it highly, but I can understand why someone might not. Miles Cameron has a recurring issue in his stories where he switches the focus from characters to plot and exposition as the story progresses.

    The Cold Iron trilogy(Masters and Mages) is a good example of this, and so is his most recent book [Artifact Space](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56097208-artifact-space). I'm both he sets up a character-driven story beautifully, and then at some point pivots into an epic plot-driven story and kind of leaves the character's arc by the wayside. 

    Still great books, but I can understand why someone might get whiplash from the transition. And I still strongly rec the rest of the trilogy. It's quality writing and has a great ending.

    Not exactly coming of age, but [Ar'Kendrythist](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) has the best father-daughter relationship I've seen in fiction. The protagonist is the father, and seeing him support his daughter through thick and thin, and just be a really good father is very wholesome. Highly recommend the series, even if it has a few bumps in the beginning. 

    As for the second and third book for Masters and Mages trilogy, I'd say that as someone who loves the coming of age part of the first book, I wasn't fulfilled. It went more into action and epic fantasy than keeping the core of what made the first book good. I stopped reading about 20% through the third book.

  I'll have access to kindle unlimited at some point in the next few weeks, and am wondering what people in this part of the internet have to recommend there.

  I enjoy several of the "classics" of this subreddit (Worm, MoL), but had a hard time getting into others (Worth the Candle, Practical Guide to Evil).  It's hard for me to articulate exactly why I didn't get into those, but the gist is that the elements of the characters and drama that the authors focused on were elements that were not compelling to me personally.

  And here's a recommendation for others, though it's been mentioned here before.  Of all the ongoing fiction I've been getting into, [Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that)  is my favorite.  It's a reconstruction of Generic Trashy Isekai, from the perspective of someone dragged from earth to be the "villain" counterpart to the Isekai'd "hero."

  The main character is a prickly little asshole, but decent enough where it counts that it's easy enough to root for him.  Miles more interesting than your standard generic Isekai protagonist.

    *Dungeon Crawler Carl* is not rational, but it's exceptionally good popcorn fiction with earlier chapters being available on Kindle Unlimited and the later ones still published on RR (might have been paywalled as well, though; Patreon gets updates rather frequently, but RR hasn't been updated in a month).

    DCC is fantastic for one sole reason: the author is a master at setting up some plot hooks, resolving them in a satisfying manner, but creating more hooks in a process. It's a never-ending ride where you never can get bored—there's sooo much intrigue for a LitRPG!

      It's also really damn funny! In a really sad way, but sometimes the author is so good at making fun of something brutal that you can't help but laugh. One of my favorites is this (mild spoilers for first book).

  A few random stories I didn't regret reading:

  [The Devil's Dark Remnant](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39156/the-devils-dark-remnant-an-urban-progression-fantasy). A pretty fun urban fantasy. It's not too heavy on the progression factor yet so don't go in expecting that, but it's worth a look if you're into the whole urban masquerade aesthetic.

  [Planetary Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47931/planetary-cultivation). Found this thoroughly enjoyable for its depiction of a believable way modern society might react to cultivation suddenly becoming a thing, as well as what the slow and meandering march of the Science of Cultivation might look like.

  [Enduring Good](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46709/enduring-good-the-rationalists-guide-to-cultivation). Gorgeous art, very high effort. Has a truly interesting ambiance to it. It's an experience.

  [Unliving](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47959/unliving) feels a bit like a published fantasy novel. Notable for its depiction of the wrath of a truly powerful necromancer - real fun if you're into that sort of thing.

  ***The Crown***

  This has been out for awhile, I finally started watching it a week ago, at which point I started binging the first three seasons.

  It's a great series with high production values, interesting characters, and excellent acting. The only problem I have is with how it treats historical events. While is gets the broad strokes right, quite a few details are dramatized for the sake of the story. There are a few episodes, like *Aberfan*, *Coup*, *Moondust*, where the show portrays events almost the opposite of what actually happened (I was really disappointed with how they portrayed Aldrin, Collins and Armstrong as fighter jocks who didn't have an original thought between them). Still, it's a great show, definitely worth picking up.

  ***Fleabag*** by SomeoneToForget

  An interesting litRPG about a dog who, through some luck of genetics, unlocks its ancestry as a wolf, which had been bred out of existence by human who wanted tamer dogs. The story follows the dog as it slowly becomes sapient and tries to understand its place in the world.

  The writing is pretty good. No obvious grammatical mistakes, and the writer is good at describing anatomy (which is important here).

  The characters are interesting. It's kinda slow, since the MC is a dog just that "awoke," but it is starting to pick up.

  The world is basically the bottom of a city that is polluted with some sort of magic by-product. It's essentially a giant trash pit, with an actual trash pit under it. It's interesting and well-described.

  ***Kitty Cat Kill Sat*** by argusthecat

  A cat is uplifted and turned into a genius. Unfortunately, she's also the sole survivor on an ancient space station that is probably haunted. She's taken on the role of an overseer for Earth, which has undergone some sort of apocalypse, trying to keep things from falling apart (by blowing things up).

  It's very well-written. No grammatical errors I can recall. The author focuses on the MC being introspective, so there's a lot of internal dialogue that seems to break the 4th wall, but it flows nicely. Like Fleabag above, it focuses on internal dialogue (at first) since there's no one else to talk to, and the MC doesn't have vocal chords capable of speech anyways.

  The setting is basically the space station. It feels unique, well-described, and fairly real, given the story, but it is a bit constraining (obviously in space you can't really expand, so I'd give this a pass).

  As far as the characters go, the MC is a cat with super-intelligence. Aside from the reminders that she can't speak and doesn't have thumbs, she sounds a lot like a human. The author does do a good job of describing her emotions, from the sadness and despair she feels at being alone, how she hates the nutritional pellets and wants to nap in the sun, to how the solitude has affected her mental state.

  Reccing the anime and manga Blue Period, it's about a young rational japanese man finding a passion for art and diving into it. Abandoning the safe rational university choices to pursue his interest. 

  &#x200B;

  It's great, the manga is better at teaching about art, but the anime is better at making grown men cry, although the manga has managed to pull it off with me, which is quite impressive (the mother scene / chapter fucked me up). 

  &#x200B;

  Anyway it's really good and you should check it out. The anime just ended and it was great, with a lot less depth than the manga, but better pacing. Both are great though so take your pick.

  Random request, I'd like to see examples of subtle magic.

   For example, in the anime Detective Conan, which is mostly a non supernatural detective serial, the main character has the ability to know when people are spying on him, or looking at him with malicious intent.
  Another example is in the Harry Potter fanfic [The Wastelands of Time](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time), where Harry has the ability to always know what time it is, and how much time has passed.
  Or in yugioh, where the protagonist has a gaming instinct, or uses the power of the legendary millennium puzzle... To manipulate the probability of drawing a particular card, or when rolling dice.

  For some reason I find that these 'subtle magics' are really fun. I'd love to see more examples of them

    I do also like when characters have small or underwhelming powers, though I think this is actually somewhat rare in stories.

    The TV show [Misfits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misfits_(TV_series) depicts a group of juvenile delinquents that gain powers and very much do not become heroes. The powers are neither powerful nor not powerful, they are things like being ignored to the point where the character is effectively invisible to a powerful time power over which the character has little control. One later character can control lactose, for example. It's stylish and kind of silly in a serious way, I quite enjoyed it back when it came out.

    There is a classic adventure / RPG game, DOS era, that really embraces the weak power thing: [Superhero League of Hoboken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_League_of_Hoboken). If you have a taste for old games, it actually fairly playable, but people seem to have wildly varying tolerances for old games. You are in charge of a (very) minor league group of superheroes, I'll put their names and powers at the end of the post since I feel like it will entertain people here. You can find a good overview of the game on the [Digital Antiquarian](https://www.filfre.net/2020/08/superhero-league-of-hoboken/

    Any traditional *Gundam*. The Newtypes have a weird kind of empathy which is part emotional, part hyper-intellectual and part prophetic.

    Most Practise from Wildbow's Otherverse needs to be relatively subtle. The system of the Masquerade exists because the Spirits that make up the entire world are invested in keeping it, and so breaching that masquerade, or even just making it harder to keep it up, is frowned upon. So unless Practitioners fight away from prying eyes, most Practise tends to be disrupting connections (making people not notice you), glamour (shape-changing, but it always leaves a tell), or a magical rope that lets you teleport line-of-sight as long as no one's watching you. One of the characters in Pale specializes in Finder magic, which has the Practitioner visit dream-like realms called Paths, which follow their own, strange logic and rules. Completing these Paths grants minor boons, such as making you slightly better at navigating traffic (at the cost of being more easily annoyed when you're not the one driving) or more resistant to annoying noise like baby cries and dogs barking (while also making it more likely to occur around you). The [Text of the Finders](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ti2MftECN9PloDlHdjTGlMbwXPxf0GGOyNl-c4OYKCs/edit) and the [Falling Oak Avenue](https://old.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/hp8xmw/pale_reflections_stolen_away_4/fy8jyl6/) should give some impression of that Practise.

    Of course, when there are no unaware humans around (or when you're certain you can "deal with" any witnesses...) people pull out heavier stuff: Elemental attacks, goblin weapons, or summoned slasher horror movie monsters also exist in that universe.

  Trying to be spoiler-free...

  So a few weeks ago EY mentioned [SSS-Class Suicide Hunter](https://reaperscans.com/series/sss-class-suicide-hunter). And I have a bit of a quibble with the protag's character development. So he gets his first skill because he was apparently the most jealous / covetousness player in the entire tower. And after a couple "upgrades", this is seemingly no longer a problem?  He's mostly selfless, and trying to do the right thing most of the time, and is somewhat clever about doing that.

  Sure, he's seeking power still, and looks for opportunities to gain power using his special skill, but beyond that, he's a pretty well-adjusted guy?  His initial moves against that one jerk guy early on may have drastically adjusted his attitude, but we don't see his character growth.

  Still, it is a fun concept, and I enjoyed reading it.

  **Edit:** grammar.

    I think the LN has a bit more of that.  It goes into more detail about him being traumatized/disgusted enough by the true nature of his former idol that he updates to doing the inverse of whatever the flame emperor would.

    That's *technically* all in the manga, but it skips and skims over things (like the part where he kills himself 4000 times).
    ...On the other hand, he really wanted a great skill, and he got it, so if you just take the earlier character at his word...  problem solved!  He has the thing he was envious of, now he can afford to be generous!  (Mostly facetious.)

    There's some good character development in the martial arts world, anyway, that links into his greed and greed- or desire- universally, along the lines of understanding the desperate, hopeless, excruciating desire (starvation, death by thirst, death by drowing etc.), which is, I think, an obvious elaboration of his initial motivation.

  I’d like to recommend the TV series “The Great” which is on Hulu. It’s a historical comedy / drama.

  It is loosely based on Catherine the great of Russia, her coup and the goings on of the court. And when I say loosely, I mean loosely. The show describes itself as “an occasionally true story.” 

  The general vibe of the show is if Game of Thrones was crossed with a pretty funny rom-com. It currently has two seasons each of which is 10 episodes long. Each episode is ~50 mins long.

  I have a recommendation and a request.

  Recommendation: [Millennial Mage](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47826/millennial-mage). It's has a fairly rational world and protagonist, that focuses on Tala, a freshly graduated Mage who's trying to make her way in life, and get out of crushing debt. Tala's actions and the world itself feel thought out, for example: Iron blocks magic, and so people use iron weapons to fight mages and magical beasts. Spoiler: >!Tala also knows this, and uses an iron salve to coat her body to prevent magical attacks. There are reasons that not everyone can do this, which are explained in the first few chapters.!<

  For the request, is there anything someone has read or watched that helps them make better stories?

  I’ll give a rec: if you haven’t been on this sub for years and years, it’s worth searching “Monday” on this sub and going through old threads. 


  I found quite a few stories to add to my TBR (which is just a tab group on my phone full of fuckin tabs hahaha). 



  I’ll also rec Brockton’s Celestial Forge. If you like “numbers go up” LitRPG, this is the no numbers/progression fantasy equivalent. I skim everything to do with him describing/digesting powers, generally there *are* some tidbits worth pulling out of them, but I just check the SV posts to see if anything noteworthy is being discussed that I have no idea about. Usually there’s nothing. 


  It’s my only experience with Worm and I think the characterization/writing is absolutely top notch. 



  If you’ve read worm and you need/want to see canon progression, don’t read BCF. It’s >1mil words and hasn’t gotten to Leviathan’s attack yet. But it’s a huge weekly guilty pleasure of mine and I haven’t seen it rec’d before.

        I’m imagining an editor by trade who gets their rocks off by editing down BCF in their free time. The story has gone like 3 weeks in a million words. Absolute bananas. There’s got to be whole chapters they would just delete. Imagine if the Bakuda fight wasn’t 250k words. I’m dying thinking about this 😂😂🤷🏼‍♂️

    I had fun with it, but haven’t been actively following it since around 700k words.

    You definitely have to be ok with a more slice of life vibe, but I liked it a lot better than other OP character worm stories like Taylor varga which also drag on for a while.

      To be honest with the sheer amount of words produced dropping for a few months is probably a good thing. You can skim all of the power descriptions/shit and get a few days of progress in the story 🤷🏼‍♂️😂

        ```
        I mean, the last 13,000 word chapter was the main character ordering a drink. Progress is not a word I'd really think of when reading BCF.  
        edit: Ah, BavarianBarbarian mentioned this.

  There was an old online chaptered story that was World War I esque, with mages being used as the artillery equivalent, which was posted here a couple of years back. I think there was smuggling of wands and conscription I want to say?

    This one? Has WWI mage-artillery/mage bombers, got linked a couple times, but no smuggling of wands I think.

      There is a minor subplot about hiding banned military-grade computation orbs.

      Its not the one that I'm looking for sorry also that's like post WWI. I also think it was original fiction rather than fan fiction, and also was recommended closer to five years back than not.

        That fanfiction was based off of a light novel (and manga) set during WWI: [Youjo Senki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saga_of_Tanya_the_Evil)

        From [what I can tell](https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/#{%22subreddit%22:%22rational%22,%22resultSize%22:100,%22query%22:%22youjo%20senki%22}), it was first recommended here back in 2017.

  If folks here haven't read The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu, get on it. I'm not exaggerating when I say I think it's among the best, smartest, most philosophically engaging sci-fi books ever written. There's also a [free podcast serialization](https://podcastaddict.com/episode/125764195) of the audiobook, for some reason.

  I'm halfway through the sequel now, which is just as good and benefits from what I feel is a more poetic translation. I'm consistently amazed at Liu's insight and depth of vision.

    I really didn't like those stories, and want to offer a counter perspective. I saw them recommended constantly but thought that they were unimaginative and philosophically... droll? might be the best word. A complete lack of interesting or engaging characters and a weird yet also unintriguing plot and sci-fi world.
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      It's pretty obvious from the fact that I recommended them, but I strongly disagree. I thought book one contained both top tier mysteries (why are scientists killing themselves? What is Three Body?) and compelling character arcs (Wang learning about >!Trisolaris and the ETO!<, Ye regaining her >!access to science & becoming so disgusted with humanity that she betrays it!<)

      I can see what you mean about its droll-ness. The book presents everything in a very matter-of-fact way, without stylish prose or grand reveals. For me, book 1 felt like Liu was methodically building a tower, and I enjoyed watching him build. He definitely doesn't have a flair for the dramatic, but the tranquil & measured presentation of interesting ideas was compelling to me.
      ```

      - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
        ```
        I also recommend these books, but I have to agree that character work isn't their strongest suit. But that feels like saying Asimov's Foundation doesn't have great characters: It's true, but it's not what the book set out to do.
        ```

    The author sort of supports genocide, so that might justify the controversial mark you're seeing. It doesn't show up for me though.

      ```
      Yeah the tag is gone. I hadn't known that, but just did a bit of reading & it seems like he basically parrots the party line, which is... ethically troubling, but also super understandable for a Chinese national living in China with a lot of Western acclaim. If I were him I would probably not criticize the CCP either.
      ```

        > If I were him I would probably not criticize the CCP either.

        Agreed. Specially with how things have been lately.
