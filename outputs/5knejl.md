## [RT][FF][C] The Last Ringbearer (1999)

### Post:

Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Ringbearer) on the book.

English translation available [here](http://www.tenseg.net/press/lastringbearer).

It was already submitted here, but since it was 3 years ago, and this sub is much bigger now, I decided to repost it.

  Well. I really liked The Last Ringbearer, and I read it in english.

  I remember reading about 40% of it and not liking it very much, partially because it turned into a spy thriller, and I'm not really interested in spy thrillers, partially because it was advertised as (and maybe intended by the author to be) something smarter and more mature, maybe even *better* than lotr and that... made it all the more unpleasant when it turned out to be kind of meh. I wasn't a fan. It's not even that Tolkien is all that sacred to me, but I still felt bad for him.

    You saw the wrong advertisement then :) At least in Russian, it was always known as part spy fiction, what with the author drawing inspiration from [Aquarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium_(Suvorov\)).

  When I read *The Last Ringbearer* a few years ago, I was very strongly reminded of my experiences with Project Gutenberg's translations of *[The Three Musketeers](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257)* and of [that book's several later sequels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Artagnan_Romances) (collectively titled *[The Vicomte de Bragelonne](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2609)*, but usually split into several parts). *The Three Musketeers* consists primarily of action, while *The Vicomte de Bragelonne* focuses significantly more on court intrigue.

  I found *The Vicomte de Bragelonne* to be rather boring (in comparison to *The Three Musketeers*, at the very least)--but how much of that was due to the slow story, and how much was due to the poor translation? Likewise, I found *The Last Ringbearer* to be *extremely* boring (IIRC), and completed it only on my second or third attempt (IIRC). Was that the fault of the author or the fault of the translator?

    I liked it in Russian just fine, but nobody I know has ever expressed a positive opinion about the English translation, and when I read the first few pages of that, I found them to be extremely pretentious in a way that the original somehow avoided.

    I honestly don't know. The book was very enjoyable for me in Russian, I even reread it more than a few times, but I haven't read it in English.
