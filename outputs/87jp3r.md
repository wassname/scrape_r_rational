  Calculating lens shapes is doable if you know snell's law and have a good way of solving differential equations numerically. But even if you know the perfect shape, you'll often notice that spherical lenses are much easier to produce.
  Iirc the biggest telescopes don't even use lenses, they use parabolic mirrors to get an image. Something worth considering, I suppose?

  Magic crystals are not birefringent, are they?

    I still don't even know how coal makes heat, don't ask me

    I would say that Snell's law is known but numerical solvers are still beyond them.  Currently, the University focuses more on empiricism than mathematics, even if Cato is recruiting some mathematicians.

  I always like reading A Hero's War for how far it goes to describe modern Earth technologies combining with rules-based magic. I appreciate all this effort thinking this stuff up.

  Thanks for this.

    I cannot rightly claim credit for the idea of using cooling spells instead of heating spells for heat engines.  

    That comes from here: http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=124435&sid=04785fde612c68d5d110ff5fd85dbbe4

    Where I asked a question about heat engine design assuming magic in this story as the fuel.  Though I was thinking more of the airplane version (which wouldn't have coal, instead running on pure magic since coal has weight and compressed magic does not).  

    Credit to gmalivuk, Zamfir and Tub for provoking the original idea that a "cold" engine was more efficient than a "hot" engine.
