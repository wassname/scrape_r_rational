## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Suppose you had a slider that could trade off mental acuity / intelligence against conscientiousness / diligence / executive function. Specifically, it is calibrated against the current global population, and operates on a quantile scale -- you start off at the median of each trait, and any increase in the quantile of one is met by an equal and opposite decrease in the quantile of the other (i.e. their sum is constrained to 1 or 100). So you can make yourself very smart and very lazy, rather dim but quite hard-working, etc. You can only do this once, and it affects as yet "unmalleable" aspects of each trait, but you can still adopt compensatory strategies to make up for what shortcomings present themselves. Where would you plop yourself? The slider tops out at making you just a smidge smarter than the smartest person on earth + just a bit lazier than the laziest person on earth, or vice-versa.

  (also, on an unrelated note, my PI just told me that I'd gotten an NIH T15 lol -- despite me playing 0 role in the application process. Easiest free money I've ever received! haha)

    Congratulations on the grant!

    The sliders and their traits are very difficult for me to think about, you need to know: population levels and distributions of traits, what that would look like in an individual, and how that would effect your individual life.

    Intelligence is relatively easy: IQ starting at 100, low elasticity, maxing at 229 at 100% (by my quick Google search). We've all experienced people who just seem naturally smarter, able to retain, apply, and learn things faster so 229 IQ I imagine as becoming millionaire pro-athlete natural levels of those traits. Read the book once and quote most of it, know it's inconsistencies vs other theories, etc.

    Diligence is much harder. I have no idea what the baseline level looks like or how it drops. +100% would be better than intense buddhist monks: able to happily live in austere environments, and burn themselves to death for what they think is right without flinching. I don't even know what that would look like applied to modern life. Would I be perfectly executing conscious ideas all the time? Could I think "be content" like the monks using my super will? Would people here consider that wire heading?

    I'm leaning towards extremely high diligence, intelligence is massively over rated. Just keeping IQ above like 80 wouldn't be a huge problem(~10% of population below that point). IIRC 70+ people are societally functional and <1% of the population is below 60. This is also hard to picture since I believe low IQ equals low diligence in real life, long term planning and conscientiousness are pretty nerdy, and low IQ is typically the result of wide reaching problems.

    From what I have seen, when it comes to accomplishing goals, diligence can stand in for intelligence. That is to say, a very diligent person with average intelligence can accomplish goals as well as a very lazy person of above-average intelligence.

    So. We have three major potential states under consideration here; average intelligence with average diligence, poor intelligence with excellent diligence, or excellent intelligence with poor diligence.

    It may well be that all of these are approximately equivalent in terms of accomplishing desired goals. Or perhaps desired goals are the product of diligence and intelligence, in which case the best goal-accomplishment point is average intelligence with average diligence.

    However, goal *accomplishment* is only *half* of the question under consideration; after all, you can only accomplish the goals that you first set. And goal *setting* is weighted much more towards intelligence. Doing your due diligence will help to avoid certain traps in your goal-setting, of course, but it's a long way from all that is necessary.

    ...so, I think I'd go with about +80% to intelligence; this doesn't torpedo diligence completely, but still improves my odds of picking and accomplishing good goals.

    It seems quite simple to me, just pick optimal intelligence level and hire employees to do the work. Hire some filipino virtual worker, even if you're broke that'd be doable starting out.

    &#x200B;

    What optimal intelligence is depends on the focus and current goal you are optimizing for. Initially you'd likely want money, so you'd optimize around that. After you've enough money to sustain yourself then you analyze what the next optimal action should be.

    &#x200B;

    Is it maximizing money and use it constructively to improve the world, is it scientific innovation  and optimization in that area to achieve a physics breakthrough for instance, or maybe even it's getting enough money so you can design, build and prototype a revolutionary piece of tech. 

    &#x200B;

    After you just continue optimizing..

  I got my first shot of Moderna today! In just a short six-ish weeks it will be time for me to forcibly overcome my newfound nigh-pathological fear of the city outdoors! It already aches like heck, though. Seriously, way worse than the flu shot.

      My doctor also recommended I move my arm to reduce soreness when I got my tetanus shot. That's the only reason I knew. And I didn't even really know, I just assumed that that's how things worked for vaccines in general.

      Indeed, my arm. I wasn't aware that working the muscle reduces the pain! Thanks for the tip.

    It's pretty good so far, bookmarked!

    Will this be a grimdark story where the character is constantly surviving by the skin of their teeth in hopeless positions, like Worm? Those stories are not to my taste, personally speaking.

  [Pushing It](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=2fe3172d2b9fe684977d184f1b6226d5) \- The Best Short Puzzling Game You will Ever Play!

  It's short with only 12 levels, but unlike most other games where they baby you by taking several levels to introduce each new mechanic, this game ramps up the difficulty and creative puzzle design at a very quick pace. Each level requires multiple insights into how to beat it which is impressive considering how short and small each level is.

  Why am I posting it to here? Because I figured you guys liked using your brains and this really is one of the best short games I have ever played.
