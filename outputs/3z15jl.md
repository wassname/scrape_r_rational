## Dark Fantasy

### Post:

Having been reading Dungeon Keeper Ami I'm now in search of something to read set in a Dark Fantasy world. By that I mean full of withces, warlocks, imps, tortures, brutality, being awfull to people, maybe vampires etc. Not necessarily all of them, for example for me the first Doom qualifies as a Dark Fantasy. In particular I would love to find a consistent world, as I'm usually more intresting in the setting then in characters.  Somwhere were it make sense to commit dark rituals and you are not constaly guessing how come a single guy could built this mega dungeon where he tortures dozen of people and none of the villagers ever noticed.

Let's disucss Dark Fantasy.

  I'm in the middle of reading the Mistborn novels right now, so I'm very biased, but it kind of sort of fits your bill? The first book really sets the stage: "Mistborn: The Final Empire". It takes place in a super-dystopia literally ruled by a god-like tyrant. The setting is very dark, and the book has its fair share of brutality, but I don't know if it's quite as dark as you want. The author does not dodge to avoid gore or horror, but at the same time the novel does follow a hero...

  However, I will say that Brandon Sanderson (the author) is one of the most *superb* world-builders. Everything makes sense and is touched on at nearly every level - for example, how the magic affects politics, society, culture, all the way down to the layman. I won't go into the details here, but... gosh. I'm midway through the second book and I'm only glad I waited until after college finals to pick this up because I don't know how I would have managed otherwise.

  If you haven't already heard of it and discarded it, I would highly recommend checking them out.

    I read the first two books of that series. I admit I really liked how the stuff in his world was connected and made sense, the reason I didn't read the third book is... Well you are still reading the second no reason to spoiler it for you.


    Also reading his book made me think of the  Orson Scott Card's book about how to write fantasy.

  I've quite enjoyed the writing of Joe Abercrombie. It's more gritty than dark but the characters are pretty morally grey and no one does anything for the sake of it.

  One example of Dark Fantasy I like is Warhammer Fantasy. It have all osrt of crazy elements most turned to eleven. Unfortunately it relies on the rule of cool to keep going and the lack of a single book or series makes it really hard to explore.

    Well on that note there's [Wishful Thinking, a 40k SI.](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wishful-thinking-40k-si.359714/) Though it's more muchkinry with free awesome powers than it is rationalist.

    I'm honestly rather confused that it doesn't have more readers actually.

        I personally liked [Shinji and Warhammer40K](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ShinjiAndWarhammer40K) much more than Thousand Shinji. It's very well written and very enjoyable to read.

          Well, until it trails off into incoherence in the latter chapters.  I loved the beginning and middle.

  Not sure this qualifies but I'll throw it out there anyways. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22500562-fimbulwinter has witches. It's about a guy transported to another version of earth by a goddess. An earth that's starting to go into an ice age as the gods are going to war. She wants him to be her champion. The mechanics of the transportation let him pick his magical affinities. It's far more munchkiny/wish-fulfillment than rational. Also tons of sex. Oh yah I should mention that it has a harem.

    Started reading it. Usualy self insert and harem is a sign of a bad book, but so far it seems good enough.

      It's by the same guy that wrote time braid, so i would expect good action and worldbuilding.
