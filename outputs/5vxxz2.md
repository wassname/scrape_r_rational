## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Is it sensible and possible in the general case to separate your emotional connection to a topic from your reaction to it?

  My grandmother recently had a health scare. We still don't know how it's going to end; it could be a pacemaker, a "not fit for surgery", or a "we did what we could". Based on her history and my layman's understanding of the medical facts of her situation, she's probably going to end up in a very similar position to her starting point (which is to say, a remaining lifespan measured in months or years rather than decades).

  But the probabilities aren't informing my reaction. It doesn't feel like she's going to be okay, it feels like an ominous premonition of doom. Obviously this feeling is unrelated to the likelihoods of each outcome, which I lack the knowledge to reliably estimate. My gut almost certainly does not have mystical predictive abilities (and even if it did, I would have no way to know until I tested it). I can't trust it any more than I could trust it yesterday, when it thought things were alright.

  I intend to ignore my emotional response. I want to preserve my grandmother's memory and make sure she knows how much I love her, and neither of these goals is served by being an anxious wreck. I can make this decision now in part because I have already worked through the involuntary reaction element (at least to the extent that I can detect).

  Would eliminating this response be desirable, if it was even possible? In this case it seems benign, though I can see how an aversion to loss could be deleterious, but I think I would have come to the same decision even without the emotional response. It's practically mandated by my ethical philosophy to minimise death, and if that is not possible to minimise losses (information, emotional health, etc.) due to death.

  I find it hard to reason about how my reasoning would function in the absence of emotional impulses. Many dystopian stories make it out to be a negative thing—tying emotion to ethics implicitly—but that seems a little nonsensical. Something doesn't become good just because it feels good, nor become bad because it feels bad. Judging people who have fallen short of your moral ideals feels good, but rarely actually prevents the behaviour. If people were actually ruled by their feelings, society would be worse than the worst dystopian story.

    I personally think emotions should be advisors, not dictators. When I find myself reacting emotionally in an undesirable manner, I try to go "I'll take that under advisement" and then, I dunno, let go? It's almost, like, pretending to be a nihilist for a few seconds, accepting and even hoping that nothing matters, and then once I'm stone, it's easy to see the demarcation line between emotions and everything else, and I try and keep the connection points in mind as I gently let my own normal thought processes into place. 

    The method used in HPMOR of imagining where the situation went as bad as possible, I agonized over it for fifty years, then wished I had the chance to do it over, and, poof, wish granted, is highly useful for these sorts of situations, imo. 

    But anyway, to answer the prompt, I do think that emotions are important to the process, if only for emulating how others feel about the situation. I would be okay with being an emotional robot, but only if I had some way of accurately emulating others around me--it wouldn't do to be a Quirrel constantly beset by Hermiones on all sides. 

    But even if everyone was emotional robots, I think *something* would be missing. 

     I think that emotions are important motivators; it's easy to put long hours in when you're passionate or angry over an important problem, or to escape to your sympathy long after your body has lost patience with something, but they must be augmentors, not originators. Use your mechanical, logical brain to come to a conclusion, then come up a way to ride your emotions *to* that conclusion.

    Sorry for the wall of brain vomit.

    (General disclaimer: this is advice given from a stranger so please take everything with a grain of salt)

    I think it would be hard, in the abstract, to have the *instinctual* reaction of being able to react in the best way possible (i.e. optimal) to distressing news.

    Humans can get upset, and that's sort of how we're built.

    However, I definitely think we can work past our emotions. It sounds like your situation is one where you can see that merely being upset won't help things. 

    In this case, if you've already identified things you can do to help, given what you know, I think your choice to ignore the overwhelming emotional tide here might be good.

    In general, though, I think that emotional responses play a strong role in extending the dimensions of human experience (except maybe for some of the negative ones). 

    There's also some evidence suggesting that in some cases, our feelings do pick up on more info than might be explicitly available to us. [See this paper on "feelings as information"](https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/780/docs/schwarz_feelings-as-information_7jan10.pdf). Also, feelings shortcut a lot of our explicit thinking, which can make it faster to update on somethings. [Nate Soares talks about updating from the "suckerpunch" of guilt as a way to quickly implement some changes](http://mindingourway.com/update-from-the-suckerpunch/).

    I hope this points at a few things that might be useful.

    >Is it sensible and possible in the general case to separate your emotional connection to a topic from your reaction to it?

    Regarding possibility, yes. This is called [emotional detachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_detachment). Regarding sensibility, it depends. For first-line emergency responders, doctors, nurses, etc., it's essential to be able to detach from the horror and sadness of a situation and start taking action to resolve or mitigate the problem.

    In other circumstances, there's a grey area. It's regarded as a disease if it makes you unhappy/depressed, or impedes your ability to empathize with others, or leads you to harm others. Of course, it does seem sensible to detach if it's for practical and benevolent reasons in situations where you would otherwise be unable to emotionally cope and continue functioning.

    >Would eliminating this response be desirable, if it was even possible? In this case it seems benign, though I can see how an aversion to loss could be deleterious, but I think I would have come to the same decision even without the emotional response. It's practically mandated by my ethical philosophy to minimise death, and if that is not possible to minimise losses (information, emotional health, etc.) due to death.

    I think you've made your point fairly well there. Yes, generalized emotional detachment/blunting tends to be a bad thing. Our emotions guide us in what we regard as good and bad, largely based on how those things make us and others feel. Death makes most people very unhappy to say the least, and that's what drives us to find ways to keep people alive for as long as possible.

    That said, death is not the only problem. Quality of life is a huge issue which does not seem to be getting the attention that it needs. What good is life if you're crippled, bedridden, and suffering endless agonizing pain? In that context, death can be a blessing by comparison.

    >I find it hard to reason about how my reasoning would function in the absence of emotional impulses. Many dystopian stories make it out to be a negative thing—tying emotion to ethics implicitly—but that seems a little nonsensical. Something doesn't become good just because it feels good, nor become bad because it feels bad.

    I don't think this is actually terribly complicated. There's a combination of social and psychological factors which drive your sense of morality. These can be fairly detailed, but the way they end up directing your morality is pretty simple.

    Social factors are chiefly your upbringing and the culture you grow up in. You cover yourself with clothes because doing otherwise would be immodest. Yet, if you had grown up in the Amazon rainforest, running around more or less naked might seem perfectly normal. You don't eat people because that's wrong/weird/evil, but if you had grown up in certain tribes in Papua New Guinea, you would be offended if someone in your family didn't want to eat a relative to honor them in death and carry them on forever. You (probably) call the police when someone steals from you or harasses/threatens/attacks you, but if you had grown up in certain cultures in American ghettos, you might consider calling the police to be wrong/evil. Culture and upbringing can be surprisingly effective at reshaping your sense of good and evil.

    Even so, there are certain things that seem to be more universal across cultures, and likely impossible to condition out of human psychology. Mourning the death of loved ones is a good example. Although it would be impossible to ever truly separate upbringing and culture from raw human psychology, these universal cross-cultural behaviors and attitudes hint at the boundaries between nature and nurture in human psychology.

    The crucial thing is that the combination of values, beliefs and thought processes that emerge from nature and nurture are what guide emotional reactions to events, and whether we regard them as right/wrong or good/evil. Furthermore, due to the evolutionary biology of the limbic system, those emotions direct how we remember things. Unlike a computer that can recall arbitrary data with equal efficiency, our biology causes us to recall strongly emotional events much more easily than seemingly unimportant events. In turn, this causes us to keep recalling and keep lingering on thoughts about things that provoked strong emotions, rather than trying to, say, optimize our productivity with pure study and work.

    The consequence of this is that your biology and the culture you're raised in cause you focus on certain things in ways that might conceivably be extremely different in other cultures or with different biologies. This is a vague way of saying that other cultures and alien brain structures would almost certainly prioritize things differently from you and I, and there's no clear standard of what's universally good/bad. The key thing is that your brain and your upbringing leads you to have certain emotional responses to what you perceive as good/bad, so rational optimization for your own happiness would guide you to maximize the frequency with which you are happy with the events around, and minimize the frequency of events which make you unhappy.

    In other words, you can't escape your own biology and upbringing, and even if you tried, your attempt would still be guided by your pre-existing social and biological factors that influence you beyond your control, leading you back to an idealized or incrementally modified variant of the things you already believe and feel. You are unable to deem a new philosophy good/bad outside of the context in which you have been raised and outside of the biological and emotional limitations of your own mind.  Thus, to be happy, you have to acknowledge what you can and cannot change, both in your own mind and in the world around you. Then, where you can make changes, make the changes that will make you happy.

    You can't intentionally detach yourself from your own emotions, but you can create circumstances which limit your suffering and help you to find happiness both on your own, and in the happiness of others.

  Recently, in watching [a playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFX9B_9L4-neNiBhZcc54c7aPXkyP7GI) of *[Darkest Dungeon](http://www.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon)*, I've been thoroughly disgusted by the fact that, in a game widely touted as a triumph in immersing the player in the hopeless experience of "cosmic horror", immersion is *totally broken* by the inclusion--indeed, the *encouragement*--of *extremely*-gamey tactics. Consider:

  \- Outside of camping intervals (of which a mission can contain between zero and three), the characters controlled by the player can use healing skills *only* during battles. This encourages the player toward the artificial prolonging of any battle against an enemy group whose damage-dealing capabilities are exceeded by the PCs' healing power.  
  \- In order to prevent this, contrived [stalling penalties](http://np.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon/comments/43wov9/how_exactly_does_the_stall_penalty_work/czlthz1) take effect whenever the enemy group is reduced to a single enemy that can't deal more damage than the PCs can heal (i.e., is neither a boss nor a miniboss). This forces the player to be more creative in his stalling, by stunning enemies to reduce their damage-dealing potential and by not killing the final monster until the very last moment before the penalties will be inflicted.  
  \- Even worse, in the final missions of the game, the developers **intentionally** (according to the person who executed the playthrough linked above) included enemy groups each containing two enemies **incapable** of dealing damage to the PCs, thus accomplishing an end run around **their own anti-stalling mechanic** in order to compensate for those missions' extreme difficulty. In addition, the stalling penalties are waived against one enemy with such high defensive statistics that killing it before the stalling penalties kick in usually is extremely difficult. ([This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0UqtvCPsMc&list=PLQFX9B_9L4-kjmz2ic1AsduLdf8dOpRWN) provides a nice example of how ridiculous the mechanic is. The ninety-minute mission includes literally *twenty-five minutes*, spread across four battles, of stalling against a single high-defense enemy in order to heal all the PCs--and this particular player is using a mod that speeds up battle animations, so the time split would be even *more* egregious under ordinary circumstances.)

  In my opinion, this trio of circumstances irreparably damages any claim to immersive capability that the game can put forward. Why can't characters use healing skills (balanced through some other method) outside battles and camps? (This includes, not just [divine](http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Heroes#Vestal) and [occult](http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Heroes#Occultist) spells that plausibly could require adrenaline to function, but also actions as mundane as [Battlefield Bandage](http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Heroes#Arbalest) and [Battlefield Medicine](http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Heroes#Plague_Doctor).) Why will reinforcements arrive *always* if the PCs are fighting a single cultist, but *never* if the the PCs are fighting two? (Wouldn't a *larger* battle be *more* likely to attract attention?) Why will reinforcements arrive *always* if the PCs are fighting a single ordinary enemy, but *never* if they're fighting a lone boss? (Wouldn't the monsters be much more likely to have set up a system to warn of threats to their leaders than to have instituted a similar system for the protection of unimportant scouts and underlings?) No in-game explanation is provided.

  I don't dispute that the game is *fun:* According to Steam, I've accumulated 130 hours in it, despite having never even *started* the final missions. However, its [being extolled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Buwei6ZWqU) as a shining example of immersion when it definitely seems to me to be nothing of the sort irks me in the extreme. The narrator of the videos linked above has *himself* stated that he would prefer that, in any stalling-friendly situation, the five or ten minutes of stalling were replaced by pressing a "kill stall-friendly enemy/-ies and fully heal all PCs" button to fast-forward the whole process--and what could be more gamey than that?

  I *also* am annoyed at the trend of wasting money on graphics rather than spending it on something more *useful.* A few days ago, my computer broke, and I attempted to play *[Darkest Dungeon](http://www.darkestdungeon.com)* on [my mother's pathetic laptop](https://www.walmart.com/ip/21777758). I expected that the game would run reasonably well, given its simplicity--but imagine my surprise when it barely even functioned! Even *[Solitairica](http://store.steampowered.com/app/463980)*--barely more than a plain-Jane solitaire game, but uses the Unreal Engine!--lags rather badly on it. In a similar vein, I always am infuriated whenever I see a visual novel, because I know that there was wasted on the art money that *could* have gone to the writing or the gameplay. What's the point of making [boring "games" with mediocre writing and art](http://store.steampowered.com/app/571880) when you could make [fun games with no writing and placeholder art](http://store.steampowered.com/app/448910), [entertaining books with no gameplay or art](https://kdp.amazon.com), or [impressive artworks with no gameplay or writing](https://www.patreon.com)?

  IIRC (I've played neither game in *several* years), I preferred *[Kudos 2](http://www.positech.co.uk/kudos2)* to *[The Sims 2](http://www2.ea.com/the-sims-2)*. Likewise, to say that the snazzy interface of *[Cities: Skylines](http://www.citiesskylines.com)* or of *[Pharaoh](https://www.gog.com/game/pharaoh_cleopatra)* is any better than the straightforward and well-marked keyboard instructions of *[Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves)* seems a very large stretch, to me. See also *[Lethis: Path of Progress](http://store.steampowered.com/app/359230)*, which, despite its cute graphics, is in terms of gameplay an outright *downgrade* from *Pharaoh*, to which it is an homage! Ugh...

    Interesting--the only praise I've heard of darkest dungeon had to do with the subtle morality, that you're practically forced to run your operation like a heartless CEO, and perhaps that's one reason why the healing is not permitted out of battle, so you're forced to keep pressing your minions. I've heard the game gets a lot easier if you stop trying to play like a hero. 

    To praise Dwarf Fortress for its user interface is a disservice to UI everywhere. Things needn't use tons of shaders, but I draw the line at needing third party utilities just to perform basic organizational tasks. 

    I do agree that gameplay too often sits at the back of the priority bus, but it's also a bit of a catch 22: the number of gamers willing to purchase an ugly yet fun game is limited and already for the most part playing ugly yet fun games. The number of people willing to drop cash for something pretty that didn't outright bore them, on the other hand, is much larger. Perfect artistry with a tiny audience, or mediocrity with exposure? I may not like it, but it's perfectly understandable why that's the status quo. 

    (also most people suck at making games, yours truly included. Prioritizing and project management *while* making a game are even harder.)

      ```

      - u/reaper7876:
        ```
        Various reasons:

        Hotkey inconsistency. Navigating a selection menu? Sometimes you go up and down with + and -; sometimes you go up and down with the arrow keys, using + and - to increment and decrement values. How do you designate the area of a task? If it's a Designation, you move to the corners with the arrow keys and select them with enter. If it's a Construction, you use UMHK to change its size, then place it in the correct spot. And so on.

        Naming inconsistencies. Seats are called chairs, except when they're thrones. Burial receptacles are called coffins, except when they're caskets or sarcophagi. Does a throne allow you to zone an office? A new player might not know just from reading them.

        Unintuitive navigation requirements. This is the biggest one, I think. Unless you've sunk a fair bit of time into the game (as I admittedly have), it's not obvious that removing a built construction is not under the Construction menu, or even under the Build menu, but grouped under Designate alongside things like smoothing stone and harvesting wild plants. Similarly, a refuse stockpile not collecting outdoors refuse is an entirely opaque problem for a newcomer, because the settings for refuse collection are not accessible from the stockpile, but are instead under Standing Orders - Refuse. Combat breaks out for the first time? You'll need to navigate [4 different selection screens](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Attack) to properly convince a dwarf to go fight; not exactly beginner friendly.

        I should note that I do in fact like the game a lot, after all that criticism; but I'm hard-pressed to defend the UI, so I don't.

    ```
    Omniscience and omnipotence are both traits with implicit infinite scope. So you are a mind infinite in size and intelligence and can even run a perfect simulation of yourself, running a simulation of yourself...          
    Your can't dismiss being a simulation (after all you could very well be a simulation run by a version of yourself) however whatever is doing the simulating must also be infinite in power and intelligence and thus must exist in a universe that allows those sorts of infinities.                                  
    Still given your own universe must be infinite and probably contains infinite nested infinities, you can be pretty certain you _are_ simulated, but it doesn't really matter since all higher/adjacent levels of simulation are of equal size and complexity. Hell things get even more complex since it's hard to even say that some levels are higher than others, given all lower levels also contain all higher levels, simulating all lower levels, ad infinitum.

    One thing I should mention is that it's not actually clear whether it's possible for a omniscient omnipotent being to have any consciousness. Given it always knows all it's thoughts beforehand and can't get new information its mind would be a totally static timeless object. Since everything would seem to indicate minds are processes a true omniscient being would actually _have_ to be a p-zombie.

    I suppose a person could have some kind of limited "omniscience" and still be a brain in a vat, like perfect knowledge of every particle in their environment, or something. 

    In that case, yeah, it seems like if anything it would be evidence *for* the simulation hypothesis - for example, you could easily create a person with similar "omniscience" of a part of your domain using your powers..

  My two weeks are up: I said I would work on an initiative prototype, and an initiative prototype I have, but it’s in that unfortunate mid-crunch state that I feel all of my time-limited game projects land in.  After having several nights where I wasn’t available to actually code anything, last night I finally got the core system working--you can decide the number, species, and type of AI for what units you want to include, which turn system you want to use, and then start actually mocking a few turns using the different turn managers.


  And that was done by around 1:30 AM last night.  I *do* like to give myself some breathing room, after all.


  But what’s missing unfortunately are the turn systems themselves: I have all the boilerplate needed, but I’m going to need a few more hours to actually get them in place.  So, if you’d like to see a turn system prototype with only a few threads of actual turn definitions, you can [download the applicable build here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0LYycfi-K18dDFPX1lQaXhuTVE?usp=sharing).  I have 32 and 64 bit builds for Windows, and universal builds for Linux and Mac in that folder.  I probably should have zipped them, but those are the sorts of decisions one makes in the wee hours of the morning.


  What *is* in the build are the Alternating and the first bits of the Simultaneous turn orders, so try those ones out.  Later today, and possibly for a few hours tomorrow, I’m going to finish hashing out the different systems, and then throw together some templates for a few different speed pokemon and moves, so stay tuned.


  ----


  However, I can’t spend *too* much time on it, as we’ve got the results for the next two-week prototype, and I’m going to go with the Voxel Engine.  The actual number of votes on /r/PokemonRenegade were actually split evenly between Voxel and Procedural Generation, but the number of people that came forward and were vocal on the Discord server in favor of Voxel were essentially unanimous in their opinions, so that’s where we’ll go.


  This is actually going to be a dual-purpose prototype: I’m going to fumble about with making a *very* simple, raw, inefficient voxel system (adapted to use hexes), but I’m *also* going to be using the opportunity to try out [Xenko](http://xenko.com/features/), an alternative to Unity that came on my radar several months ago, but I was helpfully reminded of this week.  It seems to check all the boxes that would make it that much more comfortable to use, with the only real downside being it doesn’t have a Mac build process yet.  Still, it wouldn’t be *too* difficult to be better than Unity, so I’ll give it a shot.


  Unity (or Xenko) are only being used for the front-end of the game, so it won’t be too difficult to use one or the other without impeding game progress *too* much, but let me know if you have any suggestions on that front, or if a lack of Mac support is make-or-break for you.


  (I know what you’re thinking: this guy couldn’t even get a simple *turn system* working in two weeks, the hell does he think he can do with a *voxel engine* in an *unknown editor*.  I gladly acknowledge the irony and accept the challenge; got to stretch to make it anywhere.)


  ----


  This week we discussed breeding in some depth, and I’m looking for ideas on how one might be able to tie the mechanic to others in the game.  *My* idea was to have a sort of Lamarckian evolution concept, where a unit’s EVs would influence the strength of the offspring, permitting both combat and breeding to go hand in hand, but there’s some pushback on this.  What do you think of the idea?  Can you think of any alternative mechanical interactions that we could give breeding to make it more intertwined with the other systems of the game?

    If Xenko were never going to support MacOS, that'd be a big negative, but it looks like it's on the horizon for them (maybe in the next major release, from what I'm seeing on their GitHub), so in my opinion that shouldn't be a reason not to go with it.

      I agree; they're supposed to have it "spring 2017".

It would definitely be a second class citizen platform in that case.

  So... I'm wanting to know if/when it rained in Rome, Italy in May-June 1944. I'm guessing it probably didn't due to the time of year, but who knows. 

  Given it's a big city and it was right about when the allies took Rome, that data has to be somewhere on the internet (it'd be in war records, right?), but I've not been able to find it - historical weather seems to only kick in around 1999.

      That's maybe TOO detailed. I can't read synoptic charts unfortunately. They have a link to daily weather observations, but they're british.

      Maybe I should see if I can find anything on the italian-language internet. Unfortunately my level of skill with the language is abysmal, but I suppose that's why god gave us google translate.

  This always confuses me. Isn't the off-topic thread *exactly* the place for that sort of thing?

    That's the point; it's saying don't make a thread for it, and this is the place for that.

    >sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here.

    Yup, this is the place for that sort of thing.  It's just saying that the /r/rational community isn't where you'd go talk about Japanese game shows, *except* for places like the Off-Topic Thread.

      I mean, I get it. But it's kind of strange that what is omitted is "it's hopefully also understandable that this [sub, except for the designated off-topic threads] isn't really the place for that sort of thing." rather than "it's hopefully also understandable that this [thread] isn't really the place for that sort of thing."

  - u/gbear605:
    ```
    The "this" in "this isn't really the place for that sort of thing" is referring to the subreddit as a whole, not this thread. To rephrase:

    > It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that /r/rational isn't normally the place for having conversations about Japanese game shows. So instead we have this one weekly thread where you're allowed to do it and try to forbid it elsewhere.

  [Another thing about genies that I wrote recently](http://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/coin-tossing-and-adversary-resistant-priors/), but the genie is significantly less friendly and it's actually about how Bayesian priors should behave in the presence of an adversary.

  It may be that this is well known stuff, but I haven't seen it discussed much, so links to related literature would be appreciated.
