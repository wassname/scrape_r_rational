  Inspired by [this post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/eqn/the_useful_idea_of_truth/) over on LessWrong, as well as popular Youtube educators like CGP Grey and CrashCourse, I thought I'd do my best to teach the lessons of LW in a more memorable and shareable way. Let me know what you think, good or bad!

  1st: Yes, I think this is an appropriate place to post this :) Thanks for sharing, I enjoyed it! One bit of constructive criticism for the future videos is to try staggering your words a bit less, the way Stephen Fry lets the words follow his natural speaking pattern rather than what appears to be you trying to speak in the order the words appear, like so:

  2nd: Would you mind explaining which programs you used to make this? I've been thinking of making book review videos in this style and this is exactly what I had in mind for the way the words would appear on the screen.

    Thank you for the feedback. I expect my voice to come through more naturally as I gain experience, and is something I'll be sure to maintain awareness of. I only hope to one day have a spoken voice as beautiful and compelling as Stephen Fry's.

    I used a combination of Photoshop CS and After Effects CS4, and [this tutorial](http://vimeo.com/26079113) is essentially comprehensive information of everything I knew when I started. Specific stuff, like keyboard shortcuts, how to organize my workflow and work area, specific plugin settings, and render options are things I learned and looked up as I went. If you're making something like this I'd be happy to  answer specific questions as they arise and I'm available to do so.

      No worries, and thanks a lot, appreciate it!
