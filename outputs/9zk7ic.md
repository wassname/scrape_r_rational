  I pick option B. The difference between a six month gap and a year gap for updates is not nearly as bad as the difference between a two week gap and a six month gap, because after 6 months I've mostly forgotten that r!Animorphs exists, and can just continue living in that ignorance.

  I would be willing to wait a whole year for TK17 to finish the entire rest of r!Animorphs, to then be published in the span of a few very fun weeks. This may be more efficient from an authorial standpoint too, since chapters can be batch-written and batch-polished.

  Appears to be a request for feedback on update release schedule, with a note that the next chapter will be posted this Sunday. Apologies for the hypebait.

  B. I have trouble remembering what's happened until now, and I expect that to be less of a problem with batched updates even if there's a bigger gap between the batches.

  Looking forward to the next one!

  One very short interlude, giving - if we are to take this as canon - a very surprising fact which I did not at all expect!

  Also looking forward to the next normal chapter Sunday.

    I cannot figure out which fact you are referring to.  If it's that Marco's mom is Visser One's host, that's original Animorphs canon.  An I missing something else?

      ```
      Prior to this, there was no hint whatsoever about what Visser Three *did* with Jake, Marco, Tobias, Erek, etc.  This is ambiguous (could be a corpse, could be a live Marco) but it's still plot progress.

  I'd favour B, I won't appreciate the arcs as much when there are very long gaps in between chapters, since I'll forget the fine details. I really like the approach of long gaps while an arc is written, and then eg releasing chapters every few days.
