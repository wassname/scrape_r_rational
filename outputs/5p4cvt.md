## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Speaking of plotting meteorological data... I feel like the discussion around the arctic ice extent in the media is often around "oh this next big ice chunk broke off", but what's more interesting/worrying is the overall temperatures and ice extent. For example, [the winter of 2016's temperatures for the arctic were at some points, a record +25C anomaly from the mean!](https://icons-sf.wxug.com/hurricane/2016/arctic-temp-dec.png). Equally interesting is the [sea surface ice extent, which is significantly down in 2016-2017.](https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home/sea-ice-extent-area/grf/nsidc_global_area_byyear_b.png) It's hard to understate the magnitude of the change in the ice extent. [2016-2017 is now at greater than 2 standard deviations away](https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/images/daily_images/N_stddev_timeseries.png) from the mean ice extent, briefly flirting with a 4 standard deviations last November. Previous years had low ice extents, but 2016's is shockingly low, a massive departure from even 2015. The change is so massive that it seems the past trends will not even hold into the future, even after temperatures return to normal. The loss of ice extent will become permanent and will create a new normal climate for the arctic, a much warmer one. It seems plausible we may begin to see an ice-free arctic during the summer months by the next century.

  I think the greater implications of this change are also understated in the media. I don't foresee the rise in sea levels as a major problem for most of the world. However, the arctic ice extent serves as a significant source of albedo for Earth, reflecting light away and cooling the planet. With this greatly diminished, polar regions will warm, and the increased moisture content in the air will increase the air pressure in polar regions slightly. [Increased air pressure will decrease the strength of the polar vortexes (vortexes are Low-pressure events), and weaker polar vortexes will be pulled away from the Northern latitudes and southwards.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex#Climate_change) This is a vicious cycle, as the polar vortex moves away from the arctic, arctic temperatures warm further, displacing polar vortexes further, increasing arctic temperatures further, etc. This may also paradoxically result in Canadian and Siberian areas remaining colder than usual, despite the overall temperature increases, as weaker polar vortexes will move south into these regions.

    On scientific grounds, aggregating arctic and antarctic sea-ice is pretty dubious.  But 2016 was a terrible year for both, so it's not like plotting them separately is less concerning :(

    And while I think that sea level rise will be a huge problem this century (due to terrestrial ice sliding into the ocean), you're spot-on about the albedo and circulation issues.

    I didn't watch it, but I liked this quote someone shared with me.

    > Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and spirit of America. We will not fail, our country will thrive and proposer again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth of the miseries of disease and to harness the technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will heal our divisions. It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: whether we are brown, black or white we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.

    It's not that I think this is indicative of any change in his character or policies from what I already believe about him, but at least it sounded like a Presidential speech. Either he keeps it up and earns my respect, if not my support, or he doesn't and I can hold this up as an example of what he could be.

        http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/donald-trump-steve-bannon-peter-thiel-214490

        > Thiel is quite a different figure from Bannon, but his ambivalence about democracy is even more explicit, shading over into outright contempt. A Silicon Valley libertarian who got rich by developing PayPal, Thiel historically likes his capitalism undiluted by sentimentality. He shares Bannon’s disdain for complacent elites and their crony capitalism, and has been an attention-getting provocateur against establishment institutions such as his alma mater, Stanford University. (He has famously offered grants to talented students who forgo college.) He is interested in technology that overcomes familiar human limitations, including space colonization and medical research into immortality. This kind of technological utopianism has a long pedigree in Silicon Valley, and was already well established in the 1990s, when it got friendly treatment from buzzy venues like Wired.

        > Thiel’s recasting himself as Tech Trump was perhaps most striking because, just a few years ago, he had written off politics altogether. “I no longer think that freedom and democracy are compatible,” Thiel wrote in a 2009 Cato Institute essay. Instead, “the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms.” He proposed redirecting energy to private enterprises that could end-run both the right’s “totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes” and the left’s “unthinking demos that guides so-called ‘social democracy.’” He proposed cyberspace, outer space and the high seas as refuges for anti-political libertarians. In a follow-up essay, Thiel explained, “I believe that politics is way too intense. That’s why I’m a libertarian. Politics gets people angry, destroys relationships and polarizes peoples’ vision: the world is us versus them; good people versus the other. Politics is about interfering with other people’s lives without their consent. That’s probably why, in the past, libertarians have made little progress in the political sphere. Thus, I advocate focusing energy elsewhere, onto peaceful projects that some consider utopian.”

        > Whatever Thiel’s motive, there is no sign that it is a new enthusiasm for democracy. Thiel wrote in his 2009 essay that “the broader education of the body politic has become a fool’s errand.” There is no evidence that he has changed his mind about that. Trump’s campaign, as noted, confirms Thiel’s dire 2009 description of politics as an us-versus-them, anger-stoking festival of irrationality. But rather than renounce politics, Trump is pushing it in a direction that Thiel seems to tolerate, even embrace: If you can’t escape the democratic herd, then maybe you can manage it on its own irrational terms. If politics is essentially demagoguery, then what a libertarian needs is a skillful and congenial demagogue.

        Here's the same article's take on Steve Bannon:

        > To understand Bannon’s outlook, the best source we have is a remote address he gave in 2014 to a conference of the Human Dignity Institute, a conservative political group with right-wing Catholic ties, which was being held at the Vatican. In the talk, recently published by BuzzFeed, Bannon laid out a strikingly coherent picture of his worldview, which has a few fundamental elements.

        > First, the United States and Europe are at the beginning of “a very brutal and bloody conflict” against “a new barbarity that’s starting, which will completely eradicate everything that we’ve been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years,” unless “we” defeat it. This is “jihadist Islamic fascism.” The “river of blood” that the Islamic State promises “is going to come to Western Europe, it’s going to come to the United Kingdom.” (Bannon seems to be just the leading edge of this clash-of-civilizations theme in the Trump administration. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has called radical Islam an “existential threat” and suggested that Islam itself is “a cancer” of an ideology rather than a genuine religion.)

        > Second, what “we” must defend against Islamic fascism is a very specific version of Western civilization. The lesson of World War II and the struggle against totalitarianism, Bannon explains, is that the great and singular achievement of the West is “an enlightened form of capitalism.” It is, he says, a specifically “Christian” or “Judeo-Christian” version of capitalism that produces wealth for the good of the community, in which “divine providence” empowers its favored people “to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth.” The thing to notice is what is left out. In a description of a coming battle for Western civilization and of the lessons of the 20th-century struggle against totalitarianism, Bannon does not mention democracy. He doesn’t mention constitutionalism. Capitalism is the thing at stake in a global clash of civilizations, the most precious part of a legacy of freedom.

        > What does it mean that Bannon doesn’t talk about democracy or constitutionalism? Maybe he just forgot. But it seems more likely that his nationalist capitalism is an alternative theory of political legitimacy, and one whose emergence doesn’t necessarily depend on the machinery of democracy. The role of politics in Bannon’s view seems to be not to choose the direction of national and global economics, but to move them toward a destination already in Bannon’s mind. When Bannon famously called himself a “Leninist,” he might have had this idea in mind: that the role of political action is to seize the state and move ruthlessly toward a predetermined goal, marshaling whatever forces will help you get there. Bannon gives no hint that the populist wave is a call for deepened democracy, which would mean, for instance, expanding political participation for working people and the marginalized (rather than embracing an anti-union agenda and vote-suppression laws) and reducing the political influence of the superwealthy class that produced Trump and is now beginning to fill his Cabinet and the ranks of his advisers.
        ```

        - u/Anderkent:
          ```
          That description of Thiel doesn't read too bad to me? It seems to acknowledge that democracy is a tool that's possibly necessary, but not nearly sufficient, to gain good governance. That in addition to the elections, which prevent some failure modes of governance, you still need someone to get involved to push the governing people into the right direction, and that Thiel seems to see himself as that person.
          ```

          - u/trekie140:
            ```
            I find the possible implication that Thiel concluded people were too stupid to intelligently govern themselves so he backed an anti-intellectual demagogue extremely unsettling.
            ```

            - u/Anderkent:
              ```
              "people were too stupid to intelligently govern themselves" is just such a weird thing to say / take away from all that. Democracy not being a perfect answer isn't about people being stupid or smart, it's just an effect of having a large amount of agents without very good coordination mechanisms.

              Being ambivalent about current governance process doesn't mean he thinks everyone else is stupid.
              ```

              - u/trekie140:
                ```
                The article just describes Thiel in such a way that it sounds like he lost faith in voters' ability to make intelligent decisions.

          So his lesson to take from the struggle against fascism is... that we need to adopt fascism?

  I write, in fits and starts, a book. I have a tendency to get stuck rewriting the same scenes over and over. I make progress mostly when I force myself to continue forwards before I'm quite satisfied with what I've got. I don't know how good the end product will be. It *should* be good. Certainly my friends tell me they like the world building and the magic system and the excessively long world history. But there's a nagging sense that maybe I'm just not good at writing characters. My writing style is different from the authors that I like reading, and I worry that my point of view characters will come across as unfeeling, or that to avoid that I will be too blunt in just having them think their feelings too explicitly. I find it difficult to have them think about information as they get it, so they end up doing the bulk of their introspection and analysis and planning when they are alone and nothing else is happening.

  I don't know what to do about this. I pivot between an unhealthy sense of being the best writer ever and wondering if I'm a little bit retarded.

    Look at it this way: even if you really actually do suck at writing characters, Isaac Asimov had terrible, wooden characters and he's considered one of the sci-fi greats of all time.

    I think you're doubtless being far too tough on yourself. When you write, do your characters ever surprise you? To me that's the best mark of a "real" character, when they act in ways you didn't anticipate.

  This is a bit late, but still trying. A rational pokemon update, or a question rather. One of the questions currently being faced is how to design the modder facing side of body part stat weighting. To elaborate, every body a pokemon has is going to be linked to different stats in different amounts, taking out a leg might harm their Movement a lot more than their Strength for example, and attacking the eyes would harm their ability to see but not do too much to their HP.

  The question is how to represent these, there are currently two major ideas.

  ---

  The first, represent them as adjustments of batches. You would represent a weighting of having more HP than normal as HP+ for example, or HP- for less HP than normal.

  For the hard numbers, say you have a batch size of 3. Then HP+ would represent two batches (6), HP++ would represent three batches (9), HP+++ four batches (12)and so on. HP- would represent one less than a batch (2), HP-- two less than a batch (1), HP--- three less than a full batch (0) and so on. Exact numbers would obviously vary with the batch size. So if for example you had two HP- and one HP+ the HP- would each get 20% of the HP attributed to those body parts and the HP+ would get 60% of the HP.

  ---

  The second idea is to represent weighting via numbers. You would represent a weighting of having more HP than normal as a high such as HP:10 maybe, while a low number such as HP:2 would represent much less HP.

  For the hard numbers, a HP:2 would represent two weight, a HP:10 would represent ten weight, a HP:1000 one thousand weight and so on. So if for example you had two HP:3 and one HP:6 the HP:3 would each get 25% of the HP and the HP6 would get 50% attributed to it.

  ---

  The question is, which system do you think would work better? Why? What do you think of both? Is there something else you think might work better? Well, that's more than one question really.

  And as always, come join in [the Discord](https://discord.gg/dJRsE6Z) if it sounds interesting, always up for discussion on it, although it's shifted a bit more towards implementation design than game design of late.

    Another way to earn resentment is to phrase your messages in such a way that from someone else’s perspective can easily be misinterpreted as 

    >laying it a bit thick with humblebragging while simultaneously insulting people that you’re sharing a community with.

    I don’t remember if it was you or m.b. someone else, who in a similar thread once shared a facebook picture, with the context of how their fellow students (I think?) made a problem out of not-wanting-to-party-with-them, but this is almost the same type of communication problem (I’ll try to post the comment I’ve mentioned here, if I find it). 

    >Any idiot could do it. 

    >took *me* 30 seconds and would have taken *you* 3 minutes

    >I can’t believe you people.

    I agree with your general message itself, regarding an individual’s overhyped prestige in a peer group. However, the manner in which you’ve tried to decline such “prestige-shower” was extremely and unnecessarily rude.
