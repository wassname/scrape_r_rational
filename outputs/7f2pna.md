  I wasn't expecting this at all really. The author keeps making nice twists on what people expect. The poachers, I thought, would just eat the children if they got them. But the free roam hunting thing makes sense and makes it much more fun.

  I'm expecting there to be some kind of character development for Emma now that she's been isolated from her family and has to deal with other children that are most likely hardened veterans of avoiding demons. It also means she'll likely learn some tricks from them...if she can survive.

  My prediction is that first timers in the hunt get a one time immunity, to allow them to get their bearings. It'll let Emma fail and see the consequences of failure while keeping her alive. I'm imagining her making friends with someone and them being eaten alive in front of her, or something equally traumatizing.

  Interesting. I wonder what the kids there will be like considering that it's the complete opposite of Grace Field.
