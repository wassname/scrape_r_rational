## Please help... Any [roughly] rational books with a similar kind of "slow-burn" primary and secondary character development as found in Mother of Learning? (the premise can be anything)

  I assume that everyone subscribed to this sub has read Worm, but that fits perfectly. 

  I'd also say Vin's development in Mistborn is something like Zorian's: gaining new powers and developing her cognitive and social capabilities at the same time. Mistborn itself is probably not ~~rational~~ rationalist, but as with all Sanderson the magic system is very rule-based and super fun to read.

    Mistborn is incredibly rational.

      I guess I meant it's not very rationalist. You're right.

      As much as I enjoyed it, *Mistborn* is about as rational as a dog with Alzheimer's.  Every single character in the first book takes a turn with the idiot ball, the final battle is decided by a power that was never foreshadowed, and the twist with the Lord Ruler is like one story-long version of "the butler did it". The main character goes through the stations of the plot without any consideration or thought  their motivations. (Which main character? Both.) Vin in particular is replaced with a completely different character going by the same name in the middle portion of the story, and I don't buy the "character development" that takes her there. She comes back for the final arc, the middle part having essentially zero relevance save for the introduction of Elend Venture. The only thing rational about it is that the author doesn't treat the enemy like a total pushover. (By making the main characters too stupid to challenge him on even terms until Deus Ex Sazed)

      I've only read the first book so far, but I don't see this getting better in the rest of the trilogy. Not that I won't, mind, just that calling the book "rational" couldn't be further off.

        can you give an example?

        the final battle is decided by a power that was never foreshadowed

        It was foreshadowed a couple times. "he is the only one powerful enough to wear metal in him, and everyone else imitates his fashion". The multiple discoveries of new metallurgic arts, the attempt to genocide his people and keep his power a secret. It would have been an idiot ball if he left his power source laying aroung.

        The main character goes through the stations of the plot without any consideration or thought their motivations. (Which main character? Both.)

        No, seriously, which one? Kelsier, who is fighting a corrupt king not for his people, but out of petty revenge for his wife? Vin, who had no real reason to fight, except everyone she ever had treat her kindly was in the rebellion, and thus fought for her friends?

        Lets put aside "i dont buy the character development"

        he comes back for the final arc, the middle part having essentially zero relevance save for the introduction of Elend Venture. 

        Judging what is relavent a third of the way through a story is an interesting trick. Most if not all of that is relavent through the rest of the series.

  Pokemon: The Origin of Species, by u/daystareld, is definitely slow, and character development is a big deal. It's rationalist, not just rational, so character actions and growth really have to make sense. A somewhat gentler touch than HPMoR, though; just as many demonstrations of how to think better, less angst at the world's inferiority.

    >less angst at the world's inferiority.

    It helps that I get to construct the world more-or-less as I want to, so I can skip over having incompetent adults and bureaucratic nightmares :)

    Love this series, my one warning is the slow update speed.

    - u/thrawnca:

      The OP requested slow :)
      ```

      - u/Rouninscholar:
        ```
        Very true, I suppose I just enjoy slow burn more when I still get to read :P

  A Hero's War? The most recent update was just recently posted in this sub. It's more of an uplift story where the society as a whole improves rather than any individual, but it scratches a similar itch.

    Yeah, Cato is a bit static but everyone around him recognizes that change is coming and takes steps one way or another

  How do you feel about fanfics?

  ```
  Way of Choices spends an entire 100+ chapters just building the world, it's lore, characters, and politics.

    Seconded. Great story.

    Is it rational or rationalist or?

      It's xianxia, so no.  Xianxia characters tend to have a "might makes right" philosophy, xianxia antagonists tend to be two-dimensional, and xianxia protagonists can generally be spotted by A) some bloodline or artifact that allows them to gain power at a higher-than-normal rate (often being mistaken for a once-in-a-millennium genius), and B) nobody giving the protagonist any face, which is used as a justification for the protag to kick ass and not feel bad about it (see the previous point about "might makes right".)

      It can be entertaining, but it's very much the literary equivalent of junk food.

  A Hero's War is definitely what you're after.

  It's even got romance, of a sort. I think it's 95 chapters in that the main POV character and the deuteragonist formally begin a 'dating period.'

  Mind, they meet in chapter 15 or so, and spend most of their time together from there on out.

  How about Time Braid. It's a great time looping fanfic in the narutoverse. One of the best I've read. Competes with MoL.

  I recommend the HP fanfic "The Arithmancer" and it's sequel "Lady Archimedes".

  It doesn't really focus on secondary characters, just the protagonist, Hermione. However, we watch her grow and develop both in skill and as a person.
  ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    I agree the Arithmancer is a good recommendation, but Lady Archimedes fell off a bit for me. The Arithmancer was a lot of Hermione still learning and experimenting to figure things out. LA was more "Hermione knows a ton and is a magical badass who can make up spells practically off the top of her head." It's still good, but I enjoyed the original's pacing quite a bit more.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      And god so many many ways to end the war are just flat out ignored because ~~the author~~ Hermione doesn't like violence and the vigilante organization that's older than her listens to her and agrees to stop the meany head fighting
      ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      The first Triwizard task was definitely a moment of awesomeness.
      ```

- u/Slinkinator:
  ```
  I think Worth the Candle might be a good candidate.  I'm not sure I'm attracted to it for the same reasons I like MoL, but it's compelling.

  On the other hand, Saga of Soul is phenomenal and definitely what you're looking for, and I think there are around 60-80 chapters, but it's been dead for years, so you have to take what you can get.
