## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I am writing a story in which the frequency of which an idea is thought of(as well as it's internal coherency) determines how strong it is. I am wondering what 'magics' that people in our world think about enough for it to be strong.

  Wand magic seems to be a stable for as long as Harry Potter have been out.

  New age crystal magic seem to be gaining traction as crystals are believed to have healing properties(and are also physical objects that you think about when you see them)

  Necromancy seem to be a stable in a lot of fantasy things.

  Shapechanging is an old stable and there's a few new werewolf movies/shows happening.

  Vampire and zombies are hit.

  Staff based magic are present in people's mind due to LoTR.

  Some kind of divine blessing.

  Technomancy?

  A lot of shows/stories features pact magic.

  There's a bunch of discliplines under mentalism(clairvoyance/divination/mediumship/mindreading/telekinesis) but I don't know if they are prominent enough in public consciousness to really have mojo.

  Alchemy had it's thing but is dead now.

  I don't really think that enough people really think about mana based casting for it to be a thing and there's a lot of different ideas about what it should be able to do which damages the internal coherency.

  There is a bunch of different superhero movies that features heavily in public consciousness but their abilities are so different that I don't know if they individually would gain enough traction.

  Various 'magicians' does a lot of tricks but again I don't know if there's enough coherency between tricks. Spacial magic for sawing people in half?

    Toon physics is also something often thought of, and has a certain internal consistency. Walt Disney, in this universe, actually went out and made an entirely *new* branch of magic, centred around surviving fallen anvils, ignoring gravity until you notice it, running into paintings, and pulling items labelled "ACME" out of nowhere.
    ```

      Loonietoomancy. I love it.

      I wonder how we can use it. Anvils are only rarely used in combat and ignoring gravity would be neat if you could use it consistently.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        It's not just anvils. You would be able to survive any blunt-force impact, whether from a frying pan or a warhammer; explosives would merely cover your face in soot; and you'd be able to pull fanciful traps out of nowhere.

        *Advanced* Looniemancers could even break the fourth wall, or practice off-screen teleportation.
        ```

    I think that, unless this is a *very* recent change to the world, viable magics would very quickly change as they would quickly become positive feedback loops and push out other forms of magic in public thought. Once some kind of magic with a low cost to entry (like magic circles, chants, etc) and a visible, benign effect becomes known, people are going to show it off, make it well known, get more people doing it, so on and so forth.

    Consider also that urban legends and creepypasta could quickly become memetic massacres if central authorities don't realize they need to create information control measures for them. All it takes is one ["Bye Bye Man"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X016TNXPGjU) reaching a critical spread on mass media and everyone's fucked.
    ```

    - u/Lightwavers:
      ```
      At the end of that trailer I just burst out laughing. "Don't say it don't think it..."

      *dramatic voice* "Bye Bye Man."

      Might as well name the creepypasta guy Barney.
      ```

    ```
    Would the very fact that an idea such as alchemy spread at some point prevent its death for the most part? If there was certifiable evidence that, say, lead could be turned into gold by a certain reaction, wouldn't that prevent alchemy from dying out since people would place more faith in its methods, and it would gradually grow to be a science just like any other? Unless someone specifically purged it from the minds of the populace, or spread huge amounts of propaganda and false information of course.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      I would agree that any magic, including alchemy, would become a science if allowed unchecked. With competing groupings/magic systems/whatnot, it might not survive though. At any rate I am interested in the current memetic landscape.
      ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Psst. The word you're looking for is "staple" not "stable."

    Anyways, I think the biggest problem would be figuring out how to make the magic non-referential. If you have a form of magic that works, you'll spend extra time thinking about rather than some other form of magic, recursively increasing its power.

  I'm writing a world with a bunch of magic systems. So I'll probably be doing a bunch of these (once a week). These are mostly to confirm what I already thought of but to make sure I'm not missing any consequences or ideas *about the magic* not necessarily the spells I present as examples. I'm mostly interested in munchkin opportunities and professions in a modern world.

  Flesh Magic. Flesh magic is about using the conceptual framework of the transformation of flesh over time (AKA biological processes) to create magical effects. The cost for this is the consumption of the flesh in the concept. Here flesh can mean living, fresh, or decaying flesh of plants or animals (anything alive; or technically anything with complex self sustaining chemical processes). The fresh (in minutes) or living flesh of a person (including the mage themself), animal, or plant can be used for most effects, but decaying or cooked flesh has a lot fewer uses. For example:

  * Consume muscle mass to pull something (it can be any direction though), not more than the muscle mass consumed could have, and the amount of mass sacrificed determines how long the enchantment can pull for (though it can be kept and controlled for quite awhile; based on some universal limits).
  * A plant that causes drowsiness can be consumed to put someone to sleep (plant flesh tends to last longer).
  * Consuming edible flesh (e.g. one would have to be able to eat it in the first place) - the less processed and cooked the better - to gain energy and nutrition, which can be further focused into accelerated healing or muscle growth (or fat growth) by conceptualizing the bodies own processes (though this can be tricky to do all at once).
  * Consuming fresh (or living) eyeballs to see like those eyes could, either on yourself directly (lasting longer), or far away (there are universal limits on how remote viewing works).
  * Consuming the regenerating limb of an animal to regenerate that limb (at mass for mass conversion). Natural healing is easy, regenerating limbs is hard (it's about conceptual transformation; an arm cannot grow itself, and a tail that can regenerate cannot regenerate an arm).
  * Blood is a popular choice of flesh that has it's own specialty magic (and hence gained additional related powers over time).

    Just to be clear, when you say consume do you mean ingest or is the flesh being consumed by some magical process? If the former, how long does it take for the effects to manifest? Does the flesh have to be digested? 

    \-Could you consume a (or multiple) seahorse/s in the process of changing sex to cause a similar effect in yourself? Or for that matter, produce asexual from eating enough animals in the process of doing the same. 

    \-I forget which animal (might've been a jellyfish) but there's an animal that can sort of reverse aging. Could you do something significant with that?

    \-electric eels, venomous animals/plants, flying animals, gilled animals?

    \-I wonder if, in regard to the first bullet point, people might have an incentive to breed animals (or, more likely, a specific animal) towards having better muscle density to get more out of less muscle consumed.

    \-I'm curious what exactly counts as alive? There's a pretty obvious incentive for people to maintain an organ's freshness. Perhaps with cooling, artificial stimulation, nutrient solutions, etc.

    \- Breeding Salamanders to get them as large as possible to improve the regeneration process. Also, the axolotl can regenerate basically anything including parts of the brain, which could potentially help with neurodegenerative diseases or in a healthy person it might have enhancive properties.

    \-What happens when you consume brain?

    In the modern era this magic is gonna be mostly used for cosmetic and athletic purposes - rich people are going to have physically ideal bodies as a matter of course, and athletes are going to have bodies hyper-optimized for their sport (and they're also not going to work out - every hour spent doing cardio or pumping iron is an hour you could have spent training or in downtime instead)

    Also what interactions do prion diseases have with this magic? I can't imagine anything good happens.
    ```
