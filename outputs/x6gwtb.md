## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

- u/lsparrish:
  ```
  If any of y'all haven't read [Doing God's Work](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25442/doing-gods-work), I highly recommend it. Top tier supernatural fiction. The metaphysics all has implications and consequences, and while it isn't written in an absurd style, it's consistently funny in an absurd way that follows logically from the subject matter. You might get the idea from the first few chapters that it's just a workplace comedy about Lucifer and Loki (cubicle buddies because of where their names landed in the alphabet) but it quickly develops into a lot more than that. Intrigue, saving the world, a fair bit of transhumanism, and a heck of a lot of munchkinry. Content warning for theists: Yahweh is definitely written as the bad guy, and Lucifer shows all signs of being a decent individual (whose powers have some sucky side effects). There's even a scene we get to see Lucifer play Devil's Advocate for God (not that it changes anything). I guess I'll throw in a content warning for gender bending if that matters to anyone (at the story's start, Loki has been a woman for decades, but isn't especially tied to either form). And it gets dark in some places, not unlike mythology. Part of the book will be leaving Royal Road on September 13th (next week) for Amazon publication.

  Is there something with similar premise to the 3% tv series and explored rationally?


  That is a setting with extreme scarcity conditions with focus on two societies. One is small and advanced and largely moved beyond that, the second is large, relatively primitive and reliant on the the other one.
  ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    The Eloi and Morlocks, perhaps?

    I guess it’s more conventional to tell a story where the 1% is reliant on the manpower of a primitive underclass, but maybe I’m just thinking of the last couple decades of dystopian fiction.

    Arguably some Sanderson—Soulcasters in *Stormlight Archive* are operated only by the priesthood. Not exactly a separate society. *Warbreaker* has its imperial city which combines social isolation with fabulous wealth due to concentrating the setting’s (re)animation magic.

    Oh, how about *Hyperion Cantos*?
    Ridiculous inequality derived from control of portal technology.
    The groups with controlling stakes have houses spanning multiple planets.
    ```

  - u/AgentFransis:
    ```
    Not quite what you asked but in *The Sparrow* you have a planet cohabited by two sentient species. A large population of a herbivore prey species and a small controlling elite of predators. They exist in a delicate and nervous balance.
    ```

- u/gramineous:
  ```
  Odd request and recommendation here, but I'm looking for either:

  -Small scale character-driven stories set up against a backdrop of a much more expansive or dire world that is not the focus of the plot, but adds an interesting context to the story.

  -Character-focused stories where a character intends to pursue their own goals, and is reasonably aware an intelligent, and a/the major difficulty is pulling themselves out of their own inaction or pushing through their own issues to do so.

  I've read two stories recently that have managed to be **both** at once, although with some caveats that make recommending them difficult.

  ___

  [Desperate Times Call for Desperate Pleasures](https://archiveofourown.org/works/37131436/chapters/92638714) is a Worm Fanfic where Taylor triggered with Cherish's canon powerset instead, and resolved the best way for her to try and be a hero was to help individuals who are the biggest emotional disasters. The story starts after Taylor has offered to consenually ~~mind control~~ modify Amy Dallon's emotions to deal with the gaint clusterfuck that she is, starting with her deeply rooted incestuous love for her adoptive sister, with Amy eventually wrangling her internal freak out and vindictiveness to decide to give this hairbrained scheme a try. Taylor decides the best strategy would be to shift the feelings onto a more appropriate target first, then work from there. Amy points out the most obvious solution that Taylor is completely blind to, that they should start pretending to be in a relationship so they can be in proximity to better use Taylor's powers.

  The story is a masterfully written work, that is also a complete and utter trainwreck that makes me feel the full gamut of emotions throughout its highs and lows. The Dean interlude was physically painful to read, but in the way that I want to force other people to have to suffer through it with me. I can not look away.

  So yes, tenative recommendation, because people coming to this subreddit for rational fiction may not want to see people that so completely and utterly fuck things up, despite their best attempts.

  ___

  My second recommendation I can not actually provide links to right now, unfortunately. Bioshifter is the currently Patreon exclusive story the author for [Vigor Mortis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis) is writing. Vigor Mortis has shown up several times in previous recommendation threads, and stands out with its complex and bizarre worldbuilding and a primary protagonist who's perspective is so disjointed from that of a normal person that it is practically that of an alien, even before she starts turning into a weird Eldritch Lich-thing made of magic.

  As far as I know, the current plan Thundamoo has is to get a backlog of 30 chapters ready, then start posting it to Royalroad. The 24th chapter was posted yesterday, so its likely going to start going public within the next month or two. I could try to describe it myself, but the author posted a brief summary attempt on their Discord several weeks ago when someone asked her what Bioshifter was about.

  >Uhhhh I mean a synopsis would be like "Hannah Hiiragi dreams of being something other than human. When the dreams start to get increasingly lucid, however, she finds herself living a double life—waking in a fantasy world as a monster when her human body rests, and waking as a human on Earth when her monster body does. Pretty soon, however, her 'human body' starts changing into something else entirely, and managing two lives becomes increasingly traumatic when both of them are all too real."

  >...or some shit like that.

  >What you need to know about Bioshifter is that it's a slow burn transformation fic featuring a lesbian disaster protagonist who has about as many panic attacks as she does crushes that heavily features themes like 'being chained to the abusive system of modern capitalism with no hope of escape,' and 'the neurodivergant pain of constantly putting on that a public face you barely understand' and 'being a closeted queer in an unfriendly community' and 'boy it sure would be awesome to turn into a sexy bug monster' and 'sdlfhsdjklfhsjkldfhsldjkfha girl, girl p, pret, gorl.'
  And all of this is wrapped up into a high fantasy adventure that somehow manages to be the b-plot

  Essentially, it's somewhere between an "isekai'd as a monster" story (speficially as some kind of fourth-dimensional magic hyper-spider) and "The Metamorphosis," as Hannah's human body on Earth and monster body on a giant floating world tree that's been steadily wasting away from multiple apocalyptic events both begin to converge and morph into a single unified monstrous transformation. Also she can do magic in both worlds now.

  Despite that grand scope, the story itself is focused on Hannah and her relationships to the people around her, which is an interesting contrast to the scope of these events while also echoing her own inability to properly address the importance and danger of her own transformation despite being fully aware of what is going on to her due to her own anxiety and just general issues. The story fluctuates between hilarious and tragic as Hannah is clearly out of her depth and struggling to cope with everything. The best example of what otherwise seems an impossible tone is that Hannah literally has her human teeth start falling out while in the middle of a test at school, and the *literal nightmare scenario* that this is isn't noticed at all as she has to rush off to deal with this sudden disaster and try to prevent people looking too closely at everything going on with her.

  I've greatly enjoyed this story so far, in both how fantastical it is and how relatable I can find Hannah. Having otherwise innocuous lines in the middle of a chapter hit me like a fucking truck is certainly an experience.
  ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    Various books in the Saga of Recluse series have large sections that fit this, although I don't think the whole book does, as the MC almost always gets involved by the end.

    But there will be very large portions where the focus is on the MC learning carpentry or blacksmithing while a war goes on in the background (for example). 

    Very good books, and might be close enough to satisfy the itch. The first and 3rd books (Magic of Recluse and Magic Engineer) are the two that most closely fit, as I recall.
    ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    You might enjoy *China Mountain Zhang*. It's a bildungsroman about a closeted american-born-chinese man in a future where they're colonizing mars. It's not a great fit for what you asked for, but I think it fits what you describe liking.
    ```

  - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
    ```
    So I'm curious. Does Hannah have no support structures? Back when I was in school people were absent for extended periods for far lesser medical issues than her visible symptoms.
    ```

    - u/gramineous:
      ```
      The short version is that Hannah is still acting like everything is normal and going to school regularly, because missing it would be diverging from her routine when she's already stressed, and would get her parents and teachers to start asking questions she's not ready to deal with. To go into more detail... 

      She has a family, but they're not pleasant to deal with. Dad is fairly lackadaisical about things (although he catches Covid around the start of the story, which also makes him be pretty hands off) and her mum is a constant pressure on her that she actively works to pacify or avoid. If you ever had a parent whose idea of raising kids was treating you exactly the way they would treat a younger version of themselves, and ignoring any evidence to the contrary (and ignoring any medically recognised mental health issues too), then you get the gist of the family dynamic. Also she has a brother who I think she hasn't even bothered to name in two dozen chapters. As far as family goes, she lives in the same house as them and not much more.

      In terms of friends, she's got one close friend who is helping and supporting her, but is also aware that Hannah fundamentally isn't able to actually process and respond to things properly if its a major source of stress and only affecting herself, and is trying to do the best he can in that context without compounding her stress or pushing too hard and driving her away. She had a second friend who's kind of completely freaked out by everything happening and dropped Hannah.

      In terms of school, I don't get the impression she's in a particularly good school, which is set somewhere in America's south I think it was, and she's good at covering things up and acting "normal" (masking is a common skill among people dealing with mental illness, especially women, and doubly so in people being in the closet while stuck in a religious and conservative community). A facemask to hide her teeth that's justified as an anti-covid measure, gloves and pants to hide her growing mutations, and the one time she goes to the nurses office she just plays her bleeding feet off as an ongoing health issue and that she wants her privacy respected. People don't see a  calm girl asking a nurse for spare bandages and think ongoing monster transformations.
      ```

      - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
        ```
        All very plausible, and possibly the worst possible response to a health crisis like this.

        Except possibly for the nurse, might the nurse not be a mandatory reporter for something like this? But I could believe she got (un)lucky with the one nurse who breaks that rule.

        Edit. I just noticed you said world tree. I wonder if the author read >!Undermind!< which also has the protagonist be a forth dimensional being who suddenly starts experiencing a second life on a world tree. Though that was more of a heroic fantasy epic than grimdark. I don't think Undermind qualifies as Rational, but its a good story.
        ```

  - u/the_Support_System:
    ```
    That's funny, as I read your request I immediately thought of, and was going to recommend to you, BioShifter. Vigor Mortis is actually my single favorite piece of fiction, bar none.

    I'm going to go read Desperate Times Call for Desperate Pleasures but actually, would you be able to recommend me anything else to read as a fellow fan of Thundamoo?
    ```

    - u/gramineous:
      ```
      Neat, I'll through a few recs here then. Only brief descriptions though. 

      [A Journey of Black and Red](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red) is a vampire story set in America, which starts off in 1803. It's the least Thundamoo-y story here, as the protagonist starts off relatively normal and isn't too keen on the whole "tortured and nonconsenually turned into a vampire by a sadistic monster" thing, but its still an engaging and very well written story with well done worldbuilding, and the protagonist very much grows into her own and reconciles her past humanity with her current self as the story develops. There's been previous recommendations on this subreddit for the work, if that's any marker of quality.

      [Ouroboros Record - Circus of Oubeniel](https://www.yamitranslations.com/p/ouroboros-record-circus-of-oubeniel_62.html?m=1) is a thing I recommend from time to time with serious caveats. It's a questionably written webnovel with a questionably done translation, but stands out as the protagonist is so extremely focused on his immortality research from the moment he is born* (*reincarted through an incredibly traumatic process that stripped away nearly everything from him but an extreme fear of dying again) that his perspective and morality is barely human, and he discovers numerous new applications of magic, applied to his own ends, resulting in truly astounding crimes against humanity. If the story was well written and translated, I do not think I could read the things he does to be honest, but its still an exploration of the horrific and bizarre that's worth mentioning.

      [Be All My Sins](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/be-all-my-sins-40k-si.388340/) is a Warhammer 40K SI fic, of the protagonist getting suddenly dumped into the 40K universe and surviving via the slippery slope of Slaanesh. While the embrace of Chaos and all the corruption alongside it whilst becoming inured to the whole experience is pretty Thundamoo-y, the worldbuilding all piggybacking on someone else's established canon might not be up your alley.

      Edit for two more tangential recommendations:

      [Under The Skin](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/under-the-skin-worm-altpower-body-horror.93343/) is a brief and sort of in-progress wormfic with an alt power Taylor. Not much is written, but what is there is incredibly lurid body horror mixed with a dive into deep trauma. I posted it the other day on Thundamoo's discord and they read through the whole thing, so there's some overlap in interests here.

      [Hollow Hill Archives](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hollow-hill-archives-teletubbies.69481/) is a sci-fi horror story told through found fragments retrieved from a research facility, that questions the nature of humanity, reality, and existence as a whole. It is also a teletubbies fanfic.

  What are your favorite manga?

  I'm only just getting into manga, but two I really like are:

  - [Kaguya-sama: Love is War](https://myanimelist.net/manga/90125/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen)
  - [Sousou no Frieren](https://myanimelist.net/manga/126287/Sousou_no_Frieren)

  Any genres or anything at all is welcome!
  ```

  - u/Aqua-dabbing:
    ```
    I'm a big fan of Kaguya the anime. (Haven't read the manga, it's probably good too.) The characters are explicitly doing stupid teenager things, but it's actually kind of rational: they have a goal (get the other one to confess) and plan for it.

    The characters are schemers, so the layers of planning and counter-planning get somewhat elaborate and are fun to see. Because they're romantically inexperienced teenagers, they make stupid decisions, with hilarious results.

    I recommend this anime to everyone :D
    ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    It's been a long time since I read much in the way of manga, but I used to read a lot of it when I was younger. I'm 100% sure my tastes have changed in the meantime, but there *are* a couple I remember more distinctly than others.

    [Monster](https://myanimelist.net/manga/1/Monster): I remember this having a very compelling story, with unusualy high quality writing and good art. The story starts with a surgeon, who is forced to choose between two patients; the one he operates on might live, but the other *will* die. One patient is an important politician, and the other is some random child. The surgeon decides that morally, he should save the child, right? As it turns out... the child was a psychopath. An unrelenting, hypercompent monster. And so, the story unfolds...

    [Kanata Kara (From Far Away)](https://myanimelist.net/manga/923/Kanata_kara): a young girl is iseki'd into a fantasy setting, where she's found by a man >!she's been prophesized to doom!<. They wander around together, there's some romance, there's some action. But... the parts I remember liking the most about it were the little things. There's a language barrier; the girl doesn't understand the locals (and how could she!), so she slowly learns to communicate as time passes. Hair lengthens with time, and gets cut. Stuff like that. I don't remember much about the actual plot, but I remember loving how thought was put into the details.
    ```

    These are the ones I've read in the last two years that I loved:

    Bakuman - My earlier [recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/wuuf9z/comment/ilc0udt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

    Blue Period - Seconding u/followelectricsheep's rec, see my [recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/s65xby/comment/ht1qoza/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) here.

    Solanin - A beautifully written coming-of-age story weirdly reminiscent of both the Scott Pilgrim comics and Murakami's Norwegian Wood.  Possible the best short manga I've ever read, it's just so calming in a way while being heartbreaking at times.

    Ultimate Rock-Paper-Scissors - Wild, insane, and creative as fuck.  The premise is eight people with different superpowers trying to win a tournament of rock-paper-scissors (who'd've thunk it?).  Pretty rational in how it explores the usage of these powers in my opinion, only downside is that it's so short.

    Pokemon Adventures - If you haven't heard of the manga before, just take my word on that it's *way* better than any other form of Pokemon content.  If you have, the memes about them being grimdark make it seem too one-dimensional in my opinion (apart from being just, not true at all apart from one or two panels).

    Yugami-kun ni wa Tomodachi ga Inai - Another seconded rec.

    Hikaru no Go - See my [recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/mfq6cq/comment/gsoxkpn/) from a while ago here.
    ```

      ```
      Oh shit, haven't seen Hikaru no Go referenced in over a decade! +1 to  Bakuman (author of Death Note), Blue Period, Solanin, Pokemon Adventures (closest thing to the Pokemon GOAT fanfic Game of Champions we're going to get), Yugami, and Hikaru no Go
      ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      I’m assuming one of the grimdark panels is a certain Arbok?

      I didn’t even realize what was going on when I first saw it, partly because it was a flashback in a different volume.

      Actually, reading Adventures through the window of a compilation volume made things incredibly confusing...
      ```

      - u/jozdien:
        ```
        Yep. That wasn't even the darkest moment for me, that would probably be >!Blue and the zombie Pokemon!< or >!Red's body being connected to Lorelie's doll and suffering permanent frost damage to his limbs before being frozen in a block of ice for months!<.

        To be fair though, I first read Adventures in scattered volumes from 1-10 based on which one was available in my library as a kid, so I never really understood it until I read it properly years later.

  - u/jaghataikhan:
    ```
    Three Days of Happiness - short supernatural series about a guy who failed to live up to his potential selling off his lifespan for money. Theme of what makes a life worth living

    Spirit Circle - another short supernatural series about two characters who have been locked in a conflict across their reincarnations over the ages. Themes of sin/guilt and redemption

    Fullmetal Alchemist- best adventure series ever written. About a pair of brothers who are on a quest to get their bodies back after a horrific accident involved in trying to resurrect their deceased mother. Themes of what is the worth of a human soul and the bonds it forges with others

    Monster- long psychological series about a gifted brain surgeon hunting a kid he saves who goes on to become an unrepentant serial killer. Theme about the duality of human nature and the nature of evil

    Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa- GOAT romcom that starts off as a kinda average harem high school series, but has one of the best finales in the medium itself (on par with Monster or FMA IMO). Theme of self-acceptance and being open with loved ones
    ```

  - u/Cosmogyre:
    ```
    **Chainsaw Man**, although I'd wait for the anime in October. Basically a kid works as a devil hunter in a world of devils, and tries to fulfill his dreams. The author, Tatsuki Fujimoto is well known for writing works that play on tropes and expectations. His one-shots, like **Goodbye, Eri**, are really good too. 

    **The Boxer**, a manwha by the same author of **The Horizon**, has just really solid visuals and great characters. Gives us the boxing life of a high-school boy as he goes up against the champions of each category.

    **Happiness** is a really interesting vampire manga, the art really enhances the experience, and the story is... unique-ish? Pretty unique I'd say. At the very least, it's realistic. 

    **Pseudo Harem** is a cute romance manga about a girl and a boy in an acting club who start as friends and get closer. No actual harem. More of a short comedy format for each chapter, but it gets longer as it goes. Also pretty realistic, as these things go. 

    **Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou** is ... a wholesome? story about two sisters trekking through a post-apocalyptic Escher-like urban dystopia. Sometimes depressing, sometimes heartwarming.

    Seconding the recs for **Oshi no Ko**, **Blue Lock, Ajin, Monster, Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors, Yugami-kun,** and **Three Days of Happiness.** All very good manga, although I'd say **Ajin, Oshi no Ko,** and **Monster** are really really good.
    ```

  - u/Nnaelo:
    ```
    There's a lot of rankings available online you can look up, so I'll recommend a lesser known piece: *Angel Densetsu*. The art is terrible, and it's old. It's also hilarious, and something I wish more people in my friend group had read. If you like Kaguya, you'll probably like it.

    I still feel compelled to shout out *Fullmetal Alchemist*, or anything else by Hiromu Arakawa, really. 

    Personal favorite, though, would be *Ajin*. It's a Tarantino movie in paper form, pretty much. *Spirit Circle* would be the runner up.

    Back when i read manga I liked the weird stuff you'd never see get adapted. Note all of these have a plethora of trigger warnings I can't properly recall at this point.

    ```

  - u/followelectricsheep:
    ```
    **Blue Period** is a story of a listless high school student discovering his passion for art. 

    **Oshi no Ko,** by the same author as Kaguya, is a critical look at the entertainment industry (idols + acting). 

    **Saihate no Paladin** is a thoughtful isekai in the same vein as Frieren. 

    **Yugami-kun ni wa Tomodachi ga Inai** is legitimately the funniest comedy I've ever read, and is about a boy who is 100% satisfied with being alone. 

    I'm kind of hesistant about recommending this, as it's dead because the author went around molesting middle school children on a bike.... but **Act-Age** is about a poor genius actress entering the entertainment industry. It was really surprising because there was literally zero fanservice, and it was an extremely charming coming-of-age story.... ahhhh. The artist still deserves lots of love. 

    **Blue Lock** is a soccer manga that, like lots of other sports manga, makes zero sense and has awful pacing. However, the art is gorgeous, everyone is fucking unhinged, and it is *very* entertaining.

  ```
  [Dying for a Cure](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/56014/dying-for-a-cure) seems like it'll (eventually) be up people's alley - it's taking a while to get going, but it seems like the story is going to focus quite a bit on munchkining skills. There's also a single iteration time loop (starts in the prologue, so it's not much of a spoiler, though honestly I'd recommend skipping the prologue then going back and reading it when it's time (you'll know when)).

  For more details: an MC with incurable cancer gets isekaied to a magical realm. But it turns out the magic of the realm is "everyone gets assigned a unique skill", and the majority of healing skills just improve regeneration - which makes cancer worse. 

  Fortunately, at some point someone got together a collection of skills that allow other skills to be branded onto a person's body from a library of collected skills, so all our plucky MC needs is to get access to that library and probably synergize together a bunch of skills that nobody's ever used before to cure his pancreas.

  The MC's own skill is useful but banned, and unfortunately there's a bunch of paladins running around who can tell if you're lying.
  ```

  - u/Dont_be_offended_but:
    ```
    This was a tough read.

    * At 93k words, the vast majority of the story has been the protagonist following people around and demanding exposition from them.
    * The protagonist is whiny, rude, arrogant, and petulant, which might be fine as character traits, but other characters never properly react to him behaving that way making most interactions feel unbelievable. The way it's written makes me worry that the author is somehow unaware of how offputting his behavior would be in person.
    * Frequently, dialogue and context would explain or imply something very clearly only for the protagonist to demand it be explained, leading to significant repetition.

    While the world seems like it might allow for munchkinry, so far I have only seen irrational character interactions and an absence of critical thinking on the part of the protagonist.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      I have to agree with this, particularly the protagonist's abrasive personality. It's especially irritating because, despite his own blatant rudeness, the protagonist is super affronted anytime another character is slightly rude back to him.

      One especially memorable scene: The MC spends an entire interview ranting at someone about how backwards and primitive her culture is compared to his own. He does this with seemingly no self awareness of the fact that her generosity has kept him from dying on the streets and given him the ability to even function in society. She patiently listens to him through it all without insulting him back, then at the end she makes one snarky comment that causes the MC to instantly switch to hating her.
      ```

      - u/Dont_be_offended_but:
        ```
        I was bothered by the church scene where he came as a charity case seeking healing and ended up arguing with the priest's beliefs, which he only vaguely understood, and yelling about the god's intentions. How hard is it to be polite for 20 minutes while this guy erases your pain, educates you about the world, and clothes you?

        And another time later the summoner guy chastised him for sharing a secret when truth discerning guards exist only for him to *immediately* start asking about the guy's own secrets.
        ```

        - u/chiruochiba:

      Charitably, I think there's an aspect that everyone thinks he's a child and so writes it off a bit. Similarly being a terminal cancer patient at 17 probably doesn't do wonders for your psyche and I can see a line going from having a terminal cancer diagnosis to never being called out on your shitty behaviour leading to being insufferable. 

      I would normally write this up to author's personality bleeding through, but the rest of the cast has actually been quite normal and mostly nice

    I like the MC's motivations. Go home but with a bunch of cool magic to keep sounds like what I'd do if I ended up in a fantasy world somehow.

    Especially grating for me is the worldbuilding that is seemingly there to solve a problem the writer wants solved, instead of being internally consistent or rational. 

    An example:

    He spends time at the fancy power Broker’s office. Here, the author wants us to finally discover the MC’s Skill, and has even set up a little shell game via phrasing (which is fine, I even enjoyed it). So there’s a little throwaway dialogue which boils down to “oh, we have an XYZ which can check that for you!”. 

    The problem is anybody with “Black Magic” (stuff that causes death or something) is instakilled by angry mobs or angry paladins. Even a rumor will get someone killed, no questions asked. 


    So why isn’t everyone mandated to have their Skill read, and then just execute the people you don’t like? Why isn’t ***everything*** considered black magic? 


    In this universe, if I have the skill to create water, I’d be on my merry way. In reality, I can think of a hundred ways to kill somebody or do some evil shit with fiat backed water production. 



    I feel like there’s an interesting story in here, revolving around the religious conspiracy, the Skills vs Brands & heaven, and getting a guy who is clearly flirting with the rational adjacent trope of abusing the hell out of a magic system back to earth, hopefully with some magic retained. 


    This is aside from the quality of the writing, which was covered in another post. It’s fine-ish IMO for RR but clearly could use major help. 🤷🏼‍♂️

      > So why isn’t everyone mandated to have their Skill read, and then just execute the people you don’t like?

      That's the basic policy in the [Book of the Dead](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47038/book-of-the-dead) world. MC got a necromancer class, and trouble ensued. >!The authorities put out a kill / capture order on the MC... to be enforced by his own parents (high-level combat classes). More trouble ensued.!<

      > I feel like there’s an interesting story in here, revolving around the religious conspiracy, the Skills vs Brands & heaven, ...

      There's actually some of that in Book of the Dead. Has been interesting so far. Recommended... if that wasn't already clear.

          Without spoilers I will say that I was a little put off by some early elements of the story.  I stuck with it, and things have moved in a better direction since then.

    The idea was fine, but I didn't like the main character, and the pacing had too much exposition.  Hard pass from me.

  A bit of tangential self-promotion here, for a board game so ignore if you are not into that, but definitely think this is the sort of thing we're into:

  I am in the last day of a [Kickstarter for a 2-8 player card game called Cosmos: Empires](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/biggerworldsgames/cosmos-empires-a-galactic-engine-building-card-game).

  It is an engine-building card game mechanicaly a little like Machi Koro but feels more like Space Base and Race for the Galaxy. Its rules are tight but the synergies between the cards and players are many and often unexpected.

  Please do ask any questions if you have them! and sorry to all those only here for the novels (' ^ . ^ )

      Trawling OPs history, they have ties with the author of "I woke up as a dungeon, now what?"  which gets recommended here sometimes. 

      Apparently they built a Text-to-Speech app optimized for webnovels, which does fit our crowd.

        Yeah I comment here commonly, would say I'm part of the community but whether I am or not  doesn't change that I think its a good fit :)

      So it is an engine builder, that is the standard 'craft your combo' synergies. Its main mechanic is rolling 2 D4 which the total of which decides what cards produce... BUT! The twist here is that you may use one if your actions (which you have 2-3 per turn and need them to build more cards) to CHANGE the total you rolled up or down by one. 

      This creates a really interesting game theory: where the optimum setup is to be part of 'the most smallest groups'. You want to match production values with your rivals, but the second most of the board has a value, that value becomes 'worthless'.

      Or to put another way: if you have the choice between 'everyone gets something' or 'me and one other get something' the second is what you would choose, and hence you want to fit into the second category as much as possible. 

      I cant claim it's the best game out there, but I think for using established mechanics to create a novel experience it is very good. :)

        Can a beginner to card games play this with some successes?(I have no idea how card games work) Note: I am willing to learn, and I am overall decent at theory crafting builds in other games
        ```

        - u/Dragfie:
          ```
          Yes, compared to most modern board games it is extremely straightforward. 

          Note the campaign has completed but if you would still like a copy you can pre-order one there is a link from the Kickstarter page.

    An indie card game for 2-8 players? And it's Australian to boot so I don't have to pay a fortune in currency exchange/shipping?

    Heck yes. Backed!
