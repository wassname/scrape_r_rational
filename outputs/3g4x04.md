## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I've recently been thinking about getting sued by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. I've had this idea for a steampunk/biopunk Tarzan book for a long time, but here's the catch; while a large number of the Tarzan books are in the public domain due to their age, making the character a public domain character (per the Sherlock Holmes ruling last year), ERB pursues people in another way. They claim *trademark* on the character of Tarzan, not copyright. Since trademark lasts forever, they're not at risk of losing it unless someone challenges them.

  So if I tried to write a Tarzan book, even one that was only loosely based on that character, I would almost certainly get sued by them as soon as I tried to sell it (especially since trademark requires that you defend your trademark in order to keep it).

  But I kind of want to poke that bear anyway, because I think using trademark law to effectively keep a public domain character out of the public domain is total bullshit. The problem is that no one has ever called ERB on it; the cases get settled out of court, with either the literature suppressed or a "license" agreement reached, which is really nothing more than extortion. It's a very winnable case (hypothetically) that no one has been stubborn enough to weather.

  So I've been thinking about how much work it would be to write this book so that I could get into a protracted legal battle with a large corporation. It sounds fun, if unwise.

      Sneaking around the trademark isn't hard. I just think it's unjust that I'd have to do that, and I think it would result in a weaker story.

      Fanfiction (for me) isn't about creating *more* of the work, it's about *making a commentary on the work*. The very first draft of "The Metropolitan Man" was actually a genericized version of the flying brick superhero and the genius mad scientist, both scrambled enough that they'd be able to slip past copyright claims. But it lost the cultural connections, the dramatic irony, and a good deal of the voice. /u/eliezeryudkowsky writes about a more specific form of this in his ["Explaining Other Universes"](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/other-universes) article.

      The Tarzan books are largely about a rejection of civilization. They're about the wonder and beauty of nature, along with the confidence and self-sufficiency of the ideal man. So the point of writing a book about Tarzan, for me, would be to turn that on its head. Civilization is *awesome* and nature kind of *sucks*. But without that underpinning of what Tarzan is, you lose some of that message, or you have to spend some time building it up. You weaken the commentary.

      I don't know. It always sort of bugs me in movies or television shows when they have to use the legally-distinct-from-but-you-can-totally-tell-what-we-mean thing with a wink and a nod to the audience.

        Have you considered contacting The Volokh Conspiracy (1st Amendment Lawbloggers).

            That's what I'm getting at. The difference in the way people read a story about Tarzan and not quite Tarzan isn't going to be greatly different. Because there's been so many "we know it's really Tarzan"s.

            The other thing you can do is not name anyone, or use a pseudonym in-world that avoids having to use 'real names'. That's what T. A. Waters did with Sherlock Holmes in _The Probability Pad_.

      I've e-mailed both the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Organization for Transformative Works, mostly in trying to figure out whether the Holmes case applied to Tarzan (which it *probably* doesn't because it's copyright vs. trademark, but ERB isn't really operating in a known legal area). It's slightly outside the wheelhouse for both of them. I'm still in the middle of a bunch of other writing work, so unless I take this book as my NaNo project it's going to be a ways off. It's mostly something that I've been idly toying with.

    Downside - tons of effort, and expense. Upside - free publicity, and making the world a better place. I would also be willing to throw in $100 for the effort, though I realize that is a drop in the bucket. Not even enough to cover a lawyer for one hour, right?

    As others said though, you can change the name just a tiny bit and be OK, I believe. Star Trek is still covered under copyright, yet John Scalzi wrote "Redshirts" simply by using different names. All the cultural references are in tact because it is so blatantly Star Trek that only someone who hasn't ever seen Star Trek would miss it (and at that point, they wouldn't get the cultural references anyway). Though maybe they weren't as hard on him, seeing as he's really popular, and has money, and the Star Trek characters were mostly cameo's in a Redshirt-focused story.

  **Sex Change Pill**

  Was reading some of the culture books, when the idea of a pill that allows you to change your sex got me thinking. (Sidenote: I really disliked how the fact that Culture species can change sex at will; that  kind of ability would destroy any notion of gender roles, but the culture still seems to keep them).

  Imagine a small, tasteless pill that can change your sex over 48 hours. It induces a harmless, but debilitating fever to do so, but once done, the transformation is perfect. Your organs and your dna all change, and you experience no dysphoria. It's relatively cheap, your sexual orientation stays the same and there's no side effects of changing sex frequently.

  What do you guys think the effect this will have on society?

  Personally, I think the female sex will be vastly reduced, almost to the point of extinction. The male body has several physical  advantages over the female, and many females would seek the pill purely because (they think) they will get more respect as a man than a woman. 

  Within a few generations, humanity will become sequentially hermaphroditic. Everyone is born a male and dies a male, but some will change into a woman for procreation and certain social functions. I have absolutely no clue how gender roles will change because of this. Thoughts?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Fringe benefits: intersexed people can now opt out of that condition, transgendered people can presumably get their dysphoria cured.

    Presuming sexual orientation stays constant through the transformation, I don't think that you'd see a substantial reduction in the female population. If people still cared about love, romance, etc. then women would have to stay women in order to be able to have boyfriends (something like 90% of the population is strictly heterosexual).

    That's even if I accept the premise that there are substantial advantages to being a man, which I don't. It's my preferred gender in terms of utility, but the world isn't inconvenient to women in terms of physical strength; I can think of maybe two times in the last two few years that my wife required my superior strength in order to accomplish some task. The question of status is arguable; I think it's more likely that the erosion of benefits for men would come to its completion, rather than a mass migration of women becoming men.
    ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    I could see people take the pill every couple of weekends, if it was safe enough. Who needs menstrual cramps, just turn male for that time of month...

    The technology involved would almost certainly include pills that repair or replace damaged organs, eliminate cancer, and provide other body mods from tattoos and tails up to full species transformations. SF cons will be insane, and gamer cons you won't be able to move without bouncing off a Tauren.

    > (Sidenote: I really disliked how the fact that Culture species can change sex at will; that kind of ability would destroy any notion of gender roles, but the culture still seems to keep them).

    Gender is performative and not strictly aligned with notions of biological sex.

    The Culture says that everyone should ideally bear one child and sire one child, but you can conform to one gender through both. The Culture also has people who take on bodies that diverge hugely from standard. These bodies don't necessarily have any morphological traits that would allow you to assign a gender even if you insisted that a particular biological sex mandates that you have a particular gender.

    > Personally, I think the female sex will be vastly reduced, almost to the point of extinction.

    > Within a few generations, humanity will become sequentially hermaphroditic.

    That would take a long time. Most people put huge stock in their gender identities, strongly connect gender to biological sex, and view both as immutable. That would be enough to fix most of the current generation once free sex change pills were introduced. But it's more extreme than that. People put a lot of importance on the sex and associated gender of their children, and that starts even before birth.

    If you introduced these pills and mandated that children must have free access to them, then you'd see a huge change. (Little girls know it's bullshit that little boys get away with acting out more and doing fewer chores, and they haven't had as much time to become attached to their assigned gender, much less their reproductive organs.) But for the most part, parents wouldn't allow their kids to use them. And then, by the time the kid is old enough to enjoy legal protections, their gender identity will probably be fixed in place and they'll probably firmly attach their gender to their biology.

    Realistically, if you can change someone's sex whole hog, you can probably make it so they don't have periods and can alter their breast size at will. Certainly with another couple generations of research. That takes care of the most annoying parts of being female in terms of biology.
    ```

  - u/Sagebrysh:

    I sort of disagree with the notion that there would be more men. I actually think you'd see a lot more women in general. I know, as a woman, I'd prefer to remain that way.

    That the Culture has gender roles is Ian Banks failing at feminism.  That they change sex at will is *part of the point*: they can't develop too large an inequality between males and females because people will vote with their genitalia.

    >Personally, I think the female sex will be vastly reduced, almost to the point of extinction. The male body has several physical advantages over the female, and many females would seek the pill purely because (they think) they will get more respect as a man than a woman. 

    This seems to assume that patriarchy (eg: a "standard-issue" favoring of masculine over feminine) is an Eternal Fact.

    It isn't.

  **Multi-bodied hiveminds**

  In hard-SF, what do you like or dislike most about relatively singular intelligences housed in multiple bodies? Is there any variation that you've hoped to encounter, but never quite seen? Do you feel any versions have become overused to the point of cliches? Are there any particular details that an authour writing about such things should be careful not to be tripped up by? Are there any other aspects to an idea that a rational/ist authour might want to be especially focussed on?

What's really fascinating about these teams, Jim, is their vastly differing approach to the brain-linking that's mandated by the Tines League: While the Men of War use only the minimum level of integration by merging visual fields, location data, and proprioperception, the Octopodes actually sacrifice a member to the sidelines and centralize their brainpower in him, trusting that his ability to view the entire field at once, devise complex strategies and tactics, and forecast the moves of the opposing team will outweigh their lack of his physical abilities."

    You need to synchronize state between each node. This is an interesting problem, and the design you choose affects so much about the experience.

    The most obvious way is to have one consciousness running and controlling many physical nodes at once. This brings up many issues very quickly. Do you distribute the consciousness across the physical nodes? If not, you guarantee that the nodes can't operate independently; if one of them gets in a car that enters a tunnel, you lose control of it. If so, you find yourself splitting often, and you have to implement some way of merging back together later.

    An efficient and relatively fault-tolerant way to go is to fork your consciousness into each node. Then, periodically, you assimilate the new memories and personality changes from each node in an elected master (in the distributed computing sense, not a political sense), produce a new version of your personality and memories, and distribute that to each node. But how long does that take? And can your nodes continue functioning (accruing new memories and personality changes) during this process?

    You could have a dedicated master and a series of clones. The clones go out, do specific tasks, then return to the master and submit their new memories to it. Then they reset to the master's current state and accept new orders. This workflow and organizational change means you don't care about personality changes from the clones, which in turn means you *can't* care about personality changes -- you always want to use the master to go on dates or watch _Grave of the Fireflies_.

    You could have a series of independent nodes from the same base sharing memories. Since they are independent, they can have diverging personalities based on which memories they lived locally and the order in which they acquire each others' memories. This is the mechanism used by Pandora in CeruleanSlane's Atonement.

      This is sounding like it will start into Git Hell really quickly.

      Like, are you *merging in* new memories and personality changes, or *rebasing* them?

      As with git, the actual time at which something happened might eventually have nothing to do with the ordering and causality of the experiences relative to the subject's consciousness.

    - u/KZLightning:

      It is not inevitable because it is hard. The reason incompetence is so common is because of how the government is structured. Governments do not always reward those who do a good job. Sometimes they reward those who know the right people, believe the right things or look pretty.

      It is true that adding additional resources will not fix the problem. The reason the problem is made worse sometimes is because poor structure may reward failure. Adding additional resources adds extra incentive and chances to fail harder and in additional ways.

      Fixing the structure of government so that it is merit-based is the goal of political science and political philosophy. It has yet to happen. (Although I have interesting suspicions about crowd-based governmental structure.)

  **Tell me what hat to buy**

  My usual headgear has been a floppy tan boonie hat, which has been reasonably good at shading my eyes during hikes both urban and rural. It's getting due for replacement; and I'd like a baseball-cap-style hat to replace it.

  Due to needing a replacement laptop, my funds are limited. I want to try out some "crache" safety inserts, so an opaque hat would be best. I'm leery about announcing my allegiance to random corporations, so if there's a logo, I'd prefer to customize it, or for it to be as innocuous as possible - maybe the hacker logo, or my provinces's shield.

  What subreddits, forums, or other online groups would be willing to treat such a fashion question seriously, without mocking of, say, using a photographer's vest instead of a daypack on many hikes, or otherwise belittling someone with a traditional nerd's lack of any sense of style?

  Desiderata: 

  1. Electricity and magnetism must work more or less as we see them. Differing in details is fine, as long as you could still make a battery, electric motor, and lightbulb that would look the same to casual inspection.

  2. Mechanics should look the same at human scale.

  3. It would also be nice if it could incorporate the luminiferous aether being a real thing, somewhere obvious to stick hacks to thermodynamics (science may obey conservation of energy, but SCIENCE! clearly does not), or inexplicable reasons why steam power and zeppelins are popular.

  Any suggestions that feel plausible are welcome.

    We-ell, an obvious reason for steam engines would be if the thermodynamics hack was good for creating heat or increasing the expansion rate of steam.

Engine to pull energy out of some background field given enough energy to start it.

    The sci-fi and adventure audience does tend to be male-centric.  I'm sure there are more female readers of both genres now than there were decades ago, but successful writers tend to write for larger audiences.
