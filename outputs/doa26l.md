## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Ant Homework](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ant-homework-worm.369635/) is a Worm fic where Taylor’s ‘instantly know how many bugs you have’ sense is turned up to its logical extreme. She ends up making an artificial intelligence out of her bugs.

      Why do you say that?  I can't see any updates in the last year.

      Great fic though!

        I haven't checked the fic in a while (it went into hiatus in 2016) and when I saw a "new" update I thought it was recent. Sorry if I sparked false hope.

  I am looking for self insert fanfiction that takes itself seriously. I find it odd that most self inserts treat their new life in a fictional world as a game to have a fun adventure in rather than an existential crisis.

  - u/major_fox_pass:

    [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) is the obvious one.

    There's one about a guy that gets dropped in the World of Warcraft with all setting knowledge removed. For the first stretch of the story he stays out of trouble, learns the local language and helps out with menial jobs.

    I can't find it right now, but have opened up a TOMT on it.

  I've been looking for some apocalypse survival series. I started [*R U In?*](https://ruinsaga.com/), which is pretty good but isn't completely rational.

  The "dropped in the middle of the wilderness, have to make my way home before I starve/freeze" survival, like *Hatchet* by Gary Paulsen, or *Dear Chloe* by Matt Stephens (the latter is a web series but also published on amazon) is good too. Really just something where the MC or a group use their wits to survive without having to really on too many tropes.

  ~~e: linking isn't working but here's the site for the first series - [ruinsaga.com](https://ruinsaga.com/)~~
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Not quite what you're looking for, but it's so good I'm gonna recommend it anyway: [Apocalypse Born](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26974/apocalypse-born) explores an IMO really interesting aspect of the apocalypse (a System apocalypse in this case): what happens after the initial wave of suck? What happens when everyone starts building towns and having kids? 

    The main character is one of the first children born after the apocalypse, and it follows him as he figures out what to do in this still dangerous but kinda explored world. 

    More in line with your request, there's [Life of Numbers](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23018/life-of-numbers) which also has an interesting twist - it's not quite a system apocalypse, it's more of a system reset apocalypse. There was a very lightweight system before the story begins, but then all of a sudden everyone's stats reset and everything goes nuts.

    There is a pretty well produced podcast called "we're alive" about a group of people trying to live through a zombie apocalypse if that interests you. I wouldn't call it rational but the acting is pretty spot on, and although zombie is pretty generic they do go in an interesting direction as the series progresses
    ```

  - u/JustForThis167:
    ```
    Don't know if you'll like this type of story, but ill put it here anyway. [Survival](https://mangadex.org/title/18675/survival-shounen-s-no-kiroku) is a grim story about a boy who is trapped on an island after an apocalypse. Warning that this shit is depressing and genuinely made me reconsider if finishing the series was good for my mental.

  I'm looking for written fiction featuring protagonists that have unusual or **alien value systems**. Examples are [ELLC](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests) where >!the MC is a mimic!<, and [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) where >!the MC is created in a bio-experiment!<.

  I find it amusing how such MCs consistently subvert expectations and break with the tropes I'm used to seeing, and the outside perspective on humanity is often funny. Any recommendations?
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Well-written dungeon core stories might scratch your itch? [Thieves' Dungeon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27261/thieves-dungeon) for instance, is based around a core who might have been neurotypically human at some point but is definitely a psychopath now, and [The Concubine's Tomb](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20846/the-concubines-tomb-a-dungeon-core-novel) has a definitely human-based dungeon core who doesn't really want to fight the insatiable bloodlust inherent in his new state. 

    Also, there's a bunch of stories with theoretically human people but who have particularly alien value systems. For instance, the main character of [The Godking's Legacy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10703/the-godkings-legacy) is theoretically human-ish (she's a squirrelkin) but has a decidedly atypical view of reality; it's mostly a joke story, though.

    There's also [The Perks of Immortality](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21623/the-perks-of-immortality), where the main character is kind of in a time loop (it's complicated) but he has all sorts of perks that greatly distort his values compared to normal humans.

    Edit: Oh also I totally forgot about [Vainqueur the Dragon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon), which hits all of your points; one of the main characters is a dragon, who obviously has an entirely different value system than everyone else.

    Edit edit: Also I didn't forget this one, but I thought it'd been abandoned until it was updated today: [A Beginner's Guide to Napping... &c](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26127/a-beginners-guide-to-napping-sunbathing-and-slaughtering) features a house cat protagonist who gets his fuzzy little ass isekai'd, and proceeds to terrorize the local wildlife. It's mostly told from his point of view. He's very similar to Vainqueur, now that I think about it.
    ```

    - u/TheVenomRex:
      ```
      Do you have any other dungeon recs?

      I have been greatly enjoying there is no loot here only puns, so I guess my main priority be that they be engaging.

        ```
        I liked [Bunker Core](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/17051/bunkercore), it's by the same author as Threadbare. 

        [Blue Core](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core) is also fairly good, though there is a dose of NSFW consentacles. 



        [Heather the Necromancer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27287/heather-the-necromancer) seems to be heading in a dungeon building direction, though the "dungeons" are actually extensions of some character classes.
        ```

    Are webcomics okay? [Demon Eater](http://demoneater.thecomicseries.com/) is an intriguing one.

    The MC is a member of a species where eat or be eaten is the default assumption.

    ```

  - u/4t0m:
    ```
    The [Crystal Trilogy](http://crystal.raelifin.com/) has several unique alien (A.I.) value systems sharing a "body"/"brain".

    Not very trope-y or funny and in my experience the series was hit-or-miss, but I don't regret reading.

  I read this a while ago, but I don't think I've recommened it to /r/rational. [Should the Sun Not Rise](https://shouldthesun.wordpress.com/) is a completed urban fantasy webfic. I'd give a more in-depth description, but the teaser on the site is superior to anything I'd come up with off the cuff.

  I do the Rattle Fiction podcast and I am looking for works of rational fiction to narrate. 

  Most helpful would be responses from authors themselves suggesting stories and giving permission to narrate. PM is also ok. 

  I strongly prefer stories that are

  * shorter (<50K words )
  * finished
  * have not been voice narrated before
  ```

- u/Sonderjye:

  I saw the newest Men in Black recently and it occurred to me that I would love to read about how you realistically could keep the knowledge of a radically different parallel society secret. Does anyone know a rat!Men-In-Black or similar?

    ```
    [Contratto](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7127255) (15k words, by Alexander Wales) is largely about someone working to maintain secrecy for a society of vampires.
    ```

- u/JustForThis167:
  ```
  Destiny's Crucible 6 is out for anyone who's reading it.

  About a engineer sent back in time to the medieval - renaissance period. Probably the most realistic 'rational' story I've ever read.

  [Prae](http://golem-studios.com/prae.php). A work in progress table top gaming system. The designer is focusing on less 'rule of cool' story telling and more on gameplay. The setting integrates magic into the worlds economy and reduces its scope compared to games like D&D. 

  Mana is a resource that people receive each day while sleeping. Spending mana creates a localized magical debt in the area. Debt can be paid down by offering prayers of mana to one of three presences. No one is sure what they are and different cultures have different ideas about what they represent and which ones they should be offering prayers to. 

  If debt is not paid down over time monsters are created. The cultures in the world developed different ways of deciding structure societal mana use. One is nomadic as mana debt is localized to a geographical location. Another has high percentage of warriors to fight off the monsters. Another creates laws around who can use their mana and developed a temples to create social pressure for the average person to offer their mana as prayers.

  The system is structured without dependency on the setting, so if you wanted to make your own you could create a cost for mana use other than monsters.

    That's a really neat idea.  It would make war even more devastating too, which could make for some interesting campaigns.  I've always liked the idea of setting trying to work monsters into the World Economy.  The nominally naughty game the Last Sovereign talks about this.
    ```

    - u/zzyni:
      ```
      The adventure I was apart of an adventure centered around taking back an old keep from some monsters. Previously one of the nomadic tribes was at war with a medieval Europe analogue. The nomadic tribe just dumped a lot of debt near the keep then backed out and waited for the monsters to soften up the target. That the debt primarily cares about a region certainly makes war with a stationary culture interesting. 



      Mana is also transferable between creatures and objects that can contain it. So it can essentially be money. However the human capacity is 3, which is how much they regain each night. Finding gemstones, called Tears in their world, that can contain a lot of mana is important to storing mana over time or from a group to cast large scale rituals. Thus villages are limited in by both having access to Tears (mana batteries) and by how the they control spending it as not to attract to much monster attention.

  Started reading The Eighth Warden, based on the recommendations posted in these weekly threads.

  In Chapter Six, Corec references vegetables:

  > To get rid of potato blight, you need to completely clear out any infected plants. Any potato plants at all, really. Then leave the field fallow for a year, or plant a crop that isn’t susceptible—no potatoes, no tomatoes

  Is this good advice? Do fantasy worlds have to have the Columbian exchange?
  ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Yes, you don't know which plants have the blight on them, some won't be visible yet, so they all have to go. The rot especially shows during storage: the mold loves cool, humid environments and is able to move and spread on it's own. You then have to wait for the spores in the soil to die off or they will just infect the next crop and keep reproducing. The mold isn't very good at surviving outside of host plants so a year without hosts(of any kind) will clear the area. Fallowing it might be dangerous though, any potato plants left behind will keep the disease alive on them.

    Your second question is too vague. Potatoes and tomatoes are from the new world, in the real world.
