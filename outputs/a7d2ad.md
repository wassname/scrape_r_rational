  Bookmarked, thanks.

  Speaking of KSP fanfics, does the first part of Seveneves come across as a KSP fanfic to you?

    If KSP were more about resource management and ISRU in the stock game then I remember it being, Seveneves might be a KSP fic. But as it stands, Seveneves is more like ... a dating sim? None of the major tech work is done by the protagonists, as I recall.
