## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  How might a world work if it ran in the opposite direction to our universe - starting from maximal entropy and moving towards order? What would physics look like? Biology? I'm willing to stretch outside of the strictly scientific realm here, so "exactly like our universe, but backward" is not really a useful answer. Using as a base for a fantasy setting.

    Philosophically speaking, it should look indistinguishable from a normal entropy-increasing universe from the inside. This is because cognition itself relies on processes that increase entropy. Learning about the environment entangles the mind with its surroundings and increases their mutual information, which correlates to entropy increase (I think; I'm not a physicist). So there must be something else different about your fantasy universe to resolve this philosophical discrepancy. Perhaps the inhabitants increase in entropy while everything else decreases.

      Physics is not fully time invariant. There are physical processes which we can observe that will show us the direction of time even if time itself reverses. [Neutrino Oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation) for example is not time invariant.

        This does not matter to the issue of cognition. The time directions are distinguishable by such oscillations, but there is no objective "forward" dimension: the type of oscillations you associate with "forward" is arbitrary. Wave function collapse also cannot provide a time direction if you assume basically any QM interpretation that is not Copenhagen. Only entropy can provide a sense of time direction, and it is deeply tied to cognition. (Source: Sean Carroll's time lectures on the Great Courses)

          All true. I was just pointing out that this universe would not look "...indistinguishable from a normal entropy-increasing universe from the inside. " is all.
