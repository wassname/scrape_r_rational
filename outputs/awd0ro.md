## Does this belong here? It looks like there are plans to transform Mother of Learning into a web comic but it's only the first page.

  A story like Mother of Learning with large amounts of internal narration and thoughts sounds... tricky to adapt into more visual mediums, but I'm interested in seeing if this can pull it off.

    Death Note is like 86% internal narration, it did fine!

  Why the manhwa format?

      All those panels that look like someone taking a picture in the vague direction of the subject.

        The story is in the photobombs

      So much hate for the whitespace.

  Best of luck to it, but it looks pretty bad honestly.

  Tee hee hee, I love the final dramatic reveal of... a dumpy nerd. This would be awesome if it got off the ground!

  Does it have the authors ok? If not i really doent like it, if it does, still looks kinda bad. But i really hope no one abuses the material without the authors ok , as i still think it will get really big if it gets a book release.

    Yeah, the author is fine with it.

          >  In America, fanfiction is always copyright infringement.

          This is not true. In many cases — perhaps most — fanfiction qualifies as fair use by three of the four tests enumerated in 17 USC §107. On top of that, it's estimated^1 most fanfiction is also sufficiently transformative to not qualify as a derivative work at all.

          The landmark case here is _Campbell v. Acuff-Rose_, but _Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin Co._ is probably more immediately relevant.

          > In the american fanfic community, any author educated on the legal realities of the practice doesn't give a damn about permission, because permission has no legal weight. It grants nothing. It protects nothing.

          This is also not true. In the event of an infringement lawsuit — which is always a possibility, even when the work should clearly not be considered infringing, because [frivolous litigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frivolous_litigation) is a thing — the ability to prove that permission was given is, at the very least, likely to dramatically reduce the defendant's legal fees.

          In this particular case, permission may actually be legally necessary, because _this is not fanfiction_; it is only an adaptation of the work into a new medium, and those usually attempt to minimize transformativity in order to remain faithful to their respective original works. It fails on at least two of the four factors of fair use (2. nature of the original work, 3. amount and substantiality), and — given the above — many judges may rule it also fails on a third (1. purpose and character).
