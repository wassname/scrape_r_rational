## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?

  How much do you track your finances? I keep a spreadsheet that tracks my monthly outlays and expenditures and categorizes them by type. Every month, I examine my credit card and bank statements (and reference receipts if need be) and enter in all my outlays and income. 

  Each page in my spreadsheet is a month, and at the front of the spreadsheet is a page with 
  [graphs](http://i.imgur.com/X5ebWet.png) and a page with tables. This lets me identify trends in my spending and saving. Basically every dollar that I gain or lose is tracked in some way, though small cash transactions between friends are not.

  Since I started doing this a couple years ago, I've become more careful and conscientious about my spending. If I spent too much one month, I am aware of it, and I also know how and where I spent too much money. It has helped me build savings.

  Do you do something similar? If so, how?

    > How much do you track your finances?

    Not very. Mostly out of laziness and lack of immediate need, I guess. I tried using [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) for a little while but didn't get much from it. I don't make a lot right now, though, so the consequences of any inefficiency now are likely to be small (grad student stipend is $20k-40k per year, depending on what I do or what sort of funding I'm on, and my wife makes a similar amount). 

    Mostly money's deposited into my/our bank account(s) automatically and we use a variety of credit cards to buy groceries or toys, pay rent and utilities, travel, etc. (well, rent requires a check, but we use credit cards to make almost all other purchases). Card balances are then automatically paid in full every month. Every few months I'll check how much is in the bank and make sure there haven't been any weird purchases. Depending on the time of year, we'll give some to various charities (a few k, though I do it over fewer transactions to avoid having more fixed fees) and toss some $ in investments (e.g. max out Roth IRAs for the year and put whatever's left into a taxable account, leaving enough in the bank to serve as a ~3 month emergency fund).

    Every few weeks I'll check up on investments (a fairly aggressive lazy portfolio made up of index funds) and credit scores, since it's fun and a little addicting to see how the numbers change through time.

    I don't really give much thought to finances and tend to buy random stuff as desires strike. But I don't want for much, so it's worked out well so far.

    I have a pretty basic spreadsheet that I use to keep track of expenditures by month and by what I spent it on. It's not complex, but as a student who doesn't work except during the summer, I find it's a necessary budgeting tool.
    ```

    I do spreadsheets too. I really just need to better account for the occasional bout of bipolar-inspired "let's buy something i don't really need" and my actual expenses will finally look like my planned expenses ten months out of 12. As it is, I just make sure that things on the balance work out. 

    (It hasn't helped that I was robbed recently, which kind of threw things out of whack right after I came up with the New And Improved Financial System that I think will finally make Actual Expenses look like Planned Expenses ten months out of twelve)

    I really wish that Amazon had a function that prevented you from buying something instantly and made you wait. This is obviously not going to help *them*, though, so I won't hold my breath.
    ```

    - u/blazinghand:
      ```
      One strategy if you're having self-control problems with internet purchases is to create a ritual for yourself. For example, if you are sure you want to buy something on Amazon, you write down the item on a piece of paper you keep on your fridge. Also, write out the URL, by hand. Then, at the end of the week, you buy any items on that piece of paper that seem like a good idea still.

      Adding a couple trivial barriers might be enough to help.

    I've been meaning to start doing this but really i want to figure out a way to import my monthly bank statement into Excel... I've seen programs like YNAB or Mint that are able to do this, and while I'm not comfortable using those (Mint has been hacked multiple times for example, and doesn't work well sometimes because banks loathe it's querying whereas YNAB is otherwise basic but is switching to a subscription-based model), I want to see if I can get that functionality.

    For now I've just been tracking savings, Roth IRA, etc., and have goals based on those.

  In my continuing adventures in depression, today I have started on Sertraline which is an antidepressant. It's making me feel weird as shit, which so far is an interesting if frustrating experience. My ability to put my thoughts into words coherently on the first try is at 50-70% of normal. Apparently I'm in for 3-6 days of various types of crapulence before I can expect to see benefits, and should discontinue use if I develop toxic epidermal necrolysis (don't google image search that lightly). Huzzah!

  Do you carry cash?  I'm asking beacuse I was recently working on a Starbucks when their card reader went down, and I'd estimate that 2/3 of people *couldn't pay* after going through the drivethrough (the store gave them their drinks for free when that happened.)

  I'm curious because I see peactically no downsides to carrying cash, and variable but at least significant upsides, but a lot of people don't carry cash anyways, and I don't know why.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    The downside to having cash in your wallet isn't carrying it, but getting it. Basically, everywhere that I shop accepts credit cards. When I bank, I do so via the internet or mail-- set up my deposits, pay my bills, write checks for credit card bills, etc. I literally do not enter my bank or use an ATM on most months.

    Looking at my budgeting spreadsheet, an example of transactions I had in the last month included:

    * Groceries, paid with credit card
    * Gasoline, paid with credit card
    * Some dining-out expenses, paid with credit card
    * Some entertainment and subscription expenses, paid with credit card
    * Some checks deposited or written, for rent or transferring money with friends, all deposited using electronic internet deposit
    * Paycheck, deposited directly
    * Paying down credit card for the month
    * Some money transferred between friends using the Venmo banking service
    * A check written to my landlord for rent
    * Other expenses and purchases, such as some stuff at the drugstore, a new video game, all done with cards or checks

    Basically, unless I specifically seek it out, I don't actually end up using cash for anything. I haven't used an ATM in several months. I do carry about a hundred dollars on me, but if I instead only had twenty dollars on my person, or no dollars, it would have no impact on my life. Going out of my way to go to an ATM is the cost, rather than carrying the cash in my wallet.

      I do most financial stuff online too, but I'll take out $20 a fortnight for "dicking around money" - small-change cash-economy stuff like if a neighbour is selling bags of horse manure as compost.
      ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    If you lose your wallet (for whatever reason) and carry cash, you lose that cash. If you just carry plastic, you don't take any sort of financial loss (at least if you report to your bank/credit agencies quickly.)

    Personally speaking, I carry cash because it's actually more convenient than debit for the sorts of small purchases I make, but it's not like there isn't a comparative risk.
    ```

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      Yeah, the two downsides I can see are:

       - whenever you lose your wallet, you lose the money in it, and

       - money that is sitting as cash in your wallet can't be used for anything else.

      The first is a small downside because (frequency of losing wallet * amount of cash * how bad losing money is * risk aversion) is quite small in most cases.  The second is usually small because it's a small amount of money.
      ```

  - u/SpeakKindly:

    Well, one downside to carrying cash is that you don't get free drinks at Starbucks when their card reader goes down :)

    I have a weird aversion to having lots of things, especially non-bulky things. My system-2 knows that it's valuable money, but my system-1 sees no difference between a dollar bill and a scrap of paper.
    ```

  - u/captainNematode:
    ```
    I tend to carry around $50 in my wallet at all times (which I don't think I've ever lost, at least not permanently -- it's occasionally been misplaced for a few days, but has always turned up soon enough). I go to plenty of places that don't accept cards and cash has been useful to have on those occasions (e.g. a lot of local parks have ~$5 entrance fees and don't have card readers, especially when you pay fees by putting money in an envelope, depositing it in a metal cylinder, and putting the corresponding ticket on your dashboard).  

    I also make use of the brilliant strategy of squirreling away $10-$20 in various bags, compartments in the car, electronics cases (e.g. in my cell phone), etc. in case I lack small amounts of money when it's needed, forgetting it's there, and rediscovering it years later.
    ```

  - u/medley_of_minds:
    ```
    Always.  I also keep a small stash in my car and apartment in case my wallet runs out unexpectedly.

    There's just a part of me that cringes every time I think about the 3% I'm handing over to visa / mastercard, so I prefer to use cash whenever practical.
    ```

  - u/hoja_nasredin:

    for the same reason it is advised to keep a stck of cash in your house in case of local apocalypse (New orleans hurricane, Crimea invasion etc.)
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I keep cash on hand for emergencies. Not a huge amount, about $20. Starbucks isn't an emergency, though. It's more for like, a taxi home from an unsafe situation that I didn't drive to, running out of medicine unexpectedly, card gets lost or broken and banks are closed, etc.
    ```

  - u/mg115ca:
    ```
    My primary use for cash is when I am out with friends and we don't want to split the check somewhere (like a drivethrough), or tipping at a restaurant. I don't use it as my first choice of payment method because a lack of logging makes it harder for me to tell what I used it for when I review my finances.

    I don't usually go out of my way to acquire it though, it's usually just when I'm paying for groceries and the card machine asks if I want cashback, I'll check how much I have in my wallet and usually grab a 20.

    I believe that people have experiences that they feel and describe in a way that comes out as Tulpas. I have friends and family who are highly religious, and they also describe rarely hearing a voice in their head that is not their own. They believe this is the voice of god. They pray in an imaginative way and imagine God speaking back to them. Sometimes, this comes true.

    I don't have, nor have I had, this kind of experience before. It seems like there is something that's possible in the human mind that's like this. If you are in the right frame if mind, you can believe you hear someone speaking back to you. It would not surprise me if what my religious acquaintances view as the voice of God is the same phenomenon that Tulpa users experience.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    The problem with tulpas is that if you strip away the woo and nonsense, you're just left with basic human empathy and storytelling, which isn't all that exciting or novel. I think the "surprising answers" thing is just an extension of empathy and a modeling of another entity's thoughts, but it *does not* require some kind of separate independent entity living inside your head. This is already a well-worn trope: "Think, think ... what would X do? *Gasp!*"

    That's not to say that I think it would be useless for therapy, since what you're doing is attempting to isolate and examine thought processes. But the tulpa thing, while interesting, seems to be almost entirely constructed of woo.

    I'd be happy to see someone attempt to steelman it though.
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:

      I disagree. For one thing, it's a really easy and common thing to become someone who has only a very basic relationship with your normal mental state. From personal experience, when I've dreamed, I've noticed that as often as my dream self is basically my normal waking self, it's also normal for it to be some random character that fits in the dream. 

      In what sense is something like that still me, that has completely different memories and goals from my waking self, and in what sense is it it's own being? I would argue that both interpretations are right, to a degree, since when you're inside the dream, you usually won't be able to bring you own thought processes into the equation, but you can still see how it's templated on you.

      So while there may be a lot of woo and nonsense, there can be a mechanism for a truly novel personality to take root in your head. Sure, there's the woo and nonsense to object to, but you have to remember that inside the human mind is literally the one place in the universe that that kind of thing actually works.

    Something similar to this, is that I've found that your brain can simulate _at least two entities capable of passing the turing test_. The reason I know this is from lucid dreaming, while in most dreams I find the npc's are pretty low quality you just don't notice because you're not lucid. In lucid dreams however, npc's can actually be convincing enough that even with full lucidity they are seem convincingly like real people even when you  know they aren't. 
    Obviously the processing for the npc's is all subconscious, but as far as I'm aware for a sane person it's the closest thing you can have to having 2 entities in your head at once. 

    This scenario always struck me as odd, because there must be quite a lot of processing going on internally, to simulate both your mind, but also the output from the other entity, which appears indistinguishable from if it had come from a real person.

  Is anyone who *hasn't* watched Log Horizon willing to read over the first two chapters of my LH fanfic to tell me how intelligible it is? I'd like to appeal to the general /r/rational audience alongside LH fans, but at the same time, I'm writing a continuation fic, and those tend to require more knowledge of the source material.

  If all it requires are some extra descriptions (because I tend to be rather sparse on those anyways) I'll try to tailor it to the general audience, but I don't want to have to insert any more exposition than I'll already have to as [semi-spoilers for LH ](#s "The adventurers have to explain what happened to them to the real world.")

  Reply to this post saying so or PM me for details.

  (And to clarify, I'm doing my best to make it [RT], although not [RST].)

  edit: and because people who haven't seen log horizon probably don't know what it is, it's one of those "gamers trapped in the game world" stories, but with a focus on worldbuilding (because it's an actual world now) instead of getting out. And it's not just a few players, it's literally tens of thousands spread out over the entire planet.
