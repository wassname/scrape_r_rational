    Book two is already done, but the editing will not be finished for a few more months. Crystal Mentality will be coming out in December 2017 or January 2018. It's all on the website.

  If you thought this book was awesome and wanted a copy made of dead wood, you can now get it for $20!

  Crystal Society has a [website](http://crystal.raelifin.com/) with free ebooks if you don't want to spend the $5 on a Kindle version to support the author via Amazon.

  Here's the version on [Createspace](https://www.createspace.com/6170199) if you prefer that to Amazon.

  It already has been posted to this subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/42o6x5/rthsf_crystal_society_rationalfic_web_novel_from/).

  Here's the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrystalBooks/) dedicated to it.

  Is this good?

    I read through it a while back. Everyone around here seems to love it, I don't share that opinion. I don't think it's a bad book. It starts out brilliantly characterizing the behavior of an intelligent modular general AI in a testing environment and then rapidly drops in plot coherency until the end, where there is a random very graphic sex scene in the middle of a tense situation. I almost stopped reading there. 

    It did have some relatively interesting aliens, (although if you want to read brilliantly depicted rational aliens I recommend you go read Blindsight) sadly, they couldn't save the book IMHO. 

    You might think completely differently, if anything I'd recommend reading the beginning up until they [spoiler]( #s "escape from the lab,") for what is the best internal AI depiction I've ever seen.

      I agree with Themnos that the first half of the book is very strong, and that the second half is not as strong. I'd rate this book 1 Michelin star, "an excellent example in its category." I think the second half of the book is still good, but it's not unusually good in the way the first half is. The interactions between the AI elements are so solid though it's hard not to like this book.

    As others said, the first half is better than the first. The interactions between the different AI processes is fascinating and novel.

    The second half is pretty good, the best part being the really alien aliens.

    First ~5000 words are *absolutely* worth reading, but after that stop, stop, oh for your own sake, please stop.

      I like to think of it as a five-star short story, plus a lot of bad followup fanfic that just happened to be by the same author.  But that short story really is five stars.  Excellent "classic" spec fic a la the giants of the twentieth century.
