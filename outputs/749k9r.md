## [Biweekly Challenge] SCP

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/71ke1m/biweekly_challenge_emulated_intelligence/), the prompt was "Emulated Intelligence". Our winner is /u/vi_fi, with their story, ["Matryoshka"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/71ke1m/biweekly_challenge_emulated_intelligence/dnbdyg6/). Congratulations to /u/vi_fi for their third win in a row, a feat never-before achieved in challenge history!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **SCP**. [SCP](http://www.scp-wiki.net/) is a community wiki where most entries are in the form of official documents pertaining to some kind of horrible anomalous thing. These documents usually hint at the shadowy SCP Foundation and are redacted for either effect or verisimilitude. You do *not* have to work within the existing SCP canon(s), nor do you have to write in government-speak; it's fine if you want to write a purely prose story about secret government response to a play which induces psychosis when performed. If you want to do a "real" SCP, then maybe [look at their guide](http://www.scp-wiki.net/guide-hub), but for the purposes of this challenge, SCP-esque is fine. If you're super into related works and want to write fanfic for those (*Delta Green*, *The Laundry Files*, etc.), feel free. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, October 18th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Slasher Movies**. The general formula for a slasher is that there's a nigh-unstoppable menace, or perhaps just a psychopath, who goes around murdering either teenagers or young adults one-by-one. Classics include the Nightmare on Elm Street series, the Friday the 13th series, and the Halloween series. Deconstructions include the Scream series (less so in the later installments) and to some extent Cabin in the Woods (though that one was more horror in general). Feel free to go in whatever direction you'd like with the prompt, but let us know if you're using an established universe, unless it's important to the story that we don't know. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 10/18.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/749ojj/challenge_companion_scp/).

    So your body becomes a p-zombie but still matches up with everything you will it to do. I know there was a philosopher that believed that normally happens, but I can't remember who it was.

    The boy is spreading this, and Dr. Gears (I assume) doesn't know anything is odd when he's talking to him, so I get the impression that only the p-zombies can see the p-zombies, or if it's just an illusion only the people under it can see who is infected. If so, they can't just put the infected under quarantine. Though I suppose they might be able to give them pictures or something.

      > Dr. Gears (I assume)

      You assume too much of me, such as a passing familiarity with the SCP mythos. I've never read a single SCP report in its entirety ^I'm ^an ^imposter ^^I'm ^^sorry

      > only the p-zombies can see the p-zombies

      In fact, there are two separate stages of the disease; a first stage which causes you to be seen as a p-zombie by second-stage infected, and a second stage in which you begin to see first- and second-stage infected as p-zombies. This is why the other boys at school registered as p-zombies to our subject, but didn't freak out at all. The question that remains is why the boy progressed to the second stage at once. I confess I'd have to make something up to explain that :)

        Coincidentally relevant to the username of the grandparent commenter, my impression was likewise that the boy was a carrier (like Typhoid Mary)--notably, he didn't make any mention of suggestion about his reaction to his own face, even though that [Tomato in the Mirror](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror) moment would have been the most horrifying aspect.  He might be the greatest hope for a vaccination, or for (potentially P-Zombie) bodies to work out how to reconnect the disconnected aspects.  A more existentially disturbing concept is for all of (surviving) humanity to end up as carriers, anything observing them turned into a P-Zombie, though hopefully some observers could take similar measures.

        (There are the normal issues of how pupils could tighten with shock as a reflex reaction without there being any meaningful emotional circuitry leading to it, or--if the meaningful emotional circuitry was still there--how the connection or disconnection of the conscious aspect could be perceived through means of sight; alternatively, it could of course be that it *is* wholly memetic, and the narrator is only convinced that the body is acting in parallel with what he wants it to do.  How would you know?  Why *wouldn't* the body whisper the second mantra, or at the least create-it-without-speaking (mind's ear), because that was exactly what the disconnected aspect would do..?  Hmm.)  (It was only with the mirror that any disconnection was noticed, so maybe the boy too doesn't feel disconnected, only would become convinced that the seen--himself--was disconnected upon seeing...  alternatively, if real, then seeing a disconnected makes you a carrier, and being seen by a carrier makes you a disconnected..?  But does being seen by a disconnected make you a disconnected or not?

        --Going round in circles.  Returning to the parent comment, other than 'Why did the boy go straight to second-stage?' there would be the question 'Why did the narrator go straight to second-stage?' (when the friends didn't).  Hm.  Other classmates looked normal, as did the narrator at first.  P-Zombie in apartment was seen immediately as P-Zombie, no delay as with narrator and boy.  Possibility that other boys saw apartment P-Zombie, but didn't perceive as abnormal?  Qualitative change, since not all others seen equally.  Even after boy saw narrator as P-Zombie, narrator didn't see boy as P-Zombie, though could be delayed.  Since qualitative change, not seeing-others-as--consider if voice-based transfer from 'carrier' (as in Slouching Towards Bedlam, maybe Northern Caves), data band not reflected in the meanings of the words themselves.  Sight-based transfer from P-Zombie?  Degree of voice-based transfer affects not only time-to-symptoms, but severity of symptoms?  Perhaps Stage 1 doesn't permit sight-based transfer or voice-based transfer or self-recognition.  Stage 2 permits voice-based transfer and maybe self-recognition, if boy is too terrified to even think of looking in mirror.  Stage 3 permits sight-based transfer, presumably voice-based transfer, presumably self-recognition.)

        Sight of Stage 3 results in Stage 2.  Perhaps severity of symptoms and incubation period are determined once, and after that unchangable?  Can sufficient talking with Stage 2 before symptoms show innoculate you enough to bump you all the way up to Stage 3 (guaranteed self-recognition, sight-based Stage 2s), or only to Stage 2 (then self-recognition, voice-based transfer)?  Since Stage unchangeable once set, worst-case-scenario of sight-based spread of Stage 3s doesn't happen, nor does self-upgrading from Stage 2 to Stage 3 happen.

        If real, then perhaps only Stage 3s are self-recognising, whereas Stage 2s recognise others and spread, Stage 1s don't recognise and might not spread.  All true P-Zombies?  Stage 1s spreading slowly by voice to make more Stage 1s might be as or more terrifying than Stage 3s spreading fast to make more Stage 3s.  The classic P-Zombie plague situation.  There, overinnoculation giving Stage 2s or Stage 3s can serve as warning bells that there's a Stage 1 spread, cooperative/deceived Stage 2/3s used with care to identify and eliminate Stage 1s, or rather eliminating vast areas and then screening for Stage 1s.

        If delusion only, there still needs to be a recognition component of the infected, but...  hmm.  Most aspects could be the same, except 'recognition' being 'recognition of infection through false perception of disconnection' instead of 'recognition of infection through perception of true disconnection'.  True disconnection at higher stages only is also possible, but less clean to have both delusion and reality of the same thing in play, both reflecting infection.

        Summary:  Apartment spread by sight (Stage 3->2), friends spread by (X) (Stage 2->1), narrator spread by (X) (Stage 2->2/3).  Friends and narrator should be all spread to by (X), and the main noted distinction is the amount of exposure to talking by the Stage 2 (who isn't capable of the sight-based transfer exhibited by Stage 3; Stage 1s not capable of any recognition; Stage 0s not recognised by anyone).

        ...It would be amusing if Stage 3s perceive Stage 0s as P-Zombies too, in which case for the 'real' case it would indicate that all of humanity were P-Zombies all along, and the stages only influence how perceivable this is (1, 2, 3) and how perceptive the infected can be of it (2, 3).  By that point, there's effectively no difference/distinction from the 'delusion' scenario, with (Stage 0s) everything adding up to normality.  Again, with the 'real' scenario, there's the underlying complication of why the P-Zombies are saying 'I think therefore I am' in the absence of a true prompt for saying so...  going round in circles again.  Perception of something missing that was never had, no difference from delusion of something missing that was always had, distinct from true loss of something which used to be had...  quite possibly this is too long for anyone to read in practice. Hm.

          Silly mental image:  "Oh no.  My body is now a P-Zombie, and it's taking advantage of its status to say *really creepy things* to scare me, which is *exactly what I would want to do!* (to lighten the situation by scaring my disconnected consciousness if I were in the position of being reduced to a consciousless body.)"

          Remembering nostalgically a Greg Egan(?) story involving a divergent personality-copy being unsympathetic to the presumably-horrified original.

    Just as an FYI, I'm getting a prompt to try and download the documents as opposed to it simply displaying. I am on my phone though so that could be the issue. But still, just thought if let ya know

    It's an interesting idea; but I think the ending could be executed better. Like, more ominous, more "holy shit the narrator is going to die".

  A bit of a mess, if I'm honest, but then again, I can't really claim that I've ever had actual standards of quality...

  (And sorry again about the dropbox link, it probably won't work for mobile users. Next challenge, I promise.)

    I'd totally read that in long form.

    I like the idea, but as written, it falls completely flat to anyone not in the rationalist community. I think it'd work better if you played up the SCPness of it, going into more detail about the weird symptoms displayed by the victims, maybe set up MIRI as a sect of the Church of the Broken God(?)
