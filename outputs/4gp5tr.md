  Same writer just started a [Game of Thrones SI fic](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blackfish-out-of-water-asoiaf-si.387956/) if you're interested.

  Loved the monty python reference, and as always, love reading about exceedingly competent Hermione. This is one of my favorite HP fics, good to see updates! :)

      exactly! A well written Hermione is so satisfying. I wish there were more, but I'm generally unsuccessful in my ffnet searches.

        Effloresco Secundus has a very good one, if you've not read it. It's a Naruto crossover with a special place in my heart for its fantastic fight scenes, worldbuilding and characterisation.

          I'm reporting back. Effloresco Secundus is fantastic, and I binge read it all. Thank you so much for the recommendation!

            Glad you enjoyed it. I occasionally go back to read it every now and again in the hopes that some of their writing skill will rub off on me.

          I've never heard of it. I'll give it a try, thanks for the rec!
