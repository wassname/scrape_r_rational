  Hey everyone, this week we discussed the value of new settings opposed to using an established one, and the idea of others using their own stories and ideas. Enjoy!

  Also, our sponsor this month is still [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php), the software that helps organize ideas for writing stories, research papers, or articles.  The code RATIONALLY will work until May 10th!
