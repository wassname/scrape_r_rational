## Developing an RPG called "Rational Magic"... hoping people from here would be interested in taking a look

### Post:

[Link to /r/rpgDesign thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/4izb12/rational_magic_rpg_v49_looking_for_feedback_and/)

That thread is more for people who are focused on the design part.  I'm writing here so that I may find people who are interested in giving feedback on the settings (and, if possible, look for writers who are interested in contributing to these settings).


######Influences

I would describe it as a blend of the following:

* Eberon, 

* Richard Morgan’s “The Steal Remains”, 

* China Mielville Perdido Street Station, 

* a little bit of Richard Morgan’s “Altered Carbon” mixed in.  Recent additional influences 

* Recently discovered "[Tippyverse](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?222007-The-Definitive-Guide-to-the-Tippyverse-By-Emperor-Tippy)" which is not an influence but is similar

* Recently discovered "[The Gods are Bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/about/)" web serial, which is becoming an influence.


>Before, there were wizards and warriors.  They went on adventures and killed dragons and orcs, found treasure, saved maidens.  All of that. But then, a revolution occurred. Not overnight; not a dramatic nor romantic revolt.  Not a revolution led by usurpers or valiant rebels. The revolution occurred because of a change in the practice of magic.

>Humans discovered how to make order from the chaos of magic.  No longer an art, Magic it is a technique, which is systematized, homogenized…commoditized.  Through the new rationalized magic techniques, wizards learned how to lord magic over men by making magic simple, commonplace, and controlled by the elite. This change in practice brought about un-told wealth to the captains of magic industry. It revolutionized the ways of war and the ways of pro-duction.  It brought easy immortality… to those who could afford it.

>The proponents of this new practice of magic are, in general, called “the Rationalizers”.  The current epoch is called “The Rationalization”

>Gradually, there were no more dragons.  The orcs (and the goblins and dogmen, etc) were driven into the most inhos-pitable lands or brutally subjugated for the good of the civilized nations.  Enclaves of the smarter races picked up and left… if they could.  Peace had come to the land.  Peace… and new, stronger forms of tyranny and terror.

  I'm significantly reminded of the webcomic Blind Springs which has a similar conflict between spiritual and logical magics.

    Thank you for the recommendation.  Reading that now.  But I don't think my game setting has conflict between spiritual and logical magic.  There is conflict between those who have been left behind or persecuted by users of logical magic, who believe that all magic is logical, or at least can be rationalized and possibly commodified.
