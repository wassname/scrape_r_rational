  SirPoley [mentioned on tumblr](http://sirpoley.tumblr.com/post/174889362674/next-hpn20-chapter-by-end-of-june) that that his goal now is monthly updates
  >Iâ€™m polishing up the next chapter now, and I have another couple partway-done in the bank; the current goal is one chapter per month for the time being.

    This is eminently acceptable.

      I agree!

  It's not dead! Rejoice! :)

    It so happens that your story here is only *mostly* dead. See, there's a big difference between mostly-dead and all-dead. Mostly-dead is slightly alive. All-dead, well... with all-dead there's usually only one thing that you can do: go through the author's bio and look for recommendations.

  Talking about voldebook:

  >He only looks a few years older than me," he added helpfully, "but in book years, he's fifty or sixty years older.

  I love the humor in this story.

  It's great to see the story going forward slowly, but steady!

      I don't know what you're talking about.

        This one is a sufficiently detailed simulation of that one.

  Is there a good synopsis of the preceding events anywhere? It's been a few years since I last read this and am foggy on the details -- what I remember last involved a muggle detective trying to unveil the wizarding world and repeatedly getting her memories deleted/altered*. Can anyone point out where that arc took place, and maybe link a good summary of what happened prior? 

  *(which, as an aside, forcefully robbing someone of such a core component of their identity seems as much if not more a violation of agency and self than mere torture or mind-control, though of course continuous variation in each doesn't match up 1-to-1, i.e. I'd rather forget the last year than be tortured or mind-controlled for a year, but I'd rather stub my toe or be made to do 10 minutes of unpleasant chores than have a day of memories removed or replaced. It not being an unforgivable curse is an affront to my sensibilities. I can imagine cases where it might be justified as a lesser evil, as well as therapeutic uses, but still feel its application should be restricted in the same way state-sanctioned killing, e.g. in an active shooter context, or the administration of chemotherapy drugs are restricted).

    [Milo -](#s "Wizard from a DnD world. Spent most of Book II possessed by You-know-Who (thanks to use of a DnD spell to instantly absorb the contents of a certain diary). Was resurrected back in his own world, thanks to Boccob taking a personal interest, and managed to get himself re-summoned. Able to create amulets that protect against mental effects, including *Imperius*")

    [Fiona - ](#s "Cop who had her memory repeatedly erased. Worked around it to some degree with a mix of her exercise tape, computers, hidden notes and a reliance on the wizardly aversion to all things technological. Knows enough about the Wizarding World to want to learn more.")

    [Hannah - ](#s "Hogwarts student. Supportive of Milo. Was one of the first to know about his return from the dead.")

    [Hermione Granger - ](#s "Hogwarts student. Figured out that Milo was working against the Good Guys in the second book; isn't quite sure that she trusts the 'possessed by you-know-you' excuse")

    [Tom Riddle - ](#s "Also known as 'You-Know-Who'. Evil Dark wizard; possessed Milo through most of Book Two, then killed him and managed to create a new body for himself. Re-took control over the Death Eaters; re-summoned Bellatrix; in the process of regaining control over the Wizarding World")

    [Department of Magical Law Enforcement - ](#s "Purchased anti-Imperius amulets from Milo while Milo was possessed by You-Know-Who. All amulets produced at the time had a deliberate flaw introduced by You-Know-Who; as a result of which pretty near the entire DMLE has been Imperiused by the You-Know-Who.")

    [Lucius Malfoy - ](#s "Own a fair chunk of the Wizarding World. Has vast swathes of property, all of which earns income, which he then either invests or bribes people with (which he sees as just another type of investment). Has recently, much to his displeasure, had his existence revealed to Internal Revenue - who, once they knew what they were looking for, were able to avoid the wards around his properties that prevented Muggles from noticing them *by accident*. Also much to his displeasure, You-Know-Who has recently returned and messed up Lucius' delicate but near-total economic control of the Wizarding World by starting to take it over in earnest.")

      It is fun to see how much one remembers from your brief synopsis and how much fails to connect, and compare that with the scenes the memory calls back on its own accord.

      That being said, I think I will enjoy rereading the whole of HP-D20 even more. Thank you for making me realise that ;)
