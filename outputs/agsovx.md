## [Challenge Companion] Endings

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread to [the biweekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/agsoca/final_biweekly_challenge_endings/), post ideas, general chit-chat, recommendations, etc. Note that endings often mean spoilers, so spoiler tag appropriately.**

  I remember really enjoying these for quite a while. I used to read a lot of the entrants, regardless of winner, and I entered a number of times myself (5 time champion, woohoo!)

  As time went on, my priorities shifted and I sort of naturally started spending less and less time on r/rational. I think it was a combination of my growing apart from it but also the sub growing in a direction that didn't appeal to me as much. Not to say it grew "badly"; it just became something I found myself not interested in. 

  Like even now, this is the first time I've been here in a few months, as I just have most story updates getting sent to my email anyway. I'm sad to see the challenges ending (I remember when they first started and they were weekly; what a rush :P) but I understand why they would.

  Overall you've done a really good job /u/alexanderwales and, even though I'm not around anymore, I still really respect what you do for this community. Thanks for all of your contribution over the years.

  The challenge list is archived here. Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, they're posted them on the wiki.

  They are posted them? Shouldn't it be they are posted on the wiki.

  Also the Google Docs hasn't been updated in a long time, and the Wiki equally updated.

  Presumably this lack of interest is why the challenges are coming to an end? Will there be a post mortem on them?

    Fixed the typo. The Google Docs spreadsheet pretty much never got updated, and the wiki wasn't updated by me (though I may go through the effort to get it in order in the next few days).

    I probably won't be doing a post mortem, but yes, it's a combination of a lack of interest and (for me) a lack of time. I found myself spending effort on the challenges that would better be spent on something else, and I think part of the problem is that it became "invisible" on the subreddit, something that people would just scroll past. (That might also be related to this sub shifting its focus more toward long-form web serials.)

      I think stickies are by their nature invisible, I don't know why but I presume most viewers imagine stickies to be unchanging and so look at them once on a new subreddit (and perhaps not even then) and then never again. Doesn't seem to be a good solution though because you don't want it for fall off the page. Maybe something like posting a 24 hour challenge notice thread, posting the challenge, stickying it after 24 hours, then posting a separate thread for a 24 hour voting period would have worked better. This could prompt everyone to read the thread. 

      This carries over into here I suppose, maybe those without forum experience don't feel the same way.

      Quite understand re:lack of time.

        I actually used to post, wait 24 hours, then sticky, but it wasn't clear to me whether it was making any difference in visibility, even if it definitely should have in theory. There's a bunch of noise involved with trying to figure out why people care or don't care about things, especially since it can vary seasonally (especially with the ebb and flow of the school year), which makes it had to do any analysis on what's working and what isn't.
