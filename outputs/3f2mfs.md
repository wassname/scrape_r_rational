  Holy shit, that last line... how do 5 words make that so much more horrifying

  That was the best rational horror I've seen here yet and now I want to unread it.

    Yeah, I'm not sure if I can forget this story whenever I'm doing art. Especially after I've made this post.

  Somehow, having read this, I feel that no Rational Horror will be the same. Maybe I can write something, though...

  I thought they'd already fucked up when their reaction to the first radio music was described. When they report back, they should first figure out whether the infection spreads physically or memetically.

    I think at that point they no longer cared. They probably wanted their ugly old planet to be laid waste to by the infection.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    I felt this way about Luminosity. "We have quibbles with the current leadership so we're going to happily [Entire story denouement](#s "crown Empress and submit to the woman whose top rule is that we have to eat nothing but Soylent or spoiled Soylent for the next several years at least!") Yeah, no. Never happen.

        I think some people expect literally everything I write to be rationalist fiction.  Most of it isn't.  Muse isn't.  I don't mind it being posted here because the audiences empirically overlap quite a bit, but I'm not doing that every time I write anything.  Thank you for appreciating the story for the not-rationalist-fiction that it is :)

        I don't think rational scifi has to be "hard" scifi, which is implied by your robots question.

        The fact that they don't use robots doesnt -really- detract from the rationality.
        It could be explained simply by them not having the tech, and yeah its possible for a world to exist where they have FTL but not robots. Not to mention that it is a diplomatic mission in practice so they might not be able to use it as it would offend their hosts.

        And I think similar things could be said about most of your other points. meaning, I don't think they are the causes for this to not be rational.


        Having said all of this i do agree that the story is not really rational, even though it is generally nice. 
        The reason for me is simply that the characters themselves did not act rationally. which is more abstract, but I think going into the specifics is not the solution in this case, because any of the specifics (why wasnt this a military mission could have easily been "solved" by having one of the people mention how "this mission really should have been a military mission, if not for colony politics we should have gotten much better protection" or something similar)

        But as a whole there are too many small points which when combined prevent this from being "rational" in my eyes..

            i may not have explained myself properly, what i meant was that all of these things could have been solved relatively easily without significantly effecting anything important in the story.

            nothing would have changed if the author added "if not for those stupid politicians" or "if only we had time to charge the robots to send them instead", other than the fact that we could be assured that the author thought about those things.
            so yes, we would know the author was aware of those points and decided to make a story where they wouldnt be relevant.

            but nothing in the story would change significantly.

            On the other hand my problem with the many small irrationalities is that without them the story would just not be the same, i.e. it would not be possible to get the same horror.

              Regardless, they failed biochemical safety procedures. If it had been a normal flu, they would have died just as surely as they did now.

              Note: I'm assuming you mean "virus transmitted by information exchange between minds" when you say "memetic virus". If you merely mean a biological virus which affects the mind, I don't get your point at all.

                I meant a virus which somehow alters the mind in a way that isn't distinguishable from the victims just having a different culture and which the victims eventually aren't aware about. There's just no precedence for a sickness like that. 

                I assume they just did the normal "Have you been sick any time in the past 2 weeks" procedure for things like a normal flu. I mean some amount of trust is required right, the colony could easily have just shot them out of the sky and they could easily just have bombed the colony from orbit.

                  Not that there's a reason to land, mind you. The ship's comparative advantage is creating warp conduits, not sightseeing, and after their mission travelling to Muse (or high orbit above Muse) is 'as simple as travelling to another continent'. So what if the mission is slower, the fate of planets is on the line.
