## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

- u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
  ```
  Any suggestions for stories that involve "kingdom building", or something similar? Like, the MC starts with a small village/territory and expands. It could also be something like a business or political career.

  I've read/am reading the following, and liked that aspect in them:

  * *Tales of the Reincarnated Lord*
  * *A Young Woman's Political Record*
  * *Demesne*
  * *Wizard's Tower*
  * *The Devil's Foundry*
  * *Interdimensional Garbage Merchant*
  * *Yashima Chronicles*
  * *Post Human*
  * *Only Villains Do That*
  ```

    Castle Kingside had a rewrite that's caught back up to where it was before - it has some problems but it might fit into what you're looking for
    ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    I've read The Devil's Foundry and OVDT, and already have Wizard's Tower on my to-read list. Can you give me a one-sentence pitch for the others?
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      Sure. I'll do them all for anyone interested. 

      * *Tales of the Reincarnated Lord* - A CN webnovel where the MC is reincarnated into the body of a young useless noble in medieval times, and inherits his family's land and set about improving/growing it using using modern techniques to develop military, economically and politically.
      * *A Young Woman's Political Record* - MC of Youjo Senki after the war ends decides that her best course of action is to get a cushy job as a MP backbencher, but instead ends up the Chancellor of alt-Germany and has to actually do work to improve and defend the country while avoiding the pitfalls of the 1920s and onwards.
      * Demesne - homesteading but with a wizard in a magic land that wants to kill you.
      * Wizard's Tower - a wizard retires from a magic university and decides to go to his former home, his mother's magic tower, where he just wants a quiet life where he can research immortality without interruptions, but keeps getting drawn into the kingdom's troubles and maybe has to save the world.
      * *The Devil's Foundry* - A lab accident send a heroin and villainess to a magic system world that is kind of shitty, so the villainess decides to start her own business using modern technology.
      * *Interdimensional Garbage Merchant* - During a system-style rapture a yound woman gets sent to an alternate dimension that is essentially an interdimensional alien trash dump, and decides that even alien trash can be worth something if repaired and sold to Earth that is being invaded by monsters.
      * *Yashima Chronicles* - Very similar to Youjo Senki, but the MC gets reincarnated in magic alt-Japan during the Sengoku era (mid-1500s), and really just wants a cushy government job, but ends up as the strongest warrior in alt-Oda Nobunaga's army and get sent to the frontlines.
      * *Post Human* - an AI wakes up in an abandoned asteroid base after Earth's destruction and has to piece together what happened, develop their base and defenses, fight an alien menace and possibly save what's left of Earth.
      * *Only Villains Do That* - An absolutely terrible MC gets sent to an even more terrible magic world as the Dark Lord to fight the hero for the amusement of two goddesses, except the world is also absolutely terrible and he is welcomed as the lesser evil.
      ```

    I would strongly recommend Dungeon Keeper Ami.  No Sailor Moon knowledge required to enjoy it.

    ```
    My favorite genre, unfortunately not a popular one to write for.


    Deeds not words on SB

    Dread our Wrath on SB

    ```
    Since you've read so much in this genre, do you have a top recommendation or two out of that list? It's a theme I'd like to see explored, but also one I think I'd have particularly high standards for, especially relative to my expectations.

    For more recs:

    **[You Needed Opponents With Gravitas](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/you-needed-opponents-with-gravitas-redux-worm-the-culture.867751/threadmarks)** (Worm/The Culture, exponentially increasing gaps between updates). Hyper-advanced anarchist aliens intervene on behalf of Earth Bet. I went in familiar with Worm and not The Culture and that was sufficient. There's some quality building of organizational power, optimism, and reasonable depictions of things being accomplished via anarchist political theory. But it also grants the protagonists overwhelming firepower from the start, so it's sort of easy mode.

    **[The Two Year Emperor](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/)** (Issekai into D&D 3.5 world, following mix of actual game rules and physics). The protagonist repeatedly doubles their power base and the scope of the conflict in front of them by providing muchkinned solutions using D&D game mechanics. But the author reuses a certain unsatisfying plot device just as many times.
    ```

    - u/Missing_Minus:
      ```
      > You Needed Opponents With Gravitas  

      (I had not read The Culture previously, so I only know what the story says)  
      Definitely agree on the 'easy mode' part. There's some bits about parallel worlds being *weird* to The Culture, which could have allowed other Shard abilities to be suitably weird as well, but not really done.  
      I also was confused about various bits. >!The Culture seems to dislike modifying minds, yet Taylor seems to have her mind rather intensely modified? She has various 'negative' parts of her personality removed away, and while I could understand dampening them, it is essentially as if they aren't there. I could totally understand Danny believing that his daughter has been replaced with how she acts, and I remained unsure if they weren't going to go for a plotline like that.!< >!The whole emulated Skitter thing was weird, and Taylor's own reaction was weird.!<  
      I sometimes ran into the issue that I can't tell if the author is playing a concept straight (>!Taylor's personality; emulated Skitter; Taylor's reaction to that!< or if they're planning on making that a part of the story, like, I dunno, >!The Mind revealing that it decided the best decision was to replace her decision making with what it believed was best for Contact and Earth!<.  
      Sadly it is over before I can see if there are any twists like that. I *enjoyed* it, but there was zero challenge and in the cases where there should be at least emotional challenges they don't seem to exist that well.
      ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        The whole >!Taylor-Skitter subplot!< felt like it was something that the author thought would be an interesting idea to explore, so he included it in an otherwise unrelated fic. I enjoyed the interaction, but I agree that it felt a bit forced.
        ```

        - u/jtolmar:
          ```
          Now that you phrase it that way, yeah, I think that whole subplot would make a much better omake than a canon part of the work.

  Most of what I've seen from the rational community has been the serious stuff, but recently from the recommendations I've been reading two utterly ridiculous comedies - [Not Your Heroes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30983558/chapters/76526360) (Harry Potter crackfic) and [An Infinite Recursion of Time](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43761/an-infinite-recursion-of-time) (heavily inspired by Worth the Candle to the point of being a crackfic) - and I am completely addicted.

  Are there any similar works you guys have read that you could recommend to me?
  ```

  - u/Ironman2179:
    ```
    Infinite Recursion just finished. It ended in an interesting place.
    ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      I liked the ending! And the afterword was informative. As the author expected I didn't really like the beastkin/demon arc too much - in part because it was rushed but also because I was disappointed with every harem member being reduced to the same state. Still, it was overall a decent if completely indecent read.
      ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    For HP crackfics, I thought Seventh Horcrux and A Black Comedy were better than Not Your Heroes. For worm crackfics, there's [Loaf](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/loaf-worm-post-epilogue-humor-complete.467128/). For extremely good Harry Potter / D&D crossover comedy that may or may not be a crackfic, there's Harry Potter And The Natural 20.

    For something with the same style of humor as crackfics, I greatly enjoyed [A City Stranded Cowboy's Robot Mercy Killing Business](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29027/a-city-stranded-cowboys-robot-mercy-killing-business).

    For parodies of this very community, I'd also recommend Chili And The Chocolate Factory.

    ```

    - u/BaronVonPwny:
      ```
      Oh, its not a fic, but it is a blatant homage with a ton of references and jokes. For example, the first girl is a stone-cold rational human princess named after a flower and with the last name Penndrac (instead of Penndraig). For another, when the MC is trying to open his character sheet, the first thing he tries is closing his eyes for exactly three seconds, and is surprised when it doesn't work.

  I have an unorthodox request: what classic literature would you recommend? I feel like I've spent too many hours reading webnovels without actually cultivating much knowledge of well-known books...
  Tell me whatever classic, publicly acknowledged books that you have enjoyed, anything from Dostoevsky to Vonnegut, Proust to Wolfe!

  EDIT: Thanks for all of the recommendations!

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    I highly recommend reading the classic dystopian novels because they've had a huge impact on our cultural zeitgeist and the artistic works that came after them.

    In particular, I recommend the following books. These have all been extremely influential in their own way, and they make the reader confront important underlying issues in our own society as well as hypothetical future dystopias. (Also, I find them fascinating and enjoyable to read.)

    * *[1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)*
    * *[Fahrenheit 451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451)*
    * *[Animal Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm)*
    * *[Brave New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World)*

    I really liked Gulliver's Travels. Pretty much everyone knows about him visiting the Giants and the little people, but not many know about his journey to the land of talking horses. Lots of interesting musings on philosophy, morality, and science along with criticisms of his society.
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      Gulliver's Travels is my favorite book. I think people in this sub might enjoy Laputa, a floating island of scientists and mathematicians. That's in the third book. There's also some discussion of immortality in that book that will probably annoy rationalists, but it's still interesting. The fourth book is explicitly about rationality and how humanity is incapable of it.
      ```

  - u/sunshine_cata:
    ```
    Don Quixote. It's the first novel ever written, but feels postmodern. Also it's very  funny.
    ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    I loved Mikhail Bulgakov the most out of classic writers by far, but I might be very biased because I had the opportunity to read his works in the original language (since I'm Russian myself).

    My second favorite classical author is James Joyce, but he's obviously insanely hard to read even with a guide, and you definitely should leave Finnegans Wake alone if you value your sanity.

    I liked some webnovels more than works of Jules Verne and H.P. Lovecraft in the respective genres, but, like, considering how old the books are, they held up nicely.

    Dostoevsky has outstanding characterization in his stories—he understood human nature better than, perhaps, any other author—but certain other aspects you might find lacking even while reading his works in Russian.

    The rest of classics I don't remember or haven't read.
    ```

    - u/sunshine_cata:

      Master and Margarita is worth reading even in translation.
      ```

      - u/NTaya:
        ```
        Yes, absolutely, but one needs to choose the translation carefully with such books.

        Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky's 1997 version explains a lot of cultural details and tries to convey at least some of the unique details of the original style. Others I mostly found lacking, though I haven't read every single one of them, of course.
        ```

    - u/sl236:
      ```
      People who read Russian and haven't read it already might enjoy "Альтист Данилов" by Vladimir Orlov - mentioning it as it's not one that you see recommended often, but is a very decent fantasy from a place and time in the history of genre fiction that is much more commonly known for hard SF.

      Sadly, the English translation is very poor, to the point of being borderline unreadable.
      ```

  - u/EdenicFaithful:
    ```
    If you mean fiction, then, Sabatini. Try *Captain Blood*.

    For shorter things I've also enjoyed Poe's *Murders in the Rue Morgue*. Of course, there's [Holmes](https://sherlock-holm.es/), particularly the Final Problem. Oh, Borges' *Library of Babel* was fantastic.

    The rest would be the usual classics. Dumas' *Monte Cristo*, Verne's *Leagues*...Kafka, of course.
    ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    I honestly love Voltaire's sharp-witted stories. Never read them in the French original, but even their English and German translations are just so *palatable* to read, they must be an outright delight if you know French.
    ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    I genuinely enjoyed reading Moby-Dick. The plot itself...almost isn't the point. Reading it, you get this layered, rich experience. Like good worldbuilding except, you know, it's real. There was a moment where I suddenly could the structure, like it had been expanding in larger and larger circles as they journeyed further from home, and it felt profound in a way I can't quite describe. I'm not saying I learned something *useful* from this, but it was a fascinating experience.

    Mind you, this was in a college book-group class with regular discussions and context about Melville's life and contemporaries. I don't know if one would feel the same way reading it straight up. I definitely recommend an annotated version, because the text is so dense with cultural references and weird (even for the time) Biblical allusion. Apparently Melville just talked like that.
    ```

    - u/sunshine_cata:
      ```
      You might like Two Years Before the Mast. It's nonfiction autobiography about life on a ship. I think it was one if the inspirations for Melville to write md.
      ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Frankenstein. first because it is not really the book you would anticipate based on cultural osmosis, and secondly because it is good. 

    Dracula is an epistolary novel, which also makes it quite different than you would expect from the movies and so on. 

    Voltaire is very sharp, and funny, though in the end, I ended up going "did you really need to hammer in your point in quite that many ways?"

    Dumas is a delight, though the novels are, in fact, exactly what you would expect given cultural osmosis.
    ```

  - u/sprague-grundy:
    ```
    Heart of Darkness is probably my favorite classic.  It's short and interesting.  It's also a good source of quotes.  One of my favorites: "I don’t like work—no man does—but I like what is in the work—the chance to find yourself. Your own reality—for yourself, not for others—what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means."

    Less of a classic, but I would strongly recommend all the Jeeves stories by Wodehouse.  They're lighthearted and comedic short stories with some of the best writing in the English language.

    Finally, I think St. Augustine's Confessions is worth a read, less for the subjective enjoyment and more for the exposure.  It's shocking how modern some of his writing is, and how foreign other parts are.

    You can probably miss the Dickens.

    Vonnegut is always a good read. From what I've read of Dostoevsky I've enjoyed his work. Tolstoy is cool too, and I enjoyed War and Peace, but I also enjoyed Infinite Jest, so take that under consideration.

    Finnegan's Wake you can probably leave alone. I haven't read Ulysses. Probably should.

    Frankenstein and Dracula are both quite good classics, along with The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Stevenson's Treasure Island is also a classic for good reason, but a lot of the classics are a bit tropey because they're the genre-defining.

    I really enjoyed a lot of Jules Verne's works as proto-science fiction. Lovecraft and Poe are pretty good if you're into that kind of thing. One Hundred Years of Solitude is also great magical realism.

    I have Proust, but I haven't read them.

    Wuthering Heights was...fine? Not really into that sort of thing.

    ```
    The Decameron is pretty great, though best experienced being read to one another by a group of friends.

    Many of the old classics (Illiad, Beowulf, and others) have gotten absolutely phenomenal new translations. I don't know if that makes them no longer classics, but seriously, Emily Wilson's Odyssey and Illiad, and Headley's new translation of Beowulf are really good! (Though they are perhaps better read aloud than read, especially Beowulf.)

    Jane Austen is well worth reading. The classic murder mystery novels (Christie, Doyle, Chandler maybe?, Sayers) are well worth reading.
    ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    The first book of The Glass Bead Game (Magister Ludi) by Hermann Hesse is very good.

    The precursors of modern genre fiction are also really interesting. E.g  Gormenghast (Mervyn somebodyorother) Last and First Men (Olaf Stapledon).

  More recs and reviews this week.

  **[Return Of The Obra Dinn](https://obradinn.com/)**

  Video game rec (and currently on sale on Steam). A ship shows up in port with its entire crew dead or missing. Armed with a magic pocket watch that lets you examine the scene of the last moment of a person's life, you must figure out exactly what happened to each of the ship's 60 crew and passengers.

  It's a cool premise, but what brings it above and beyond is the sheer variety of ways you're supposed to figure out the cases. Not every individual detail is a clue, but every *kind* of detail is a clue at some point, much more than you'd expect. It also has a stand-out art style that compliments the game well, and some suitably mysterious worldbuilding.

  I will say that the user interface leaves some to be desired. I found myself constantly fighting against the notebook, as it switches pages and loses your progress at all sorts of inconvenient times. This is particularly baffling at the start of the game, as some of the features behave differently (and worse) on your first visit to each corpse.

  If you want more video game recs, I would also suggest **[Outer Wilds](https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html)** (open ended exploration in a tiny solar system, until you discover a goal for yourself), and **[Baba Is You](https://www.hempuli.com/baba/)** (classic block puzzle where you can change the rules). In case you haven't yet purchased Baba Is You, I'd also like to point out that Itch.io gives creators a significantly better cut than the other game markets do.

  **[There Is Nothing To Fear](https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368)**

  Harry Potter AU in which a young Voldemort is sorted into Gryffindor, as a collection of short stories. [Hermione Granger And The Silent Country](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/66202159), which I reviewed last week, is a part of it.

  It was a quick read and there's some occasional good stuff, but little of it really stood out to me in the way that HGatSC did. It felt more like a collection of interludes and author's notes for said story, than as a proper story in and of itself. This may or may not have been because of the order I read it in.
  ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    Outer Wilds and Baba Is You are both my 2019 GOTY, and fuck anyone who says there can't be two GOTY. They both are the best in their respective genre.

    - u/ProfessorPhi:
      ```
      All 3 of these video games (and the fanfic recc too) are absolutely incredible. I highly recommend both Outer Wilds as it has a mechanic /r/rational seems to love, and Obra Dinn was an experience you'd be foolish to miss out on.
      ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      If you like Outer Wilds, and happen to also like Hollow Knight^(*), then I would like to recommend La Mulana, a game that combines brutally difficult platforming with cryptic puzzles based on piecing together fragments of mythology.

      It's meaner than both of those games in their respective fields. Which puzzles are useful info is less immediately clear, and you need to extract more from them, and you need to take notes manually. Your attack hitbox is even tinier than the nail in HK, air control on jumps is very limited (you really have to choose exactly where you jump and commit), and the bosses are generally harder. And then it's an absolutely massive story that doubles in size more times than you'd expect.

      If this description sounds exciting then I highly recommend it. If this description sounds like something you want no part in, then definitely don't go in anyway because I sound enthusiastic, it's probably something you'd hate (though you may still find the wiki fun to read).

      ^(*) Or hard platformers in general, but if you like those and haven't played Hollow Knight, you should go do that first anyway.

  This isn't explicitly rational, but Mecanimus (of [A Journey of Black and Red](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red) ) has started a new fic: [The Calamitous Bob](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/44132/the-calamitous-bob) which I've quite enjoyed so far. It is an actual LitRPG this time.

  Still working through [Ar'Kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst), and enjoying that as well.  In general, I like how the Script (the "game" system) has been set up by the gods of the Vierd to manage how people cast magic (use mana flows). The gods actively encourage experimentation with magic, but also curb excesses. They (the gods) aren't omniscient, and will change spells later if found to be a problem, and explicitly mark some effects to indicate likely changes in the future if needed.  It is in a marked contrast to many LitRPGs where, basically, there is a system, and that's it.

      I don't know if I'd consider Taylor to be the *opposite*, but she's certainly not Rational in the same sense or level that Harry in HPMOR or even Juniper in Worth the Candle are.    
      I don't think I completely disagree with Wildbow's proposed view (and it is somewhat a view rather than canon fact, considering it is deciding if they would be a good authority figure which is relatively subjective, but it does hold more weight due to them being the author), but I think it is also using her most extreme actions in the most extreme scenarios as examples. The case of Taylor being an authority figure would likely be quite different in a world where she isn't experiencing the problems of Lung, Brockton Bay turning into a hole in the ground via Leviathan, having to deal with Noelle, the S9, knowing the world is going to end and that she wants to stop it. For the world she was in, she managed a relatively good job. Sure her actions were extreme, but the situations were extreme.  
      In these situations she might actually be a *good* authority figure, because it gives her the standing to enact what she thinks best (not that this is always correct, but she has a relatively good track record). She would then have the 'power' to suggest some plan/method to a group to use rather than being considered the enemy. Sure, there would be better choices for some position, but she a) isn't that corrupt b) not evil intent-wise (which does matter when you willingly give someone power rather than them doing whatever they want) c) relatively pragmatic (I think Wildbow is playing up her black and white viewpoint too much in that post. Sure it might be closer to that than a really good pragmatist, but it is nothing compared to the usual black-and-white behavior of some young adult story protagonists).  
      In normal situations (aka pre-main-story Brockton bay, though I believe the Bay was still an outlier?) she might not do as well. Still, I don't she'd be awful. Though it depends on what position she's in. Presumably relatively high-tier hero (Armsmaster? Dauntless?) on the team. Still, I think in those scenarios she'd know that the extreme methods (if she was somehow transported there) aren't needed as much.  
      Still, I agree that she isn't the most rational protagonist. I do think it is still notably more rational story/characters/worldbuilding than most works and so deserves to be in r/rational, though.

        Well, he was responding to a post which claimed that Taylor was "compassionate enough to not be unreasonable or oppressive" and "knows when to compromise and when to hold fast to principles". That's an extremely high bar for any teenager. Certainly not one that Taylor would be in a position to clear given her background, her circumstances and the >!parasitic alien attached to her!<.

          Yeah, I agree she's certainly not that perfect. Though, I believe what I said still stands for Wildbow's commentary.  

          > The title of the original post was "Taylor would make for the best PRT director. Prove Me wrong."  

          Yeah I noticed that, but focused more on the general authority figures part that the parent post in this thread mentioned. I think what Wildbow said is more general than just PRT director though.  
          Can't remember if this is a canon or fanon element, but aren't PRT directors not meant to have powers? So she'd be pretty bad at it in that way :)
          Specifically for PRT director, I agree she certainly wouldn't be the best. Especially since she is more suited to a (potentially leading-) combat role than managing others, which is why my first idea of a position of authority she might have  held was of team leader in the Protectorate.  
          Though, Taylor's mistakes/overreactions/extreme-reactions that Wildbow highlights are more combat related than others. Though of course that is what a significant portion of the story takes place in. So, for specific PRT Director I would say there simply isn't enough info for me to get a good idea of how she'd behave in that position (whether in a calmer city or in canon-storyline Brockton).  
          I do think Wildbow's comments there are more general than just that thread's topic, but I should have paid some amount more attention to the context surrounding it.

            That's right. However, I think it helps to distinguish between what the PRT was supposed to be according to the law that created it and what it actually was. The latter >!had less to do with law enforcement and more to do with maximizing the number of Infected who would be available and properly trained/equipped for the final confrontation with Scion!<. It required a very different skill set to run as we saw, e.g., when >!the PRT covered up for Armsmaster breaking the Endbringer truce or Piggot broke the truce against the S9!<.

          Sure, but he is also somewhat cherry-picking. He starts answering the comments and then just disappears when pointed to counter-examples.

          >the same weakness in Scion that she had or has in herself, and to brutally attack it in even what she describes as being bully-like.

          Like really, he's going to blame her for being a bully? To Scion? While the world is ending? Come on.

          I mean, there are good points in there, he does know the text and possibly his intent at the time but the whole comment is tainted with whatever it is that caused him to give the finger to Worm and write Ward.

            The way I read it, he is not blaming her for it. He is [responding to an earlier claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/blkuii/taylor_would_make_for_the_best_prt_director_prove/emp9622/) that Taylor is "Compassionate enough to not be unreasonable or oppressive" by stating that "Her compassion or empathy, such as it is, is to identify the same weakness in >!Scion!< that she had or has in herself".

  - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
    ```
    There are a number of different aspects here. Early on, Taylor's decisions were irrational simply because she was an immature, inexperienced, emotionally damaged 15-year-old with no knowledge of what was actually going on. For example, consider her internal monologue after her >!conversation with Armsmaster!< at the end of 3.5:

    > >!Fuck it.  I was going to rob the hell out of that bank.  I’d win the trust of the Undersiders, I was going to figure out who was running the show, and then I was going to hand over all of the info.!<

    > >!To Miss Militia, I was thinking.  Not Armsmaster.!<

    It speaks for itself.

    Later on, as she gained knowledge and experience, her plans became more adequate, but by then >!her personality had been changed by her shard due to all the conflict that she had been in!<. The result was that even if the basic idea behind a plan was reasonable, the implementation was heavily conflict-oriented and thus suboptimal. Her trip to >!the PRT to meet Tagg and Alexandria!< is a prime example -- >!she framed an otherwise reasonable proposal as an ultimatum while simultaneously making herself a hostage!<.

    Like many other capes, she suffered from this disability throughout the last two thirds of the canon and yet -- the "Queen of Escalation" meme notwithstanding -- she often managed to come up with solutions that de-escalated the situation, e.g. after the >!Cauldron revelations during the Echidna fight!< or during the >!PRT Directors' meeting after the Behemoth fight!<.

      > >!...her personality had been influenced by her shard.!<

      This take is pretty common in the Worm fandom but I think it's incorrect.

But >!her power!< only influenced her in the sense that it broadened her options and let her drive herself further into her own mistakes. The central metaphor in Worm is that powers are a representation of trauma, and that metaphor is undercut if you pretend that powers >!control parahumans like a puppet on strings!<.

In cases where there's an >!active influence!<, we see powers acting more like a blunt instrument than a carefully calibrated tool - think of >!Noelle and how her power influenced her!<. It's far more likely, in my mind, that powers simply go to people who are ill-equipped to handle the responsibility, and give those parahumans the rope to hang themselves with.

You might be on the fence about something, trying to make a call, and the passenger pushes you one way over the other, based on your own feelings of doubt or fear. It might tap into emotions, and dampen X emotion while promoting Y, just dampen them across the board, or take the joy out of day to day living while adding excitement to the cape life. A vague sort of depression that only goes away when one's out and fighting. Sometimes, as mentioned before, it's set up as a trap, a flood of emotion or a set of mental switches that get thrown when a prerequisite is met - such as a cape just steering clear of all confrontations, except the shard set it up so they can't, and they have a sort of limit break/command cutting in that mandates them to fight in one way or another. Or it plays off a limit or a berserk button that already exists - Damsel can't spend too long being anything less than top dog or she gets restless, and if she goes too long despite that, then she has to act, she's acting without thinking about it. This takes time and effort for the passenger, and a host that doesn't demand that time and effort (by circumstance or intent) is going to develop a better connection with the power. This in turn is a reward of sorts. If Damsel did kill the local capes and assume control over the area, fighting off all comers, she'd find her facility and control with her power just ramped up like crazy.!<

            It so happens that I was taking notes as I was reading *Worm*. Here is what I wrote about this issue while reading the opening arcs:

            > ... the setup is a bit hard to credit. It conveniently recreates the by-now-standard “superhero environment” with mostly game-like relationships between the “good guys” and the “bad guys”. The idea that teenagers – some as young as 13 – would be acting not only as successful supervillains, but also as state-sponsored superheroes who put their lives on the line every other day is hard to credit. Granted, there are indications that there is parallel universe business involved and there are mysteries related to the origins of superheroes, so perhaps it will be eventually explained as “one of an infinite variety of parallel universes where superheroes are possible”.

            And a bit later:

            > One issue that my WSOD has had with this serial is the MC’s willing acceptance – and near-flawless handling – of major risks. For example, the way she keeps her cool while Bitch is being shot at and she herself is being shot at at point blank range is not something that I would expect from a seasoned killer, much less a 15-year-old girl who has been at this business for a month and hasn’t even killed anyone yet. Ditto her ability to >!cut out Lung’s eyes with a knife.!<

            Re: "it's more than plausible she jumped to that solution on her own initiative", I don't think it's an either/or proposition. By the time of that >!confrontation Taylor's personality had changed so much that only a moderate nudge was required, if that. The changes were due to a combination of her shard's carrot-and-stick and Taylor's experiences, which taught her what worked and what didn't. Of course, what "worked" in the cape world was heavily dependent on other capes' behavior, which had also been shaped by shard pressure.!<

            This raises what is perhaps the biggest issue which comes up at the end of *Worm*. Who, exactly, had unrestricted agency in the serial? >!Parahumans? Contessa? Shards? The Simurgh? Scion?!<. The answer is arguably "none of the above", which casts a very different light on what happened.

              This is less an expression of >!superpower manipulation!< and more an expression of >!Cauldron's hands working behind the scenes to make a more optimal scenario!<. Still a major worldbuilding contrivance, but I think the fact that there's a *reason* to prefer the superhero facade over everything else gives it more depth than "they were all compelled". Also:

              > The idea that teenagers – some as young as 13 – would be acting not only as successful supervillains, but also as state-sponsored superheroes who put their lives on the line...

              It's implied that the superheroes really *aren't* supposed to be putting their lives on the line, with the exception of Endbringer battles. The Wards defeat at the bank and their subsequent reprimand implies that they don't get into big fights very often, and while that changes as the circumstances in Brockton Bay change that's more of an exception than a rule. And the Protectorate acts more like a police force than a proper superhero team, sticking to one to two capes together at a time - also implying to me that they run away from fights more often than they intervene. We don't really see them in group battles except when the Undersiders *ambush them* while they're all together, and in that case they perform as poorly as you would expect a group with little cohesion to do. Remember that the Ward's advice to Taylor was to use *butterflies* in battle and to stop shoving bugs down people's throats.

              > For example, the way she keeps her cool while Bitch is being shot at and she herself is being shot at...

              I think this is more of a "Wildbow doesn't understand guns" thing than a >!powers influence their user thing!< although it could equally be Taylor just offloading her emotions on to her bugs. Wildbow is a Canadian and constantly underestimates the power, intimidation factor, and commonality of guns in the United States, eventually coming up with worldbuilding to justify why Taylor is surprised to see a single pistol in the Undersiders possession and so on. That entire scene is kind of fucky because it's an example of Wildbow writing himself into a corner and then not really knowing how to get his characters out of it. I believe that *modern* Wildbow would have had Taylor talk her way out of it or concede some minor amount of money or have the thugs flee in fear of a cape or something else more sane. If you read the description of the scene closely she *crouches down* to avoid the bullet, which is doubly stupid because if the thugs had any sense at all they'd aim for her apparent center of mass - which is now where her head is!

                Wildbow has changed his mind on shard mechanics over time. You are arguing from Ward-era WoG, which emphasizes personal responsibility and de-emphasizes the personality-altering power of shards to focus on the themes of that story, whereas the points raised are from Worm-era exposition. Without that context, you will end up running into situations where WB contradicts his own writing.

                  I don't believe there's a big difference between Ward era WoG and Worm era WoG, except that we have more of the latter. Maybe because Wildbow wised up to the fact that people latch on to the wrong things, maybe because he just has less to say about his worldbuilding. I don't think there was ever a point where he *changed his mind* about how much >!influence shards have over people.!< It's just that fanon overemphasizes the implausibility of the events in Worm. When people write ten thousand fanfics going over the same events one after another, things which made perfect sense before start to feel like contrivances.

                  In the context of the original metaphor of *Worm*, powers represent trauma. This is as close to indisputable as a metaphor can get, and it was obvious well before Ward was ever conceived. (trigger events were named that way for a reason) The *metaphor* is that traumatized people sometimes act like they have a little alien in their head, pulling their strings, making them self-sabotage, revel in their own bad habits, locking them in an endless nightmare where they repeat the worst moments of their life over and over. >!While in the context of Worm this is literal, crucially, *in real life there is no alien*. Any reading of Worm where these people are compelled to take the steps they do, ignores the fact that capes and their failure to cope with their problems reflects *real behavior*.!< Taylor would still be a perpetually sad girl who lashes out at other people because of her distrust of authority even if the events of Worm never happened.

                    There are major differences you can notice with only a cursory look. The Worm to Ward transition is hardly seamless, in both themes and the mechanics of the setting. 

                    Ward specifically fundamentally changes the way Shards are presented in the setting and retroactively takes a chunk out of Worm in the process, in much the same way Pale takes a chunk out of Pact by changing how the Practice is presented. By moving the moral compass of the setting's worldbuilding in a different direction while keeping the superficial details the same, Wildbow creates major dissonance for some readers, while simultaneously giving others confidence in asserting that they "don't believe there is a big difference", simply because they're keyed into different aspects of the work.

                    Taylor is a character that's fundamentally defined by the moral compass of the setting she inhabits. She's reactionary, and the people who influence her are personifications of that moral compass: A dragon warlord, a criminal mastermind, and yes, an emotionless alien parasite. Somehow, she still manages to try for heroic results. You can't forget that when discussing her character, even if you choose to interpret it in the least sympathetic light. She's in a story where the moral compass dictates you have to constantly prove you're a hero, with multiple destabilizing influences trying to make it impossible. Meanwhile in Ward, the fact that the main characters are heroic is assumed and unquestioned.

                    It doesn't really matter how you personally choose to engage with the trauma allegory in the story. The fact that it references trauma and victims of it is hardly conditioning, in any case. The story and its mechanics extend far past that initial conceit, and Worm vs Ward, it means different things in the first place.

  I would like to recommend ["The Desert Storm"](https://archiveofourown.org/series/1311746) by Blue\_Sunshine. Here's the description taken from the series page:

      Four years after Order 66 and the fall of the Jedi Order, a grieving,
      struggling Ben Kenobi finds himself inexplicably taken back in time,
      crashing headlong into the foundations of fate. Grasping hope and 
      vengeance with both hands, Ben rebuilds his identity and seeks to change 
      the course of history: by saving Anakin Skywalker, the Jedi Order, the 
      galaxy - and just maybe saving Obi-Wan Kenobi along the way.

      Featuring a heavy dose of Mandalorian involvement, overall world-building,
      cultural exploration, and every star wars plot I have ever wanted to 
      write.

  It does a really good job exploring the trauma that Ben Kenobi carries with him, and features an interesting look at the Jedi Order's inner workings. The Jedi philosophy is fleshed out, and makes much more sense then in the movies.

  The series is over 1 million words long, but is set up in multiple books that make great stopping points.

    I enjoyed the first three stories, but it meandered into hurt/comfort fluff at some point and never came back. It's also a bit repetitive (how many times can Ben Kenobi be acussed of being abusive? It won't happen just once per book past the first one.) and the characters are too 'perfect'. Ben is an absolute Gary Stu, but not even he holds a candle to Shmi.

  Any stories with a decent to well done polyamorous triad? Preferably ffm or mmf. I remember there being one in Wake of the Ravager but it was mostly comedy, and didn't really consider the relationship seriously.

    ```
    [The Daily Grind](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15925/the-daily-grind) I remember has an MMF triad.

    [The Fifth Season](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161852-the-fifth-season) is worth a read, even without the triad it has in it. The triad is not remotely the focus of the book, however.

      Darn, I was hoping for the triad to be the focus. It's in my bookmarks list, I'll pick it up sometime.

    [Water](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/water.shtml), and its sequel, [Mana](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/mana.shtml), is a really great story with the triad as its center, though it's technically mfnb.

    This is Kirsten Saells whole thing, but she really *is* missing in action, to the point that her books vanished of kindle. Dead trees still available. 

    Elliot Kay, Good Intentions. 

    Honestly, it is just stupidly hard to find things in this space, which is odd, because harem stories pretty invariably  go off the rails at love interest number 3, since you cant explore the relationship graph in any depth after that. You would think more authors would spot the problem and *stop*

    These types of relationships appear to be common in [Perilous Waif](https://www.amazon.com/Perilous-Waif-Alice-Long-Book-ebook/dp/B01NBWXMP9), and it seems probable that the main character will end up in something like one eventually.

        The sequel is being posted serially on Questionable Questing, and the latest update was just a few hours ago.  I imagine it'll get published on Amazon after it's finished being written.

            No clear sign of 'main plot' yet, so it's a bit hard to judge, but so far it's not bad. 

            The only minor problem imo is that since the worldbuilding and all the sci-fi tech is so extensively built out, there's a lot of possible "why didn't character X simply do Y to solve problem Z?" questions due to the sheer amount of possibilities open to the characters.

          Ooh, nice! And even more encouraging is the author's note about the size of his draft chapter backlog:

          > This is the sequel to Perilous Waif, which is currently available on Amazon. I'm planning to post at a rate of one chapter per week, with occasional bonus chapters, at which rate I should end up finishing the book before running out of backlog. If you want to read ahead, most of the book is already available to my supporters on SubscribeStar.

  Assorted recommendations:

  [Loki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series\)) is pretty decent so far. If you don't already have Disney+, through, either pirate it or wait for Dune to come out to pick up the service and watch it.

  Lang Noi's [Catch Your Breath](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9509154/1/Catch-Your-Breath) is on of the better (and longer) Naruto SIs. I doubt it'll ever be completed and it's not, like, Shakespeare, but it's still plenty of fun. It also had a complete Naruto/BnHA crossover that's excellent called [Shell Game](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13075140/1/Shell-Game).

  [A Young Woman's Marvelous Adventure](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-marvelous-adventure-youjo-senki-mcu.944975/) is an entertaining Youjo Senki/MCU crossover that looks quite promising. Given the author's track record, I doubt it'll be completed, but until jacobk gets bored it'll probably update quickly and be quite entertaining.

    I'm reading *A Young Woman's Marvelous Adventure* and liking it so far. Though like you said the author has a history of dropping projects. The story begins with an author's note saying "No promises on how long I'll keep updating this one." so not very confidence inspiring.

    That said jacobk kinda finished *A Young Woman's Political Record* and I really liked it. It's been a year since the last chapter was posted and it's still missing the epilogue, though the last chapter works as one.

    There's a Cold War sequel being planned, the author is on SBF and has 2 chapters done. So far not chapters have been posted, though they just announced this a few days ago.

      >so not very confidence inspiring.

      I've kind of accepted the fact that the vast majority of in-progress fanfic I read will never be completed. I just read them with the understanding that they're interesting explorations of some fictional world for however long the author is interested in updating the project. If I want to read works to completion, I either filter by that specifically or I just read actual professionally published novels.

    It says that it was:

    > Inspired by Silver Queen's "Dreaming of Sunshine."

    I dropped *Dreaming of Sunshine* after 3 chapters because the MC was "too inconsistent and plain freaky for me to stomach", to quote my notes. Is this fic's MC similar?

      > I dropped Dreaming of Sunshine after 3 chapters because the MC was "too inconsistent and plain freaky for me to stomach", to quote my notes

      given that the mc is ~6 years old at that point, that doesn't seem particularly surprising

      i won't say that it's rational, but it's definitely one of my top guilty pleasure fics
      ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      They're not really similar people, but it's been long enough since I've read the beginning to Catch Your Breath that I can't really know how you'll react to her. Suffice to say, I'm a fan, but you'd be better off just reading a few chapters than listening to me talk about her.

        Fair enough. Thanks for the recommendation!
