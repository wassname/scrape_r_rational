## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  In this clip, a Flash-type superhero is fighting a weather manipulator. Except that in this setting, powers don't necessarily come with all the [required secondaries](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers): this Flash can't just instantly shed momentum, nor can he phase through obstacles.

  (Also, he must eat a hamburger as payment for every use of his power. /r/evenwithcontext)

    It's hard to tell how fast he's moving, but I'm going to assume he's sub-sonic since he doesn't seem to be bruising himself against the air.

    When hitting an armor plate, friction and the energy of collision can cause lead bullets to reach their relatively low melting point and go molten, turning kinetic energy into heat and splattering rather than cutting.

    In addition to being less than 1/11th as dense as lead (and thus imparting less than 1/11th the kinetic energy), water is *already* molten, and it vaporizes at a significantly lower temperature than lead melts.

    Being pelted by vaporizing beads of water at somewhere less than 300 meters per second is going to be painful, but far from deadly.

      Well this is probably the coolest thing I'm going to learn today. Would a knight in well-made/heavy plate armor be effectively bulletproof?
      ```

      - u/Sparkwitch:
        ```
        Sort of. It's certainly why heavy body armor includes ballistic plates. It's also why armor piercing rounds contain non-lead cores: steel alloys, tungsten carbide, depleted uranium.

        Most of the time it's better for the knight (or, for that matter, the modern soldier) to be able to move unencumbered and quickly get out of the line of fire than to be wearing armor that is thick enough, dense enough, and layered enough to stop bullets.

    It’s from [*Darker than Black,*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darker_than_Black) which is a pretty fun two season long show. It also has some similarities with [*Hunter × Hunter.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter) 

    In both of these the [superpower lottery](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery) gives to some people (to [“contractors”](http://darkerthanblack.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Abilities) in one, to [“Nen users”](http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Nen_Abilities) in another) some unique abilities, as well as counterbalancing handicaps. In both the characters often have to try and quickly find out the nature of their opponents’ power and come up with a strategy that will save them from getting killed.

  I just got done playing SUPERHOT and have to say that it's the most innovative shooter I've played in years.

  The gimmick (and I mean that in the best possible way) is that time only moves when you move, so you're spending the vast majority of your time plotting out your moves instead of doing fast twitch actions. In many ways it's a puzzler, not a shooter.

  My wife was watching me fail repeatedly at a level and said, "Why don't you cut the bullet in half with your katana?" which I then proceeded to do, and it was awesome.

    Imo it was a bit short though, for the price it's asking. To be fair, there's some form of replayability in the challenge modes, though the ones I've tried haven't really held my attention yet. I guess it was as long as it needed to be, but I definitely wanted more. 

    And of course, it's the most innovative shooter I've played in years.

  I'm not American, but I've been following the debates and townhalls in the US primary. Like the overwhelming majority of Europeans, I favour the Democratic party, so that's also what I've talked most about and followed most closely. I used to think "If Bernie doesn't get the nomination, the Democratic party won't fight for any significant changes, so maybe Trump as the last Outsider would be better," but in the last week or so I've started to think that Trump would be *worse* than the average Republican president.
  ```

    The president has significantly less power as head of state than it frequently appears.

    There is power, as Commander-in-Chief of the military, to carry out military actions, but theoretically the congress could stop that at any time by refusing to pay for it. The president also appoints many major civil servants, again subject to congressional approval. In return, the president can veto their legislation (subject to a two-thirds majority override), and with appointments to the Justice Department the president has a good degree of control over how (and, functionally, whether) congressional laws are enforced.

    If the president is only interested in sustaining the status quo, or is supported by a compliant congress, it can appear that the executive branch has a lot of power. The president makes proposals and those proposals are executed.

    When a president acts in opposition to congress (not merely, as with the last few presidents, opposition to half of it) presidential power can evaporate very quickly indeed.

    Additionally, there is a great deal of political capital to be gained by fighting for significant change specifically when it *can't* be implemented. Both parties are braver about proposing and voting for legislation that would please their base but offend independents when they know the other party's president will veto it.

    All the benefit of having fought the good fight, with none of the requirement to deal with legislative consequences.

    President Bernie Sanders would say more things that please non-Americans than President Hillary Clinton would... and a *lot* more such things than President Donald Trump would. Whether any of those things would lead to significant change is almost entirely in the hands of congress.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      It is of course 100% the case that even with a 51% Democratic Congress and Senate (60% seems unlikely), Sanders stands no chance of pushing through every piece of legislation he has campaigned on. However, one of Sanders' main strengths is that he draws crowds and volunteers to a higher degree than most politicians, even than Clinton, who is still leading in the polls. If there were no Super PACs, he would be outraising her to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. A president who is good at getting normal citizens to care enough to get involved is able to apply a lot of soft pressure on individual congressmen and senators, especially when they have public opinion on their side. Plus, for all that he was Independent, he has been in congress and the senate for a long time. He and Clinton both know that game.

      Ultimately, for me it boils down to: Sanders wants to make systemic changes to improve the lives of the vast majority of Americans (There is an economic argument to be had here, but it works in Europe, and I really don't like trickle down economics), and is the candidate least likely to help multinational corporations bully governments around the world. Plus, it's almost unthinkable that the Senate would refuse to confirm a Supreme Court Justice for 5/9 years, and Sanders would definitely hold out on putting forward Justices he liked. He won't get everything he wants, maybe not even the majority of what he wants, but I'd rather have a president who tried, and who made perfectly certain that the issues were at least discussed.

      Now, I realize /r/rational is very unlikely to all favour Sanders, and I will certainly confine the political discussion to this comment tree, but it's Offtopic Friday, so if anyone wants to keep discussing the election or Sanders, I'd love to hear the input of people here.

      I agree with everything you said, but I feel like I should point out that although it is theoretically possible for congress to refuse to pay for war and stop it that has never happened. The three main reasons being the President doesn't need the approval of congress to fight if it isn't a war, so he just doesn't call it such(if memory serves the US has only technically served in 6 wars). Second being that Republicans are almost always pro war anyways allowing the president to go to anyone that does anything they don't like on any pretext they can think of. Third of course is that us Americans really like spending money on our military, so the idea that  republicans (hell even a democratic supermajority) seems so unlikely that it almost seems impossible.

      This particular election cycle, there will likely be replacement *but probably more than one* of the Supreme Court, due to the present court's demographics. The Supreme Court's influence and effects are extremely large and long-lasting. Once Justices are raised to the bench, they have little check on their power, and it's quite likely that due to the ages of the present Supreme Court constituents and the ability to retire voluntarily, whoever wins election will likely win the court for the next several decades - with things like the constitutionality of laws requiring photo ID for voting and voter suppression laws, privacy as a right, etc. all up for grabs.

      He's very good at it. Even when I strongly disagree with him, it's difficult not to like him at times. He's got a certain charm. He does ridiculous things like responding to "You promised during an interview on my radio show that you would show us your taxes" with "Almost no one listens to your radio show," as if that is in any way a satisfying answer, yet the audience loves it. I am not at all certain that a majority of the voters would vote against him.

          I think it's more because people tend to vote for people they like, especially when said person isn't impacting their day-to-day living. In smaller communities, where that person has clear, decisive impact on how we live each day (think any show with a small group of 'survivors' such as Lost or The Walking Dead), people are much more concerned with that person being capable, as well as likable. 

          In a situation where they feel free from worrying about how capable the person is (due to the overarching distance between the POTUS and your average citizen), they're going to stray towards the person they like more. Especially when they're not very learned, or inclined to research. Modern politics is, more often than not, a popularity contest, as far as who gets the popular vote anyway. And charismatic, well spoken and most of all *well liked* individuals always win those. 

          TL;DR: When a person has little real stake in who wins a competition and/or isn't well versed on the technicalities of said competition, they're just going to vote for the guy they like.

    Yeah, also not from the US but I feel that if Bernie doesn't make it then Hillary as the status-quo choice is still probably the best. The idea of Trump as the outsider who will actually make changes sounds great in theory apart from the fact that the changes would be being made by Trump:/

    I'm reserving judgement on that. I have a hard time accepting that Trump actually doubts Obama's birth certificate or believes vaccines cause autism. It appears to be appears to have been done to establish a particularly radical fan base. But how many of his current opinions are genuine, meaning do they represent what he would actually try to accomplish in office? I don't see how any other Republican would stand a chance against Sanders or Clinton. If it's Trump vs Clinton then I'll have to try to figure out what Trump would actually do.

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Fair enough. It's very possible he's pretending and will be more reasonable in the general and as a president. It's just... not a gamble I'm very comfortable with. At least with Hillary we know all we get is the two trade agreements and continued unlimited money in politi... Oh god I'm making myself sad again.
      ```

      - u/HPMOR_fan:
        ```
        Yes, that's why if I were to support him I hope I could determine what he really believes (for example by taking a closer look at what he did before getting involved in politics). There's also the point that even if he does a complete 180 on all his policies, where much of his support came from is scary in itself.

        I wonder if he's planning to be an ink blot test. Convince the conservatives that he's pretending to be more liberal to win the general election, while convincing the moderates/liberals that he only acted conservative to win the primaries.
        ```

      - u/HPMOR_fan:
        ```
        I should add that a big factor for me is how chummy Trump gets with the Republican establishment. If I see him using the same advisers as Bush, for example, I couldn't support him no matter what he says. I'll take the Democratic establishment over Republican every time.

    Theoretically, study wizard magic. In every edition of the game it's the most powerful and versatile thing you can do. 

    But in this world, I'm very bad at making myself do the reasonable and fun things rather than slumping into akrasia/depression, and I don't see why that would change. [(Yudkowsky on that topic)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ou/if_you_demand_magic_magic_wont_help/)

    More plausibly, I would try to find some rich patron that would be satisfied by the standard time-traveller wares: gunpowder, the printing press, basic sanitation, accounting etc. D&D magic may be superior to a lot of that tech, but (except in Eberron) it's prohibitively expensive to non-spellcasters and doesn't scale well.

At the same time, I try to find out whether there are any cracks in the world that I can exploit.

  The outcome of the Iranian Elections is [looking up](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/27/reformists-and-moderates-lead-race-in-early-election-results). If the reformists and moderates continue to do well, we should see big improvements. I don't have high hopes for the Assembly of Experts, but should the moderates manage to get control of that, we should see big changes in the next 20 years. Regardless, these elections vindicate Rouhani. His opponents claim that his conciliatory attitude towards the west and willingness to negotiate makes Iran weak and is unpopular with the people. It seems they have been proven wrong. With renewed support we should expect the pro-liberalization factions in Iran to have a stronger mandate going forward, and the Ayatollah will have even less grounds to restrict them.

  The Assembly of Experts is the elected body that has the power to kick out the Ayatollah (leader of the theocratic branch of the Iranian government) and is in charge of selecting a new one when the current one dies or retires. Ali Khamenei, the current Ayatollah, is 76 and has cancer, which means this Assembly of Experts is probably the one that will select the next Ayatollah. A win for the non-conservative parties here could give them control of the theocratic branch of government, potentially for decades. This is important because one of the things that has slowed down the wave of liberalization going through Iran is the theocratic branch.

  My attempt to tap into the collective intelligence of /r/rational by putting codes in my fanfic hasn't been as successful as I'd hoped, largely due to a drop in interest overall. Oh well. It was sort of an afterthought.
  ```

  - u/thecommexokid:
    ```
    The trouble with ciphers is that it's hard to use the power of collective intelligence to work together, because there's really no incremental progress. If you try exactly the right thing, the message shifts from gibberish to perfect English all at once; if you try almost-but-not-quite the right thing, the result still looks like gibberish and there's no signal that you're on the right track. There's no ability to post, "This thought seems like a promising lead, what do other people make of it?" and have others take up the baton.

    For the long cipher passage from chapter 2, I got as far as to note that the passage uses all 26 characters, has a letter frequency distribution inconsistent with English but consistent with random text, and has no strong periodic index of coincidence for any period 1–20. So that ruled out a whole bunch of common cipher types, but I didn't have any idea how to proceed from there.

    The only in-text hints were Dipper's description of a right isosceles triangle and Mabel's admonishment to hold off on proposing solutions. Since I was unable to make much of the former, I instead listened to the latter.

    *Edit:* I think if I saw one or two of these things get solved in the text, that would give me a sense of where in the enormous solution space you as the author had your attention focused, and I'd have a lot more success with future ciphers.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      > it's hard to use the power of collective intelligence to work together

      I would just like to add on the fact that people also don't tend to see crossing out possibilities as progress. For example in a perfect collective intelligence, what you just outlined would be used as incremental progress to know what doesn't need to be repeated and to focus attention on different types of codes.

      Unfortunately people see failures as wastes of time instead of progress, when in research, any experimental result is information to be used to narrow down the hypothesis space.
      ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    The problem is that /r/rational likes to solve whodunnit mysteries, social manipulations, or munchkining problems, but your fanfiction was the first story that I have ever seen posted here with any codes involved whatsoever. If you still want to have readers who like that sort of stuff while having rational stuff, put the codes as aside-attraction and share your story with /r/codes.

    TL;DR - The codes can include hints, but make the story solvable (albeit harder) without codes.
