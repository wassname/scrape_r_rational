  I like this interpretation of Tobias.

  I worry that the Yeerks are too strong. There seem to be two ways that this can play out in a non extinction event. 1. The Animorphs turn into rationalist munchkins and save everything. 2. The Elimist gives them a bunch of deus ex machinas until they win. I don't particularly like either of those options. Here's hoping there's a more detailed plan to success in the mind of the author.

    The author has said in one of the other threads that he's actually not sure if the animorphs are going to win. 

    <.<

    - u/chaosmosis:

      The best plan so far is Tobias' "intentionally fuck up the human race so maybe the Andalites win" imo.
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        I'm voting for that one too.

    Missed opportunity to use the phrase "Ellimist ex machina."

  Awesome.

  Tobias strikes me as OOC for the books, but meh, it works pretty well.

  I've gotta say, I like this kid. I hope he stays.

  Justified everyone-using-a-different-morph! What are the odds, right?

  Speaking of odds, gosh. Ellimist schenanigans as an explanation for plot convenience. Not sure whether that's brilliant or incredibly worrying.

    It's a *rare* nod to canon.  Book 27, The Exposed.

      WAIT WAIT STOP EVERYTHING

      What happens if Tobias morphs Marco, Marco acquires Marco!Tobias and morphs into himself, and then the nothlit timer runs out and he "dies" leaving only ... himself ... behind ....

          Very interesting. Just one problem: [Spoiler](#s "The post-jewel people would eventually spill the beans about the one week thing. Conspiracies don't work in real life because large numbers of people can't keep secrets for very long.")

            Hm, good point.
            ```

      - u/chaosmosis:
        ```
        I had the same thought. It seems like this removes basically all the impracticalities of turning nothlit, if the morphing technology can be reapplied.
        ```

        - u/TimTravel:
          ```
          Also it adds the ability to use thought-speak when not morphed. The only risks are resonance and whether reapplying morphing tech is messed up.
          ```

          - u/chaosmosis:
            ```
            > use thought-speak when not morphed

            I thought Ax couldn't do that while morphed as human in canon, although I could be misremembering.
            ```

            - u/TimTravel:
              ```
              It would make no sense but that sounds familiar. I seem to remember he generally doesn't.
              ```

              - u/Haulage:
                ```
                There were some inconsistencies regarding the rules of thought-speak in the early books. Eventually it seemed that the canon settled into the decision that as long as you were in a morph, you could thought-speak. Ax and Tobias used thought-speak while in human morphs in the later books.
                ```

        - u/MugaSofer:
          ```
          How would you persuade the nothlit to morph into their old self, though? Remember, nothlits don't retain their minds in this fic; the original subspaced body has been lost.
          ```

          - u/chaosmosis:
            ```
            Oh, nice catch.
            ```

        - u/TK17Studios:
          ```
          Question: do you guys actually want me to drop confirming/disconfirming hints on stuff like this, or do you want me to stay out of the conversation?
          ```

          - u/chaosmosis:
            ```
            Personally, I think I want you to give hints or explanations only if it's on something very unlikely to ever make it into the actual text.
            ```

          - u/junkbait:
            ```
            I agree, hints or explanations if a speculation is just not going to happen is fine to me. If it is a confirmation, then definitely warn for spoilers.

            Usually, I just like speculating out loud and finding out through the story itself.
            ```

      - u/booljayj:
        ```
        The morphing technology is pretty elaborate, it seems implausible that they would allow something to morph itself. The technology creates a "base state" when you first get it, which is just your own body. When you acquire an animal, it not only stores the animal's DNA as a new state, but also the transition required to reach that new state. Therefore, if you acquire DNA that matches the base state, the transition required is null, so no morphing takes place.
        ```

  Excellently done. Glad to see one of my favorite characters so interestingly adapted. The non-canon addition is promising too: I keep thinking of Bean.  Looking forward to the next one!
  ```

- u/ketura:
  ```
  How's everyone like the new thought-speech notation?  Better or worse than the (())?  Sadly FFN filters angle brackets to prevents HTML (or some weaksauce excuse).
  ```

  - u/Zephyr1011:
    ```
    The old seemed nicer. The new one is easy to confuse with speech marks, and doesn't even show up on mobile, just a blank space
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      Oh. That's a problem, if it doesn't show up on mobile.
      ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        Yeah, that sucks.  I found these characters and sent them to the author; they're indistinguishable from <> in FFN's document system, but I guess they use a different font for stories than the docx for some reason.  This really sucks; I'm not a fan at all of the (()) notation.  Guess it's back to the drawing board.
        ```

          Sending five million angry letters to FF.net?

      Which browser (or app or whatever)?
      ```

      - u/Zephyr1011:
        ```
        I'm on Android, and it doesn't show up in my Reddit app's integrated browser, chrome or my phone's stock browser, I just see a blank space and slight indentation
        ```

        - u/TK17Studios:
          ```
          Fixed now?
          ```

          - u/Zephyr1011:
            ```
            Yes, that works. Thanks, much better now
            ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Better. I actually didn't even notice there was anything weird until you mentioned it. 

    (But this is why ao3 is orders better than FF)
    ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Trying a new character now.  Check Jake's chapter for updates as soon as FFN refreshes.

      It works on my laptop.
      ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Yep, new notation appears to be a success, at least on my end.  Googled "unicode symbols verdana," since that's the FFN font (I think?) and found a pair that works.

  A solution for at least mildly cooperative Yeerks:

  1. Give Yeerk ability to morph.

  2. Allow Yeerk to aquire one human.

  3. Yeerk morphs human.

  4. Wait (at least) two hours.

  Now you have a Yeerk who doesn't need a host. Interference / resonance might wear off given enough time as a nothlit. I think this was involved in canon.

  ---

  Potential risky move: acquire a Yeerk and investigate the pool.

  ---

  Hilarious move: Nest all of the Animorphs in one body by morphing a Yeerk, controlling the next one in line, then morphing a Yeerk again. I seriously doubt this would be useful and it would still have the same time limit.

  ---

  Andilites vs Yeerks: why not just ram enemy planets with a ship traveling near the speed of light? That should do it.

  ---

  Elimist: be very very careful that you're not robbing characters on either side of agency. Omnipotents have a tendency to do that.

    The mechanics of being a nothlit have been changed. Now your consciousness dies after 2 hours
    ```

  - u/booljayj:
    ```
    The nested yeerks idea is actually really interesting, but only if we can figure out how Visser 3's morphing works. If his Yeerk body is pushed into z-space along with his host's while morphing, then nesting is possible. It seems like this would actually be necessary for him to control his host while in morph, because he has to stay in contact with the Andalite brain.

    It's one of those things that you would never, ever try if you value your life, but it's an interesting thought experiment.
