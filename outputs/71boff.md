## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I've been super into peacocks lately, and thinking about how variant humanoid species might have wildly impractical displays for mating purposes.

  * The female Equis put almost all of their efforts into mathematics, specifically in solving NP problems whose solutions can be checked in P time, with solution checking being done by the males. There are big society balls where eligible women are repeatedly tested by eligible men.
  * Female scill have a large shell on their backs, which they decorate with complex dioramas and cityscapes. Because all this is done on their back, the complexity and beauty of these three-dimensional scenes is a testament to either a stable family that can devote time to shell-work, a lot of money paid in labor, or a woman who is dexterous and proficient enough to carefully manipulate long, complex tools through mirrors. (There is some taboo against not doing it yourself, and most prospective mates will ask questions about the scene in order to test a woman's knowledge.)

  Does anyone have more?

    Twice a year, members of a vampiric species (temp designation KEANU) gather at a prearranged metropolis for an event akin to a wine and cheese tasting. Males regurgitate the choicest morsels of arterial blood they've acquired since their last rendezvous. Preserved in the male's mucus to forestall clotting as well as diffuse the male's unique hormonal signature, the large globs are effectively Fruit Gushers that the females get to sample. Rarity and quality of the blood source factor into the one-upmanship.

      Should have been "checked". And actually I think "NP" would probably be sufficient, but computational complexity is not something I know that well, which probably makes this bit of worldbuilding worthless for me (since it would take me too long to write a society ball scene with real examples).

        Your females wouldn't need NP problems. They'd need problems that *look like* NP problems to the unaided male mind.

        So, what they basically need is problems where the solutions are easy to verify but the method is *not obvious* (and preferably not too difficult once you know the trick).

          That's what low-class women trying to impress low-class men do.  The elite know all of those tricks, so they aren't fooled by illusions of difficulty.

          Well, to do it *right*, you wouldn't just construct a story and then include bits like [math problem goes here], because then you're not doing much different than if the peacock/ritual thing was something like, say, archery contests or musical singing ability.

          Like, if you assume a world in which men present problems to women which are hard to do and easy to check, that implies a lot of things about that world, and a lot of things about the specific problems used (because they have to be doable in relatively short order by a well-trained humanish brain). And it seems like it would be *really, really hard* to do that if you weren't well-schooled in both mathematics and complexity theory.

          I mean ... just as a starting point for a story, there's a woman who is going to a society ball to placate her father and needs to make decent enough showing that there's no scandal, which isn't hard for her because she's brilliant and actually interested in mathematics, rather than interested in the results that mathematics can bring her (namely, a good husband). At the ball, she meets a man who asks questions outside the norms of their sociocultural tradition, giving mathematical problems that not only challenge his partners, but are designed to probe into how they think, and which reveal *him* as brilliant to anyone paying attention.

          I would submit that I could write such a thing, but it would take me *ages* to do, because I'd have to get a grasp on a lot of things that I don't have a grasp on. That is, if I wanted to do it *right* and display actual intelligence that puts some amount of narrative/character weight on the math, rather than just using math problems as an interesting set dressing (which would be far simpler).

            Okay, I have a skeleton of a short story ready to go, if someone with a heavy math background wants to write the damned thing:

            $FEMPROT is a bright young woman of marriageable age who is going to a society ball in order to appease her father. She's plain-looking but very gifted at math, and more than being gifted, she has a genuine interest in it. However, she isn't really looking for a husband, because that would likely mean the end of being allowed to devote huge numbers of hours to esoteric math.

            The entire story takes place at a society ball, and the first few problems she's presented with are within the same set of boring old problems, difficult but with defined algorithms for solving that you just have to churn through, algorithms that every marriage-age woman knows, where the only challenge is how fast you can do it. This goes on for one or two examples.

            $FEMPROT is then approached by a somewhat standoffish and brusque man, who begins asking her a series of questions. The first of these is rote, which she breezes through, and she's about to turn away when he asks her another. She churns through it, but it's a much harder one in the same class, because it butts up against one of the corner cases of the traditional algorithm used for solving that problem. She finds this somewhat annoying, because it makes her look like she doesn't know her stuff, but she gets the answer out after some time and awkward standing around.

            Then he asks her a third question, still within the same problem set as the previous two, and again it's a corner case where the traditional solution algorithm is terribly slow. At that point, she realizes that this is part of the test, and switches to a different, little-known solving algorithm that performs well on that particular edge case.

            From there, the problems start to wander into the esoteric, and most often the man gives them two or three times, each time hitting at a different part of the problem space, each time encouraging different methods of solution. This testing goes on for a bit, and after every time, he says "That's correct", which is too blunt, a little bit off-putting (because she's the one doing the hard work), and a little bit thrilling (because who doesn't like being told that they're right). But the *problems themselves* are interesting ones, and the challenge is thrilling for $FEMPROT, in a way that she hadn't expected when coming to the society ball.

            But things take a turn when the problems start to change, and it takes her at least two of them to mark the difference. The solutions are no longer checkable in P time, yet he continues going on with his "that's correct". This is enraging, because he's not even doing the easy part anymore, he's just taking her word for it. So on the third one of this set, she solves it and then gives the wrong answer to him, expecting to shove it in his face, but he instead says, "that's incorrect" and continues on. What happened is obvious to her; he planned all these problems ahead of time and laboriously solved them, or got a woman to solve them.

            So she calls him out, and he mildly replies that he solved the problem himself. She makes a major breach of etiquette and challenges *him* with a problem, which they both finish solving at the same time, which leaves her breathless, shocked, and in love.

            At which point he says that she's the most extraordinary woman he's ever met, and that he has a proposition for her; he wants her to help him work on designing something called a mechanical computer (and, incidentally, he would like to start courting her, on the understanding that the courtship would give her some social cover to do the work).

            (I am mostly interested to see whether you could actually write a story like that where a lot of the twists and turns rest on mathematical/algorithmic problems. My guess is that the payoff wouldn't be worth the effort.)

              Thinking some about what *kind* of math might work for this. The obvious easy to check hard to solve problem would be something like factoring or something, which unfortunately is too boring to really have the kind of variety you are looking for.

              Looking at solutions to Diophantine equations, might be a little better, but the interesting stuff there is generally pretty hard to do in your head.

              Perhaps the best idea I could come up with was integration. Improper integrals are straightforward to check (just differentiate), and less straightforward to derive. Unfortunately, most functions won't have a nice improper integral, and the classes that always have them, also generally have algorithms for computing them that are not much worse than the algorithms for checking. Also, this has the advantage that if you want similar problems whose answers are hard to check, you can use definite integrals.

            Oh, in that case you just need to shanghai your mathematician friend into being your coauthor too, though I admit that this might not work very well if you don't have the good fortune of having a mathematician friend who likes to write.

        I've been working through (some of) the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems with only pencil/paper/calculator.  There are at least a few (or variations) that are doable purely mentally if you have good working memory and know the right algorithms.

        For example: "What is the largest even Fibonacci Number below 1 million?" (variant of [#2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2))

    But then, the next person who arrives will be expected to do that person, and to do the momentous thing. Or, in an emergency, the setting will abruptly manifest a person to be the Visitor (or the fey will all act as if the Visitor is there, even if he/she is not). Surely the fey story is going to take the first available opportunity to break out of the loop.

  I've always really enjoyed and admired the way Frank Herbert made his universe, particularly the Holtzman shields that made it so an advanced interstellar civilization still had a heavy emphasis on personal skill with melee weapons. 

  The melee weapon/personal skill part is something that I also want to have in my story, so here's my idea: 

  I was thinking of having cultivators(yes, this is my take on the xianxia genre) at a certain level of power being able to extend a sort of "aura of omnipotence" from their skin. This field extends initially a millimetre or less (with legendary masters attaining mastery of up perhaps ~20 cm from their skin) in which they have complete control. So it's impossible to kill these people because they can simply not allow something hostile to enter that field. After a lot of training the very gifted can even manage to perceive themselves at a molecular level, and if they attain the knowledge of how to correctly change their own biology, they can change it to so that they are practically immortal.

  The only way to kill a cultivator with an aura is by penetrating it with another aura. So two cultivators can beat each other to death with their hands, or they can use the very rare weapons made from the metal extracted from the meteors that rarely fall, and which are highly contested. When the weapon is bound to the cultivator's soul(an arduous and uncertain process), the weapon can extend the cultivator's aura just like it was their own body. 

  So this is a world where a common person can't even fathom defeating a cultivator of any skill. Where the average cultivator will spend a decade meditating and trying to achieve the understanding to extend an aura and affect an outside object's momentum simultaneously. Where many die of old age before they can perceive themselves at a small enough scale to rejuvenate themselves. Where what a person can do is entirely up to their skill and their imagination. 

  Some ideas of what's possible: Fly like a superhero, use their own bodies like a missile, accelerate objects like a railgun, create matter from nothing, alter existing matter, altar other animals, alter one's own body into an absurdly massive monstrosity with an implausible number of redundant organs, replicate objects, replicate yourself, heal others, travel into outer space, travel between solar systems (or even galaxies?) travel through the planet's core, the sun's core.  

  Anyone have any thoughts?

    It's one of those things that I see and think "this is a great idea that needs metrics". To use this in a work of fiction, I would probably sit down and determine:

    A) what the supersets of power are, then what the subsets of power are

    B) how many standardized years of study/meditation each superset/subset would normally take

    I'd start with "ways to kill a person" and circle outward from there. Stopping an arrow from entering your aura (and from there, your flesh) is one thing, doing it instinctively is another, doing it while you're asleep takes even more practice. Imbibing or inhaling poison is a concern, if you don't know enough to reverse it, and if you actually need to eat and drink because you don't know enough about those processes to replace them entirely.

    You'd also need a rigid definition of where the aura projects from, especially if you're involving biotinkering and matter creation.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      Yeah, the idea is in its infancy. To make it a *Rational Studios Production* I would have to make it nice and tidy like that, which I fully intend to. 

      So in my mind, I imagine the process of cultivation being like a profound knowledge of self, both spiritually and physically. Manifesting an aura beyond one's skin is very hard because you have to make this other stuff, all the molecules and germs and bacteria yourself, which is insanely hard. Once you have your aura firmly manifested, the difference between what you know and what you don't is very clear. Anything that changes your "self", anything that intrudes on the millimetre that you know so very intimately will be like a needle in your eye; you'll flinch. Eventually (with training) you'll react reflexively in the correct manner.

    Wouldn't the first one who ascended to godhood will masacre all the practicioners to keep the monopoly on that power? No point in let potential rivals laying around.

    What keep the rest of human from banding together in a massive witchhunt? They will loose, of course. But it's really hard to blend in society while having a nuclear bomb trigger in your hand.

      I mean, a cultivator doesn't have any other abilities that would allow him to project force. If he's not there, in person, then he's not any different from anyone else. How would he know you're a cultivator? You're in a shack in the woods, and your family comes by once a day to give you some rice, fish and water, hoping you'll have a breakthrough so you can join a clan or sect or the army(in that order). 

      And say a cultivator manages to become the ruler of a country(which is dumb, as every moment he spends maintaining his political power is a moment that he's not increasing his cultivation power) and outlaws cultivation, so that he was the only one. It would be tantamount to inviting invasion by neighbouring countries, or even just random wandering cultivators. In this world, there's no rock paper scissors, there's only rock rock rock. And a country with 3 rocks is more powerful than a country with 1 rock(not necessarily, of course, but you get my point). 

      Also, cultivation is unending. There is no point where you stop becoming more powerful, and once you start on that path you don't tend to stop. 

      As to your second point, there's two reasons why there would be no animosity from the common person: 

      First, it's ingrained into their society. Becoming a cultivator is one of the few ways to jump immediately to (the bottom of) the highest social class in the world. The lowest cultivator is above every other non-cultivator in the world(or so cultivators believe, and might makes right in spades). As an aside: while anyone can become a cultivator, few actually manage to. Just like in our world, the best indicator of success in cultivation is to come from a family of cultivators. 

      Second, there is an outside threat that only cultivators can resist against. That's enough to turn cultivators from tyrants to saviours.
      ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    If a cultivator cal alter their body on that level, then they can extend their skin into a whip for a ranged attack (and then, on a hit, the end of the whip suddenly manifests really long claws and starts tearing apart the target).

    If they cannot create matter inside their aura, then they can also be killed be being trapped in vacuum. (Vacuum can be generated by building an airtight room with a single small hole, and having a cultivator with a field large enough to cover the hole only permit air to leave via the hole, i.e. acting as a pump).

    If they can only control matter, then they can still be killed by lasers of magnetic force weapons. Anything that they don't know about can kill them (a cultivator unaware of microwaves can be killed by a microwave beam) simply because they don't know to stop it. Or the void rifle from "Worth The Candle", which simply creates a void in whatever matter it is aimed at.
