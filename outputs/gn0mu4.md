## What would happen if the disease from Dominions was a real thing?

### Post:

This is just a thought experiment - curious what would be the rational outcome / effect on society.

Disease, in Dominions, has a chance of manifesting whenever someone sustains a serious wound (like a combat wound) or goes malnourished for a long time. This disease is not infectious, but is basically a very long term, untreatable disease. Any wounds they sustain basically never really heal, and they get sicker and weaker until they die. Each month, they stand a very good chance of getting additional permanent afflictions (becoming weak, or limp, or crippled, or mute, or blinded, or demented, or getting PTSD, or losing an arm, or a leg, etc).

Am asking because it strikes me as really weird for a disease.

  It's not *very* long term. The average human in Dominions has 10 HP. Hardier warriors might have 12, and exceptional heroes might go as high as 16. Disease completely stops natural healing, and causes the loss of 1 HP per month, so basically everyone who contracts Disease dies in a year.

  Diseases that are effectively 100% fatal exist in real life; [rabies is a good example](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/48ujhq/whats_the_scariest_real_thing_on_our_earth/d0mz5uq/?context=3). In such cases, our actual response is just to be really proactive about preventing it.

  That said, the 'non-infectious' bit is *weird*. Not being spread between people, but instead randomly caused by injury and hunger, it seems more like a curse upon the world than an actual disease... and indeed, Dominions has all kinds of nasty magics that cause disease, including on a potentially-global scale. It also has a number of magics that cure disease, from divine powers to herbal remedies to magical sites. Since most such effects cure any afflictions, including stuff like *missing limbs*, it's pretty clear that any setting that contains this particular Disease also contains curative effects of similar potency. So the best answer is the same as with any other disease; first we find a way to treat it, then we find a way to cure it, then we find a way to eradicate it. Given that Dominions includes effects like Gift of Health, which cures all afflictions on a potentially-global scale, the same principle can clearly be applied even to "untreatable" supernatural Disease.

    Wow, a fellow Dominions player! Thanks for the post! And basically agree with everything you said.

    I'm wondering if in addition, there would be significant social fallout from having to deal with those people who get the disease (e.g. similar to nursing homes), if they would be discriminated against and even persecuted, if it would result in witch hunts, if it could be used as a torture / threat method, if it would cause fewer people to sign up for the armed services, if it would change how society views the famished, etc.

  In Dominions it IS treatable, provided that you have a healer unit. A wide variety of human factions get them, and there's two different kinds of independent unit who can do it. Furthermore, anyone with the correct research can cast Cure Disease, craft a Miraculous Cure All Elixir or otherwise get access to suitable medical care. So it's not really untreatable so much as as a serious disease that you won't recover from without treatment.

  That said, I absolutely expect to see it used as a terrorist weapon. (Looking at you, Bane Venom Charm!)

    Oh yea that would get so bad if bane venom charm were to exist in the real world!

  The symptom list is highly suggestive of the consequences of untreated diabetes. Which includes impaired healing of wounds, increased susceptibility to wound infections leading to amputation, impaired vision and blindness from retina damage, heart and kidney damage leading to low oxygen levels and general weakness, etc.

  So it's not really all that weird. All you need is a  common bacteria that can infect wounds but doesn't spread easily from person to person (which describes lots of actual bacteria) that also produces a toxin that, if it gets into the bloodstream, generally messes people up but not badly enough to kill them right away. "Disease" not being contagious might just be an approximation to "You probably would get it if their blood gets into your blood, but that rarely happens in a world without blood transfusions and injected drugs."

  Dominions' medical system is sort of constrained by the fact that the entire setting experienced by the  game is basically during the equivalent of a World War: everything is going into producing and training soldiers and weapons, and only the bare minimum is left for the home front. If you took the world and magic of Dominions and had no enemies to fight, you could make a pretty great paradise with e.g. Gift of Health, Well of Misery, Gift of Nature's Bounty, Disease Grinders and so on and so forth. However, in the game setting pretty much all of the benefits of magic are horribly constrained by the fact that you have to use every magic resource to go kill the other bastards before they take over the world and kill *you*. It's a very Molochian trap, sometimes lead by actual Molochs, where everyone's in a pretty permanent state of competition, sacrificing everything for a competitive edge. 

  One of the more interesting gamey interactions with disease is to have a regen bless and give the diseased unit a shroud of the battle saint. They have a terminal disease that is slowly killing them permanently but it doesn't actually make any progress because they're permanently regenerating...

  One of my favourite nations is MA C'tis, lizard kings of disease. Their swamps being the source of disease to all warmblooded creatures points towards disease also being a stand-in for e.g. malaria and other insect-borne disease. On the other hand, things like Foul Air and battle injuries in general suggest a more widespread infection form of disease. There are units that disease those around them, having basically contagious disease - the mummy and e.g. T'ien Ch'i's Master With The Iron Crutch Li T'ieh-Kuai for example; interestingly both explicitly identify the disease as leprosy in their flavour text (which was often thought, in the time periods Dominions draws on for it's lore, to be much more contagious than we now believe).  There are Disease Demon assassins that spread plague, too, though. Also, you get a chance to get diseased in winter if you're old (especially in death scales). Basically, the weirdness of Dominions Disease from a Doylist perspective is because they're drawing from like a ton of different folklores and superstitions and belief systems that were in turn based on a number of different actual diseases with varying etiologies and prognoses and treatments, and simplifying it to a binary 'diseased y/n' state for gameplay and sanity reasons.
