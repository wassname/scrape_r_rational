## [meta] Weekly Challenge on the Decline?

### Post:

Ok, so is it just me, or does there seem to be a declining interest in the weekly challenges? As in there appears to be less submissions overall, and less  people involved in active discussion of them? While the comment amounts may seem large on a few of the recent ones, it's to be noted that a lot of them are generated by back-and-forth discussion among the same set of users. (edit: as opposed to active discussion among a good spread of users, as it appeared to be in the first few weeks)

If I'm incorrect, then by all means, explain why I am. If I am right, though, then can people tell me why this is? I personally love the weekly challenge, it gives me an excuse to write short stories, my preferred medium. 

Anyway. So. Thoughts?

  If I'm not mistaken, most colleges and schools have been in session long enough that the students amongst us might be needing to concentrate on their curriculum.  That wasn't why I stopped participating, I was busy with other things too, but not school.

    Fair point, an obvious conclusion that hadn't occurred to me, which is doubly sad because I ran a survey months ago that made it clear most of the sub is in their late teens to early twenties, making the schooling answer an obvious first guess.

    I can say that this is the main reason why I haven't contributed to the challenges, even though I wanted to write for Dueling Time Travelers. However, I fully intend to post something for Orange and Blue Morality.

  I think in part it depends on the prompt. I also think that the start of school probably had an impact. We'll see how this week's prompt does? Overall I'm not too worried about it.

    I am curious why that's a bad prompt, if it was a bad prompt, mostly so that I can avoid giving a prompt like that again. Two of what I'd consider the most influential science fiction stories of all time featured dinosaurs: *Jurassic Park* and *A Sound of Thunder*. But I suppose I can see where it wouldn't capture the attention of a rationalist, since while they're cool or flashy, there's nothing particularly "thinky" about them.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I think it's because most of the other prompts were rather easy to generate "thinky" problems for and Dinosaurs are simply about dealing dinosaurs and everything I came up with sounded like an action scene from Jurassic Park.

      I personally think that writing rational fiction can sometimes be harder than being a rationalist if only because you not only have to come up with rational behaviors and actions, you also have to come up with a problem with a solution that involves thinking instead of just having a simple answer of being dependent brave, charismatic, or some non-mental quality.

      Also, Dinosaurs just coincided with the first week of September which is when a lot of us start the school year. This probably is the bigger reason than everything I said above.

      EDIT: If the weekly challenge does start dropping off, I suggest making it into a monthly challenge and several associated threads devoted to giving each other ideas polishing entering contestant's stories. Like a Rational version of NaNoRiMo, except without the length requirement.

      The problem I had with the Dinosaurs prompt was that it was a little limiting. 

      You can either do Jurassic Park (which has been done), time travel (which was the prior week's prompt), or something really weird (which either ends up being hand-wavy, or ends up taking a lot of text to close plot holes), like alien dinosaurs.

      I'm not saying it can't be done with the dinosaurs prompt, it would just take a ton of work to think of something creative that is both effectively communicated, and rational, in the span of a short story.

      As a side note: I wrote a Wolly Mammoth story, but wasn't completely happy with it, and decided not to post it.

  Weekly is way too often, there are no good rewards, and the clinical, self-contained and frequent nature of the contest robs it of even the glory that would be the prime one. What if the contests were monthly, and preceded by a discussion thread where people were encouraged to bat around ideas? That would also give people who didn't care enough to execute a story an avenue to contribute and engage. Just the act of making a new thread to discuss the winning story, and a flair, would go a long way. You could also hand out, idk, discussion time with alexanderwales or something. 

  Again though, weekly is way too frequent for something like this, especially in such a small community and without a material reward. 

  Also worth pointing out that the sub has sort of stultified, with more focus on consumption than original discussion.

  All this comes with the caveat that I haven't been following these contests. And indeed (edit) it looks like you already had a reward flair.
