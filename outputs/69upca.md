        The source paragraph is trying to prove that the "analogy between the world and a sea monster cuts across faiths" and extends that to atheists via the pun.
        The pun hinges on the term "gigantic fluke" and the two meanings of the word "fluke": 1. an unlikely chance occurrence, especially a surprising piece of luck; and 2. either of the lobes of a whale's tail
        Religious people tend to ascribe to atheists the belief that the world and the universe came about by chance (and not by divine creation); so both meanings of "gigantic fluke" apply.

  >“I don’t buy it,” said Ana Thurmond.

  I also don't buy it.

  So, this is fun-theoretic modal realism theodicy. The claim is, to maximise total utility you have to actualize every possible different 4-dimensional block universe where the total amount of goodness is positive. Some of these universes will include instances of unimaginable suffering.


  This entire setup is just a temporal version of one of Derek Parfit's [repugnant conclusions](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/) - the repugant conclusion is a major paradox of Utilitarian reasoning that is still unsolved, but its a paradox for the reason that the conclusion is so repugnant. **If the message of Unsong is that God is moral to actualize all worlds with total utility >0, then it forces us to also accept the repugnant conclusion and all its consequences.**

  Unsong will presumably conclude with all the prisoners in hell, freed and able to enjoy a wonderful existence for some enormous length of time. Just as in the repugnant conclusion, for every person suffering immense pain in Hell we can add another person suffering more intense pleasure/happiness for a longer period of time in heaven, making the total utility of that world positive.

  These extreme worlds that God occasionally actualised, where everything would turn out best in the end even if there are intervals of extreme suffering early on, would be disqualified by the verisons of consequentialism that were created to avoid this kind of paradox (e.g. a critical level view). He should have actualized only all those universes where the welfare of individuals didn't fall below an absolute level.

  So, God has his normative ethics wrong. It's wrong in a more subtle way than in actual religion (where He only cares about individual salvation, rather than individual happiness, thus justifying any amount of human suffering for the sake of greater salvation through faith), but still just mistaken - our values diverge because God's ethics falls victim to moral paradoxes.

  Thus, at the end of Unsong, God's answer reduces to essentially the same, first and obvious answer to theodicy that intelligent people have recongised since the time of the ancient greeks - God is all powerful, he does things that are inconsistent with morality as we understand it, so his morality is not ours. If God has values that allow for the existence of Hell, then he may be good according to those values, but he is not good according to a sane human normative ethics.

  It's not enough that the total trajectory of the Unsong universe makes it turn out good in the end - worlds containing large numbers of people whose welfare falls below an absolute level shouldn't be actualized. A moral theory that doesn't have this feature will fall victim to the repugnant conclusion and similar arguments. We might not be able to know exactly how to fix our version of Utilitarianism to account for this flaw, but it's clear we do need to fix it somehow.
  ```

  - u/TheUtilitaria:
    ```
    I'd be remiss if I didn't add some philosophers do accept the repugnant conclusion, and if you admit that then Unsong's God's actions are at least no worse than actualizing a smaller set of universes, assuming we decide the infinite set of all universes with goodness > 0 is meaningfully larger than the infinite set of all universes with perfect goodness.

    However, Unsong is also playing theodicy on easy mode considering its God doesn't allow *infinite* punishment, and isn't testing people based on their level of faith, unlike the Christian God
    ```

  - u/Little_Cat_Z:

    So, God will create and sustain a universe where the net total utility is positive over its existence? There is no point in making two identical universes since merging them into one will not result in the loss of any sapient experience, but God can create two universes that differ only very slightly. And, in this story that is exactly what he did. He created a perfect universe, then another that had a minor variation, and another, etc. From the story: 

    >  THERE IS A WORLD MADE OF NOTHING BUT BLISS, WITH A GIANT ALEPH IN THE CENTER. THERE IS ANOTHER WORLD MADE OF NOTHING BUT BLISS WITH A GIANT BET IN THE CENTER. AND SO ON

    Apparently that small variation is sufficient for these to be distinct universes. So it stands to reason that there are a pair of universes which are COMPLETELY IDENTICAL IN EVERY WAY except that in one universe there is a box containing a sentient being who endures unimaginable suffering for trillions of years- and in the other universe this does not happen. Without the suffering box in universe 1, there would be no reason for both of these universes to exist simultaneously. This means that God has created a sentient being and tortures it for trillions of years for no reason. 

    In fact, since even minor variations are sufficient for there to be a new universe, God would create and torture every possible sentient being in a box in the middle of their own universe surrounded by bliss. In fact, he would create nearly infinite universes for each possible sentient wherein they are tortured in a differently shaped box or one with different markings on its surface. So long as there is sufficient bliss outside these boxes, the net utility of these universes is positive.

      Why for no reason? This statement pretty much contradicts everything else you wrote, since the rest of your comment makes it clear both that there *is* a reason and that you *understand* the reason. You can *disagree* with God's reasoning, of course, but to claim that he had *no* reason seems empirically false.

        Let's suppose God is an algorithm that creates universes. Before a universe is created, Go checks:

        1. Does this exact universe already exist?
        2. Will the net utility in this universe be negative?

        If the answer to both of these is "no", then the universe will be created. These criteria will allow, for example, the existence of a perfect universe with a giant Aleph in the center, another perfect universe with a giant Bet in the center, etc. Despite the fact that these universes are functionally identical, the algorithm views them as distinct enough to both exist.

        There isn't really any reason for these to both exist since the experiences of the inhabitants will be identical, but algodrithm creates both anyway. It isn't accurate to say that the total utility is the sum of utility^Aleph and utility^Bet because there is no new experience in Bet.

        Now suppose you have two almost identical universes. In both universes there is an impenetrable, opaque box in the center. In one universe, this box is empty; in the other universe, the box contains a sentient being who is being tortured. In this case there *is* a new experience in the second universe, but is is one of negative utility. Algodrithm looks at universe 2 and determines that is is distinct from universe 1 and calculates that even with the torture victim, the net utility of universe 2 is positive. So God creates universe 2. 

        It has already been established that there is no reason to create two identical universes, and since the experience of those outside the box is identical, the only new information is the experience of the victim. So, yes, I can't claim that there is no reason for God to create universe 2, but functionally, the only reason for him to create this second universe is to torture that one dude for trillions of years.

          The God in Unsong says he only controls the seed of the universe, IE the initial circumstances, and also that he "prunes his garden" of universes regularly. I don't see any reason from the text to assume he doesn't take your point into account.

          Assume, however, that the presence of a box containing an ever screaming being might have effects on the sapient beings in that otherwise perfect universe, causing them to differentiate significantly from the other non-screaming box. If you don't take the box having no effect on the other inhabitants of the universe as a given, said inhabitants may be significantly differentiated individuals.

This means that God has created a sentient being and tortures it for trillions of years for no reason. 

      The important distinction is that in both universes, there are trillions of sentient beings who are in a state of bliss for trillions of years. By adding the universe with the one suffering entity, the amount of total happiness has increased by trillions minus one.

        God could create two completely identical universes with completely identical inhabitants, but this would be pointless. Merging the universes into one would not result in any information loss since they are the same universe duplicated. From the story:
        > IF TWO THINGS ARE THE SAME, THEY ARE ONE THING. IF I CREATED TWO PERFECT UNIVERSES, I WOULD ONLY HAVE CREATED ONE UNIVERSE.

        Now suppose you have two almost identical universes. In both universes there is an impenetrable, opaque box in the center. In one universe, this box is empty; in the other universe, the box contains a sentient being who is being tortured. Even though the inhabitants are identical (except the victim), these universes are distinct enough for God to create both of them. The only new information that exists in universe 2 is the torture victim. This means that in creating this universe, the only new information God actually created was a sentient being who is suffering for trillions of years. There is no additional net happiness in universe 2 that is not achieved in the universe without the victim.

          I see the thing you're gesturing at, but I also get the sense that you're jumping to conclusions unsupported by the text.  *In the ontology presented,* the Aleph universe and the Bet universe are considered significantly different enough that the enraptured consciousnesses in each are not redundant, and do count.  That single fact—indisputable given the text—knocks your whole argument over (though I admit your argument holds *if we ignore the text*).

            In other words, it seems to me that you're claiming that a rule's been broken, but the text never laid out that rule.  Or, as I read and interpret—the text laid out a rule that could've been any of several things (including the version you're arguing from), but the further addition of the story's context narrowed the possibility space to a version you're refusing to consider in your argument.
            ```

          - u/Little_Cat_Z:
            ```
            My interpretation of the text was that there is no fundamental difference between the worlds of perfect bliss where one has a giant Aleph at the center and the other has a giant Bet at the center. Unless the inhabitants are able to interact with these structures, their experiences will be the same. I don't see where in the context of the story this is refuted. 

            I will agree that if the inclusion of a giant Bet or a box with a suffering person gives the rest of the world's inhabitants a unique set of experiences, not otherwise attainable, then my argument does not hold.

            - u/TK17Studios:

              It's refuted by the fact that it's God who set the rule of "don't make redundant universes," and yet he was willing to make both of those universes (therefore, not redundant according to the rules; since he wouldn't be breaking his *own* rules that must modify our understanding of what the rule *is*).

      God only creates the initial conditions of a universe (the seed which forms the highest celestial realm Atziluth) at Time 0, so the suffering sentient beings in their boxes have to get there somehow and persist for trillions of years. Let's name the sentient being in the box Robin.

      How did Robin get in the box? God may work in mysterious ways, but I don't think absolute bliss would abruptly self-transmute into torture. It's a punishment from God - let's name the representation of the severity of his punishment Thamiel.

      We know at least one instance of a universe with a suffering Robin tortured by a Thamiel, but we also know that its "neighborhood" is almost completely barren of other universes worth instantiating. I take this to indicate that God, generally speaking, doesn't instantiate many universes with Hells. If he does instantiate it, there must be something worthwhile there -- God's utilitarianism might be one of the refined flavors that doesn't completely skewer itself on the repugnant conclusion

    No need. [Average utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism) suffices to address this particular concern.

    (Side note: I'm not an average utilitarian; nor am I convinced that the Repugnant Conclusion is all that repugnant in the first place. But even if I was, I wouldn't take that intuition as strong evidence that total utilitarianism is mistaken, since it's just as likely for my intuition to be mistaken. This sort of "intuition as law" attitude is actually one of my major pet peeves with the field of moral philosophy. It's as if they refuse to even consider the possibility that maybe, just maybe, it's their intuitions that are wrong, not the theory.)

    At what level of welfare does a universe become too awful to be actualized? Or, in UNSONG terms:

    WHAT IS THE CORRECT LEVEL OF SUFFERING AT WHICH TO DECLARE THE UNIVERSE UNACCEPTABLE? WHEN A SPARROW FALLS? WHEN SOMEONE BURNS FOR FOUR THOUSAND YEARS? WHEN SOME NINCOMPOOP BOILS A GOAT IN ITS MOTHER'S MILK?

    If God can anticipate the desires of a created being, and foresees that said being would prefer to exist than not exist, he may have a moral imperative to create all such beings that do not require the existence of a given threshold of evil.

  What annoys me is that that explanation for the problem of evil means that you're essentially living in a chaotic universe.

    The universes seem to be ranked by their number of flaws, a norm [equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) to complexity.

    If only a single universe can grow from each seed, the cosmos is deterministic ("Nothing is ever a coincidence."), and Adam Kadmon has to contain a recording of all true static (the sort of static that has maximal [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)).

    If this universe is in the middle of a vast waste, we wouldn't expect to ever see any true static in it, because that static could have been instantiated differently and then there would be a neighbor in the vast waste.

    If this universe is in the furthest edges of the garden, we can't have it devolve into true chaos because that'd mean additional complexity and getting even further from the center.

    Corollary: Uriel, on the day that he wanted Sohu to remain, reached into Adam Kadmon and eliminated one of the degrees of freedom that could have meant neighbors in the vast waste.

    Not necessarily*.  It's a modal argument.  God is instantiating the best (set) of all possible worlds, but he's still limited by possibility and impossibility.  He could not, for instance, create a world where squares are round, that has no referent.  Things that are necessary in modal terms (like the existence of God or mathematical relations) must exist in all possible worlds.  Causality could be such a thing, or perhaps it's emergent from types of cosmogony-seeds that are statistically common in creating goodness.  In the terms of Uriel's Kabballah, Atziluth is the same in all possible worlds, and causality may be classed there, or may belong to a large portion of expressions of Briyah by the nature of the former's relation to the latter.

      This surely cannot be. Uriel edited Atziluth to create SCABMOM. It must be universe-local.

      I think Adam Kadamon, the world seed, is exactly synonymous with Atziluth, and causality may be a *very common feature* or even universal among different world seeds, but we probably can't say anything about that one way or another

    God is described as instantiating the seed of the universe, Adam Kadmon, which includes its own laws of cause and effect:

    >I DID NOT SAY, ANA THURMOND, THAT YOUR WORLD IS GOOD NOW. I SAID THAT ADAM KADMON, ITS SEED, WAS A GOOD SEED. THAT IT WILL UNFOLD, BIT BY BIT, RINGING CONCLUSION AFTER CONCLUSION FROM ITS PREMISES, UNTIL FINALLY ITS OWN INTERNAL LOGIC CULMINATES IN ITS SALVATION.

    "Its own internal logic" sounds like it has rules that it abides by. And this is not implied to be unusual.

    We have no idea what a "typical" universe in this space is like; although we know what the centre of the Garden is like, and we have one other sample near the edge, we don't have much of a probability distribution. It could be that universes with smaller descriptions are privileged somehow - that the universes whose laws of physics fit on one page are more common than those which have no coherent laws and whose shortest description is just a list of every event, moment to moment, with no pattern to it.

    I mean, the total number of universes God is considering must be finite, right? Consequentialist ethics breaks down when dealing with infinities, the whole system has to be finite to work as Metatron describes. Very large, maybe, but finite (Answer to Job says it's more than 10^10^10^10^10^984 ) And if it's finite, we don't know how many of your "chaotic" universes are even under consideration.

    It could be that the typical universe is chaotic with no consistent rules. It could be that the typical universe has consistent rules that don't support life (e.g. there are no stable atoms). It could be that the typical universe is something else entirely. Answers on a postcard, please. But we really have no idea.

  As a Tegmarkian modal realist, I'm unconvinced that God's choice of whether to instantiate a particular universe actually affects that universe's existence in a morally relevant sense. Indeed, one could even argue that to determine whether a universe is worthy of being created in the first place, God must perform a computation to determine its goodness. Such a computation would likely be equivalent to simulating the universe in question, which in my view is no different from instantiating it directly. Hence, by the very act of determining whether a particular universe is worthy of instantiation, God simulates (and therefore instantiates) every possible universe, including those that fail to meet his criteria.

    In a classical theist sense, God's omniscience is not a potential to be actualized (he does not have to run a computation to determine if P is true) he knows the truth value of any well formed statement innately.

    That's assuming He's dead-set on creating every possible universe where good outweighs evil.  If, however, He's willing to let some good universes not be created, then I'd imagine he could make some educated guesses- create some low-resolution universe simulations, so to speak- and only create the universes guaranteed to be net good according to those models.

    Kabbalah already resembles an oracle, in that it allows prediction of events that are not related causally. There's nothing to say the principles of Kabbalah, used by God, don't simply allow Him to determine, via a close reading of Adam Kadmon bare, the eventual goodness of a given universe. He might *model* entities at some level of granularity, but the whole point of kabbalah is that it lets you skip steps.

  On one hand, that's a shit answer.  The good and the bad don't just balance out like that.  I'd argue for at least a weak form of negative utilitarianism - I just don't believe that a tiny contribution to net happiness is worth *that much suffering*.

  On the other hand, the chapter kind of illustrates the point - good enough to still be engaging, bad enough I no longer regret having a prior engagement during the wrap-up party.  Utility optimizing for me?  Maybe.  I mean, I see how it relates to the digrammaton and everything, but yeah, not my favorite chapter.

    > I just don't believe that a tiny contribution to net happiness is worth that much suffering

    You may be making the same error as Ana in assuming that it is going to be tiny contribution. I think the following paragraph strongly indicates that it may be a large net contribution in the end.

    > “YES,” said God. “WHICH IMPLIES THAT HELL MUST NOT BE ETERNAL. I DID NOT SAY, ANA THURMOND, THAT YOUR WORLD IS GOOD NOW. I SAID THAT ADAM KADMON, ITS SEED, WAS A GOOD SEED. THAT IT WILL UNFOLD, BIT BY BIT, RINGING CONCLUSION AFTER CONCLUSION FROM ITS PREMISES, UNTIL FINALLY ITS OWN INTERNAL LOGIC CULMINATES IN ITS SALVATION.”

      At the same time, we have heard that UNSONG!God created worlds until they were just marginally more good than bad, and that they are in a world close to or at that border.  So at least compared to many other worlds, it seems it will be a small contribution indeed.
      ```

      - u/Alphanos:

        Not necessarily the case.  We must distinguish between two things: the boundaries of which hypothetical worlds are sufficiently net-good to be worth creating, and the boundaries of actualized created worlds which were able to fulfill those standards.  The answer talks about how the world of UNSONG exists surrounded by a metaphysical vast waste of possibilities which were never actualized.  This suggests that as you grow nearer to the edges of the garden, the actualized net-good worlds become less and less frequent from among the many possibilities.  Because of these wastes of unrealized possibility, there may actually be a very large metaphysical distance in net-goodness between the hypothetical least net-good world and the actualized least net-good world.

          I interpret that somewhat differently.  The way I read it, even the reason the thicket of non-actualization exists is because even one coincidence less is enough to drive the net-good into negative values, where the world is an "[abomination] of wickedness".  Additionally, it appears that net-goodness decreases monotonically as distance from the center increases, and UNSONG's universe is quite far from the center.  It would seem that this means that UNSONG is almost certainly about a reality which is only barely worth actualizing by UNSONG!God's standards, and likely not worth actualizing by my own.

            It's interesting to see how the same chapter can be interpreted very differently.  The chapter strongly implies that in the UNSONG universe, hell will not be eternal.  I interpret this to ultimately result in an infinite degree of net-goodness.  However great the degree of past suffering and iniquity, an eternal future without such evil will inevitably produce an unlimited quantity of good to outweigh the finite amount of evil.

            Since we are told that this universe is towards the outer edges of the garden, and yet we can still expect an infinite degree of net-goodness, then I interpret the meaning of the garden edges differently.  I think this implies that God's omnibenevolence results in all actualized worlds producing an infinite degree of net-good.  However, the edges of the garden are where it becomes increasingly difficult and infrequent for a world with such a large quantity of evil to still end up resulting in such an infinite net-good outcome.

            Thus all of the coincidences.  Rather than one slipped coincidence changing the result from (Good - Evil = 1) to (Good - Evil = -1), I take it that one slipped coincidence would change the result from (Good - Evil = Infinite Good) to (Good - Evil = Infinite Evil).  It becomes very rare for seeds in the vicinity of the UNSONG universe to manage to defeat and destroy evil to produce a net-infinite-good eternal future.  So that is why God declines to create the worlds that do not produce the favourable result.

            - u/Ibbot:
              ```
              On the other hand, God describes infinite good and states that no more worlds can be infinitely good.  So I don't see the destruction of hell as producing infinite good.  Eliminating a source of future infinite evil, definitely, but the living world will still contain evil and an insufficiency of good.  Eliminating hell is a big and necessary step towards infinite good, and may even be the push towards some net positive goodness, but I don't see it as a sufficient step.  Of course, it sounds like the dead and dying go to heaven, but the living will still suffer, and why not simply start in heaven?  I suppose we may see next weekend what the correct interpretation is.

            You've got that backwards. The "center" is the perfectly good world by which all others are generated. Distance from the center is a calculation, stating how different it is from the center. One way of viewing the highly dimensional data that is worlds.
            ```

            - u/Ibbot:

              And I would expect net goodness to strictly decrease as difference from perfection increases.
              ```

  - u/holomanga:
    ```
    Also remember that the tiny contribution to net happiness also includes a *very large* amount of happiness that's locked up counterbalancing the bad that goes on, kind of. Rather than being 1 hedon and 1000 antihedons, it's 1001 hedons and 1000 antihedons.
