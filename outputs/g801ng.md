  The moral of the story is: make sure your spam filter is up-to-date. Also, million-to-one shots happen approximately one in a million times. This is a direct follow-up to ['Bows and Arrows against the Lightning'](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/bows-and-arrows-against-the-lightning/) - and far, far in the future of [Ascent](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/chapter-1-necessity/).

  Simulation capture! VR galaxies! War! It's got everything, though I'm still really stuck on how we got here from Ascent. What is this, a thousand years in its future?
