  So, finally caught up with this story. 

  I do like it, but ... 112 chapters, but it's been what, 2 months since he arrived? And only now is starting to work towards the delving part?

  Don't get me wrong. I definitely appreciate the lack of EDGE this story has, the time it takes to world build, as well a slow and steady progression in abilities, but man is this slow!

  Not to mention he's taking a very lackadaisical approach to not dying... I get he's support based and personal power would be a long time coming, but you'd think he'd prioritize not dying/getting injured by your abilities first. It's only recent chapters it seems like this is becoming a thing he's working on. 

  Another thing. There's being naive and nice, but there's another when making the stupidest decisions possible, and then going 'Oh well, what can you do?" How about applying that reasoning before the decision?? The fact that he isn't chained up in a basement or dead is kind of a miracle in itself. 

  Sorry for the rant. Again, I do like the story really, but it was tough at times to get though, not counting the micromanaging of stats... Also it's kind of shitty how he's kind of guilt tripping  Ameliah to join, but I understand she's needed.
  ```

  - u/zorianteron:
    ```
    I mean, if you're talking about trying not to die, having Ameliah along is one of the best things he do towards that.
    ```

    - u/chojinra:
      ```
      I agree completely, I'm glad he went for it. Goes for the survival thing. It just feels like the way he did it was a bit.. off. Then again, if you look at it as an awkward guy with very little female experience, it kind of fits.
      ```

      - u/zorianteron:
        ```
        The author's just trying to make the character relatable for most of his audience ;)
        ```

- u/sibswagl:
  ```
  I really hope Rain pushes the members of his group to make their builds public, at least to other members. We don’t know how crazy Ameliah is as a Bronze, but she’s crazy useful as a Silver, so hopefully it scales down.
  ```

  - u/interested_commenter:
    ```
    She's probably pretty mediocre as a Bronze actually, at least compared to other rare classes. Her ability to change skills is amazing but doesn't unlock until Silver. We don't actually know what her original build was, but in addition to perfectly even stats she probably had skills in several minimally-related trees, which means missing out on the ability to stack metamagic.

    The build might work well with Rain, since she would be a frontline fighter who can actually benefit from him providing mana, but as a solo warrior it's probably weaker than a well-planned traditional warrior build.
    ```

    - u/zombieking26:
      ```
      Yup, there's a reason the saying goes "Jack of all trades, Master of none"
      ```

    - u/Slyvena:
      ```
      I think her original build was a smattering of poor choices based on her desperate life, choosing the skills she needed to survive day to day over the years. Then she lucked out big time and it turned out her miss-matched assortment of 'necessary to survive one more day' skills unlocked the Legendary class with a similar theme.
      ```

      - u/interested_commenter:
        ```
        Maybe, though considering her father told her how to get her rare bronze class and she did tell Rain that Legendary Silver requires 5 points each in 5 specialization trees, I think it's likely she did do that. Since that's not widely known, I doubt she would imply that its THE way to do it if she had done it a different way. I'd guess that when her dad helped her get her bronze class he also told her to keep putting points in the same five trees (though probably not a full build).

        The only "suboptimal" skill we know she took as a Bronze is Purify, and you do get one freebie (5 trees with 5 points each, but you get 26 points to do it).
        ```

- u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
  ```
  How long has it been since this story has had any real interaction with the System?

  The characters are not interesting enough to support mostly character driven story arc. This veritable sea of one dimensional characters are entirely forgettable and the dialogue is cringey and full of bad memes.
  ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    I'm surprised anyone on r/rational is this unhappy with the mc not getting more powerup handouts.  He's still finding new ways to exploit the ones he's got.

    Even if he was getting more skill handouts, his build is complete garbage for delving without a party to benefit from his skills, and any extra skills won't change that, they'll just kill opportunities for future story moments.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      r/rational is a lot more about numbers-go-up munchkining and less about savvy constraint optimization than you'd think.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        It's not like people share the stuff that is actually like that here, so I'd disagree.
        ```

      - u/Charlie___:
        ```
        Demographics shift, it happens.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It's not that the MC isn't getting power-ups, it's that there's been very little new system-driven stuff and instead a bunch of cringey interpersonal stuff that SenescentSoul sucks at writing.
      ```

      - u/MilesSand:
        ```
        Are you saying that adding numbers on a spreadsheet would make up for a weakness the writer's writing ability? Because it sounds like you're saying that.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Yes. "Tolerate cringey writing in exchange for interesting system-side stuff" is supposed to be Delve's whole deal.
          ```

        - u/sibswagl:
          ```
          I mean, let's be real, a non-insignificant portion of both litRPG fans and ratfic fans really like numbers-go-up. I personally like numbers-go-up. Numbers-go-up is useful for conveying growth and plot progression (though obviously you need to actually *do stuff* with said larger numbers).

          Rain has been capped for a long time. And sure, he's still figuring stuff out and plot is happening, but he's not getting any stronger. And in a world as explicitly who's-got-the-bigger-stick as a litRPG world, well, that matters.
          ```

          - u/Veedrac:
            ```
            > And sure, he's still figuring stuff out and plot is happening, but he's not getting any stronger.

            This is not at all true. He's progressed in quite a few ways. He's trained his stats up, as well as figured out how to raise them further, he got a macro hack, he's got better use of his powers for damage, and he even now leads a group, with quite a haul of money, and the authority that comes from a Custodian plate from the Watch. He's been working on his meditation skills, with obvious future payoff, with additional payoff from the tons of accolades he collected, and he hacked his way into getting Dozer. And that's not even counting the tech progress.

            I agree with MilesSand that it's weird /r/rational is so disappointed he's not just getting points-go-up freebies. Rain has been making large leaps in personal and extrapersonal power, but because his level is unchanged people are treating it like it doesn't count.
            ```

            - u/kaukamieli:
              ```
              This. And even if he had not gotten all that, the system and the world is interesting enough to see him adventure there. He is hacking ancient artifacts, saving cities and gaining KNOWLEDGE that nobody else really has and can use it for later power.

              I don't care if he never levels up. All this lateral powerstuff could make him very important dude. He will probably figure out how the Gitbook works and publish a wikipedia equivalent about the powers.
              ```

              - u/Noir_Bass:
                ```
                I mean, reading his comments it sounds like his problem is mostly that the writing for the dialogues and interpersonal stuff is pretty weak, which...it kinda is, not gonna lie, but I agree the power progression part of the story is really well done, keeping it way more interesting than just numbers-go-up while conserving the feeling of the MC constantly progressing. It's good enough that I can easily overlook the weaker parts of the writing at least.
                ```

          - u/MilesSand:
            ```
            As I see it the appeal in a ratfic sense is about finding ways to be at the top of the heap without having it granted by the metaphysical forces that rule it all. Rain is doing that.  He's being slow and has to earn every baby step, but he's doing it. 

            As for having a bigger stick he'll never beat any of the big players in a 1 on 1 fight (or a 1 vs hivemind fight in the case of the Citizens).  He's a support class while they're all soloists or some variation of soloists. Blues won't help  with that.  At least until he has a party together, which, he's working on that.  Some blue ex machina that sneaks up on him just to die in his face, again, would be pretty lame.
            ```

            - u/sibswagl:
              ```
              Yeah, that's absolutely a fair point. There's definitely an aspect of doing the best with what you have.

              To me, it feels like Rain's stalled because he hasn't gotten much stronger, even within the constraints of his level cap. It's a tough balance to strike -- if he finds some super OP combo or exploit, it feels cheap; if he makes small, incremental progress, it feels slow.
              ```

              - u/MilesSand:
                ```
                I agree it feels slow.  I think that's just the author being bad at pacing rather than the need for a super-mega-ultra-rare creature to show up and change a number on a spreadsheet.
                ```

      - u/HantuAnggara:
        ```
        If you look at the reviews, many complain about his characters. I suppose that's why he's focusing on it.

        Personally, I would prefer he focused more on the system and I've been strategizing my Patreon subscription whenever the story does that. For example, when he got stuck in the town crystal thing. Interface/system customization is the primary reason I'm reading this story and it's hard to find anything similar. It's also why I don't really mind if he can't level up because he is still growing regardless.

      That's not possible, he doesn't have a harem, or a shitty ability that is secretly OP.

      Well, he doesn't have the former, and who knows about the latter.

        His shitty ability that is secretly OP is excel spreadsheets.

            Except it's only really OP because the world is conveniently set up in a way for that to be the case.. An ancient super advanced civilization existed before, but somehow everyone, even the educated elite forgot about the concept of zero. Sure.. 

            &#x200B;

            Also the world is very badly optimized. No crafters because slavery, but he has a crafter friend to make him OP items. Nobody understands basic math even though they can build castles, forts and large cities with lights everywhere. Hmmm...

            &#x200B;

            People living in huts and without writing on the americas understood math and invented the concept of zero, but in delve that's up to the MC to fix.

            &#x200B;

            The annoying part is, we know what's going to happen and it isn't that interesting. He'll optimize the world by creating systems to protect crafters, elevate commoners and teach people basic math.

              ```
              So far I don't think we've seen any construction that people on earth couldn't do thousands of years ago without the concept of 0, though?
              ```

              - u/fassina2:
                ```
                Not necessarily zero but they'd need more advanced mathematics than they have to build 5 stories tall towers like the one stavo has.

                Or castles, forts, bridges, multistory buildings, bathhouses, city walls etc. 

                The level of math they display doesn't match their architecture at all. At their level they should have huts made of straw and dirt like most europeans did until 2500 to 1500 years ago depending on the region.
                ```

                - u/zorianteron:
                  ```
                  I mean, historically, when the roman empire collapsed people lost the knowledge/ability to build their large buildings (stone arches, viaducts, bath-houses etc), but the buildings themselves remained for centuries.  The majistraal are the collapsed empire, and I think it's mentioned that the bath-house was a majistraal building (as were quite a few others).  You could even handwave some of the 'maintaining old structures' problems by saying that they were magically reinforced.
                  ```

                  - u/fassina2:
                    ```
                    The majistraal are much older. Some of their buildings are buried hundreds of feet underground. I think assuming most buildings in the city are of majistraal origin is a bit of a stretch, but it's handwavable.
                    ```

                    - u/zorianteron:
                      ```
                      The only majistraal building I know of that's underground is the barrier crystal chamber, and I think that's a case of being deliberately built underground in the first place rather than solid rock forming up over it.

                      I think it's explicitly stated that the teleportation platform is a majistraal artifact, and I don't think those are mobile.
                      ```

        - u/chojinra:
          ```
          Well, that and Algebra. Which is basically what Excel is... huh. Good point.

  Rain with a skill swapping friend is going to be fun. 

  The  other thing besides non-synergistic skills is the secrecy about classes and skills. The Guard at least seems to have their standard builds that do useful things, but the guild really should too. Even just having level 5 class picks well known does a big bump for most adventurers. 

  His ideas on builds may also chance when he finally bumps into the damage cap or see more of the higher level people in action, and learning about their skill mixes.

  Also, we have only just started seeing crafting. We've seen stat boosting, and we've seen basic enchantment, but what kinds of things do higher tier crafting skills do? Can you boost skills? Skill Categories? Classes? Class Bonuses or Effects? How far will rain's tech development go, and how much will crafting support that?
  ```

  - u/TwoxMachina:
    ```
    Skill swap + Dynamo should let her level up a lot of skills.
    ```

    - u/kaukamieli:
      ```
      What kind of party has she been running with to have leveled multiple full classes so high? Feels weird without supports.
      ```

      - u/MilesSand:
        ```
        She's just been at this since the age of five and had an altruistic streak that got her into lots of situations where skill use was needed.
        ```

        - u/interested_commenter:
          ```
          She also has the benefit of perfectly balanced stats, which means much more points into the regen stats than most people (she has a 1:1 ratio instead of the 3:1 or 4:1 of most mages), plus the ability to power level using metamagic/regen skills that would otherwise be suboptimal. For example, she can do physical training while her mana regens, then magic training while she recovers stamina, while having skills that boost both (Intrinsic Clarity and its equivalents). She can also switch to passive skills when she's not training, maybe even abusing whatever that skill was that gives a huge regen boost but prevents casting. Her class perk offers a lot of ways to game the leveling system; even if she can't level as easily as Rain she's been doing it much longer.
          ```

            > She also has the benefit of perfectly balanced stats, which means much more points into the regen stats than most people (she has a 1:1 ratio instead of the 3:1 or 4:1 of most mages)

            Well, it won't really help because she is MAD between six stats instead of two. If a Normal Mage is 3:1 then he might run 40 Int 20 Clarity per 60 points. She's going to be running 10/10/10/10/10/10 instead. So relative to their size, her pools recover thrice as fast, but at an absolute rate, they recover half speed.
            ```

            - u/interested_commenter:
              ```
              Right, but the mage has basically zero stamina/health regen and probably no skills that depend on them. If she's really grinding skills/xp, Ameliah can insure she never has full stamina or mana, and (if she's smart/dedicated enough) probably use low-teir blood magic to take advantage of her health regen. When a mage runs out of mana, they're done training for the day, when Ameliah runs out she can train physical skills.

              It's not the biggest factor (not nearly as big as having leveled metamagics), but it does help
              ```

              - u/kaukamieli:
                ```
                Only when she is actually training. It takes her time to switch skills. IIRC it's a lot of time. She could have some magic and some physical stuff at the same time, but then she would have a bad build on and that would be bad if she got surprised.
                ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    Guild members tend to follow published skill progressions.

    That said, I'm actually of the opinion that the "bad" progressions are only bad if they don't have properly built teammates, or decided to switch focus midway, like Staavo did after losing his foot.  Though if Tallheart can make a good enough prosthetic he may be able to recover and turn his build into a decent hybrid build with some hidden skills.
    ```

    - u/zombieking26:
      ```
      Fair, though I think only choosing one stat over a more balanced approach is a bad idea unless you have something that can counteract your weaknesses.
      ```

      - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
        ```
        I think you're wrong here. The system is all about stacking multiplies and exponential growth so I think that if you go for a balanced approach you're going to reach a point where your defence isn't high enough to stop a one hit kill from an offensive specced monster, and your offence isn't high enough to hurt a tanky monster. 

        You'd be much better off going for a DPS/Tank combo and squeezing out every drop of exponential growth.
        ```

        - u/zombieking26:
          ```
          Ok, let me be clear here with what I meant.
          Yes, it's obviously better to do what you just said given you have perfect knowledge and access to gear. But what would have happened if rain never got his armor? 


          He would be dead. Full stop. Yes, hyper specialization is more optimal in a society that allows it, but if you're an average joe in this world with a level cap of 10 and no money to your name, I think a more balanced approach increases your chance of survival, even if it means you'll may never obtain godlike stats.
          ```

      - u/MilesSand:
        ```
        True, but I mean we've seen the system reveal hidden skills to rescue people who make those kinds of decisions, or even reward them.

          Whatever the optimal build and optimal set if builds for a party are, they may well include a lot of that sort of hyper specialization.

        ^(And yes, even though there's probably not an outright "bad" build as long as it's coherent, there's almost certainly an optimal build since the system relies on the illusion of depth through limiting information rather than actual depth through incomparable choices.)
        ```

- u/TheTruthVeritas:
  ```
  Nice to see that ass Rankin get his justice for embezzling all that Tel.

  And we get some hard confirmation on Rain's plans for his group. He explicitly states the problem with Awakened and why they can't deal with monsters at higher levels, as both get exponential amounts of strength, which is negligible at lower levels and is apparent at high levels, with most of the humans' strength coming from a synergized party. Crafters, tanks, magical dps, physical dps, ranged and physical attackers, healers, and supports in one party can increase a group's total strength far more than a party of jack of all trades dps, an issue that can't be resolved normally in that world due to its medieval level, exemplified when Rain brings up Tallheart and how Awakened don't have easy access to such a valuable and important power boost, akin to fighting without equipment in normal games. We've already known all this earlier, but it's nice for Rain to explicitly say all that and confirm it.

  Now I just wish we'd get on with the action, I want to get back to the theorycrafting and min-maxing in combat. How many more months until we get back to the good part? We've already spent an entire month with Rain stuck in a hole and another month with Rain stuck in a coma, please give us some action.
  ```

  - u/chojinra:
    ```
    Not going to lie, I actually liked the coma part. It felt like he was really taking strides to understand his abilities, and found a way to create an interface to ancient technologies that few can master. It felt like he was actually growing and becoming truly powerful... 

    Aaand then he gave it away for nothing. I get it, extricating yourself from that situation ASAP to not get tied up in politics is smart, but I was hoping there was a bit more take away from the situation.
    ```

    - u/HantuAnggara:
      ```
      Same here, I thought that maybe the story was going the settlement building direction even if it means they would be involved in a war. Too bad Rain chose the smart decision rather than the fun one.
      ```

      - u/chojinra:
        ```
        Yeah, steady progression seems to be the key here. 

        Still, maaaybe that progress can tick up just a notch...
        ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Tbh I do not think crafters belong to the party. They should be doing the crafting. They are a force multiplier when they are not in a dungeon. In the dungeon there should be someone else with actual dungeoneering skills. And occasionally get leveled up with the party's assistance when possible. I don't think the world would be balanced so that every 8th awakened would be a crafter.

    Personally I think the story is not going to the direction where Rain gets a big blue again. He has newbies, so they would be trying to get them some levels first. Then they could help him get some levels.
    ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      They have to be part of the party to level properly.  Crafting build stats translate directly into combat skills when part of a party anyway, especially with proper support buffs and protection via main tank (defender in the mc party case). 

       Tallheart's party role, for example, is a utility role for creating battlements where the party can fight and recover, with some pretty good DPS and off-tank damage sponge capabilities from his massive raw stats.
      ```

      - u/RiOrius:
        ```
        Seems like it's easy enough to get XP just from using skills, especially with a Dynamo/Winterbot around. Crafters only need to be in the party when hunting blues to raise the cap. That's the bigger bottleneck anyway, right?
        ```

        - u/MilesSand:
          ```
          A crafter has the ability to make tools on the fly, so the party doesn't have to carry a bunch of special and situational equipment around.  For example, Tallheart's skills would lend themselves wonderfully toward making walls and barriers to CC  enemies.  Or custom shaped keys for locks, collars for creatures the party may wish to capture.  His presence adds a lot of utility that's just not available without a crafter, since bags of infinite carry space are unavailable. He also lets the party use resources immediately instead of having to go back, allowing for longer delves and less time wasted travelling back and forth.

          The off-dps and off-tank roles are to cover for when the mains could use some help. They give the party much-needed flexibility because a more specialized dps can't damage sponge and a more specialized tank can't CC or deal rapid damage.

            How much of that could be done better by other builds though? Tallheart is, I think, the highest level charachter in Rains circle of friends by far so just on raw stats alone he's a formidable fighter. 

            But for example, making walls and barriers: Ameliah's earth magic seems to have done that better and faster despite her being at a lower level and not having class the way an actual Earth mage would.
            ```

            - u/Slyvena:
              ```
              That's probably just her being a high level. Ameliah even remarked in her POV chapter that an earth mage her level could have done it easier than her. It seems like Uncertain Saviour is able to be 70-80% as strong as a specialized class, but it can be any class it wants.

        ... that's what I said. Get leveled with ther party's assistance. I.E. Being in the actual party when they are leveling the crafter. He does not have to be in most of the raids, just in some specific ones fit to level him up.

        Pretty sure someone else could do those roles better. Otherwise he would be OP crafter and dps/tank and it would be stupid to not go that route for pretty much everybody.

  Man I wonder what  [SenescentSoul](https://www.royalroad.com/profile/122908) is gonna do from here. I'm getting super excited about the potential kingdom(in this case guild)-building coming up, and political power is my favorite kind of OP MC power to read about. 

  With that said everyone seems to be complaining about the interpersonal parts of the story, which would be necessary to explore rain's growing political power... I guess I hope Sense ignores them and goes that root anyway? Personally I don't care much for the numbers-go-up. I love the direction it is going now with a more large-scale political approach.

  - u/HantuAnggara:

    People like the interpersonal parts of the story. People just don't think SenescentSoul does it as good as he does the system and would rather have him focus on that instead. That's how I see it at least.
    ```

  - u/general_enthusiast:
    ```
    Likewise! I enjoy seeing the contents of the system given how much thought went into it (such as when it's mentioned in other people's chapters), but I'd also be perfectly happy if he never levelled again.

    To me at least, the interpersonal parts *are* the strength of the story: 


    - As you say, there's political intrigue to spare;

    - The sociological aspects are extremely well thought out, and contrast with his beliefs in interesting ways; 

    - Rain's individual relationships show a lot about him, but importantly the other characters have their own relationships and plans rather than *just* following his ideas (at worst, most could be their own cliche fantasy protagonists);

    - Rain has a strong sense of morality and emotionally intelligent ways of expressing it (to me, both great things in a protagonist). 

    It's a shame to see some people don't value these in this fiction as much as its power progression, if only because I see a slow pace as a tool to explore these rather than as a flaw of writing.

  Loved Rain's rant in this chapter. I also sympathized with the adventurers' confusion when Rain was trying to explain Rankin's scam. I understood it, but it took a few rereads to fully get it.

  The part that wasn't immediately obvious is that adventurers are completely unaffected by this scam, their quest rewards are the exact same. Rankin was just siphoning away some of the Guild's share/tax.

  But I think Rain made the right choice to "bribe" the adventurers so they don't try to claim the rest of his money and to get some necessary goodwill from them and the Guild.
  ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    This was my opinion too. But there's another layer. By his speech and then bribing them to pay them "back" he's convinced a lot of them that Rankin did in fact steal from them directly.

     He's secured their goodwill but also their help in getting Rankin turned over to the guild to face his penalties, for some goodwill from the Guild, when normally most of them wouldn't care if they weren't the ones being stolen from.
    ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    > Rankin was just siphoning away some of the Guild's share/tax.

    No he was not. He was siphoning money from those who bought services from the guild. They should have been paying less. The guild got what the correct tax was from the correct payment.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Using Rain's example in story:

      If the quest is posted with a reward of 100 tel, then the payers pay 110 tel, adventurers get the reward of 100 tel, and the Guild gets the tax of 10% at 10 tel. That's what happens as normal.

      But with Rankin's interference, the quest is still posted with a reward of 100 tel, the payers pay 110 tel, adventurers get 100 tel, and the guild is told that the quest was worth only 90 tel, and therefore get only 9 tel. That leaves 100 reward tel + 9 tax tel + 1 tel for Rankin which is 110 tel for payers to pay.

      In both cases, adventurers and payers all see everything as normal. The only one who is affected, is the Guild. Which makes sense, because adventurers probably also post quests from time to time and would have been suspicious if things were off when they were paying versus earning.

  What do you guys think is the make up for Rain's supposed 8 man party? Like 2 different types of magic attackers, 2 physical attackers, 2 defenders then some sort of utility/support class like his own and then a healer. That's my guess.

    I imagine it will change depending on the specific creatures of dungeons.  
    It will probably make sense to think of smaller sets of 2-3 class clusters. Smaller groupings of highly specalised class synergies that together can fufill 'High DPS', 'Group Shielding', 'Group Battery' roles.  
    Although, group battery basically means you just need to have a Dynamo in every party above level 10 (when their aura synergies start getting potent). After level 25, a Dynamo is mandatory as their auras essentially become high speed regen Health/Stamina/Mana all at once.  
    For other classes, they can forgo the passives that normally increase their regeneration and instead double down on true class potentials
    ```

    - u/clawclawbite:
      ```
      Dynamo and Aura mage are two different things, much as Rain is getting good synergy. His key non-dynamo ability is selective target Force Ward. That said, the dps people do know that offense is a form of defense, and having the Mana and possibly stamina to go all out every encounter is great.
      ```

      - u/Slyvena:
        ```
        I'm aware. But honestly a non-dynamo Aura mage is pathetic and will take far too long to even get feasible.
        A Dynamo non-aura mage only becomes truely useful at Gold Tier, at which point a Dynamo Aura mage is still always better (unless you are alone).
        The two dovetail together so nicely, there is almost never any reasonable reason to spec into only one unless you were the last man alive on earth.
        ```

          >But honestly a non-dynamo Aura mage is pathetic

          Worker would've been a much better choice than Dynamo for Rain.  1.5x multipliers to Winter, Extend, Amplify, Focus, Intrinsic Clarity, Intrinsic Focus, Cross Coupling, Aura Synergy...

          He'd have higher mana regen, more damage (via metamagic only), and more powerful utility skills.
          ```

    - u/kaukamieli:
      ```
      >they can forgo the passives...

      Can they? This is a rare thing they are doing. If this operation fails, they have fucked themselves over completely.
      ```

      - u/Slyvena:
        ```
        That will be the main challenge. Convincing people this is worth the risk.
        Won't be as big of a deal once they have a few Aura Dynamo's up and running, that way people aren't screwed even if Rain dies, so people will be more trusting. Once they've had some early success, the momentum will be there. Though not without its share of challenges, public confidence is the only obstacle remaining (and not letting major powers figure out how much of a sleeping game changer there is waking up in his little group)
        ```
