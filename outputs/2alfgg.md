  ...yup.  The Landguards have a strong enough moral code to kill their friends, if needed.

    Bingo.
    ```

- u/MadScientist14159:
  ```
  So paladins are immune to diplomacy checks?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Nope.  But 'Helpful' doesn't mean 'Stupid' or 'Slave.'

  Reference to the V Vs Epic Dragon scene of OOTS?

  Awesome as that scene was, this suggests extremely worrying things are about to happen. Afi knows where they are, has access to functionally limitless resources and presumably has more of a plan that to waltz in and kill/kidnap/subvert their leadership.

  Incidentally, why haven't the lich kings ever invaded Flobovia or places on that continent? And since they do not appear to have done so, why not move Grofhamr there?

    >Reference to the V Vs Epic Dragon scene of OOTS?

    Yep.  :)  That scene was half written before I realized that Rich had beaten me to it.  I decided to keep it as it was; V/Dragon is so epic that I thought the nod wouldn't go amiss.  

    And yes, things are about to get very hairy for our heroes.


    Arannias (the continent where Flobovia resides) is not known in the Union.  The Grǫfhamrites were motivated to do research looking for a safe haven, and they found a passing reference deep in one of their archives to Arannias.  Afi and the other Lich Kings have not found out about it...yet.

  ...I really thought he would be harder to kill. He's going to keep coming back until they listen or something, right?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Yep.  When a lich's body is destroyed, he regenerates from his phylactery.  It takes a few days, though.
    ```

  I'm a little sad how short that encounter was.

  I was really hoping for a great "No mister bond, I expect you to dine" scene.

  With the obviously fake Afi, an antimagic field, and Grǫfhamr sealed, there was the chance there for some real communication.

  From what little we've seen, Afi seems like a pretty swell guy, and a potential dark rationalist to rival MOR!Quirrel.

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Thomas is a *seriously* badass warrior.  Without his magic, Afi is nothing.  There was no way that fight was going to take more than a couple of rounds.

    As to the rest of it...well, more will come out in the next few chapters.
    ```

    - u/Prezombie:
      ```
      Yeah, I totally get that. My complaint wasn't that the fight was short and offscreen (look at River Tam's example in Serenity), but the fact that the fight started so soon.
      ```

- u/Riddle-Tom_Riddle:
  ```
  ...Huh.

  I thought they would act against him after(if) he *requested* something against the land, people, or ruler.
  ```
