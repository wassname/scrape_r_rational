  Here's an after action report on it from my perspective as the author:

  This was the first time I'd done anything like this, and it was surprisingly intense.  There was a sense of urgency that is missing from normal writing.  I was mentally exhausted when the two hours ended, although I didn't realize it had ended until the buzzer rang.

  It was also a lesson in quality awareness; I didn't have time to choose the right word or polish things, or even to fix typos.  (I did anyway, because it was almost physically painful not to.)

  Flow was very easy; I wasn't reaching for words or having trouble thinking what should happen next.  There were a couple of scenes that ended up much shorter than I thought they should be; I think I spent too much time fixing typos or improving words.  There was one scene that I didn't finish in the allotted 5 minutes, so I cheated by using the 10 minutes that should have been the voting period.

  Speaking of shorter than expected, I was surprised at the variance in how much I was able to produce.  Here are the approximate word counts for the 8 "chapters" that were released:

  * l1.html:      141
  * l2.html:      242
  * l3.html:      243
  * l4.html:      370
  * l5.html:      188
  * l6.html:      224
  * l7.html:      447 (*) This is the one that I took extra time on.
  * l8.html:      187

  Keeping details straight was difficult.  In the heat of the moment I didn't think of the fact that the Elves don't speak English, so now apparently their Lord has translation magic.  I also wasn't sure if I'd kept the death count correct; turns out I did, but that was more luck than anything else.

  I'm pleased at the quality of the writing that came out; it's not as good as what I normally produce, but there's a lot worse out there.

  All in all this was a very positive experience, and I would do it again if people were interested.  I asked the players what they thought about it; the responses were [generally positive.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5609535/)

  Eaglejarl plans to spend the whole day doing updates to this quest every 15 minutes in an effort to improve his speed writing skills.

    For values of "whole day" that sound more like "2 hours from 10am to 12pm Pacific time".  :>
