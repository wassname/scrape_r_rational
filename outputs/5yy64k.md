## [META] What to do about the weekly threads?

### Post:

I have been posting the Sunday Writing Skills Thread since the beginning of January, and after 2 1/2 months of the posting, I wanted to get the subreddit's opinion on what should happen to the thread:

* Automoderator takes over in posting it

* Drop the thread entirely

* I keep posting it and we will decide at a later date what to do with it

* Merge it with the Wednesday World Building Thread

* Write-In Other Options

  * Decrease the frequency to a bimonthly or monthly thread

  * Leave it in, but add two more weekly threads so we have something going every single day

Also, if you think any other weekly threads needs to be modified or dropped, now is the time to air out your concerns.

  I feel like there's not enough content of that type each week for a whole thread based around it, but I'd rather keep it separate from worldbuilding. Could it maybe become a twice-monthly or monthly thread instead?
  ```

    I, too, would rather keep it separate from Wednesday Worldbuilding.

    I think twice a month would be a great compromise for it. I've been using the thread, but I have to admit that half of the time I'm posting in it for the sake of posting in it, since I want to support the thread's existence. But the other half of the time I actually do have an important question I'd like other peoples' comments on. So I think bimonthly would be a great compromise (better than monthly IMO).

  We currently have five different weekly threads running. Maybe it's time we cut back?

  I'm all for the merge with the Wednesday thread option.
  ```

    ```
    Alternatively, add 2 more to round out the number
    ```

  ```
  I vote for making it monthly, and additionally suggest that the focus of the thread be pivoted away from rationality and towards the act of writing itself.
  ```

  Personally I don't know if writing skills works as a weekly thread. The others are sort of rational-fic-adjacent and a place to funnel various mostly-off-topic posts. "Writing skills" doesn't seem to fit the pattern of "rationality topics", "rational world building", "miscellaneous", "munchkin". I would just as soon eliminate it altogether. 

  As a tangent, I'm also not a huge fan of the munchkin thread being on Saturday. It has much the same utility as the Wednesday thread ("here's an idea, now tell me how it works/doesn't work"), and it cuts the off topic thread short from its pinned position. It only makes sense to me to have a place for idle chatter that's in place over much of the weekend, instead of just Friday. Moving Saturday Munchkin to Sunday is something I would propose (and was about to, before that slot was taken by this new thread). 

  (Full disclosure, I *do* use that thread every week to announce/discuss progress on my game project, so I'm obviously biased in this regard.)

    Surely a pure fiction-writing thread is just as relevant as a pure rationality thread?
    ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  (Unrelated: Anyone know where the Saturday Munchkinry Thread went? I can still find it via my comment history, but not in the /r/rational list.)
  ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    Maybe you accidentally pressed the `hide` button on that submission, or changed your Reddit preferences to automatically hide all submissions that you've already upvoted.
    ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    I can see the thread just fine as the 5th thread from the top of /r/rational. So I'm not sure what's going on, but so far it seems local to you.
    ```

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  I honestly don't mind the weekly threads even if they don't get much discussion. Perhaps ones that drop to <5 comments can be reconsidered, but the monday / wednesday / friday threads work pretty well IMO
  ```
