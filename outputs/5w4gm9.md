## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Inversion of The Gamer:

  You are an RPG hero character. "Normal" life for you consists of grinding for skills and stats, killing monsters for XP, magic, and munchkinry in general. You expect to save the world. Suddenly, you are transported to a mundane 'real world' setting. Instead of bright blue status windows and time stopping menus, you have a mental skill for imagining such windows.

  Your new identity is that of a weakling kid who spends most of their time gaming. You can't be sure the stats you see in your mind's eye are even real, since they seem to fluctuate based on hidden variables. Combat no longer yields (much) experience, and there doesn't seem to be such thing as magic any more. You no longer automatically know if people like you or not, even though the reputation system here seems to be more important than ever. Also, you have hardly any willpower, no college level skills, and barely enough knowledge to pass high school.

  What do you do?

    Become a professional gamer, which I would probably have a knack for (and if I'm streaming or something, then I might imbue a bit of personality in my videos by adopting a persona as a displaced RPG hero character who has strong opinions about these others RPGs that he's playing and relevant anecdotes to tell, a combination of Let's Play and serial fiction).

      I so want to watch some improvised comedy where a comedian plays a video game and discusses it as a video game player now...

      This idea is awesome :D

  Don't know if this is munchinry as there are no special powers to exploit as such. You come into existence as the younger clone of someone else. You have their memories, but you also have a lot of talents they didn't have, such as singing, art, speaking Portugese and general athletic prowess. You are healthy and attractive and apparently around 20 years old. But. You have no money, no ID or legal existence and no way for now to contact the original you're based on. As far as you know no-one else has been cloned like you but you could easily be wrong. How do you go about making money, creating a life and ultimately finding your originator?

    > You come into existence as the younger clone of someone else.

    How do we know this, as opposed to thinking we teleported, were made younger and implanted with additional skills?

    How did the scenario start out - a bang of displaced air, a sphere of deleted matter like in Terminator, waking up in our bed? Are we clothed? Are we within a day's travel of our home?

    Depending on local customs, visit a library or other place with public internet. We could send ourselves an email (how exactly would we be unable to contact someone whose entire memories we know?), but we should check whether time has passed, and whether our memories say we'd cooperate with ourselves.

    Any technology that can do this at nonastronomical cost is [a gamechanger and an express route to Singularity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=366414&type=card). Our independent existence indicates an accident, a moron or magic.

      You come into existence with the memory of your original really wishing they could be someone like you, so you assume magic rather than scientific cloning. Because you have been imagined into existence with extra skills (all the stuff your original wishes they had basically) you are quite a different person to them. You are clothed, sitting on a bench on a street, with a notebook and pen and the beginnings of a sketch of the building opposite. You tried to check into your email but the original gets an alert and changed the password. You mail them but get no response. They have been scammed in the past and will be very inclined to dismiss contact as a prank or a scam. No significant time has passed since the wish, but you and the original are in different cities.

  Can you think of any ways to beat a character (hereafter known as the "Player") who uses "Save" mechanics from video games, with you yourself having specific powers and limitations? To be specific:

  - At specific locations in space ("Save points") this character can "save their game".

  - When the "game" is "saved", the state of the universe at that time is recorded. The player can then go back to this point at any time, or automatically if they die.

  - Only one save can exist at a given time; if they save again they overwrite it.

  - At any time they can also "reset", going back to a very early point, the point at which they entered the area in which this conflict takes place (more on that later).

  The player also gains EXP from killing and gets stronger as such, but this is no longer relevant at the time of this challenge as they have killed everyone they can but you.

  The player, you, and everyone you know are trapped in an enclosed area underground which you cannot escape. This area is about the size of a large modern city. The player is an omnicidal maniac, and has killed everyone in this (normally overpopulated) area except you and a few people who managed to evacuate to safety.

  If you allow the player to get beyond a certain point, a hallway before a throne room, they will destroy the world entirely, forever unless they choose to bring it back.

  You yourself have a few powers and limitations to munchkin. To be specific:

  - You can teleport anywhere within the area of conflict at any time. You need to walk (or run) a small distance to do so, so doing so uses some energy.
  - You have extremely competent combat abilities, normally completely overpowering the player. But they have as many tries as they want to get it right. Your specific combat abilities include gravity manipulation, projectiles (made of calcium, of any proportion) which can fly through the air and or emerge out of any surface, and huge floating blasters (These do not produce heat or thrust, and are only capable of hurting people). But you are not capable, for some reason, of any attack which is physically impossible to dodge unless the player first agrees to stop fighting.
  - You always know how many times you have killed the player.
  - You will die instantly from any hit that successfully lands, though you can dodge them using teleportation or ordinary means. You are susceptible to exhaustion, though your physical state (and with a few exceptions, like the number of times you've killed the player, your mental state) is loaded along with the state of the rest of the universe. This includes how exhausted you are.

  This is a pretty tough power to stop. Any ideas?

  This is obvious to anyone who's played the game, but this scenario comes from a popular video game. I don't want to say the title of the video game outright, because this post contained massive spoilers for the game. If you don't know the game and don't care about spoilers, put "Haqregnyr" through rot13.

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    So the general idea is to get the player to "save" in some position where they die pretty much immediately after no matter what they do, so they get frustrated and reset. Then you immediately gank them every time they try to increase their power, forcing them to reset constantly.

    If their value system is even somewhat malleable, the negative reinforcement should eventually change their personality in ways that you can use.

    In game terms, you're basically making the game too unfun to play in any mode except "pascifist."

      Force reset once to save all the player's victims, then medically induced coma and as close to cryogenic suspension as is possible.
      ```

    If I have the ability to do fast computations in my head then I can just apply a pseudorandom function to the complete description of my opponent's actions so far and make it essentially impossible for my opponent to make useful their memories of previous iterations. That sentence was confusing so here's a sort of example / timeline:

    1. Player loads save, attempts to fight me.
    2. I fight them using strategy 54-b because my PRF told me so.
    3. Player reloads save, attempts to fight me.
    4. I fight them using strategy 93-m because my PRF told me so.

    I decide how I fight in a chaotic way that is determined by the actions of Player but in a way that every tiniest muscle twitch can completely change my behavior, so they can't just reload after losing and use their memories of what I did last time. This negates the advantage of experience Player has after resetting: they can never get back to a situation where that knowledge is useful.
