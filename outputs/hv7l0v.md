  I really like the gimmick of not showing us the questions.  Gives each paragraph extra \*punch\* as you work out what you think it is answering.
  ```

- u/Makin-:

  Ending ruins it, in my opinion. >!MAYBE it could have worked if it didn't come up out of the blue and there were clues throughout, but the "satanic" AI thing is really goofy by itself, and even if you take it as a meta strategy I'm not sure it enhances the story at all.!<

    I viewed that whole section as reflecting boomer Facebook memes. Level 1 -> AI is actually the devil. Level 2 -> goofy conspiracy theory. Level 3 -> AI presents a conspiracy about itself in such a way to serve its own unknowable ends. Are those ends religious strife, or it’s own survival? Or we take it at its word, and there is no intent, and the violence it commits is just an inevitable process for the kind of mind we seek to build?

    I love the idea of an AI signal-boosting ‘Christians are immune to AI devilry’ as a way to facilitate its manipulation of both the religious (‘we’re safe!’) and the secular (‘that’s what bible nuts think’).

  >!The blue text doesn't track at all to me.!<

  >!Like, the bot seemed absolutely coherent to me. It alluded to many historical figures in ways that made sense and there weren't random meaningless sentences.!<

  >!It does take a jump from "how could I kill someone without arms? I don't have arms rofl" to "btw have you ever heard of this conspiracy theory where chatbots convince people to kill themselves?"!<

  >!Incidentally, all of this author's stories apparently end the same way, so if you've read one you've read them all.!<
  ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    The author seems to believe that cryptic language is an adequate substitute for good writing.
    ```
