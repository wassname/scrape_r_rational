  that was... slightly disappointing. I guess even from his early years, the Pilgrim had the "my way or the highway" attitude.

  It's interesting that the Ophanim support him with this way though. A lot of the things he does will have far reaching consequences on people who don't know better, so what does "mercy" constitute of anyway?

    Is it possible for you to consolidate double chapters like this into one thread like the WTC chapters?

  The Grey Pilgrim continues to be cemented as an unlikable piece of shit. At least in my opinion.
