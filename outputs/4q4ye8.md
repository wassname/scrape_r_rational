**Synopsis**

*What if you really were transported to a fantasy world and expected to kill monsters to survive?*

*No special abilities, no OP weapons, no status screen to boost your stats. Never mind finding the dragon’s treasure or defeating the Demon Lord, you only need to worry about one thing—how to stay alive.*

*All the people summoned form parties and set off on their adventures, leaving behind the people who nobody wants in their group.*

*Story of my life, thinks Colin.*

&nbsp;
***
*Genre: Fantasy, Summoned, Comedy, Adventure, Romance, Slice of Life, non-OP*

Not strictly speaking rational (although I do try to try to keep things within the realm of plausibility) but since the story received so much interest from this sub I thought i'd just do a post letting you know I've started posting chapters again.

### Comments:

- u/VanPeer:
  ```
  I'm a huge fan of this story, and you introduced the Lord Admin very effectively. But something about the interaction in this chapter seems off. Colin is too flippant in his responses, considering Lord Admin's dreaded reputation. Seems a little unrealistic.
