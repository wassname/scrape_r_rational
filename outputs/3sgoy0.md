    Exactly. The gameplay mechanics seem really bare-bones (and probably not very well thought-out - at least that's my prior for tacked-on amateur game design, having seen a lot of it). So what you're left with is lots of experimental psychology trivia. And while I really like experimental psychology trivia, there are better mediums for sharing it than a card game.

    When I look at the trivia games that I play, most of them have somewhere in the hundreds of questions. Trivial Pursuit has something like 6,000, Wits & Wager has 900 ... this game has 75. The game is won when you have an answer card from all 5 categories or when you have 10 in total. So assuming that on your first playthrough you have 4 players, perfect play means that you could still go through half the deck (40 cards) and imperfect play means you'll go through more.

    So yeah. Definitely an interesting idea, but there's not enough trivia to sustain it because you'll very quickly know all the answers.

    "Children of late parents will be ineligible for next day's services."

    That should reduce it by about 50%.

    "Children will be released onto the street at 3:00 pm"

    ```
    "Children of late parents will be fined an amount sufficient to pay the overtime of our employees enough that they"re indifferent about it."

    (Oh sorry, you said psychology, not economics.)

  In my professional experience, games devoted to teaching people something are usually terrible, and I never back anything on KS, but I figured this would be of interest.

  I agree that it's irrational to produce a card game with no replay value.

    Well I don't know about that: he's up some fraction of 166,000$ with 7 days left on the clock.

      Don't support it (not that you were going to). Merely appreciate the display.

  i am unsure whether i should be disappointed or proud that i also noticed the lack of replayability like everyone else in this thread

  Maybe I should have read these comments before I backed it. :)
