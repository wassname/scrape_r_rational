  "it's a miracle you got this far with such an awful work ethic" I died at this line. He is pretty much defined by his work ethic, he has 6 versions of himself working on 5 different things at the same time. Also silverlake is actually a super mage, what a surprise. This chapter is actually incredibly significant, silverlake is leagues above basically every other mage they have encountered and having her is a teacher is great. Also did he mention kael this loop?

    Silverlake x Quatach-Ichl OTP.

    I mean, think about it. They're both incredibly powerful ancient mages, with some sort of immortality acquired. Silverlake, with her personality, line of work, and [moving house](https://i.imgur.com/9XORnAN.jpg), is clearly [Baba Yaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Yaga) from Slavic folklore. Quatach-Ichl, similarly, is a lich with a crown in a position of authority â€” obviously [Koschei the Deathless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koschei) expy. They both caused Z^Z much pain, and...

    Come on, so many connections already! It's grounds for shipping.

      I don't think a Lich has much to gain from a relationship, or any real desire. Friends? Sure. 

      But uh, he's missing certain parts that would make a relationship work, and Silverlake has been hiding in a pocket dimension, deep in the woods for centuries, only visiting other witches like Kael's mother in law.

        That's a pretty flawed argument considering many old people marry very late into their lives and never have sex for their marriage.

          > never have sex for their marriage.

          Uh, I hate to break this to you, but old people have a LOT of sex. Your not wanting to think about it doesn't make it true. [STD](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derrick-y-mcdaniel/sex-and-seniors-stds-a-ne_b_9619778.html) rates for the elderly (especially in retirement homes) are pretty damn high.

          There are romantic relationships without sex, sure, but I don't see Silverlake or Quatach wanting one. And most of those relationships still have cuddling, kissing, etc, which a lich just can't do.

          She's a hermit in the middle of the forest, in a pocket plane *by choice.* He's an animated pile of bones high up in his country's ruling class.

          If they wanted a relationship, they'd have one.

        That being said, "we both are immortal" isn't a very good foundation for a romantic relationship. Basically all it means is that they have no other options. No one else is in their league, and everyone else will die anyway. Mere longevity isn't enough for romantic compatiblity, but in this case it rules out all the other options. Kinda sad actually.

          I think I disagree on that one. 

          First of all it immortality separates them from nearly everyone else and allows a mindset of "we against the rest of the world". 

          The next thing is that in order to acquire immortality one needs to have a specific type of personality, because one needs to be dedicated enough to reach this goal in one lifetime. 

          Although ZxZ have the first property and I can imagine Zorian without the time loop could have reached immortality Zach does not have the right personality for it.

              Unfortunately, my favourite Russian books are untranslated :(

              Well, except "The Last Ringbearer", which is very good, but I heard some unfavorable things about translation quality. I actually [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5knejl/rtffc_the_last_ringbearer_1999/) it on this sub.

                Thanks for posting it!  I just finished reading through it in English, and that post is how I discovered it.  /u/jaghataikhan, if you check it out, make sure to get the second translation; it's what I read, and various sources say it's a large improvement over the first.

                I had a few minor issues with the text that I presume were translational.  It was odd, for instance, to see Elvish "runes" (as opposed to "script" or "letters", or just "Tengwar") mentioned by someone with enough Tolkien lore to mention specific Valar by name.  Overall, I found it to be quite readable.  I will note though, that it felt very Russian, from the implied worldview all the way down through minor turns of phrase.  I'm glad the translator preserved the story's Russian character, but it has a different flow than natively-written English work that I guess could be disorienting.

                I quite liked it in the beginning, but like the commenter on the other thread, I found it much less interesting once it became a spy thriller.  I enjoy spy thrillers in general; I think the issue here was partly that I wasn't expecting it, and partly that the spy thriller aspect depended on a lot of very minor details happening very far from the main plot.  Agents and agencies are hard for me to keep straight when the geopolitical context is fantasy and the story I really care about is 3000 miles from the one I'm reading.  Still, I enjoyed it a lot more than I didn't.

                  What's wrong with calling Certhas Daeron "runes"? XD

                  I mean, I also can name every Valar by name (and hey, look at my nickname), but I also always called Elven letters "runes". Perhaps it's a thing in the Russian translation of Tolkien.

                    > Certhas Daeron

                    I don't remember exactly, but it was in a context that I was reasonably sure it referred to Tengwar.  (Maybe it was a note written on paper.)  I'd forgotten about the Cirth at the time, though, so I suppose it might actually have meant those.  Whoops!

                    It might be just a translation thing.  Or I might be objecting over nothing.  It's a somewhat pedantic distinction that only a language nerd would care about, but we all know Tolkien was the biggest of those.

                    As a native English speaker, and a language nerd, I understand "rune" primarily to mean a symbol that looks like it's from the [Futhark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark), and was probably invented to be carved with a chisel, not written with a pen.  Their shape reflects this: Straight lines, sharp angles, few strokes.  In Middle-Earth, that would include the Cirth and all later modifications like the Angerthas, but not the Tengwar.  As far as I know, this is always what Tolkien meant by "rune".

                    "Rune" also has a common secondary sense, where it refers to any symbol that has an obscure meaning or is hard to identify, especially if it is associated with magic.  This would include the Tengwar for most readers, though it wouldn't for the characters--the Tengwar are just ordinary letters for them.  There's also a third, least common sense where "rune" can just mean any letter or symbol.

                    Of course, maybe the letters in question actually were [Tengwar runes](http://www.dafont.com/tengwar-noldor.font).

    Correction: 7 versions of himself, working on 6 things concurrently. Zorian himself was only taking a brief break before going back to work.

    And yeah, I hope that they manage to get that agelessness potion recipe. Could be both incredibly useful in general if the ingredients aren't too rare/costly, and would be a *fantastic* bargaining chip for old mages.

      - u/sicutumbo:

        A potion recipe being extremely rare or difficult to make doesn't necessarily impact the cost or rarity of its base components. For a corollary, a professional chef can make fantastic meals out of simple ingredients, and many people would pay quite a bit for said food even if the simple cost of materials is very low.

    > the proletariat overthrows the bourgeoisie

    It's not just a joke, either; it's a real danger.

    Still, I'm not sure what the simulacra would demand. If Zorian *had* a way to give them continuity across loops, he'd do it; it would save him a lot of time and expensive materials rebuilding their golem bodies.

    They already get to package up whatever memories are most important to them and merge them back into the original. Zorian could maybe use Black Room time to integrate a bit *more*, but ultimately he won't be able to completely integrate them all. So there's room for some negotiation there, perhaps, if it's important to them, but not cause for a rebellion.

    They can already influence research priorities to do things like making better golems for themselves.

    Maybe there could be a conflict if simulacra demand the ability to overwrite (and thus effectively possess) living hosts, the original refuses, and they go to war to modify him so he'll let them? They would have to diverge significantly from his morals for that to arise, though, and they only get a month to do it - less, if the initial golem-crafting takes a while.

  >He was a brand new type of simulacrum that the original had thought up recently â€“ instead of being embodied into an ectoplasmic shell like a regular simulacrum, he had been attached to a real matter golem body designed to mimic the original. This was a step up from the base spell in just about every regard, granting him vastly increased durability and halving his maintenance cost at the same time.

  I haven't read anything else in this update yet, but I need to comment on this before continuing. Remember when Zorian was told that the Simulcrum spell is step 1 in becoming a lich? Attaching part of your soul to a physical object after you've separated it out from your mortal body really, really sounds like step 2. 

  I've had my suspicions about that particular plotbunny since it first showed up, and I still think it's going to be part of the solution to how Zorian will smuggle his soul out of the simulation, so it's interesting to see that thread progressed a bit right at the start of the chapter.

  Further comments after actually reading the thing:

  >"You're trying to stave off death from old age?" Zach asked, surprised. "Wow. That's an incredibly advanced skill. I heard from Zorian you were a master alchemist, but I didn't know you were that good."

  >"Silly boy," Silverlake chuckled. "I'm not trying to stave off old age. I already have that."

  Kinda figured she'd be older than naturally possible. But I will also point out that this means the odds of Zorian ever growing old are basically zero if he gets out of this mess intact. I figured he'd be set anyway, because I'm still betting on the lich thing, but now that he actually knows and has contact with someone who has already solved the problem with alchemy, it makes a nice backup plan.

  >As for the contents of the inner layer, it consisted of three things: a nice, luxurious two-story house, an expansive herb garden full of rare magical plants and a heavily warded alchemical workshop where she did most of her work.

  >Yes, a powerful witch that was clearly very proud of her traditions and made distinctions between alchemy and 'potion making' had a fully quipped alchemical workshop that would be familiar to any conventional alchemist out in the major cities. Zorian couldn't help but find that a little amusing.

  I would pretend to be surprised, but I have met at least one amish person and/or native american before. The myth of the noble savage is a great way to con people, but it turns out most people are people with the same wants and needs as other people, and are perfectly happy to take advantage of ways to fulfill those needs easily. Guess we'll have to just be glad she doesn't have a casino in there.

  >"Hmph. Shows what you know," Silverlake said. "I'm doing it this way because this is the superior option. It's good enough for the job. Doing this with a complicated alchemical setup wouldn't get stuff done any faster or give better results â€“ it would just inflict wear and tear on delicate equipment and be a nightmare to clean up afterwards."

  As an addendum to my earlier comment, while most people are just normal people, other people are *wise* people, and these rare treasures tend to notice that even obsolete techniques occasionally do have advantages and that there are no time cops running around forcing you to choose between only traditional methods or only new technology.

  Which is a shame, because it forces me to admit that maybe she wasn't just fucking with Zorian last time.

  >"It's because alchemy, in its current form, requires an entire society built to enable it. Somebody has to build all the vials, containers, heaters, and other equipment. Somebody needs to grow, gather and track down the ingredients used in it. Somebody needs to transport and distribute it to those than need itâ€¦ or have the right connections to use it. Somebody needs to guard the workshops full of valuable equipment from thieves and various miscreants. The old witches had access to none of that, so they had to make do with chucking things into a big iron cauldron and eyeballing things. It is, as you said, cheaper. Cheaper in terms of money and also cheaper in terms of social infrastructure needed to support it."

  I'm sensing a pattern. Much the same could apply to magic in general. The whole idea of the Empire having risen to prominence principally because of an ordered and systematic approach to incorporating and disseminating all the magical lore that could be found hidden in a thousand tiny societies and forging it into an unstoppable force. No small tribal community could replicate that. You need an education system to spread literacy, you need a large and thriving empire to collect information from all over, both internally and by theft or trade from elsewhere.

  It sounds like it indicates a general pattern of civilization growing and thriving through cooperation, but in light of the rest of her speech, it could also foreshadow the opposite. After all, if some disaster were to strike which sabotaged the nation's infrastructure, say by blowing up a city, alchemy would be driven out and the surviving alchemists would be forced to revert to potion-making. I wonder if something similar would happen to mages in general without access to advanced spells and knowledge of the kind stored in the Academy Library.

    A disaster big enough to destroy infrastructure on that scale would destroy society as a whole. A city isn't thinking big enough.

    Most people would be dead in that case, so who cares to prepare for it? It's like seriously preparing for all-out nuclear war in real life. Yeah, you *can* do that, but if you feasibly prepare enough to matter, you'll bankrupt yourself, have little time to learn skills actually relevant in modern society, and still likely won't survive if disaster strikes.
    ```

    - u/Tommy2255:
      ```
      > A city isn't thinking big enough.

      The disaster this story is about, which is what I was trying to allude to, goes well beyond the destruction of a single city that I used as an example. All-out nuclear war is about the right scale.

      And preparing deliberately for that scenario is not something that I mentioned at all. It wouldn't even make sense for them to try, since the coming disaster is not one that most people are aware of. That doesn't change the fact that people who do develop those skills for other reasons will have an advantage, and those skills will proliferate more readily than more interdependent ones if society does collapse.

      I'm also skeptical of how well your comparison to nuclear war works when we're talking about a pre-industrial civilization. We have cars, planes, telecommunications technology. If civilization survives to any degree anywhere in the world, then the remnants of our organizational infrastructure will be able to access and support any other part of the world in a timely manner. That isn't true here. Aside from a minuscule minority of individuals capable of teleportation, transportation takes place at a walking pace or by train or sailing ship. If there is a collapse of the government, and the accompanying inability to effectively police trade routes to keep them even sort of safe from both criminals and monsters, then isolated provinces staying isolated for years or for generations is a thing that could actually happen. Besides which, this world demonstrably has had more advanced civilizations in the past which have failed.

  You know, while pocket dimension creation will be very useful, perhaps the most important part of this chapter is the confirmation that Zorian can [craft supersonic weaponry and inscribe spells into the ammunition](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/590wr7/mother_of_learning_chapter_60_into_the_abyss/d94yfin/).

  Zorian's going to end up turning himself into a golem based lich in order to escape the time loop.  Zach will either let Zorian "piggy back" his soul for the trip, or only Zorian will make it through.

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```

    ```
    Yeah the golem simulacrums are going to play out in an interesting way for sure. They seem to come out of nowhere and be moving the plot a lot already (and they seem more headstrong?).
    ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      Imagine if your body suddenly became creaky, unresponsive and unreliable. That's essentially what the simulacrum experience when they're created; going from a perfectly normal human to a body that they're fully aware is artificial. Since their entire lives will be spent in these bodies, it makes perfect sense that they'd want them to be improved until they're superior to their old one.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Well, it's probably a useful field of research for Zorian anyway. Better, more responsive golems = good. It's just that the simulacrums *living* in those golems put a higher priority on that direction of research than the original would.

        At least he'll get unbeatably high-quality feedback on each attempted improvement :).
        ```

        - u/-Fender-:
          ```
          Agreed. And in the end, he'll have a squadron of super-robot copies that don't care about cardio or muscle strain to throw at every problem.

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Wait a second.

            Each simulacrum has a running mana cost to maintain its magical brain, plus a cost to maintain its body - negated by putting it in a physical golem form - plus whatever mana it spends on spells.

            But mind magic is really quite cheap. It just takes concentration.

            And a single Zorian has shown the ability to smoothly control a squad of six mindless golems.

            So, the army size is at least 1 original + *n* simulacrum-golem (golacrum?) generals, plus 6 * (*n* + 1) regular-golem infantry, where *n* is the number of simulacra he can maintain. Currently 48 golems plus one human. Probably each Zorian can manage more than six subordinates if the commands are simple.
            ```

            - u/-Fender-:
              ```
              Yep. Zorian will be the founder of the field of magic of golemancy. Especially so once he creates his own mobile pocket dimension in which he'll keep hundreds of golems on standby.

                And then, with soul sight, Zorian will be able to [create a simulacrum of Zach](https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/golems-and-undead/#comment-148).

                Of course, lacking mind magic, Zach should probably go for quality over quantity. He wouldn't be able to achieve the same benefits from a swarm, and splitting his mana reserves so many ways would actually work against him.

                But you *know* he'll want to upload himself to a [giant battle robot](http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Metal_Unit) :).

                ETA Assuming, of course, that he can get past his fear of allowing Zorian to access his mind. Which I presume is necessary to create a simulacrum.

                Not just the founder of a new field, but a new field that takes advantage of his Kekkei Genkei. It's the mind magic that makes it special. If he makes even a token attempt at leveraging his magical power into political power, there's a good chance he'll be the founder of a new noble house, complete with their own secret bloodline nonsense.

              While true, increasing numbers of golems only give any real benefit up to a point. Golems are basically melee fighters and that's it. They're useful for soaking up damage, and overpowering some types of strong magical creatures. They aren't mages, and rarely have any ranged attacks at all. For Zorian, he needs all the mana he can get, and sinking all of it into better golem control is a waste for a mage of his caliber. He is far more adaptable, deadly, and overall efficient using his mana for spells.

              That said, I wonder how well he could cast spells if he had multiple copies of himself to work with? Ritual spells and general group casting are things he has never really focused on, at least partly because he's more concerned with personal power rather than group effectiveness, but he could get really good results if he had multiple mages with extremely good mana shaping skills focused on a single spell. Probably not terribly useful in combat, but an interesting avenue to explore.

                Not the way Zorian fights. Remember how they took on Sudomir's mansion? Dispeller grenades, alchemical and magical explosives, all manner of fun items. Not to mention his new rifle design.

                And a really sturdy mindless golem in a high-mana area could potentially become [a magic cannon](https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/golems-and-undead/#comment-102).

                  Thanks for the link. It seems like they have mostly been used in melee roles aside from the infiltration on Sudomir's mansion. I'm primarily thinking of the various assaults on the Ibasan force below Cyoria.  Maybe it's simply easier to hire mercenaries to throw grenades and fire guns than it is to build a golem accurate enough to trust to do so? Golems are generally noted to be expensive, and I imagine making them with enough dexterity and intelligence to hit a target with a gun is even more so. Although that's still useful if they need to do some covert stuff where hiring mercenaries or any outside parties is inadvisable.

                    Fortunately expense is not a real issue for ZZ :). Yes, mercenaries are much easier and cheaper, and he'll probably still use them, but don't underestimate the knockout punch of nearly 50 soldiers working with perfect synchronisation and no fear.

                    Note that the golacrums could also go kamikaze by drawing on ambient mana without limit. Normally this is just a fancy (but almost unblockable) way to commit suicide, as the foreign energy rapidly destroys your vital organs, but with a durable golem body, they could probably accumulate rather spectacular amounts of energy before they finally break down.

                    Hey, I wonder whether Zorian could design golems that would allow simulacra to swap between them? So if one of the golacrums gets in trouble, it can jump to another body.

                      I don't think that u/nobody103 has ever mentioned what the effect of simulacrum using ambient mana would be, or why they don't use it more often. Even if they're copies and care about their lives, they should still recognize that they are temporary existences working to achieve a common goal, and that damage to their bodies and the slight mental damage they take would have little to no effect on the original while potentially allowing them to reach certain goals much more optimally.

Their bodies are likely tough enough to take it, but their minds are still vulnerable to poisoning, causing death with severe acute use or insanity with chronic use.

                        Given that all the simulacra are master mind mages, the risk of them going rogue would be unacceptable except in a dire emergency. And given that they inherit Zorian's strong sense of self-preservation, they won't be keen on anything so self-destructive.

                Yes and no. Yes, I'd expect some mana crystals to be present for recharging, but no, a golacrum can't just draw on raw mana (including mana crystals) directly, not without damaging its magical brain. Mindless golems have nothing fragile, so they can get away with it.

    I think there's too much uncertainty in how the time loop treats souls for them to be sure enough that it'll work. I'm betting on them going to the real world by passing through a primordial's prison.

      ```
      Problem is that they would have to open the prison on the inside to get into reality (which is a shitty prison design if you can open it from the inside and they couldn't overpower it if a primordial can't) or wait for the ritual but that means they enter reality at the end of the month and possibly the primordial to still be in it.

    Ha! I think you're right.

    If this were a fanfiction (where things tend to be simpler), Zorian might replace or merge with his original soul, but that's _hard_, especially considering how he isn't even merging with his simulcrum instances. The difference is how the magic in this universe is defined as being really hard. It's one of the reasons why I love this story so much.

    among purposes of guardian of threshold is to prevent souls from escaping the gate. Stand alone soul, even when it is piggybacking, most likely be detected and prohibited from leaving.

    His soul will already escape, just not his memories right? So he only has to escape his memories, and for that he just need to implant  memory packets in Zach.

      There is no reason to think that his soul will escape.  His real body in the real world already has a working soul.  His body and soul were both created by the Soverign Gate and will be destroyed (or maybe sent to the afterlife?) when the Gate runs out of power unless something is done.

  Since the loops coming to a close, I think Zorian's feeling the pressure and doing everything he can to squeeze as much usefulness out of each restart as he can. The improved golems were a good idea but he still may not have taken it far enough yet considering how obscenely valuable they are. Think about it, every restart he'll now be getting like 7 or 8 months worth of activity and work done. The potency of this really can't be understated. The 3ish years left is now essentially worth 21-24 years worth of activity, this is huge. With a SINGLE innovation, he just doubled the time he has available to work with inside the loop, he just bought himself a whole DECADE, another improvement like that and it's 20 extra years worth of activity. I'm not sure Zorian understands just how significant that was since he just mentions it once and blows past it. As we draw closer to the end, further improvements will yield more diminishing returns, he really needs to focus on these golems now as a priority, the gains are monumental. 

  Also his research with those hired warders, diviners, alchemists, golem makers and the rest is making him an expert in half a dozen magical fields. And if he's integrating the memories of all the simulcra, it means it's not just magical expertise he's getting, it's general knowledge, experience and wisdom, with all the experts he's constantly interacting with, I expect Zorian to be less and less surprised by things and demonstrate a high degree of knowledge about basically everything more and more so from now on.

        All the more reason to use that time to integrate the memories of what his simulacra were previously doing. Sure, he could also read books, etc, but memory-integration really does seems like a valuable use of time.

        Besides the political advantages of simulacra knowing that they'll be more completely preserved, and the fact that they'll have a harder time pranking him, he might find that increased integration helps him to better absorb skills that have proved hard to transfer, [such as language learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/72/Mother-of-Learning). And he can better monitor & understand divergence, so he (and his copies) will be better prepared to avoid or adapt to it in future generations.

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Hmm. So you think that he connected to the Koth Bakora gate?

        Interesting idea, but a) that would lead to some interesting conversations when Silverlake looked through it and saw what's on the other side, and b) Zorian hasn't been able to reverse-engineer the Bakora gates that thoroughly. As far as we've heard, he hasn't even been able to improve the activation ritual.
        ```

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          The Bakora gates are primarily interesting because they can create stable dimensional portals *without the aid of a mage*. Golems, for example, aren't impressive due to their intelligence, but because they can act intelligently without a human puppetting their every move. So even if Zorian is able to cast the same spell the Bakora gates use, that's still a long way from making that spell into an item.

          Also, it was mentioned last chapter that teleportation magic, and likely dimensionalism as a whole, is notoriously difficult to make into items. The text mentioned that the only teleportation spells that you see in items are only able to either teleport you to a pre-set location, or teleport you between two pads.

            - u/sicutumbo:
              ```
              Oh, sorry if that wasn't clear. I'm saying he doesn't need to reverse engineer a Bakora gate in order to use the same spell, because making the item is much harder than simply casting the spell.
              ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Remember Zorian teaches the Dimensional Gate spell to Damien because he couldn't always send a Simulacrum to Koth in time. He hated the idea of depending to Damien so much and that's why he traveled to Koth with Silent Doorway Spiders to get a Key from the Koth Gate, so ultimately he wouldn't need to depend on anybody and could open the gate himself.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            I didn't think that he collected the Bakora Gate key in order to be independent. He did it so that the aranea would be willing and able to help him use their gate.

For Zorian, it was a way to ensuring easy access to Koth without having to rely on Daimen. Plus, he suspected that having this key would make it much,Â muchÂ easier to convince the Silent Doorway Adepts to cooperate with him in future restarts.

              Here Zorian says it himself. 

              Remember Zorian needs to find other keys too and one of them is in Blantyrre. He can reach Blantyrre in One month time but hardly so. He will have one or two day left after reaching Blantyrre and 2 days are not enough to find the key, hence he will search for Bakora Gate instead and acquire the Gate key, so that he can reach there at the start of the Timeloop.

    The position of animals change every restart, based on minute changes. In that one restart, Zorian had fairly heavily influenced the ecosystem by steadily hunting silver wolves and collecting alchemical ingredients throughout the forest. The changes to the flora from his gathering could have changed the locations of any number of small animals who rely on those ingredients, or his mere presence could have chased them away to other areas, and killing the wolves made several other areas safe because of a lack of predators.

    The knowledge of the location of the salamander in that one restart is not reliable information. And besides, we don't have any confirmation that that salamander was the proper size and age; simply that it was desirable enough to Silverlake to have her show herself to a talented baby mage she knew was looking for her. We also know that she is interested in collecting smaller samples as well, after all. But we do know from Zorian's impression of her two samples that the one he previously encountered was a larger specimen.

  I really hope that Zorian begins recording some of the things that he learns, specifically the mind magic stuff. He mentioned a long time ago about wanting to write a book about human mind magic, and considering how far he has advanced it would be a good project for when he has downtime.

  Think about how difficult it was to get an actual education from the aranea. He had to barter for actual years in order to get to the point he is at right now, and their mind magic knowledge is hardly centralized in a single convenient location. Any human mind mage is, right now, almost completely shit out of luck if they don't happen to either make friends with an aranean web, or are born into the right noble house. It's a huge branch of magic that their society just hasn't been able to explore because they can't get off the ground in exploring it.

  Even if Zorian left out the more invasive branches of mind magic, which frankly it doesn't fare well in compared to other schools of magic, it would be incredibly useful. I mean, who wouldn't want to learn how to keep perfect memories, or be able to sense other life forms regardless of invisibility or intervening walls? Combined with those telepathic relays, it's an instant communication vector with near unlimited distance.

  There's also the more mundane things that Zorian has learned that deserve to be recorded. That shielding spell seems super useful if you have the requisite shaping skills. And he's also commissioned various projects in the fields of alchemy and golem making that  would be incredibly costly to develop outside of the time loop. What government wouldn't pay for a flashbang grenade that briefly incapacitates Grey Hunters? Not everyone is concerned with keeping parts of it intact.

    >I really hope that Zorian begins recording some of the things that he learns, specifically the mind magic stuff. He mentioned a long time ago about wanting to write a book about human mind magic, and considering how far he has advanced it would be a good project for when he has downtime.

    Personally I would try to avoid spending time on anything that wasn't skill advancing until: 1. you have all keys and have successfully left the time loop. 2. you've achieved *at least* a potion of non-aging like Silverlake if not also the potion of eternal youth. 

    Once those two things are done you have all the time in the world to achieve whatever goals make you happy, but anything before that is potentially a waste of your chance to ever get them.

    I disagree. The main reason why human mind magic is in such sad state is not lack of information, but heavy restriction on the mind magic.

    That's why Zorian book about mind magic wouldn't change all that much - because all copies of it would be locked in some goverment facility.

    - u/Banarok:

      depending on how he writes it it could get heavily restricted, but the government would probably hunt empaths for spies after he wrote it giving them ample employment opportunities.

        >the government would probably hunt empaths for spies giving them ample employment opportunities.

        I think you are overly optimistic - as an example CIA case officers admission requirements are pretty high. So I doubt that many of empaths could make a cut. And what do think would be done to those who don't?


        But that's not even main issue with mind magic. The main issue with it is that the more people know and use it the less useful it becomes. If you alone in the world capable of mind magic - you are golden. If 1% people  capable of using mind magic and 5% people can defend against it, its pretty useful. If 10% capable of it and 50% can defend against it, then it almost useless.


        That's why I believe that there is no good way to make mind magic more widespread - the more people know about it, the less useful it becomes, the less people make effort to learn it.

  Zorian is also getting sketchier and sketchier, while his morals are intact the fact that he's getting souls sight in addition to everything else is sending up a huge number of red flags.

  Also: I have a feeling Silverlake might not exactly react well when they confront her with proof of the time loop next reset.  Just because she didn't believe them this time (and thus didn't have the existential crisis) doesn't mean she won't be..... troublesome with her master of soul and mind magics when unhinged.

    > I can't believe I overlooked the giant salamander all this time when looking into Silverlake.

    Well, it makes sense that it's important to the story, but it would also have made sense if it were simply a mundanely valuable ingredient. Remember, the whole area around Silverlake's cottage was "suspiciously picked-clean". She might well have stepped out to retrieve it even if it were for regular potions.

    So don't feel bad about missing it :)

    > the fact that he's getting souls sight in addition to everything else is sending up a huge number of red flags

    Really? I've expected it for ages. It's a perfect complement to his skill set.

    > I have a feeling Silverlake might not exactly react well when they confront her with proof of the time loop

    I have a feeling she can be *fantastically useful* if she believes the loop exists and is motivated to do something about it. She wants out? Great, she can help them retrieve Key pieces! She wants continuity across loops? OK, temporary markers are speculated to be governed by the crown; if she has ideas for taking down QI, they'll be happy to listen.

    Whatever she wants to get from the loop, I'm pretty sure it will align with ZZ's goals and they'll be more than happy to cooperate.

        > If she wants to survive, she might see them as an obstacle

        I don't see that. They already want to find a way for multiple people to exit. If they find it, I expect they'd be happy to share. If they don't find it, or if they can't share - well, she doesn't even have a soul marker, she wouldn't be able to access the Gate. Rather than being an obstacle, they're her best shot.

            She wouldn't be dumb enough to try that without learning everything she could about the marker first. If she tried, she would certainly trip the tampering switch on Zach and the loop would reset - or, if she targeted Zorian first, Zach would be free to pummel her. Assuming that she's even skilled enough in combat to take on both of them at once, so quickly that Zorian couldn't manually reset. And one thing she would quickly learn is that the marker is highly resistant to tampering and copying.

            If there was actually any possibility of her duplicating the marker, her best shot at that would be to have the two of them willingly cooperate and provide her with a template. Which they would almost certainly be happy to do.

            It's like when people talked about the possibility of Zorian attacking Xvim's mind once Xvim started tutoring him properly. It might be theoretically possible to do, but it's vastly less efficient than willing cooperation. And given how much ZZ could benefit from a looping Silverlake, they'd almost certainly cooperate if it were feasible.

            Though I doubt it is.

    I don't think soul sight is a red flag at all, nor is it a *change in morals*. Remember Zorian was asking Kael about how to get soul sight clear back in the beginning. Even Alanic admitted that soul sight itself isn't immoral, and Zorian would be daft not to get it if it's possible to get ethically (as he's doing). Soul sight is only a red flag to people who don't know Zorian's story. It's something that is generally too difficult to be worth the time to get it normally, but for someone in a loop like Zorian it'd be ridiculous NOT to get it.

            There's a difference between soul awareness-gained through long periods of drugs, meditation and/or having your soul ripped out, and literally being able to see how it works with your eyes.

              From what Alanic has told Zorian in the past, I doubt this will help his personal soul sight at all, save by perhaps letting him practice seeing other people's souls.

              His personal soul sight is good enough to discern all the details of the marker, after all.

    I think it's actually pretty important that he's doing it without killing people. Not just for his morals, either.

    There are a number of people who can discern truth from lies. One of those happens to be a priestess of the church most opposed to necromancy.

    If Zorian can *honestly* say he got his without killing anyone, he'll be a lot more likely to get their help.
    ```

    - u/spanj:
      ```
      Alanic mentioned truth discernment involves watching for perturbations of the soul. People who have partial control of this can spoof telling the truth, which is why Alanic opted for asking Zach instead of Zorian due to Zorian's ability for soulself-reflection. 

      If you have soul sight, regardless if it is innate or acquired via dubious/innocuous means, I think it is safe to assume you can trick the priestess.

"Youth" is a relative term, after all; I can easily see "endless youth" simply meaning "you don't change as you get older".

    Considering it brings you to the brink of death...probably. He can't actually die without a reset, but he can probably get away with near-death.

    Whether he'll want it - harder to say. It would help speed up his soul awareness, certainly, since he can't take Alanic's accelerated training option, and thus it would make him much more effective against QI. But he might be more persuaded by Alanic's warnings about the moral hazards.

        There's more to consider than just that; if the soul really is duplicated by the process, then what happens with the marker? Two copies? Or a brand new, unmarked soul arrives from wherever new souls usually come from? Or the (already-damaged) marker tries to split/copy itself and breaks down?

        Lots of unknowns. Observing the salamander with soul sight should be very instructive, though.

          Souls record every experience the body has since its birth.  Souls cannot be destroyed.  This leaves us with 3 potential options:

          If one of the bodies has the original salamander's soul, this would mean the other salamander would be considered a newborn by anyone reading its soul.

          If splitting the body means that the original is dead, then both bodies would get new souls & the original soul will pass on.

          If splitting a soul is possible, then both bodies get half of the original soul along with the soul record of the original salamander's experiences.  Considering it is possible to splice souls together to make shifters, this seems the most likely option.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            It seems rather odd to suppose that a soul could be split in half - which sounds rather destructive - merely by inflicting damage on the physical body. It would also seem odd for the original soul to move on when the body never actually died.

          Well, Silverlake said that two living salamanders can grow from the one, so there has to be a second soul coming from *somewhere*...

            - u/thrawnca:

              1: Magical creatures pretty much have to have souls to shape mana.

              2: Not impossible, I suppose, but it seems odd for regeneration to construct a link to a remote soul. Would have big implications for people using salamander potions.

    In their defence, they know and can observe that everyone has an immortal soul. It's understandable that avoiding death, while still generally seen as desirable, becomes less imperative.
    ```

    - u/eroticas:
      ```
      They observe a thing, which they call a soul, which *isn't the same as the mind* apparently, and which is clearly vulnerable to the whims of not-always-benevolent gods, I really dunno about this. The only thing we *really* know about souls is that they are what generates mana, including a life force necessary to sustain a physical body, and that souls are only fully compatible to the bodies they grew up in. There haven't been any clear indications that there's consciousness there. It's possible that souls contain a "backup copy" of consciousness but we don't *know* that.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        We also know that souls appear to be indestructible. Which affects the immortality calculations. And until a few centuries ago, the gods were definitely present. The world is still adapting to their absence.

        It's all very well to say "The gods aren't always benevolent" (although it's a bit arrogant to suppose that we're smart enough and experienced enough to be reliable judges of that), but the fact remains, trying to resist their plans or fight against them would seem futile and foolish to most ordinary citizens.
        ```

        - u/eroticas:
          ```
          My experience with agents is that they're not always benevolent, I think it would be a bit presumptuous to assume they were!
          ```

  - u/Cheese_Ninja:
    ```
    To be fair, immortality and beyond that eternal youthfulness seems like it requires immense resources and skills. Silverlake isn't exactly a slouch, and she has only achieved the first part of that over more than a hundred years.

    It's possible that the reagents are nigh-unique, and that there's a degree of luck involved in the alchemy. I doubt that every one of the Immortal Eleven achieved their immortality through the exact same method.
    ```

    - u/eroticas:
      ```
      That's entirely because their civilization sucks. They carefully hoard their secrets such that each mage has to do our equivalent of science from *scratch*. They don't *want* to distribute skills and resources and power. It's vastly inefficient. I think it would be a stretch to imagine a scenario where a well put together society *couldn't* mass produce immortality, if all it takes is a spider, a big salamander, and the skillset of a lone old witch.

  Pretty good chapter! I see that Silverlake is actually yet another potential romance-able waifu path!

  Some errors I found.

  Their skills have grown, they have become intimately familiar with the grey hunter's capabilities and they have brought a number of surprises designed specifically to counter it.

  All of those "have"s should be "had", because it should be past tense.

  it shook of the stun effectÂ 

  Missing an f there.

  The bullets were filled the distilled essence

  Missing a "with"

  before they can track down its corpse

  "can" should be "could" because past tense

  Then again, the grey hunter did mangle one of the simulacrums

  "did mangle" should be "had mangled"; tense inconsistency

  sought out to original

  "to" should be "the"

  He was the one that shot the grey hunter!

  "shot" should be "had shot"

  Well, he and number three, but number three ended up being killed by the grey hunter's last hurrah.

  "ended" should be "had ended"

  He totally earned this and was not taking no for an answer.

  "totally earned" should be "had totally earned"

  "We have come to trade!" Zach said in an equally cheery tome, undaunted by her wariness.

  "tome" should be "tone"

  Everything you gain will be done at the end of this month,Â 

  I think that "done" should be "undone"?

  "It not possible for me to absorb your pocket dimension creation skills in less than a month.

  "It not" should be "It's not"

  which is why Zorian couldn't find it

  "is" should be "was"; tense inconsistency

  It had been five days since then, and thus far Silverlake was keeping to her side of the deal.Â 

  "was" should be "had been"

  Zorian was afraid

  "was" should be "had been"

  Silverlake did basically rope him into helping her with her alchemy

  "did basically rope" should be "had basically roped"

  Seems to be a lot of tense inconsistencies, with a noticeable lack of past participle usage. Should probably work on that.

        Fair enough. It's not a big deal for me, really.

        Though in all honesty, I get spammed with duplicates anyway. The sheer volume of corrections I get from various channels is useful, but I inevitably get many, many duplicates in the process.
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    A lot of these are duplicates of the ones I reported earlier, or are not mistakes. Eg "Silverlake did basically rope him into" - imagine that "did" is in italics, and the sentence makes sense. Actually, most of the suggested "had"s are not really necessary.

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    He doesn't need to wait 100 years. He knows that there's a giant salamander in the area, he knows it's possible to divide salamanders into two living copies, and he has mind magic that can capture it alive.

    However, this isn't the immortality potion, it's a youthfulness potion. Much less important for a teenager, though it probably has some nice side effects.

    I think that once ZZ have all the parts of the Key, they will be able to edit the program of the loop - including the duration of the loop. And since the loop is limited by mana, and it only uses mana to restart the loop, they could still manage to squeeze a few more decades/centuries out of the remaining restarts.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > once ZZ have all the parts of the Key, they will be able to edit the program of the loop

      Highly unlikely. There is a big difference between having the Key, vs being the Maker. Having the Key allows you to re-open the barred Gate, and apparently outside the loop it allows you to mark the next Controller, but that doesn't mean you're the superuser.
      ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        It gives you a "higher level of access" but we don't know for sure what that entails besides unbarring the gate.

  >"Bah," Silverlake spat. "What's a touchy-feely, squeamish kid like you trying to get soul perception for, then? You'll never achieve anything worth a damn in soul magic with that attitude."

  >**"I may need it to save my life,"** Zorian told her. "It's not something you need to worry about. The question is: can you do it? Can you make me a potion that can grant me soul perception in less than a month's time?"

  Can someone refresh me on a past chapter in which he though soul sight would be nearly essential? Because I only remember him thinking it would be useful, and am wondering if this is a new thing.

  Also, does anyone else think Alanic was either a Necromancer's apprentice or experiment when he was very young? And he either rebelled on his own or that necromancer was destroyed by the Church and the Church adopted and raised him after that?

      The lich tried to fuse his soul with Zach, but that's been checked by alanic and he's fine.  He might need it to escape the loop but we don't know how yet, he hasn't mentioned it before.

          What?  No, he theorized he got the gatekeeper to put his soul back into his real world body, just like the guardian would do for a normal marker.  Once in his original body roommates with his original soul, he kicks the other soul out.  That seems likely to me, but not set in stone.
          ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    I think Alanic was a necromancer or apprentice to one, you don't give soul sight to your test subject.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I don't recall him ever declaring it to be essential. If he had, he probably wouldn't have said "*may* need it". I can easily see it affecting their chances of getting the crown, though. Or revealing more details of their markers. Remember, some of Zorian's marker is dead; he likely could learn a lot by studying Zach's.
    ```

    - u/Cheese_Ninja:
      ```
      Maybe not essential, but it felt to me like he was placing more value in external soul perception this chapter than any time in the past. I'm just wondering if some time in the past 9 restarts they developed a plan or made a discovery that made it more important to spend their finite time and less finite resources on obtaining it. Being able to study Zach's marker sounds like a pretty good possibility. I know you're not a fan of my Zorian soul merging theory, which I think benefit from soul perception as well.

      And it's odd that they're only trying to get a potion for Zorian at the moment, unless they're sure it cause a restart if Zach consumed it, since it's apparently a more extreme version of the ritual Alanic did. But the Marker has different activation thresholds for different things, e.g. unstructured vs structured mind magic, so I think it should still be worth a try.

      In the past I thought that soul perception fell under the category of enhancements that consume mana reserves, but this chapter made me change my mind. This chapter phrased it as being a natural part of every soul that's just normally sealed in its lower level of efficacy. If there is a cost to reserves, I think it would be under 1 magnitude.

  Great chapter!

  I'm not sure I quite get why Silverlake wants her youth restored as much as she does, though. She doesn't seem physically incapable, and she's basically a hermit. Who's even going to see her?

  Plus, it's hard to imagine her personality carrying the same authority coming from a twenty-something.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure she doesn't care what she looks like, but even a small improvement in fitness would be a big deal over centuries.

    And in terms of personal presence and influence, returning herself to early twenties equivalent is probably not going backward.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I know this is mostly unrelated, but I'm thinking of introducing a friend to this book. I know that the first four chapters are really important, but I'm thinking of making my friend skip them, just because the world building can be hard to push through if you aren't already invested in the story. What should I do? My friend's into fantasy/mystery sort of stuff, so MoL fits the bill pretty well. I just don't know how to go about getting her to try it. As a side note, one of her favourite series of all time is called 'Skullduggery Pleasants', if that helps with anything. She does also like Harry Potter, but I'm not quite sure how well HP translates into MoL since they are both incredibly different from each other. It's kinda stupid to ask the rational reddit about skipping the core worldbuilding chapters, but I'm genuinely asking about your own experiences. Do you think it's smarter to read the first four chapters after reading up to around chapter 20+? Or should one just read from the start?
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    Definitely from the start. MoL builds so much on the initial details; it basically revolves around the sense of progression and unfolding mysteries via time loop. I'd say just give a gushy recommendation tailored to what you already know about what she likes. or, uh, stretch the truth and mention a train ride to school... 

    I've recommended a lot of books to friends and it usually comes down how I sell it. Enthusiasm is contagious, but a healthy dose of pessimism is recommended. Sometimes they just don't like it or can't muster the initiative to start it. Pester them with how good it is, send them an e-book version, or make a tactical retreat to try later when they're complaining of boredom.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Er...if she doesn't like detailed world building, she probably won't enjoy it much. That's the best part of MoL.

    ETA And no, I definitely wouldn't skip the first four chapters. That's where half the important characters are introduced, and Zorian enters the loop. What I would instead suggest is that your friend read *only* the first four chapters and then make a decision about continuing.
    ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    Tell her some people find the first four chapters slow, but shit hits the fan by then. And also tell her that some people really love the first four chapters! I adored the leisurely pace, especially because when the summer festival happens and the plot begins to really run, I was left with a feeling of exhilaration.
    ```
