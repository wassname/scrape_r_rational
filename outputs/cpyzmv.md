I have a bit more than a full chapter of backlog at present, but this is a web serial and I'm happy to take suggestions from readers as to where they want things to go.  Would you like more "hangout" chapters, where Ram gets a chance to breathe?  More info on a given character (I'm already moving forward some of the big reveal on Ram's situation per a reader request in last week's update)?  Anything else?

The Blurb for those just joining us: " The  world has not been kind to Ram’s family. Father just lost an arm.  Mother can’t work. And if Ram can’t find a way to make money fast, a  life of forced labor is the best any of them can hope for. His only way  forward is through the darkest side of their dark world–fighting on the  front lines of war against the demons, hiding with thieves and assassins  in the shadows, wandering the wilds where the monsters rule.  How much more will the god of the pyre ask him to sacrifice?  And why, Ram wonders, should he be the one to pay? "

Thanks, one and all!

  Wow, these guys are really motivated to take Ram down, even after half their friends die in front of them. Of course *now* is the time he finally meets selfless people dedicated to defending their community at their own peril.

    Or paranoid troglodytes with a bunker mentality.  It's sort of like "terrorist" versus "freedom fighter."

      Yeah, but, if I saw a terrorist kill 3 of my friends after saying he'd be out of our hair if we live him alone, and all I have is a pickaxe... at that point I might just cut my losses and assume it's someone else's problem :P
