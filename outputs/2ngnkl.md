## Anybody seen "Coherence"?

### Post:

I have read [this review](http://www.sirlin.net/posts/interstellar-and-coherence), which claims [Coherence](http://www.coherencethemovie.com/) is better than Interstellar. Unfortunately, it seems impossible to watch outside the US?

  Seems like a pretty good character study, where everyone can blame their irrationality on a comet. The claim that it "does for quantum physics what *Looper* did for time travel" throws me off, since there's nothing particularly quantum in the trailer. But hey, the reviews are good, and I'm a big fan of those *Blair Witch Project* style natural-script stories, so I'd certainly be interested in watching it. Needless to say, I'll be monitoring this thread.

  ETA: Skimming the review. Tired of scrolling past pages of unoriginal *Interstellar* critiques. I **liked** that movie, dammit. If you're worried about the science so much, [there's literally a book about that](http://www.amazon.com/The-Science-Interstellar-Kip-Thorne/dp/0393351378), and it's quite good at justifying the film. And no, love didn't actually matter, like, at all, that was just Nolan putting themes on top of it. As a story, it's great; as hard science fiction, it falls a bit short. But it wasn't meant to be judged as hard science fiction! So don't.

  Also, that soundtrack was objectively amazing, no matter what he says.

  I wonder how he's gonna 180° into applauding a story whose premise seems to be that a comet causes parallel universes to run into each other …
