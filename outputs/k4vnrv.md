  I like this story for its relative mundanity. Tabitha is focussed on what’s important to her — having a good life — rather than trying to exploit future knowledge for power and fame.

  I started reading it this morning at chapter one. Did not get very much else done today, but now at chapter 27, and it seems to have changed genre on me. I'm enjoying it, though.

  Oooh, a Groundhog Day/Replay/Harry August style story I haven't read? Thank you, that is my favourite genre!

    I'm a sucker for loop stories too. I haven't found a way to search for them on Royal Road but here are some I found just because they are highly rated.

    * The Perfect Run - MC can set a save point to return to when he dies, future earth with superpowers
    * The Menocht Loop - Starts in a loop and doesn't know why, magical world with technology
    * Blessed Time - Gains a looping power with active activation and limits. magical fantasy world

    Honorable mention (Not looping but using knowledge from previous lives)

    * The Many Lives of Cadence Lee - Reborn into a different world each death
    * Magic Smithing - Reborn once, from earth to a magical world
    * Sylver Seeker - Reborn into the same or similar fantasy world
    ```

      RR actually just added a time loop tag! You can search for all stories tagged as time loop. MoL hilariously doesn't show up in a "time loop" advanced search because the author hasn't logged in to add the tag.

    I assume you already read Mother of Learning?
    ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      Yes, definitely. It's great. Thank you for the suggestion!

    If you're willing to read fanfiction, [Purple Days](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/) is a pretty good take on a repeating timeloop around A Song of Ice and Fire.

    In particular, it does a great job exploring the world, especially the less used parts not well covered by the books.
