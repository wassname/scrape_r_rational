  Hopefully this isn't moving too slowly - my initial projection was for a dozen chapters, and I think I might end up having to go past that. Next chapter will start resolving some of the lingering plot threads.

    I don't feel it's too slow because there was still a lot of development and new information in this chapter. And at least for me those things keep me interested in reading.

  Mostly great as usual but, as my honest opinion/first impression, I'm not sure Martha's exposition on her husband's experiences sits well. Maybe there's too many different things happening in this one chapter that it feels crammed in.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Yeah, I somewhat agree and might fix that later.
    ```

    - u/None:

      I like the anecdote, but I agree it feels a little crammed, maybe split the scene up and have the conversation about the guns and her husband happen after he's been working there a little while?

        Alright, it's been pulled, and I think will get moved to a different place in a later chapter (I have just the one in mind). It was one of those things that I wasn't sure sat well on the page, and I appreciate the feedback to let me know that I wasn't just imagining things.

          I've especially loved the historical tidbits in this fic. It was brilliant to set it in the 1930s, and I've learned a lot about that time period from the things you've mentioned. So yeah – though I agree with the others, I'd love it if you'd find a place to work it in somewhere.
          ```

            Glad you enjoy it - it's definitely a bit more work, because I write something like "Lois drove" and then spend ten minutes looking up what the laws for women drivers were in the 1930s (prohibiting women from driving was talked about, but never implemented - the biggest impediment was that for a long time cars were started with a manual crank that took a lot of physical exertion, but by the 30s the switch to electric start had mostly been made). But I've always liked the interwar period - it's my second favorite time period, with the other being the early 1700s.

              Early 1700s! Really? I guess I'm surprised to hear that! A quick survey of what I learned about history in school reveals a particular deficit in those two exact areas – my US History class skipped right from WWI to WWII (maybe because the professor dallied so much in the Reconstruction era), and ... Where in the world were the interesting events of the early eighteenth century?
              ```

                In the first two decades of the 1700s, you have:

                * The calculus controversy between Newton and Leibniz
                * The War of Spanish Succession involving many of the major powers in Western Europe
                * A Golden Age of Piracy (one of a few - this one was somewhat attributable to the end of the previously mentioned War of Spanish Succession which left thousands of trained sailors without jobs)
                * Rise of modern banking in London
                * First commercial steam engine (by Thomas Newcomen)

                For a couple of years I ran a D&D campaign that was set in 1713 (with magic and dragons, naturally), and every week we'd go on some new adventure in a world as historically accurate as I could make it, but with all sorts of wacky D&D stuff added in. There's a wonderful series by Neal Stephenson (of Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon fame) called "The Baroque Cycle" that will teach you everything you want to know and more about that time period. I think part of the reason that I like it so much is that it's so often ignored.

                Edit: Oh, and it's also part of the Edo period of Japan and a time of colonialism in basically everywhere that's not Europe. And Peter the Great! And a bunch of other stuff!

      I thought it was intentional, setting her up as a friendly rambling old lady.

  Corrections thread:

  * You missed the line-breaks between the first two scene changes (Jimmy-Lois, Lois-Luthor).

  * Also "not matter the circumstances" should be "**no** matter the circumstances" I think.

  * And in your author's notes "Whether this was [x] or [y] is left as an exercise to the reader" should probably be "**Working out** whether this was..." :P

    > She could feel her eyes on him while she undressed sometimes. 

    Should be his eyes on her?
    ```

      ```
      I will fix this when I get home in a few hours, thanks.
      ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Thanks! Line breaks I caught a couple minutes after it went live, but I would guess you started reading as soon as you got the e-mail?
    ```

      also a mixup of her and him in the sentence about Lois undressing, which gave me a moment of confusion. 

      Otherwise great chapter

  Good work! Keep it up, please.

  "in prison for awhile" should be "a while". "If Superman really were" should be "really was." "You have the most exposure to the man as anyone on the planet" should be "You have more exposure to the man than anyone else on the planet". "She could feel her eyes on him" should be "She could feel his eyes on her."
  ```

- u/TimTravel:
  ```
  All caught up. I love it so far!

  Despite Lex's concerns, based on Superman's dialogue and my general understanding of the character, I think he's more likely to give up and leave the planet than become violent or take over the world. Story-logic would suggest otherwise, of course.
