## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You can continuously renew the supply of any handheld common item that is meant to be used continuously and steadily: a roll of duct tape, a can of spray paint, a spool of wire, a ball of yarn, etc.

  A few limitations: 

  * The supply isn’t inexhaustible, it renews only as used and has a maximum rate of renewal of about 1.5% a second.  You are unlikely to exhaust a big ball of yarn, but a small bundle of rope might be used up (counting as used as it comes unbundled) faster than your power renews it.

  * The item must be sufficiently common, a custom ordered canister of Gold spray paint won’t work with the power.  A limited mass production run might if it is made in sufficient quantity.

  * It must be sufficiently continuous and contiguous.  A pitcher of water poured out wouldn’t work with this power, but a jug with a good nozzle might and with a miniature pump setup that makes the water flow steady and continuous definitely would.

  * The item must be held to use this power.  The item must be small enough that you can lift it without mechanical assistance.

  So munchkin ideas for

  * the real world

  * a post apocalyptic setting

  * street tier superheroes

    ```
    Scuba diving, being able to stay down *forever* is far more discontinuously useful than almost any similar area. 

    You might be able to use a leafblower to create air from nothing, and because the supply is the entire atmosphere the 1.5% thing is still a lot of air. 

    Either of these are especially useful on a spaceship.

    Real world: I don't munchkin it, I just enjoy never having to buy duct tape or twine again.

    Post-apocalypse: freshwater is probably the most valuable application. Build the biggest pump you can hold and supply everyone in your settlement with water as needed. If nutrition isn't an issue, work out a lot so you can hold bigger pumps. (Also see if you can make "continuously distributed coils of sausage" popular enough for your power to take hold.)

    Street capes: The Winch is a big dude who carries a spool of chain on his back, as well as bolt cutters to snip it as needed. He's not very powerful.

      The coil of sausage is a great idea.  Now that you got me thinking if it a pasta extruded and flour supply should work as well.

    **Real world**

    I'm thinking finding an expensive liquid (scorpion venom, insulin, human blood, Horshoe crab blood, etc), put it in a common mass produced container of some kind that comes with a faucet or drip mechanism, like one of those water jugs for camping.  

    Make it as big as possible while I can still lift it once, briefly (spend a few weeks in the gym first for the low hanging fruit gains). Then sit next to it and hold it to constantly produce while I surf, read, play games etc with my other hand. 

    If I can't get a deal for a large volume; start small and save up the produced liquid for progressively bigger vessels.


    **Post apocalypse**

    Same as above but water, fuel, antibiotics, insulin, etc. Keep vessels of many sizes around so that I can produce more of whatever valuable liquids are found.
    ```

    - u/Norseman2:
      ```
      The liquids you suggested are a bit problematic, since all of them would require FDA approval to allow you to sell them. Additionally, the most profitable one there is scorpion venom at about $10,300/mL, but it might not count as being "sufficiently common". Aside from that though, insulin goes for about $32/mL, horseshoe crab blood at about $16/mL, and human blood at about $1/mL.

      A better alternative, if it counts, might be molten gold. That wouldn't require FDA approval and could sell for about $400/mL.
      ```

      - u/KilotonDefenestrator:
        ```
        I was thinking I would be working with an established medical company. 

        I considered gold, but I thought it would be problematic to pass off the device that maintains gold at a liquid state and drips it out at 1,5% per second as a "common handheld item". 

        The containers in my medical examples would be simple, off the shelf products. Just the contents would be special.
        ```

        - u/Norseman2:
          ```
          Actually, just realized a much easier solution. Simply unspool a large cable reel of gold wiring.

            Huh. Clever. Obvious in hindsight, like simple elegant solutions often are. Probably hard to beat value generated too.
            ```

          - u/scruiser:
            ```
            I figured there was probably some way of making something to sell with this power, but I didn't realize the solution was that simple and elegant.  You can literally buy mass produced Gold wire off Amazon, so it counts as "common".  Nicely done.
            ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Do electronics count? If I hold an iPhone in my hand, it is continuously and steadily consuming electricity, at a rate of less than 1.5% per second. It is extremely common, and the power is drained continuously and contiguously. And I can hold it in my hand.

    So would this mean any common handheld electronic will never ever run out of power as long as I hold it? For that matter, a laptop isn't too difficult to hold with one hand. Can I recharge one from 0% to 100% power just by holding it for slightly over a minute? Do I even need to hold it, or can my power reach any handheld item even if I am not holding it?

    What about "digital" money? For example, phones have balances (or minutes) that are continuously drained as you make calls. If you hold your phone, does this balance renew?
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Digital money doesn’t count.  An external battery pack giving electricity to something else will work, the battery within a device won’t.

  - u/skullcandy231:
    ```
    How much of it can you summon at once and how quickly?
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      1.5% per second of the total unused supply.  So for a 100 m long ball of twine you could unspool 1.5 m (150 cm) per second and not exhaust the supply.  Whereas for a 1 m length, you could only unspool 1.5 cm per second.  If you exceed these limits you will be using your supply faster than you are replenishing it.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        Can you renew something after it is completely depleted?

        For example, a wax candle would continuously use up it's wax, until all that remains is the wick. Can you then pick up the wick and renew it to get a candle back?

        What about a [Sparkler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkler)? Can you pick up burnt out sparklers and renew them? 

        Because for a post apocalyptic scenario, renewing sparklers would let you make lots of renewable sparkler bombs. (Note: This is illegal, do not attempt to make unless in a lawless post apocalyptic scenario.)
        ```

        - u/scruiser:
          ```
          There has to be something of it left.  For example with a candle at least some wax would need to be left for the wax to be renewed.  Although with ordinary usage of the candle, starting from a complete state, the power would renew both wax and wick and the candle wouldn’t run out as longer as it burned slower than a rate of 1.5% per second.  

          Restoring an almost used up candle is tricky.  The item needs to be in use for the power to activate and renew it, so you would need a way of slowing the burning rate of an almost used up candle to restore it... as long as the remaining candle would take longer than 94 seconds to be used up with your power and had both a little wax and wick left the power would eventually restore it as it burned.

          For the sparkler, rig it up so a small portion of it won’t burn properly, use it, the retrieve the unburned portion and burn it slowly?  I haven’t used a sparkler in a while so I’m not sure that would work.

    Small usages of the power, never run out of lighter fluid. Has been smoking the same cigarette since 1987. Never runs out of alcohol in a hip flask. Never runs out of toothpaste in tube. Never runs out of shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, bleach, or any kind or common consumable. Never runs out of coolant, or antifreeze, and never has to re fill on oil. Never runs out of propane when grilling. Never runs out of spices, or condiments. Never runs out of chewing tobacco. Only bought licorice once.
    ```

  - u/Nomorethisplz:
    ```
    For the real world I would use one of those money guns and continuously shoot money out of it to effectively print money (or would the process of taking out the fake money and filling the toy with real money count as the object being used up? Could you refill an empty can of spray paint with a different colour of paint and have the power work to restore it? If so would it restore the new or old colour).

    You could use a tube of icing like the ones in a bakery to create a constant supply of high concentration sugar which can be used to flavour lackluster apocalypse food, salt shakers can be used to create much needed electrolytes and smoothies and juices can be drunk continuously to regain much needed vitamins which might be useful in an apocalypse where fruit is hard to come by, sunflower oil can be continuously poured out and stored in glass bottles to be used in Molotov cocktails and a pack of seeds could be used to cover huge swathes of land in seeds which is especially useful for people who haven’t gardened before since now they have an infinite supply of seeds to test on or they can just eat the seeds continuously if it goes that poorly. I’m not sure if things go off when using this power so I don’t know if you can just continuously pour out fruit juice or if after a few days nasty, chunky, expired juice comes out? If it replaces the old stuff with new stuff is that fresh and sustainable forever? E.g. pouring out milk all day into other containers, pouring the milk from those containers into containers, are these most recent containers of milk full of fresh milk or 2 day old milk? If it’s the former you could have infinite luxury so long as you manage the goods correctly but if it’s the latter I think you might be in trouble, of course the off stuff has uses too so the power is still useful e.g. as fertiliser for the gardening projects mentioned above with the pack of seeds.

    A street tier superhero: pepper spray woman, utilises canisters of pepper spray all over her body to fend off attackers. She has multiple cans so that if she needs to use more than 1.5% per second she can switch between them to maintain her supply.

  You can materialize 99% pure iron, up to 100 kg of it, in any structure you can visualize the entirety of it in. It could be a monomolecular string 1000 km long, or a solid block. You can only go to the limit of materializing singular iron molecules, no smaller. You can only materialize 99% pure, inert iron. No isotopes, or allotropes, or alloys. Once you hit your quota of 100 kg, you must wait 24 hours before you can use your power again. 

  The materialization happens in a radius of 25m, with the structure happening much like a 3d printer (layer by layer), but at a much higher speed. For example, you can materialize a single block of 100kg of iron in 1 second. More intricate/smaller objects take longer depending on how much concentration and mental acuity you need to visualize it. A woven blanket of monomolecular iron strings would take days of concentration. You can't materialize things inside people, or inside of buildings or objects that you can't see into. You can only materialize stationary things, and once your materializations are in the real world they are acted upon by real world physics.

    How quickly can I visualize iron dust?   
    It's dust, so the shape doesn't matter and can be whatever is easiest to visualize. 

    If you can do so very quickly, you can materialize a cloud of iron dust around your opponent, then set it on fire. 

    If not so quickly, you can materialize tiny invisible amounts of iron dust in an enemy's mouth whenever you see them open it, slowly poisoning them to death.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Dust isn't very complicated but it's very small. You wouldn't be able to make an explosion of iron dust but you'd maybe be able to materialize enough per second to make a slight fog. Still very flammable, and explosive. 

      Technically, you could use up your concentration to build straight up machines one part at a time. Like building a gun one part at a time, or a lathe. Of course, you'd need to pick mechanisms that work with the strengths of pure iron.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Pure iron shouldn't be too much of an issue because it would be completely solid. Much of the issue with early ironworking was that you'd either have bubbles in cast iron pieces or stress fractures in wrought iron pieces. If you're manifesting the iron ex nihilo, that is less of an issue.

    1kg into low earth orbit is a minimum of 32 MJ or 32,000,000J.

    100kg at the top of a 400m building is 392,000 J. 100kg at the top of an 850m building is 833,000.

    My initial thought was to use the iron as a space-launch system using its potential energy but unfortunately even assuming total conversion of its potential energy and perfect storage of same, it's about one month per kilogram launched, and 1kg into LEO is only worth like a few grand.

    Damn. There goes my brilliant plan.

      > My initial thought was to use the iron as a space-launch system using its potential energy but unfortunately even assuming total conversion of its potential energy and perfect storage of same, it's about one month per kilogram launched

      I mean, even if the math had checked out, ground launch still has a ton of issues, most notably air resistance. If you want to do space related stuff, your best bet is to bootstrap your way to getting yourself into orbit via existing companies, then use the power for space construction. Being able to materialize a hundred kg into orbit for free would be absolutely massive when it comes to creating megastructures in space.

      There's some catches: Weight still matters when it comes to moving anywhere, albeit far less than when you're launching. Plus, I'm not sure how useful pure iron even is for a pressurized container, and alloying it in orbit is still prohibitive.

      But in theory, getting hundreds of free kgs worth of shaped iron should help boost the commercialization of space. Things like stations or oversized ships should be easier if the shell gets into orbit for nearly free.

    Caltrops would be a decent compromise in conflict, I imagine. The basic structure is relatively simple, and being able to create them on command could do well due to people not expecting it, being able to sneak past metal detectors, and so on.

    The metal detector thing is actually pretty interesting. If you were determined, you could materialise knives on an aeroplane to perform heinous activities, maybe even a simple crossbow and bolt if you bring a piece of rope and know what you're doing. Though honestly I'm not sure how useful that would be since that's not, you know, my line of work.

    Industrial sabotage, perhaps? All you have to do is get inside a factory and you can pretty untraceably put a literal wrench in machinery, or contaminate food and chemical products to lower reputations. It's not like anyone's gonna call you out on it if they see you staring at the materialising chunk of iron - you could even hit them with a 'is that suppose to be there?'

    Human reaction time is about 200ms, or a fifth of a second. I think it's reasonable to presume you could create iron weights above a person's head that drop down an kill them faster than they can react, especially if the process is quiet. Surprise would help here, of course. I'm not sure what mass/height ratio would be optimal, but I think the optimum would be lethal at a glance.

    You could probably make decent art, being that manual dexterity is less of a limitation. Literally, create anything you can imagine! Sculptures are the obvious usage, but you could probably create a series of iron lines on a pale coloured wooden surface, take a picture, and turn that into some decent digital line art. And that's ignoring the novelty of having supernaturally created art in the first place.

    You could make people stumble by creating small objects in front of or below their steps, which could be funny. Potentially useful. Mostly funny.

    In combat you could perhaps create iron blindfolds? In the time it takes to remove the initial blockage to sight you could create one bound tightly enough that it would a struggle to take off. That one's maybe more useful in the fantasy setting.

    Last but not least, create razors in food you're about to eat and then sue the restaurant you're eating at. Though that one's contingent on you being an asshole, and it'll likely only work once. Come to think of it, a lot of these are contingent on being an asshole. Oh well!

  An enemy combatant can prevent combustion in an 2000 ft radius around themself. 

  * This will prevent guns from firing, as the gunpowder will fail to ignite. 
  * Grenades will fail to explode, and fires cannot burn. 
  * Engines will fail to start, and will stall upon entering this area. 

  To make matters worse, the enemy is in an urban environment and has unpowered minions armed with melee weapons.

        Combustion reactions transform carbon compounds into CO2 and water. The most important part of cellular metabolism, the oxidation of acetyl-coA to transform NAD+ into NADH, is technically a partial combustion reaction. Stopping that starves all eukaryotic cells out on its own.

        The problem with powers like this is that biology in general "uses every trick in the book," as it were. Dimwitted theists convinced that the fine-tuning argument is proof of God wouldn't be so convinced if that didn't look so true from a naïve perspective. But they're looking at it all wrong. Those tricks weren't designed with us in mind, we developed to take advantage of them because they exist. Reality looks tailor-made for us only because we sometimes fail to take the outside view and recognize that we are, instead, tailored to fit perfectly within it.

        So you can't really fuck with chemistry or physics too hard without also destroying the assumptions which allow us to function. You could do some kind of Manton Limit to fix this, but that will always be an artificial hack. There is no part of the fundaments of physics you can mess with without messing with creatures built to function under that physics.

              Unfortunately, I don't know enough about cellular biology to know the temperature of combustion reactions at a cellular level. 

              Or really, if a temperature-limit actually makes sense in the context of combustion in general. I'll have to read up more on the chemistry involved. 

              I also considered only affecting the composition of certain chemicals, or preventing the chain reaction that sets of the rest of the gunpowder. 

              Perhaps reducing the expansion that matter undergoes when it increases in temperature? So the expansion of heated air wouldn't take place and propel the bullet. But again, it'd have to only apply to temperatures above that of the human body, and I still don't know cellular biology well enough to say if that kills a person or not.

    To win, load pepperballs, full rubber balls, or even frozen paintballs in a pinch, and then your average suburbia PD could simply hose fire untill the enemy is in too much pain/can't breathe. The riot squad can also be equipped with paintball guns, along with mace and stun battons. To move around, they could use police horses, bikes, or requisition Tesla's (or other EV's) to close in. Unless the mooks are well prepared (gas masks) this wouldn't be too difficult.

  If masturbation were a skill that one can level up in a system a la Worth the Candle, what virtues would it give? Most interestingly, what would be the reality breaking level 100 virtue? Would there be combo virtues, and what would the linked skills be? E.g.: masturbation, handjobs and sign language, what would be the combo virtue for that?
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    Low level virtues often round out the skill or make it more usable. So the low level virtues would allow you to bypass limitations like chafing, lack of arousal, etc.

    I think one key thematic element of masturbation is self reliance and self dependence.  Various mid-level virtue might allow masturbation to replace some combination of sleep, food, social interaction, and/or water.  

    The capstone virtue would be something outright broken.  Another element of masturbation is the self care aspect.  So maybe for a capstone masturbation is able restore all the various magical energy pools used by other powers such as blood for blood magic, your own bones if used for bone magic, emotions for passion magic, mental energy for gem magic, breath for vibration magic, whatever it is Locus use (oh a way to help the Locus expand), etc.  Outside of the WtC magic system... maybe whatever magic resource analogs exist in this skill system: mana, magic energy, mental focus, creativity, willpower, stamina, etc.

    For other virtues, maybe a grip strength for guys and a dexterous touch or penetrating touch for women?  Or just lump all three together into one or two virtues.

    For the combo virtue with sign language maybe a way of communicating and articulating your conscious and subconscious thoughts perfectly to yourself by touching yourself.  With handjobs added as well, a way of perfectly communicating to other people through touch.
