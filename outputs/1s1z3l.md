  Okay, most of us have come here from /r/HPMOR as far as I know, but I was surprised not to see this /u/EliezerYudkowsky short up here.

  **Assumes devil's advocate pose**

  Postulate: The true ending was the irrational one, the rational ending was the first one where the Maximum Fun-Fun Ultra Super Happy People win. 

  Argument: Human quality of life would be higher, death would be reduced/eliminated, and it's effects mitigated by better communication of partial mind-states across generations, by <untranslatable#>.
  ```

    Counterargument: value is complex.  Human beings value many of the adaptations we've built up *against* pain and sadness even if we don't particularly value the pain and sadness themselves.  The true ending is rational, because we don't throw away our souls to turn bio-orgasmium.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Devil's Advocate: Yudkowsky himself said that he doesn't know which one would be the best scenario - he actually said he has fun watching people argue about which one he was really defending when he was defending neither.

      My position: Sure value is complex, but are you sure you're not rationalising pain and sadness just like you used to rationalise death? And do please think for five minutes before answering. Have you actually examined your internal beliefs, weighed your reasons and found your true rejection? I used to think the true ending was the better one but I'm not so sure anymore. Mainly after reading [this short story by Alicorn](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/damagereport.shtml).

      In fact, I believe people romanticise pain and sadness as much as they romanticise death, and while sadness couldn't be eliminated (whatever lowest level of possible happiness there was would become the new highest level of possible sadness) (not sure the logic follows) pain should be.

        > Sure value is complex, but are you sure you're not rationalising pain and sadness just like you used to rationalise death?

        I never rationalized death as being *a good thing overall* (growing on the *Young Wizards* series does that), but I was not a transhumanist.  I'm still not, really: I don't believe in getting my hopes up when no attack on "the death problem" has been even *partially* successful thus far.  Fund research?  Hell yes.  Start preaching from the mountaintops about how with strange aeons even death has died?  No.

        >And do please think for five minutes before answering. Have you actually examined your internal beliefs, weighed your reasons and found your true rejection?

        Strangely enough, I've already considered this, and have a cached answer: my rejection is, in fact, that I think we acquire a lot of positive traits through the actions we take and the skills we learn to avoid painful outcomes.  We all know, for instance, that children who grow up with riches and golden parachutes all their lives... never really grow up.  Taking away pain *entirely* doesn't enable someone to become the best version of themselves.

        That doesn't mean we need to maximize pain, or simply accept levels of pain decided by Nature.  Melioration is a real and proper attack on pain, and an ideal world should contain *just enough* pain to enable learning to overcome it, *and no more than that*.

        As I put it to someone on another subreddit: in a good future, people might well cry over spilled milk, having nothing more genuinely tragic or evil happening to them.  However, crying over spilled milk or a stubbed toe, and then learning resiliency and discipline, is better than simply removing pain entirely and having a race of spoiled brats.

        EDIT: Oh, and that doesn't even begin to take account of masochists.

        >In fact, I believe people romanticise pain and sadness as much as they romanticise death, and while sadness couldn't be eliminated (whatever lowest level of possible happiness there was would become the new highest level of possible sadness) (not sure the logic follows) pain should be.

        And "romantic jealousy"?  Remember, the Superhappies don't experience *attached, devoted love* as we do, because they decided *romantic entanglements were too painful*.

        Now, being in a long-distance and sometimes rocky long-term relationship myself, I feel qualified to rule on this one.  Being attached and being in love is *way better* than not, be that being single or screwing around (or *trying* to screw around, in the case of us nerds :-p).  I don't think anyone should give that up because it's *difficult* sometimes.

        TL;DR: The Superhappies *suck*, and I don't want my species joining theirs.  We can and should do much, much better than them.  I refuse to vote to scoop entire distinct color channels out of the sensory spectrum.  If, on the other hand, you'd like to put new colors *in*, bizarre new sensations and emotions previously known only to Cthulhu Below, then go ahead ;-)!

          I was talking mainly about physical pain. I don't see why we should need it. Emotional pain *does* sound like it's useful, however. You only become a grownup by being put in grownup situations.

          I like that.

          > And "romantic jealousy"? Remember, the Superhappies don't experience *attached, devoted love* as we do, because they decided *romantic entanglements were too painful*.

          I had forgotten about that, actually. I mean, I don't think romantic jealousy should be a thing because I personally feel it's quite silly to become possessive of a person you love, but that's part of my personal polyamorous philosophy. As for the removal of love, *bad* thing.

          Okay, you convinced me, I changed my mind. The Superhappy outcome is a bad one. Mainly because I think there should be some third alternative that is better. As you said, "We can and should do much, much better than them."

          (But I wouldn't say no to keeping the old sensations *and* adding the bizarre new ones previously known only to Cthulhu Below, either.)

          TL;DR: I agree with you that the Superhappies suck and we should find a better third alternative. I don't think *physical* pain should exist anymore because it's stupid, we can design better ways of making ourselves avoid physical damage without having to add the whole negative sensation thing, but other kinds of emotional pain can be useful in a human brain. This might not be valid for a posthuman, though.

        Actually, let me counterpoint with an alternative imagining: imagine you were fully, completely immortal.  As in, Captain Jack Harkness-level immortal: you can't even be blasted into atoms, it will take a full-blown Reality Warper to get rid of you, and even *they* might not be able to.

        *In that case*, why would you even *want* to eliminate pain?  You don't want to run short of possible sensations or values in your everlasting life, do you?  Surely you'd prefer your own mind have more complexity and for life to be more interesting versus simply trying to simplify yourself into a drooling blob of orgasmium in fear of the Reaper?
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Pain is by definition the sensation we want to avoid. If we grow to like pain, it won't be pain anymore, it'll be something else. So in the Captain Harkness level of immortality, avoiding pain is useless, and it stops being what we'd call pain on a philosophical level.

          That is to say I agree to some extent.

          However, complexity isn't a value in and of itself. If I had to pick two minds, Complexity would *not* be anywhere *near* the top of the choice criteria. And that's also a false dichotomy, we don't have to choose between having a highly complex pain-including life and a drooling blob of orgasmium. We can have a complex mind that doesn't experience highly negative physical sensations but is otherwise capable of qualia we can't even imagine as humans.
