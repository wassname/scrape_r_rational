## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Can anyone recommend me some original English language Xianxia (rational optional). I've read the Cradle Series and the SV quest Forge of Destiny. Both were enjoyable. I've tried to read some translated Xianxia web novels but even the one's I've been told have good translation come across as just about unreadable to me.
  ```

    [Taint](https://lsdell.com/chapter-001-first-floor/) is an Xianxia that I quite enjoyed, in fact I am just about to start re reading it. 

    The bad:

    - The first few chapters are kinda dull. It took a while (chapter 13-ish) to get the point where I was actively enjoying it and not just reading it for answers to the mysterys. 

    - The main character >!is not a good person. She has a goal to which everything else is secondary. Not only that but she spends years traped in a tower alone with nothing but demons and as a result is quite feral. Like she flat out murders innocent people because she couldn't understand a simple social cue. !<

    The good:

    - There are some fucking amazing fight scenes. They really manage to capture the enormous power of the characters involved and it only gets better as the story gose on. 

    - The magic system is well thought out and, dare I say it, quite rational. Every so often a new rule will be introduced and there will be an ah ha! moment as every thing up to that point slides into place.

    - I for one found a few side characters quite like able and I found my really feeling for the main character. I wanted her to do well and succeed on an emotional level.

    If you hate the translation then you could try a pictographic medium which relies less on language.

    Try  [Zui Wu Dao](https://ta1.taadd.com/files/img/logo/201506/201506051350475547.jpg) or Tail of demons and God's.
    ```

    I only know of a few OEL Xianxia to recommend:

    [White Collar Cultivator](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/) was pretty good with an everyman character isekaied into a generic wuxia world and with him digging into the mental differences between mortals and cultivators. He's basically using common-sense and his mastery over bureaucracy to stay alive. Unfortunately, WCC is dead so you might not like the abrupt ending.

    You've probably already read [Sufficiently Advanced Magic](https://www.amazon.com/Sufficiently-Advanced-Magic-Arcane-Ascension-ebook/dp/B06XBFD7CB), but the power levels of Xianxia is very evident in the books and I think it's adjacent to the genre even if it's missing the Asian cultural influences.

    [The Dao of Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic) is a fantastic story about a man from Earth who seeks out to scientifically investigate Qi and wants to completely rebuild cultivation society into one where everyone isn't back-stabbing each other all the time.
    ```

    - u/GlimmervoidG:
      ```
      Thanks. I might give The Dao of Magic of much a try.

      I'm honestly not sure why there aren't more OEL Xianxia. I mean, there's something of a fad for Xianxia at the moment, driven by the translated web novels. Books like the Cradle Series are selling really well. Quests like Forge of Destiny are really popular.

      Why aren't there a thousand follow-the-leader stories out there, just like the thousand isekai clones and the thousand LitRPG clones?
      ```

  - u/SpiritLBC:
    ```
    Does [Savage Divinity](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/5701/savage-divinity) qualify? There is cultivation and ridiculously powerful experts. I find it quite enjoyable. Not at all rational and later on there is a lot of filler but characters are likeable, fights are fun and MC does try to uplift society with his (quite limited) modern world knowledge.
    ```

- u/Audere_of_the_Grey:
  ```
  Anyone have any recommendations for fiction with broad but hard and well thought-out magic systems? Broad as in Mother of Learning magic rather than Mistborn magic. It’s not too hard to make a hard magic system with very specific and limited abilities like in the Mistborn novels, but I’m looking for examples where magic as a whole can do a lot of things, but somehow still manages to be explained well enough that problems can be solved with it without it seeming like a deus ex machina.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    The Inheritance Cycle's magic system can do literally anything except resurrect the dead, and the only rule is that your body must contain enough energy to do the thing you are trying to do "manually" or the spell drains all your energy trying to complete and kills you. Comes complete with an explicitly magical language which can be used literally or metaphorically to produce whatever effects.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      IC magic can resurect the dead too. The only problem is, it's so computationally difficult to reconstruct someone, you'll die. Same reason past prediction only gets you indistinct images, and future seeing murders entire spell circles for nothing.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        That's my headcannon as well, especially given the final battle. Particularly intelligent dragons might be able to do it given the right inspiration, but we haven't seen a dragon (or anyone) who understands physiology very well.
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The Gods are Bastards I think would count.
    ```

- u/SpiritLBC:
  ```
  Any recommendations for stories where there is an existential threat to humanity and there is a unified effort in war preferably set in future? Or just something similar to "To the Stars". "Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest" scratched similar itch but its more school slice of life.
  ```

  - u/cjet79:
    ```
    Most stories on r/HFY. Might not all be rational though.
    ```

  - u/NZPIEFACE:

    > "Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest" scratched similar itch but its more school slice of life.

    wait, what? I have never heard of this series before, so I'm currently wondering how a series with that name can scratch thtat itch.
    ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  Are there any other stories where the main character is the member of a harem rather than being the protagonist-like individual that a typical harem  tends to focus around? The following two stories are great examples where the first one has the protagonist be an haremette and the second one is the male friend of an harem protagonist. Even though Leo ends up having a three way relationship later, the story still has novel takes on the typical harem shenanigans.

  [Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/) \[Original Fiction\] -  Rokusabe Koujirou is a Valkyrie, a human compatible with a device known as a Valkyrie Core and able to materialize a suit of Powered Armour known as a Valkyrie Frame. Training as a member of the United Nations Air Force to combat the growing Antagonist forces, Koujirou is one of less than 100 males out of the 20,000 Valkyries in service. Surrounded by women, can Koujirou find a way to fight the Antagonists, save the world and maybe even find love? It doesn't really matter, cause that's not who this quest is about.

  [The Simulacrum](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum) \[Original Fiction\] - An amnesiac guy from our world is sent into a harem romance comedy show, except instead of being the protagonist, which is the typical thing for how these stories tend to go, he is the idiot friend of the protagonist. The world closely follows narrative tropes from the genre and he uses his genre savviness to avoid awkward situations that normally arise out of these stories, and figure out what's going on and  why he is here.

  Another type of work I'm looking for is where a relatively normal person is thrown into a world that operates on porno logic. Erogamer is the only example I can think of and I'm hoping for more that similarly plays around with the conventions of erotica.

  Can I have some recommendations for things to into completely blind? Doesn't matter why I should be going into it blind, it can be any genre or medium, just put the title down.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Puella Magi Madoka Magica, available on Netflix (US). I went in blind, highly recommend it.

    My two favorite David Fincher movies, Se7en and Fight Club, though it would be hard to be blind for either of them if you hadn't seen them yet.

    I'm not sure how obscure you're looking for, as those are all fairly to extremely mainstream.
    ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    Not necessarily rational, but a better experience IMO if going in blind:



    "Spiderlight", Adrian Tchaikovsky

    "Constellation Games", Leonard Richardson

    "Vita Nostra", Sergei and Marina Dyachenko



    "School-Live" (anime)

    "Kuragehime" (anime)

    "SSSS Gridman" (anime)
    ```

      I just finished school live and it was actually what prompted me to ask this.

    Wilde Life http://wildelifecomic.com/

    Webcomic, better blind for sure.

    I was just recommending this to a coworker earlier: ["The Last Question"](http://www.physics.princeton.edu/ph115/LQ.pdf), short story by Isaac Asimov.

    Edit: on mobile, not sure why the link isn't formatting correctly, whatever.

    The film "Wind River"

    Kill la Kill, the anime

    Ann Leckie's "Ancillary Justice"

    Schlock Mercenary. Start at the very beginning.

    The Library at Mount Char. (Novel.)

    Primer. (Movie.)

    Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. (The novel, not the TV show.)

    Traitor. (Novel by O. S. C.)

    Worm and Homestuck (both web fiction) can get spoiled via cultural osmosis and are long but if you don't know anything about them then you're in for a ride.

  Just caught up to the mother of learning novel, Can you guys suggest me some good novels like MOL?
  ```

  - u/Palmolive3x90g:
    ```
    [Need to Become Stronger](https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/) is pretty good. It's a naruto fanfic and the magic system has been revampted in a way that allows for losts of inteligent exploitation. Considering how simler MoL is to naruto (chakra control = shaping skill, Shaping exercises = tree/water walking exercises, indidual spells/jutsu takeing lots of practice the master, etc) the rational naruto magic system starts to look quite simler to MoL. 

    When I read it the chapter quality went like so: 1-2 (bad), 3-12 (ok), 14-20 (very fucking good), 20-28 (good), 28 - 43 (very good).

  Just started binging Netflix's Love Death and Robots, thought you guys might be interested in "When the Yoghurt Took Over". It's a fun little story about a yoghurt-based GAI.
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    What a coincidence! I binged the entire season yesterday. LDR doesn't have as much to say as it thinks it does, and a few of the episodes were kind of contrived, but it's definitely a worthwhile watch for the quality of the animations alone, to say nothing, of the interesting worlds it builds.

    Personally, I think ZIMA BLUE was the best episode from a "thinky" standpoint, while "LUCKY 13" was the best from an "I-liked-it" standpoint.
    ```

    - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
      ```
      I'm only up to Good Hunting, but tbh so far I don't even get the impression that *it* thinks it has much to say. It is, however, *very* good at appealing to my inner-14-year-old, and it knows it.
      ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I liked it, but it was never anything special. The dialogue especially could be extremely trite and cliched at times. The animation/cgi was pretty great though. 

      Overall I found it kind of depressing, actually. Imagine using those resources on a worm adaptation, or something similar. Then again I was never a fan of anthologies, so maybe it's just me.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        The resources aren't that much, it was only a few episodes. They'd cover one arc of Worm at best with that amount of funding I expect.
        ```
