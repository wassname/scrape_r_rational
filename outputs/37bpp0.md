  The more mundane commercial use of Gentle Repose is given in the Stronghold Builder's Guide. This specifies that you can have a permanent version of the spell cast as an area effect on a room, preventing decay and spoilage.

  Apply that to your wagon and you can transport fresh spices while your competitors all trade in the relatively ineffectual dried varieties. You can slaughter animals in one place and sell the meat on another continent. It's what refrigeration wishes it could be when it grows up.

  At that point, why carry the merchant at all? Just let him stay at home and let the cleric handle the exchange of items. If you like lugging around corpses, pack some random graveyard into your vessel.
  ```

- u/ToaKraka:
  ```
  tl;dr:

  * Cleric of god of death painlessly kills merchants and casts Gentle Repose to preserve corpses

  * Dead merchants' souls go to a comfortable antechamber of the afterlife, by special arrangement with the god of death

  * Caravan space that would've been taken up by merchants' food/water/clothes can be devoted to more sellable goods, allowing more profit for the merchants

  * Cleric rides with corpses to maintain Gentle Repose, then casts Revivify or Raise Dead upon arrival at destination
  ```

    Wow, he's reinvented cryosleep.

  Huh. Seems inefficient, honestly. Is being dead for the journey really *that* much more relaxing and safe, especially if you're conscious the whole time?


  ... on the other hand, glancing at the item prices, maybe it isn't such a bad deal.
  ```

    You're not conscious of the journey itself; you're conscious of a luxurious place of rest and relaxation, and you're NOT conscious of the nitpicky details of the passage of time. (Departed souls are explicitly stated by the rules as only knowing a vague idea of how long they've been dead.)

    The thing that seems inefficient to me is that the cleric has to go on the trip, and the cleric requires supplies... although I suppose the cleric could just pray for Create Food and Water.

    Additional inefficiency: The merchants themselves aren't nearly as much of a drain on the caravan's capacity as their guards are. Merchants with character levels can serve as PART OF the caravan's guard, which is more efficient than hiring henchmen AND stocking supplies for them (and musclebound henchmen probably eat a greater volume of food than merchants, even though the food they eat might be cheaper).

    There's... also the problem with Revivify... uh... not working that way. Whether it's 3.5 Revivify or 5E Revivify, Gentle Repose doesn't change the fact that the merchant died more than one round / one minute ago. In fact, 3.5's description of the spell's effect is that it works by preventing the soul from leaving in the first place, so the suggestion that they have a cushy room in the afterlife to wait is explicitly contrary to that.

    You can work around that with Revenance, which calls the soul back to the body for a limited time, and then Revivify locks the soul into the body. But now you're paying the cleric for even more spellcasting services. (Which is a good deal for the cash-strapped god of death! But not so much for the merchant.)

      Actually, it explicitly does. That's it's primary purpose.

      >Gentle Repose

      >You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. **Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see raise dead). Days spent under the influence of this spell donâ€™t count against the time limit.** Additionally, this spell makes transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant.

      Revivify works the same as raise dead, only it measures its time limit in rounds, not days.

    I don't think it'd be quite that popular. However, I can see it being a tourist thing - the God of Death could set up a whole otherworldly vacation destination to enjoy while on your way to real vacation destinations, and for *really* long trips - halfway across the world with a medieval tech level - it would probably be preferable.
    ```

  This is a lovely thought, but why in the world would you do this? Load your goods and people into a set of Portable Holes. Have a mage Teleport to the destination. Boom, done. 

  Things to note:

  * Portable Holes can be nested by RAW, so you can have a lot of space. 
  * There's 10 person-minutes of air in a Portable Hole. You only need two rounds to do this. (1) pick up Hole + cast Teleport. (2) Put Hole down. It is open, it has unlimited air. 
  * If you want more safety margin, there's lots of options. Darsson's Cooling Breeze (ideally + Permanency), Bottles of Air, those brass pipes from Stormwrack designed for diving bells, another PH that you open when you need air, etc. 

  Assuming you don't need the Permanency, you can do all of this with a 7th level mage. Teleport has a margin for error, but it's a percentage of the distance traveled, so you can walk your shots on target. Portable Holes cost 20,000 gold and therefore 3 weeks to make -- with demand as high as it would be, plenty of mages would be cranking them out. There's other options too -- Enveloping Pits, Bags of Holding (the largest), Teleportation Circle, etc. 

  I can see Gods of Death offering vacation packages, but not just to make trade caravans easier.
