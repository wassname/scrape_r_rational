## WTC what is Thargox?

### Post:

Paging through some old chapters, and I can't remember what details about this entity were revealed.  There's no wiki page on it either.  can someone refresh me?

  Thargox is good at coordinating large amounts of warders, is friendly with Solace, made the locus' bottle, and can only be communicated with through an entad (IIRC).

  FYI you can find specific names on AO3 by clicking "Entire Work" on the top and using Ctrl+F.

      In a parallel universe, there's this guy from Kansas who goes by cthuluraejepsen. No relation to AW though.

    thanks, I had found a few references but the way Thargox was referred to in several places indicated more familiarity than I guess we've gotten.  Solace's coyness seemed to be foreshadowing something that I thought we would have seen by now.  Guess it's still wait and see =)

      Likely, we'll see Thargox in the future.

      Well, we also met him, and he has some lines. He possessed a woman at Heshnel/O'kald's fort through an amulet. 

      But yeah, we don't know anything beyond what's been said in this thread.

  The details have not been revealed. No one in-universe even knows, aside maybe from Solace.
