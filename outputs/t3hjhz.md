## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [*A Practical Guide to Evil*](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/) 

  The series ended over the weenkend, and for those who haven't I'd highly recommend checking it out. It's one of the top webseries out there (the top one, according to [TWF](http://topwebfiction.com/), where's it's almost always ranked #1), and the author has released all the paywalled extra chapters they wrote to the public.

  My favourite part of the story is without a doubt the characters. They are extremely well written, and give the story takes place over about a decade, we see them grow and mature. The main character and her friends go from a group of five young people fighting to make the world better to mature (mostly) adults who change the fate of nations. Supporting characters also get their own POV chapters, so we can see their motivations, inner thoughts and reasonings as well. The extra chapters to a great job of fleshing them out, and we get to see what made them who they are.

  The story really focuses on solving problems through knowledge and resources. It's not so much that characters can't rely on luck - we know there are Gods, and they interfere for their champions sometimes - but they know how to manage their "story" to either avoid having the Gods interfere, or to have them do so on their side. Plot armour exists (sometimes literally), but it doesn't feel wrong or heavy-handed, since it's justified within the story's rules. There's a lot of meta-narrative exploitation going on, and the characters suffer or gain if they make a wrong step. Sometimes they lose anyway, and have to figure out how to pick themselves up and try again.

  The world building is great, the author takes a lot of cues from previous/ancient civilizations to make nations/cultures feel distinct. Though there are a few bits that change from the first book, it is consistent as well. The author heavily leans into story narratives, so there are "rules" to the world that govern heroes and villains, and this meta-narrative becomes an important part of the story.

  The prose is great, definitely a cut above the rest. Spelling and grammar wise there is nothing too serious, though I did notice that the last book, as the chapters became longer, more typos started popping up. It wasn't terrible, but it was enough to be noticeable.

  I will note that the tone of the story changes after the first two books. There's an emphasis on humour at first (like how the MC comes from he "Laure House for Tragically Orphaned Girls") that doesn't quite go away, but the story does shift into something more mature.

  There's a lot to love about the story, especially for fans of fantasy that avoids the usual tropes (or acknowledges and makes use of them), and for those who like intelligent reasonings in characters. I'd definitely recommend *A Practical Guide to Evil*.

    Love PGtE, but I would quibble on the typos. They're almost constant. If I could have a dollar for every typo I found, I could make a full time job out of it, given how long the story is. The writing is great, it just needs copy editing.
    ```

    - u/Kawoomba:
      ```
      Sometimes I wonder if the typos are there on purpose, to better justify a future improved and proof-read e-book version. Otherwise it is near unimaginable that a story that popular doesn't even have one competent beta-reader, or even a "list typos here" forum post (like TWI usually did). Collecting the typos would be trivial, and correcting them a task of like 5 minutes per post. I usually would not suspect such a thing, it is just *such* a stark juxtaposition between the number of typos and the quality of the prose.
      ```

  ```
  I've read the first 10 chapters of Sylver Seeker after seeing it recommended here:

  A) Does the writing quality ever improve?

  B) How did it ever get a 4.5/5 grammar score? The author adds punctuation to text like a particularity hyperactive child adds sprinkles to ice-cream. Are the stories that only get 4/5 composed solely by chimps banging on typewriters?
  ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    On RR, anything below 4.1-ish stars is almost certainly total trash, with very few exceptions.
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      Especially so if it’s a litrpg. God, the mediocre ones all read like Azarinth Healer, which is not a good thing. I read Azarinth Healer, Salvos, and Sylver Seeker, and they all felt the same. Well, except that Sylver had the worst grammar and writing of the 3. Or they’re trainwrecks in other ways like Delve.
      ```

      - u/YankDownUnder:
        ```
        > Or they’re trainwrecks in other ways like Delve.

        What's wrong with Delve? (I've never read it, so you'd be saving me some time.)
        ```

        - u/ulyssessword:
          ```
          Very, very slow pacing, both by plot-per-word and by the calendar.  Also, the characters have somewhat merged together into an indistinguishable mass of "reacting to Rain's zany antics" and it frequently skips over what *should* be interesting interactions to focus on throwaway characters instead.
          ```

        - u/TheTruthVeritas:
          ```
          Man, just about everything that could go wrong, has gone wrong in Delve. The MC is honestly pretty pathetic, he essentially only achieves anything because he luckily befriends possibly one of the only few high level crafters not attached to any big organizations, and a lot of other helpful people that I feel trivializes the story. He doesn’t earn anything that happens, and is an idealistic fool. That’s a minor complaint too.

          The story goes nowhere. A mini-arc is spent on him literally being stuck in a hole in a ground. And all he does is just keep on digging and training his stats, not even anything important. Half of a chapter is spent on everyone standing on a wall doing nothing. He spends an entire arc trying to solve an ancient dead superpower’s artifact to save the city, and just hands it off to the local ruling power and gets absolutely nothing in return. Note that everybody would’ve died if he didn’t figure out and solve the problem, and that said ruling power is literally one of the 3 superpowers of the world. Chapters are spent on random characters in the MC’s new organization that have no meaning or purpose, I doubt most readers can even remember most of those characters. And in these fluff chapters, they don’t even show the important fluff. There is no tension. The biggest antagonist superpower country sends a group after the MC and his organization after a member attacks some of their soldiers, but this conflict just straight up disappears and nothing happens.

          When a side character finally reaches a conclusion with his big backstory conflict involving his family, it’s just told to the reader, instead of say, doing a POV chapter with him.

          Despite being a litrpg that is heavily advertised as being very in-depth with the system where a lot of number crunching and optimizing happens, half of this story also involves the MC playing at vague minecrafting in his soul. A lot of the story is spent on this, and most of the time it’s just rehashing the same thing, and even when it’s not it’s ridiculous bullshit like going in-depth on him making a snake avatar out of soul material bullshit and how accurate it is to a real snake. I will again repeat that there has been virtually no payoff with this, and that there’s nothing that could possibly justify all this garbage throughout all the chapters.

          All the characters are written blandly too. Even the average Azarinth-like litrpg on RoyalRoad is written better since at least they don’t write dozens of boring indistinct side characters and force them upon you.

          The main character, again, is also very annoying. It’s a common complaint every chapter about how annoying he is. Every chapter he’ll always say a bunch of vague cultural references that only he understands. He fails as a leader, he has no agency and just gets carried by other people. It’s like one of those crappy Japanese isekais where the MC tries to implement democracy or modern inventions in hackneyed ways.

          Delve had a promising start where it actually did cool things and went places, but for a while now it’s been slowly dragging around doing nothing. It’s like a bad shounen, but in addition to being bad, when it’s dragging around doing filler it doesn’t even do fun filler with villains or conflicts or adventures. Instead, Delve just does a lot of navel gazing.


          I recommend looking at the past weekly Delve posts. They do a good job of showing why and how everyone is so dissatisfied with the series.

                So? You can walk up to someone and hand them five dollars without anyone stopping you. Doesn't make everyone into a "scam".

                Don't think it's worth the money? Don't pay for it, you're not being held at gunpoint to donate and it is available for free on RR. 

                I don't understand the sheer vitriolic hate this subreddit has for the author. Sure maybe you don't like their stuff but damn, ya'll act like they shot your dog. 

                Some people go out and spend $50 to drink poison that'll make them feel like shit the next day, but it's the $5/month **donation** that sets you off.
                ```

                  Your comparison is incorrect. This is more akin to essential oils—you can easily find out how terrible they are with a simple search, but it doesn't stop it from being a colossal scam. If you paid to get chapters in advance only to realize that the story has been shit the whole time a few months into the subscription, you got scammed (that's my problem with *Paranoid Mage*, but that's unrelated, lol). Overall, I don't really care for *Delve*, I'm not subscribed and I don't read the free updates either, but it's not a *free* scam, and you are making intentionally wrong analogies.
                  ```

                  - u/tomtan:
                    ```
                    Why would anyone ever donate to patreon without reading what's available for free first? And after reading everything on RR, anyone who donates on patreon already has a good understanding of where the story is going, the pacing and the boring zany references that amuses no one else than rain.

                    I mean I used to be subscribed, I cancelled once I realised I had spent 2 months without reading the patreon updates because I was no longer excited by the story but you don't see me bashing the author. His story is just not for me, nothing wrong with that.
                    ```

                  - u/None:
                    ```
                    Your comparison is incorrect... It's not a scam at all, not unless you also consider buying a meal and not liking it a scam? Where exactly were you told you'd enjoy reading the unreleased chapters?

                    I think you misunderstand how Patreon works. No where does it state that you are paying money to get chapters that you will enjoy reading.

                    Patreon is for **donating** and some creators have donation incentives to encourage donations, but AFAIK no one has a "If you give me $5 I will make you happy" as a donation incentive. 

                    You're experiencing classic buyers remorse, nothing more. 

                    **You** chose to **donate** because you didn't want to wait for the chapters to be released publicly. That's not a scam, that's being impatient and getting upset you didn't like what you paid for.

                    It's clear you're too invested in this and admitting you made a mistake is beyond you. There's no point in trying to continue this from either of us. You won't change your opinion and neither will I.

                    Edit: The legal definition of donation, as /r/rational residents have struggled understanding the concept

                    A donation is a voluntary transfer of property (often money) from the transferor (donor) to the transferee (donee) with no exchange of value (consideration) on the part of the recipient (donee). (The recipient gives nothing in exchange for the donated property.)

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      As an author who thinks he's one of the very few exceptions you're talking about, yeah, that seems about right. :D

      (Royal Road hates in medias res _so much_. I'd probably be rated 4.5 or higher if I hadn't done an in medias res start.)
      ```

      - u/sephirothrr:
        ```
        Which is frustrating because there's nothing I hate more than having to read 5000 words of useless bullshit prologue of whatever the mc is doing before the plot starts
        ```

        - u/lillarty:
          ```
          I hate almost every usage of *in medias res*, precisely because I hate having to read 5000 words of bullshit filler before the plot starts, and putting a random paragraph from chapter 5 at the start of your prologue doesn't make it any less frustrating. It's the worst of both worlds; an incoherent opening that spoils part of the story *and* a useless bullshit prologue which you have to wade through.
          ```

          - u/Flashbunny:
            ```
            I thought in media res was starting the story having skipped any setup or prologue, explaining things as they come up, not putting a flashforward at the start and then doing the usual thing?
            ```

            - u/lillarty:
              ```
              It's possible I'm mistaken, but I believe it's simply any story which starts *in the middle of things*, as the name suggests; what happens after that isn't relevant to the classification.
              ```

          - u/sephirothrr:
            ```
            yeah fair, I guess the specific thing I really dislike is like, spending a day or whatever in the earth life of an Isekai protagonist before they get hit by a bus

            no one cares, and it's a really lazy way to do characterization
            ```

  - u/LaziIy:
    ```
    A) I got to like chapter 25 before moving on, the writing quality was pretty much the same. That said, I believe that there should be upwards of 180 chapters now so there should be some improvement.  

    B) Yeah pretty much
    ```

  - u/Judah77:
    ```
    No, it doesn't get better.  I dropped around chapter 30ish.
    ```

- u/IICVX:
  ```
  I found a story I can't believe I missed last week: [Fox's Tongue and Kirin's Bone](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42226/foxs-tongue-and-kirins-bone) is just amazing. Super well written, and the setting is really intriguing; it seems kind of like a deconstruction of fairy tales, like "what would happen if animals actually had the intelligence and magical powers that are attributed to them?". 

  There's also a lot of political plotting going on, though it seems to go over the main character's head - or does it? He's definitely a somewhat unreliable narrator, and since the story is from his perspective, all the hints are things he notices. I'm still unsure if the MC actually realized that the >!library fey was the princess nobody ever sees!< - it's such a common, tropey twist that he _probably_ did, but he always acted in a plausibly deniable manner about it.

  Probably  the worst part of the story is the first chapter, which is just kind of confusing (how does he know he's seeing his Death? What even is going on?), but it takes off like a rocket from there.
  ```

  - u/sephirothrr:
    ```
    I'd also like to add that the author, MuffinLance, has also written [some great AtlA fanfiction](https://archiveofourown.org/users/MuffinLance/works) that has been previously linked on this sub.

    They're varying degrees of rational, but they're all well written and very enjoyable.
    ```

    - u/loltimetodie_:
      ```
      For anyone interested in AtlA fanfiction, through MuffinLance's tumblr (or bookmarks, I kinda forget which), I found [While Mighty Oaks do Fall](https://archiveofourown.org/works/29177388/chapters/71633358), an AU fic centred on Zuko having been given to the Fire Temple as a child, a la historical rulers in our world disinheriting children by sending them to join a monastary. 

      *Very* rigorous in the development of religions in the AtLA world, which is where it intersects with the sphere of "rational" fic imo. Characters aren't necessarily rational in the way some people here enjoy, but a very rational exploration of how religion may have developed in this world, the role it plays in societies and in the minds and motivations of the characters, lines that can be drawn to and through canon events (e.g. Fire Lord Sozin kicking off a tradition of secular authority running roughshod over religious authority in the Fire Nation, enabling a radical expansionism that would seem to be proscribed by most traditions in every nation), etc.

      The author studies religion at a graduate level IIRC, and it kinda shows.

    I’ve seen Blindsight by Peter Watts recommended here, it’s a published book, but I only recently found out it’s licensed as Creative Commons, so you can download a free epub from [the authors website](https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm) (or elsewhere). I’ve only just started it, it’s pretty weird sci-fi but seems interesting. If that’s the wrong format you can use the program Calibre to fix it.

    Also FYI there are ways to convert RoyalRoad stories to ereader formats, I don’t have a link handy but it’s posted about pretty regularly here so it should show up in search.

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    Archive of Our Own lets you download any work as an epub/mobi, or are you specifically talking about skipping the "download it and then put it on my e-reader" step by buying on-device?

    Another thing would be to send things to pocket and use the kobo pocket integration, I use that to read blog posts all the time.

    If you haven't read The Martian or Project Hail Mary, both of those are trad novels in the style of Apollo 13 (i.e. astronaut met with disaster, uses science to fix it; finds new disaster, repeat). 

    Project Hail Mary has some major plot elements that are easily spoiled and perhaps best left as a surprise so I would advise avoiding even reading the blurb if you care about those things. 

    Dragon's Egg is something I often recommend, it's sci-fi from the 80s about life that evolves on a neutron star and first contact with humans. It was written by a neutron star physicist so it's about as hard as sci fi gets, despite the premise. Added to that the aliens live 15 minutes so there's a real disconnect between the two species!

  There's been a hypothetical I've been mulling over for a bit, and I'm curious if anyone's ever done a good alt-history/theorycrafting on it:

  What would the world post-WW2 look like if Nuclear Weapons had never worked? (Suppose Nuclear Physics is the same, but if you try and make a bomb out of it, God reaches in and nudges the explosives a bit so the chain reaction fails)
  ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    How about other types of WMD? If countries wanted to (and nuclear weapons didn't work), they'd doubtlessly put their efforts into things like chemical or biological super weapons. In an alt-history where instead of maintaining world peace through Nuclear MAD, countries boast about how many unique bioweapon-tipped missiles they have in their arsenals while a vaccination arms-race occurs.
    ```

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      I feel like the bioweapon-MAD world would be much more likely to go over the edge into destruction. We all know the destructive capabilities of Tsar Bomba because we've seen it and other nuclear tests, but the nature of a bioweapon sort of forces it to be more shrouded in uncertainty. You can be certain that the Soviets *had* a bioweapon, but we've developed a counteragent for it. Do they have another one?

      It seems to me that rather than Mutually *Assured* Destruction, you'd end up with Mutually Probable Destruction, and I don't have enough faith in politicians in particular, or humanity in general, to believe that we wouldn't run into someone who rolls the dice and kills us all.
      ```

    - u/self_made_human:
      ```
      Given how well we've handled COVID (there was a confirmed lab leak of Delta in Taiwan while they were studying it), a Bio-MAD setting certainly has quite a bit of suspension of disbelief its premise.

      I would consider societies with widespread orbital weaponry, à la "Rods from God" capable of achieving MAD with tech we can make today, or everyone and their mother owning a relativistic kill vehicle in a more advanced world.
      ```

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        Eh, secure labs around the world have been dealing with far more dangerous diseases than COVID for a long time now and have kept their smallpox, extreme influenzas, anthraxes, and whatevers from escaping and causing widespread death. 

        If the amount of money that was poured into nukes was poured into bioscience instead, I suspect we'd have a quite different world today, and while there would undoubtedly be accidents, that'd just be something the people and governments learned to deal with.

        I mean, it's not like we haven't had nuclear accidents. Granted, I don't think a nuclear weapon has ever been set off accidentally, but there have been a lot of close calls and accidents: once nukes were dropped on North Carolina due to an aircraft failure, and one of the bombs had 3 out if 4 safety switches fail--less than a single millimeters of metal was all that stopped the US from nuking itself.

          I still think storing MAD-assuring levels of bioweaponry is a fool's errand. There were quite a few leaks of our own bioweapons, albeit none of them were remotely strong enough to approach world-ending.

          I don't deny that nukes are risky, but in a less *explodes without notice* way, compared to how easy it is to mess up in even the tightest BSL-4 labs, let alone deploy it in war against a peer opponent. I think that still holds firm even after discounting for the anthropic argument that we didn't actually start an accidental nuclear war.

          TL;DR: The *course* for developing bioweapons is much more fraught by their very nature, in a way that nukes are not. Modern IRL safety procedures are still frankly inadequate, and you're positing a developmental course where they desperately tried to develop ever stronger pathogens with worse security for at least several decades unless their biotech had implausible leapfrogs.

    Current events would suggest that certain modern-day "military superpowers" are nothing of the sort, and are only threatening due to nuclear capabilities. I would expect there to have been more wars, but a much more... resolved geopolitical state.
    ```

    - u/fljared:
      ```
      Hm, though I do wonder to what extent that's because assumptions about security have been made because the Nukes were always there as a final resort. A USSR without the bomb would've likely invested in other projects (Though I don't know how long they would've chased an impossible bomb, and the relevant costs of making the first one vs the next thousand)

    Wouldn't that, after a while when other nuclear physics is well tested and no theoretical model can explain why it only doesn't work specifically in bomb form, change quite a few more things in the science department?

      My supposition here is that everyone assumes that they just need to build it to better tolerances and that the conventional explosives aren't correct. Maybe in the background other theories develop to explain why, but I'm mostly trying to sidestep the [Universal Fire](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LaM5aTcXvXzwQSC2Q/universal-fire) problem to explore the geopolitics aspect.

        I think you could somewhat  reasonably have a world where certain nuclei are slightly more or less stable than usual. Or a planet where there is almost no fissile material on earth due to some process during planetary formation that worked like a sieve to filter heavy elements (though that would leave the question of where they went... some other planet? asteroids?). You'd probably still be able to build a nuclear fission bomb if you really tried, but it might be as expensive as making anti matter bombs is today. Disallowing fusion bombs is probably not possible, but those generally don't work that well without a fission bomb to compress them enough anyway.
        You don't actually have to make it physically impossible, you just have to make uneconomical to do so.



        Another idea I just had:
        Could be funny if almost all the fissile material is on the moon mixed with some other material that absorbs enough neutrons to not start a chain reaction. Like a second, radioactive sun.

        That's a real killer to ignore, so I'd find the idea of an alternate universe where fissile material was *much* rarer to the point of being infeasible to collect in quantities capable of going critical to be a more productive avenue of approach.

    I'd see the only realistic form of MAD here to be widespread orbital weaponry, such as tungsten penetrators or "Rods from God".

    Dropped from orbit, they would do just as much damage as small-yield nukes, or you could go wild and drag some mountain sized asteroids for additional *fuck you*.

    At least that's all I see being plausible in a post-WW2 setting that isn't far ahead of our own, because biological MAD is a death sentence given our dismal response to COVID.

    Best of all, we could build them with tech from today, without relying on anything nuclear. Old fashioned rockets work just as well for getting them into orbit.

  So I have a request for stories that fit a criteria and for help finding lost spots in stories I was reading.

  First off, stories that use leveling up like The Gamer. I'd prefer ones that use off meta builds like leveling in luck, but doesn't have to be. Just ones that are done well. I have read Solo Leveling. 

  Secondly, got a new phone and lost my spot in Mother of Learning and Worth the Candle.

  I was at the spider soul wipes in MoL and the Unicorn defeat/Gold defeat in WTC. Approximate chapter numbers for those would be appreciated.

    You are looking for
    [MoL chapter 26](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning/chapter/307245/26-soulkill)
    and
    [WtC chapter 40](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle/chapter/373459/chapter-40-the-feminine-mystique)

          I second that, mostly. I created an account on Royal Road, and it is much easier to get updates and read stories now. 

          The downside is that previously, I only bothered to do this for stories that were very good. So now I'm spending more time reading things on Royal Road and the average quality of what I read has gone down.

    Dungeon Crawler Carl has both level-ups and an off-meta build that is essentially forced on the character by the system. It's almost anti-rational in how zany it is, but a very fun read anyway.

    [The Games we Play](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12119784/1/The-Games-We-Play-By-Ryuugi) has Jaune become a gamer, and immediately munchkin it as far a it can go. Unfortunately, his enemies get very very strong. Some pacing problems at the end, but I really like the way the author writes the effect of the stats. Say the difference between 100 int and 150 int is visible in how the story is written. It's technically a rwby fanfic but it might as well be a whole nother story with rwby characters. Really good worldbuilding. It's completed, and was supposed to get a sequel but hasn't yet. 

    [The Gamer](https://chyoa.com/story/The-Gamer%2C-Chyoa-edition.12004) is a choose your own adventure style erotica. NSFW obviously. I've tried a few of the routes but the one I liked the most was neo_kenka's route. Felt the most realized and full of interesting ideas. The sex scenes are mostly skippable, although not labeled, and the characters are surprisingly good? Also has a pretty unconventional "teleporting paladin" build. The combat scenes are very good, and the worldbuilding is surprisingly good. The kinks are hit or miss, and most of the sex scenes are meh. But I'd still recommend it if you're starved of gamer novels.

      I love Ryuuji stories. I remember reading this as it released but then I forgot about it as the time between chapters increased.

      Oooh CYOA stories are fun. I'll have to give it a go.

      Any more recommendations?

      I've been rereading The Gamer manwhua and I forgot how annoying him not leveling wis was lol

        There are a few good Worm/Gamer fanfics. Need to read Worm before these though since they assume a good knowledge of Worm, and besides, Worm is a great story anyway. The two I liked the most are

        [Greg Veder vs the World](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/greg-veder-vs-the-world-worm-the-gamer.601118/): Greg wakes up with the powers of the gamer, goes around trying to be a hero but the darkness of the Worm setting slowly whittles him away. It's a lot of fun. Action scenes and character interactions are well done. Doesn't really go too deep into an off meta build, since the gamer powerset kinda makes him a jack of all trades already. He kinda turns into an elemental stealth spellblade or something lol. 

        [A Daring Synthesis](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/): It's like The Gamer but also Flowers for Algernon. Greg starts out as a cringy weeb with no social awareness or mind-mouth filter, and through slow gains in WIS he turns into a person worthy of respect. I would suggest powering through the first few chapters, even though the cringe is *a lot*. The author wrote a kinda troll ending for the story, but there is an earlier stopping point that works as a good and satisfying ending point for everything the fic tries to do.

    I think my favorite use of a "luck" stat in a litrpg type story was in "Threadbare" on Royal Road, if you haven't read it yet. (Main character is a "greater toy golem", literally an animated teddy bear that can gain levels, and they start out with absurdly low Luck.) 

    Oh I should mention that if you want to read it in order you should read the first book, then read his other story, then come back and read through second book, so that's a bit confusing.  But definitely at least read the first book.
