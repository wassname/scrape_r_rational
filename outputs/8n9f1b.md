### Post:

I had just read the recently released Mother of learning chapter and fet little sad thinking it is in the final arc and will end in the near future.I feel MOL is one of the better works of fiction which includes both published and non published in the last few years, yes it does not dive into human nature and get philosophical of why we do things which lot of good published books like three body problem,  foundation series etc do.It is very entertaining and very very addictive. So to prepare myself for the eventual ending , I would like to start a new adventure like mother of learning.

The books I have read with time loops and enjoyed

Fifteen lives of Harry August

Replay

Dark Matter

Nantucket series (not time restart but a varient of time manipulation)

Web fiction I like

Practical guide to Evil

Unsong ( was very interesting, great storytelling)

Worm

Savage divinity

HPMOR

PokÃ©mon origin of species 



Fiction I tried but gave up

Worth a candle ( not really into mmorpg setting now)

God's of bastards (got too meandering at some point)

I really like MOL and hence tried some Chinese and Japanese web novels which deal with the hero working hard to get power but was not able to get into them either due to poor writing or long plots or irrationality.

I am looking for preferably new book and not a fanfic as of now, but if you feel something is good please share

  For long stories that were difficult to put down for me (but without timeloops) I will mention [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/) and [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/).


  For stuff with timeloops I mostly have fanfiction.
  There is [Hard Reset](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset). Twilight Sparkle is trapped in a time loop that resets upon her death, and needs to figure out how to save the world. In the process of which she becomes utterly badass. And also dies. A lot.
  One of the sequels, [Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder), which has multiple timelooping characters in different loops at the same time. Basically, only the person who actually triggers a reset gets to remember the loop. Which leads to interesting tactical problems when facing another timelooping opponent, and information problems when working with another timelooper. After all, you never share a memory of any of the time loops, so how can you trust each other and work together? Unfortunately it's unfinished and abandoned, but still worth a read despite that.

  And then there are [The Infinite Loops](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops). Which is less of a story rather than a collection of scenes loosely connected by story lines. Timeloops galore for a variety of different canons. Mostly within their own universes, but there are crossover loops where they get stuck in different universes and/or meet people from different universes. Then most characters eventually learn how to create subspace pockets where they can store items in order to take them with them between loops. And the loops don't stop, so it leads to characters with millennia of experience and equipment from a wide range of fictional universes... needless to say they tend to end up hilariously overpowered.

  If you want an addictive adventure type of novel with a smart protagonist, I recommend The Vorkosigan Saga. It's a series about a hyper intelligent guy with severe physical limitations, and how he uses his cleverness to get around those limitations. If you read HPMOR, you'll have seen several quotes from these novels, a particularly good one is: "The key of strategy is not to choose a path to victory, but to choose so that **all paths** lead to a victory."

  You should start with [The Warrior's Apprentice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61906.The_Warrior_s_Apprentice). It's not the first novel (chronologically), but it is the first novel with Miles Vorkosigan as the main character.  After that read The Vor Game, and if you're hooked follow [the chronological order](https://www.goodreads.com/series/98254-vorkosigan-saga-chronological). Skip the short/side stories and the prequel books until later, IMO.

  Have you tried anything from [qntm](https://qntm.org/fiction)? Fine Structure and Ra are the longest and the most well known but I like his other writing as well. Check out Ed Stories particularly for time travel stuff. He also writes on [SCP](http://www.scp-wiki.net/qntm-s-author-page).

    I just read Ed stories now, and while the science is clearly magic \(unrealistic\), the story was a blast to read. At the beginning it appears like a confusing attempt at wish\-fulfilment, but as the story progresses the quality picks up and it retroactively smooths over the bumps. Far from rationalist, but it clearly doesn't try to be and it is quite fun and interesting regardless. Thanks for the recommendation.

  Time Braid is a fancfic but may otherwise fit your specifications. If you haven't read it, All You Need Is Kill is a time loop narrative, they recently made a big-budget movie out of it.

    Note that Time Braid is rather NSFW.

    Wasn't Edge if tomorrow based on it ?

      Yes, The book is obviously much better.

  Not sure that I can help; I haven't read the majority of that list, and Worm I just didn't enjoy (read about half, it wasn't becoming more enjoyable, gave up).

  u/alexanderwales has written a lot of good stuff IMO, but you didn't like WtC, so...maybe not your thing?

  If you haven't already, it's worth taking a look at the recursive HPMoR fanfics. My personal favorites are Following the Phoenix and Significant Digits, but you quite possibly have different tastes, so...maybe Draco Malfoy and the Practice of Rationality?

  Oh, and since the stories you like seem a bit darker than mine - Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time was a somewhat interesting time loop.

  If you like MOL, you should try other novels about gifted and diligent students:

  1. "The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss
  2. [The Good Student](http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student) by mooderino.
  3. And

  >hence tried some Chinese and Japanese web novels which deal with the  hero working hard to get power but was not able to get into them either  due to poor writing or long plots or irrationality

  Still try [Way of Choices](http://gravitytales.com/novel/way-of-choices/). It have long plot, but still it *have* plot, and it isn't dumb. It's the only Chinese webnovel worth reading, I think.
