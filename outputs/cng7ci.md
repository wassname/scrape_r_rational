  The Contingency is *delightful.* All hail Ingenium 2: Ethical Boogaloo.

  Haley's exposition dump here breaks the rules so *good.* She's simultaneously using best practices for organizational security (compartmentalization, least privilege, backups, disaster recovery and continuity planning) and being genre savvy/aware of narrative causality. By taking herself out of the hero archetype and refusing to escalate she steps out of the Concept's line of fire and gets the opportunity to build the seeds of victory with an Unspoken Plan Guarantee. 

  It's okay if Yoda can pull an X-Wing out of a swamp with the Force: he's dying and he's not going to be the one fighting Vader. 
  Similarly, it's ok if Contingency builds an ethical wish engine and solves death. They're not going to take on the Concept head-on, or curbstomp the Efreet. They're getting the stats of Pathfinder's gods and putting them to their best use, narratively and practically.

  I said they were going to need a miracle. Well, Haley built one! And it involves small furry animals!

  I didn't really follow the D&D specific stuff, but if I understand correctly the Haleys think that threats escalating in response to a protagonist's power level is a kind of law of nature in the narrative universes, so directly intervening is counterproductive, as it just summons bigger threats. If this applies to anyone acting as a "character" it does seem to entail that any kind of victory is impossible, as any success generates a threat in repsonse
