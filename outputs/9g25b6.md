## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You live in a world where 10% have the power to use telekinesis.

  But they can only effect there own ~~magic particles~~ ectoplasm. They can also transmute the ectoplasm into fake material. It reverts slowly back.  
  And there are some ways to block the telekinesis. (Like with distance, a thick layer of someone elses ectoplasm, and probably other stuff)Speed (and acceleration) of telekinesis is limited to a human punch (\~30km/h or\~20mph) (but you could transmute a bow and shoot an ectoplasm arrow faster)  
  And the temperature is always that of the surrounding (but you could build a freezer).  
  The energy you give the environment comes out of your body (produced by your mitochondria). So no free energy.  
  Also, that is still true: " When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body  simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in  direction on the first body. "

  &#x200B;

  Also to prevent chemistry shenanigans, no (solid) particles smaller than

  * They have only a limited amount of ectoplasm. Like weak magic user have 1kg, the strongest have 1000kg of that stuff.
  * Ectoplasm can temporally simulate solid, liquid or gaseous matter. Like a (steel) sword, water or helium. Some can hold that state for 1min other for 1000min (16,6h). It is harder to control liquid and gases. By a factor of 10 (liquid) and 100 (gases)
  * Some have a telekinetic range from 1m other 1000m (1km). (They can't effect ectoplasm outside of there range.) You have a vague sense where your ectoplasm is, but you want to see it, if you want to control it with any skill.
  * Some can produce a force of 10 Newton other the force of 10000Newton [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders\_of\_magnitude\_(force)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(force)) (without the mass of there own ectoplasm or it's speed included) So one could have a coin of ectoplasm and another a bolder and both could have the same carry capacity.
  * Some can move one solid object, liquid blob or cloud, others can move up to 100.

  Normally that all depends on talent and training, but for your min/maxing you can use 1000 points. You also start with 1 point in every category (so you have 1005 points). That means you can have 1kg ectoplasm, you can transmute for 1 min, in a distance of 1m, 10 Newtons and 0,1 objects. (0.1 objects means you can use one object with 10% of the ectoplasm you have. 1.3 Objects means you can control 2 objects, but one can only have 30% of your ectoplasm reservoir. And it becomes irrelevant at 9.1 objects.)

  The object rules/points may change. Keep in mind, a crossbow is made of different parts, which would be counted as different objects.

  So, what would you do, if you got transported (without any objects or devices) or reincarnated in a fantasy world with a tech level of the renaissance (\~15.-16. century), where 10% have ectoplasm and monsters like goblins and dragons exist. You have all the knowledge you can google now.\^\^

  Or what cool stuff should people there be able to do?

  How would you fight/built your powers in a death tournament against single opponents?

  And how if you had to fight against armies without ectoplasm?

  EDIT: formating

  Edit2: 
  I forgot to mention how ectoplasm works untransmuted:
  It acts like ghosts, can't touch, nearly no interaction, can't see someone elses (just a vague sense that it is there and maybe where, if you have the sixth sense) can go through walls 
  It still has mass for the purpose of acceleration (with telekinesis) , but you can't weight something down. 
  You can store and hide all your ectoplasm inside your body (even if it should have a higher volume than your body)
  And if you transmute it in a place where already matter is (like air or water or maybe loose sand, the ectoplasm pushes the material there away with a really small force. Even loose sand is nearly too much to push away.

    As in, infinite thermoconductivity? Does this apply to pure ectoplasm as well as transmuted, fake materials? So if you place a rod of it between two rooms with a difference in temperature, they'll equalize much faster than normal?

    &#x200B;

    For offensive applications, my first thought was to gather a lot of gaseous ectoplasm in the air, then collapse it to a solid in an enemy's throat. What defenses are there against this?

    &#x200B;

    And speaking of the application of Newton's third law, if you make an ectoplasm fist and punch a wall, does it feel like you punched said wall with your actual hands, or does your fake hand just recoil and possibly take damage/break as though it received it?

      Well, if the enemy has his own ectoplasm, he can keep a thick layer of it around himself to prevent you from inserting your ectoplasm into his body. Or just stay out of your attack range, seeing as you needed to invest a lot of points into making your ectoplasmic gas last longer than 0.01min instead of range.

      At the point of creation it has the temperature of its surrounding. If you make a rod inside a hole in a wall, it would be like if you put a rod into it with a temperature  between the temperature of those rooms.

      >

      You can't transmute from one state into another. (Well you could cool it under the freezing point with normal physics) llYou would need to go back into ectoplasm. BUT you wouldn't need the gaseous state. You could just transmute ectoplasm inside the throat into some solid (since you are in range anyway). But that would be hard to aim if you cannot see inside the throat. Easier to just throw an ectoplasm knife into him.

      Still you risk losing your ectoplasm, since your opponent could bubble yours with his. 

      A technique to counter this would be to always walk in a bubble of ectoplasm, if you can. 

      Still gas is a good way to kill non-mages (aka canon foddet). If you have the range, mass and time needed to suffocate someone (or poison if you can make it). Some ways around the limits I can think off.

      Counter strategy: Have mages catch the gas inside bubbles until opponent is out of ectoplasm. 

      I forgot to mention how ectoplasm works untransmuted:
      It acts like ghosts, can't touch, nearly no interaction, can't see someone elses (just a vague sense that it is there and maybe where, if you have the sixth sense) can go through walls

      And if you transmute it in a place where already matter is (like air or water or maybe loose sand, the ectoplasm pushes the material there away with a really small force. Even loose sand is nearly too much to push away. 

      I will add it above.

      >does it feel like you punched said wall with your actual hands, or does your fake hand just recoil and possibly take damage/break as though it received it?

      You don't really "punch". It would be like throwing a baseball. The thrower only has the opposing force of the throw. The ball get's the force/damage. 
      Since you have a maximum of force you can apply with your telekinesis, that is the maximum of force that will hit your body. So it shouldn't matter if you accelerate a fist (to the max speed of 30kmh) or hit/push with that fist a wall.  I think the force hits your whole body (or parts of every living cell of your body). It doesn't just hit your brain or liver or your (not existing) mana chacras.

      I think you would have some kind of feedback. But it wouldn't feel like pain or be very accurate.

    Say I invest enough points to move 5 solid objects. Can I still create 100 solid objects at the same time, and move 5 of them around to hit the others and get them all moving? For example, can I create 5 bows and have each fire 19 arrows at the same time?

    I'm not sure I understand what this means. Suppose I go to an active volcano and create a hollow solid sphere of ectoplasm within the lava. Is this sphere as hot as the lava? Now let's say I lift up his sphere full of lava into the air. Does the ectoplasmic shell instantly become air temperature? Does it stay hot because of the lava inside?  Or does it just lose heat as any ordinary object would? In other words, is there any way for me to carry a ball of hot lava around with me wherever I go?

    &#x200B;

    \>  Or what cool stuff should people there be able to do? 

    &#x200B;

    Can you create explosions? First, create an empty airtight solid container out of ectoplasm. Then endlessly insert ectoplasm into the container and make it become a gas. Eventually the air pressure will become too much and the container will explode. (To avoid hurting yourself, make the side of the container facing you much much thicker, so the explosion bursts out the other side.) If you can do this fast enough, you basically have an endless supply of grenades. For added lethality, add tiny hard balls or spikes to your container to make a frag grenade.

      >How long does it take to recharge though? Can I just create a gas for 0.01min repeatedly, over and over?

      Hmm... I edited my first post after you posted. The ectoplasm transmuting into gas would push the air away with a force (no number given cause i don't want to calculate). It would be like if you open a valve of a container that is under constant pressure (not much pressure) and you close it after your ectoplasm limit is reached . There are formulars to calculate how much volume goes out per second. 

      Back to your question, you could but the work you do by pushing away air comes from your body. And the Volume/mass you create is limited by that. You don't create your whole reservoir instantly

      But just write what you would do if it recharges fast. (Lava ball?)

      >Suppose I go to an active volcano and create a hollow solid sphere of ectoplasm within the lava. Is this sphere as hot as the lava? Now let's say I lift up his sphere full of lava into the air.

      You probably couldn't push the lava away.
      But in the air above the lava creating a sphere with a hole (as hot as the air in a volcano) . Now you move it in the lava with telekinesis and fill it up and close it. 
      The sphere acts from the moment you create it like a ordinary object (you can move with telekinesis). You would need to use material that doesn't melt (like some ceramics) and it still would lose heat over time.

      But let's say you can have a ball of lava with you (with some handicaps). The limiting factor for size would probably be the force. And how long you can maintain the sphere would depend on your concentration (if you constantly recreate it)

      >Can you create explosions?

      Yes, but... Energy comes from your body, you would need at least two objects (sphere + gas) and each metal shrapnel would be an object (of course doesn't count to your object limit if you don't telemove it) but you can't generate more than your object stat at the same time. Also still limited by maximum volume/second.So it wouldn't be that fast.


      >Eventually the air pressure will become too much and the container will explode. 

      Also the pressure inside can't be bigger than the your creation pressure (everyone has the same)

      You could put the sphere in a cold place and make a liquid that is liquid at that temperature and a gas at room temperature. Just less controll

      Or just make a chemical explosive. Just keep in mind, that your body produces that used energy. (So you could starve by throwing granates) And chemical explosives waste so much heat... i think... but I also heard sugar has more calories than some explosives.
      ```

        \> But just write what you would do if it recharges fast. (Lava ball?) 

        &#x200B;

        If it recharges fast enough you basically have infinite duration (possibly by creating the objects in shifts). So you could build more or less permanent ectoplasmic structures (within a certain range of yourself). So with enough points in range and strength, you could build a literal fortress around yourself, and move it around slowly as you iteratively destroy and recreate parts further forward.

        &#x200B;

        \>  Also the pressure inside can't be bigger than the your creation pressure (everyone has the same) 

        &#x200B;

        What exactly does this mean? If I slowly increase the pressure until it exceeds the creation pressure, what exactly happens? Does the container explode since it can't withstand the pressure? This is what I would expect and works great for making grenades. Or does the whole thing just disappear with no explosion?

        &#x200B;

        If creating too much pressure doesn't work, how about creating anti-grenades? Start by creating a large object, then create another object that is an airtight shell around the first object. Disintegrate the first object, leaving behind a vacuum that causes the second object to implode. (If creation pressure is a problem, use an actual solid rather than ectoplasm for the second object. E.g. Pour molten iron over your first object until it solidifies as a shell. It would mean that you need to prepare your anti-grenades beforehand though.)

        &#x200B;

        \> You would need to use material that doesn't melt (like some ceramics) and it still would lose heat over time. 

        &#x200B;

        Heat loss could be slowed by using two layers of ectoplasm with a vacuum in between, like a [vacuum flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_flask). As for material, just use tungsten. 

        &#x200B;

        Wait, hold on. You can CHOOSE the material? Can you create radioactive materials, like a huge chunk of uranium that would instantly go nuclear? Or worse, a chunk of neutrons like that of a neutron star, which would explode out far more violently. I mean, it would kill you the moment you created it, but a kill everyone button has its uses.

    A big bottleneck in uplift fiction is that a lot of modern tech takes precision equipment to manufacture. 

    Ectoplasm solves this really nicely.  Create an ectoplasm copy of an object.  Wrap it in an ectoplasm mold.  Dismiss object 1.  Fill mold with metal.

    Then, I'd use that to make radios.  Once I have radios, I can use fast communication to arbitrage the hell out of whatever commodity markets I can find.

    I wouldn't let it be known that radio exists.  Instead, I'd use my new wealth to set up wired communication lines,and imply that they were my trick to pass messages so quickly.  (See: Barbed Wire Telephone) 

    Then, I'd use my advantage at machining stuff to make rifles. 

    Then, you have goblin bands up against rifle infantry units, where the rifle infantry gets instant communications.

    How much focus does it need to maintain and move it about?

    &#x200B;

    Does this mean I can have flight from the start at 30km/h for as long as my build allows? With just a thread / leather band around my torso, and enough force to make myself float?

    &#x200B;

    Or I could just fly like mistborn mages 'fly' make a coin and push it into the ground, with enough force it should push me away from it, controlling angles and starting momentum you could fly faster this way. You could land with simple a simple controlled belt around your waist. You can just pull the coin back from the air, because of it's low mass it wouldn't slow you down.

    &#x200B;

    You could easily throw things by tying them with a magic rubber band and flinging that around, including people. This means you could remote control things that already exist by just gluing it to your ectoplasm.

    &#x200B;

    30km/h is actually enough force to punch holes through people with sharp objects. So I guess flying small spikes that you can control remotely, even with a range of just 20m you could basically defeat most humans with that.

    &#x200B;

    Force shields for defense.

    &#x200B;

    You could manually make the poisonous gas, put it inside a telekinesis canister with high pressure, remote gas bombs.  There's some really silly things you could do to pressurize things with this power, just make a balloon fill it with any gas you want, than contract it with your power..

    &#x200B;

    I guess you could breath underwater with oxygen bubbles (you don't need to make the oxygen just the container) and swim at 30km/h with a telekinetic belt or faster with a bit more thinking.

    &#x200B;

    You could make strings and control people like puppets.

    &#x200B;

    Transmute your power inside a fire... Including things like flammables and explosives.

    &#x200B;

    Other than that I guess the obvious, manually build / pay people to build: Steam engines, factories, electric power plants, full plate armor, rifles, cars, artillery, tanks, gas masks, antibiotics, planes, bombs, machineguns... If you had some better understanding of electronics you could have pretty much anything modern manufactured for you, I don't though.

    I also assume I can only swap once with the same person. Or is it once at all? If I can only swap once at all, I would research some years a person so I can make the most of it.

    Swap bodies with president or king... at important meetings. Maybe discredit politicians with opposing political goals. Like go with the body of an anti-gay rights politician into a gay location 2 days before a bill about gay marriage or something. Or make a (gay) sex video with that body.  


    Small scale goal:  
    Get money by swapping with a rich guy and buy expensive (untraceable) stuff like jewellery or gold and hide it in some park. And then come back with my own body. Or sign a (prepared) contract to give away all the money to my body. Use that money for small scale goal.  
    Personal goals (like being popular, destroy bullies, get your crush...) Use other people's body to make yourself look good and your enemies bad. Or swap with the boy/girl friend of your crush and break up with him/her/it.  


    Good stuff you could do:   
    Basically everything above just with ethical rules and altruistic goals (use money for charity...)  
    Fight crime, by switching bodies with criminal. Wearing a wire with the body of some criminal or there associates. Confessing in the body of some criminal or doing a crime so the person gets arrested, would be too unethical for me.

    One day isn't really enough to accomplish a huge amount^(*). Even if you body swap with one of the most powerful people in the world, your goals wouldn't even be in the planning stages by the time you swapped back and they could cancel it.

    So most of the best plans involve getting power to my actual self in a plausible way that's hard to reverse.

    1. Post a manifesto about how to solve all the world's problems given enough funding, get some friends to repost it various places so it's at least faux-viral. It doesn't actually need to be a working, or even particularly good, plan, though I'd do my best.

    2. Set up a video queue of documentaries on world wealth inequality, climate change, that sort of thing. (I don't expect this to help much but it's free so whatever.) Place the monitor in a dark room with no distinguishing features.

    3. Tie myself up in the dark room, watching the monitor. Have a friend around who's agreed to untie me after a day. 

    4. Body swap with someone rich and evil who speaks a language I know, like Rupert Murdoch or a Koch brother.

    5. Notice my manifesto on the internet. Be moved to tears by it.

    6. Start asking my advisers to figure out how much money I can get into the hands of the manifesto-writer immediately.

    7. Chat online with myself for a while then arrange a bank transfer to myself.

    8. Spend whatever remaining time I have talking about how much better the world will be now that we're following the plan to whoever will listen. (That is, raise the social cost of going back as much as possible.)

    9. Write a note to myself explaining what I did with my day, then lock my bedroom door and go to bed alone even if whoever I am doesn't normally. (I'm rich and powerful and spent a whole day acting weird so I don't expect this to be hard to convince anyone of.)

    10. Post swapping back, start visibly but anonymously following the plan.

    This is all assuming it's a one-time thing. If it's repeatable you can do most of the tricks that have been proposed for munhkinning Death Note with a little bit of finesse.

    ^(*) Unless your goal is just raw destruction, which unfortunately our world is much more ready to begin at the drop of a hat.

    Assuming you can direct who it goes to:

    1. Self-assassination through drinking slow acting poisons near the end of the day.
    2. Transferring wealth or shorting stocks.
    3. Terrorism. 
    4. Social gaffes or obvious lawbreaking to discredit enemies.
    5. Handshake deals that would cost another person credibility to back out of.
    6. Award show speeches to raise awareness of minute issues.
    7. Large public donations or pledges that are hard to back out of.
    8. Assembling blackmail material.

    It would be really, really easy to do.
