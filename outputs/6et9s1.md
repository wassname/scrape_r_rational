  While I have scrolled through most of the fucking, I must say that the chapter has the best title. The Thing strikes just the right balance of erotic and horrifying for me.

  For those thinking "not ratfic enough", check back in a couple of chapters when we start getting into the theory-of-mind stuff.

    Ok, you know what?  Removed.  Sorry.  Two grounds here:

    * No obvious rationality or rational content.

    * Very difficult to read.

    It's not exactly good writing, or good rational writing, to make me read from the first-person perspective of extremely sexually aroused characters who aren't going to give me any description of what their lives and their worlds are, what they look like, what their goals are (besides the sex), etc.

      I find this a very sad use of censorship.

        Well sorry, but fiction needs to be comprehensible.

    Your [table of contents](http://sadehall.tumblr.com/contents.html) lists all of the third major division of this story as "III: Chapter One." So by "a couple of chapters" do you mean "a couple of eight-segment things" - such that we might get to the theory of mind stuff sometime in late September / early October, and after another ~200k words (taking your most recent chapter length as typical)?

      Sorry, that is kind of confusing. I'm referring to the 10k-word smaller segments, and the present section title is a metafictional reference. So think more like a month or so.

    Maybe ease up on posting until then?

      If the score of this comment or a (more) direct imperative from a mod indicates so, I will.

        The official guideline is to post your own content at most weekly; personally I feel it's better to error on the side of letting others post it for you. 

        That's me as a member of the community though, not as a mod, so use your own judgement.

    ```
    Right, ok, I'm clicking through this link.  Be right back.  Might need brain-bleach.
