## [Q] Can anyone think of any good examples of rationalist films?

### Post:

Having been thinking about the desolation of Smaug film again recently, and thinking about just how incredibly stupid the majority of the characters seem to act, can anyone point me in the direction of some good-quality films that serve as great examples of rationalist fiction?

  My list from last time:

  * *Primer* - two engineers invent a time machine
  * *The Man From Earth* - a college professor claims to be immortal at a going away party
  * *Limitless* - a man finds a drug that makes him smarter
  * *The Prestige* - duelling stage magicians, but fails the Idiot Ball test
  * *Moneyball* - a stats geek baseball manager uses stats to build a better team

  *Limitless* is sort of borderline, but I give it points because it's one of the few pieces of fiction that doesn't present enhanced intelligence as some terrible thing - there's no [Cave Man Science Fiction](http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/) going on.

  The biggest thing that films tend to fail on is the protagonist. The film can be a puzzle that you can figure out, but so often the protagonist just does the dumbest, most boneheaded things, or reacts in some animal or emotional way that's really *really* not in their best interests.

  There are also probably a ton of detective/mystery movies that I'm missing here, though it's relatively rare to get one that's a fair play whodunnit in film.

    Thanks for recommending The Man From Earth, I had it on my HD for a long time and your post finally pushed me to watch it. I loved it, and I second the recommendation.

  [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1t9cqx/are_there_any_movies_or_other_media_pieces_which/) is the thread from the last time this question was asked. Use the search bar first next time.

    This is a rapidly-growing sub; Periodic reposts are probably healthy and expose a lot of new people to things they would not otherwise have seen. Posts like this one that solicit information will benefit even more from occasional reposts.

    Man, I was about to make a list, only to realize that I already did it last time.

    But surely we can ask this question again? I thought this sub was also about discussion and not purely about listing works of rational fiction.

      Of course, but it always helps to keep the past discussions on hand for reference.

        The tone of your first comment comes across as dismissive of OP. I'm going to assume you were attempting to be helpful, but I would recommend you remember that text based communication channels will tend to be read in a negative light, despite the intentions of the writer. 

        Edit: Words are hard, mmmKay

    Cheers, sorry. Spur of the moment thing.
