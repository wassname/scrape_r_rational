  * there's so little fanart of worth the candle!! I had to rectify this
  * the backpack is anachronistic, since Bethel is in the background, but I thought it represented Amaryllis the best. You can always just pretend it's another backpack.
  * similarly, I don't think bethel ever set up in the bottle with the doe, but there's no reason she couldn't (I think)
  * spoilers latest update >!yeah, so I don't have raven, who only became confirmed companion this last update, but in fairness, she shouldn't be in the same as scene as fenn!<
  * I wasn't sure if solace still has her cloak and staff, but they were fun to draw
  * the doe is irritating juniper, as always

  i liked the style. reminded me of â€˜90s kids adventure video games, which is sort of appropriate

  What kind of resolution is that? Might be a bit overkill if it takes 2 min to load.

    2000 x 1545. It's quite big, but if it takes more than a second or two you should check your router hasn't been replaced by a potato.

    Or you're on mobile, but then your complaint doesn't makes sense anyway.

      I don't know what the issue was, but earlier it refused to load. Might have been reddit, might have been my connection. No way to tell now.
