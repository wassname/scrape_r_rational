  Oh, good. Hellsport is not a metaphor. It's the port that hell owns. Sounds like a lovely place. Undocumented visitors can be killed for looking at people funny, and you count as undocumented if you left it in your other pants. Lovely town.

  So, if you don't have a tag you're not protected by the laws of the city. And Athos shouldn't have got a tag because he's there as a non-sapient (all in the name of saving a few bucks).

  I bet this is a Chekhov's gun waiting to be fired. With Eugene using this fact to attack / blackmail Athos?

    As Marcus's mount / pet he's protected under the property laws.  Also, >!he can't be challenged to a duel the way Marcus can!<, so there's pros and cons both ways.
