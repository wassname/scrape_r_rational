  And today, class, we've discovered a problem with decoupled tiny economies with high demand products connecting with huge economies with many people willing to take advantage of that high demand. 

  I suspect the galleon exchange rate is about to take a nosedive.

    There's actually a flaw in my math here that makes it even worse than it seemed. It says 'million' when it should say 'hundred thousand'. Hazards of not getting to do my usual Saturday edit.

  ```
  I love how the Phoenix was just like "Okay, enough! I got this, fool!"

  [edit] Good luck with your computer!

    Thanks! I'm glad that was amusing outside my head.

  HOLY SHIT HERMIONE, DON'T DO THAT TO YOURSELF.

    ...oh yeah, she's not an immortal troll-unicorn-human chimera* in this fic, vacuum can hurt her.

      ```
      Yep.

  My computer is crashing every 10-15 minutes, so I'm posting this a day early before handing my baby over to people I've never met before who claim they can make it better.  Enjoy.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Best of luck. For whatever it's worth, you and your baby are in my thoughts.
    ```

- u/haeri:
  ```
  An error I haven't seen pointed out: Erd√∂s was still alive in 1992, so no need to use the resurrection stone to get a 1.

  Enjoying the fic so far.
