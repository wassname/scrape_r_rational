  Hanno calling Cat Black and being her equal and counterpart/opposite is going to have Consequences.

    well she is the "Black queen", while it's not her name it pretty much just as well could be.

  I don't think Cat will talk to Stalwart Apostle, but I really want someone to. An interlude from her perspective where the White Knight or the Grey Pilgrim explains what happened with the Scorched Apostate would be fantastic.

  It would be an interesting viewpoint. She could think about she had done, and either accept or question her decision. Also, I would like the perspective of a young and scared hero just being utterly terrified of the Black Queen. And I'm assuming that she is, because of how everyone else has been reacting.

  One thing that hasn't come up yet, and I wonder if it will, is how long did Pascale (Stalwart Apostle) spend praying, compared to how much time she had? If she spent 10 minutes when she had a day, suddenly most of Cat's verbalized objections fall flat. I expect that wasn't the case, because that would make for a much less interesting story, but we don't actually know.

  For my last thought, prayer is a form of meditation. Trying to meditate and clear your head before making a decision when confronted with a seemingly insurmountable problem isn't the worst idea.

  I think part of what I admittedly like about Cat as a character is the acknowledgement of both Scorched's humanity as a boy who honestly deserved better in so many ways, but also the colder military uses that he could have contributed. Also love the fact that she's upfront about Stalwart's lesser value to her both as a named asset and also as her being no more deserving of life than Scorched. Like its totally more than a little petty, but its also something that I cam super empathize with.

    She's right tho. Apostle did "nothing" and so *should* have died. Apostate made a tough decision and paid the price and he died in his sleep with only Cat around to mourn him.

    And White is right too. There are rules, and the rules say that praying little girls are invulnerable to damage and disfigured sorcerers can't rest for even a moment. There are rules, Cat.

      > praying little girls are invulnerable to damage 

      Are they, though?

      I mean, if nothing else, book 4's prologue showed us that believing in yourself and having faith in a higher cause really, really doesn't keep you from ending in a shallow grave with the last 20 idiots who tried the exact same thing.

      The Hedge Wizard went against Warlock, with no plan besides "murder him until he dies", and at a disadvantage of 20 years of experience. And despite that she was absolutely pissed about her sister's death and desperately wanted to avenge her, she got a spear through the skull for her troubles.

      If all it took for the heroes to win was to be really motivated about it, the Dead King wouldn't be a problem.

        ```
        Fights between named are always a tossup, though there is more weight on the side of Heroes than Villains of course. It wouldn't be much of a story, though, if it was never possible for a Villain to defeat a Hero, and so that is always possible.

        But Apostle wasn't facing down a Villain. She was facing down a horde of powerful, but still ultimately mundane, zombies. It's already been established that Named can scythe through arbitrary numbers of mundanes with near-impunity, and so her ability to do so is unsurprising.
        ```

  I actually really like this update, mostly in the way it surprised me.

  Previously, "Good" was established to be rather harsh and uncaring.  Mind you, we mostly see it from the Villain PoV, but what they have complained about has made a lot of sense.

  Until now.

  Now we learn that Above is actually *limited* in their power, and not just bound by arbitrary rules.  They are far from omnipotent, and instead seem to have only a set amount of power that they can use at a time, and have to scrimp and save it for the right moment.

  *This* is why only one out of a thousand or ten thousand or whatever people who pray for salvation are Blessed/Chosen.  It's not just a 'balance' being kept where they don't want Below to get a champion, it's because they don't have the mojo to appoint Heroes willy-nilly.

  Cat sort of skipped over this in her angry rant, but it's rather important to go back and look at our own views toward the other side.

  Above isn't deaf to the prayers of the oppressed.  It isn't coldly obeying some sort of specific rules in order to deny their opponents in some weird zero-sum prisoner's dilemma.  It just has to be very careful with whom it invests in power, and thus it is understandably rather cautious when it comes to spending it.

  **TLDR**:  Above aren't assholes with choosing Heroes; Above is **weak** and lacks the power to uplift everyone who asks or meets the criteria.
