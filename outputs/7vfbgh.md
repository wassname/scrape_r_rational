## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

    I'm not 100% sure about this but if I had to give a simple definition of rationality it would be the  realization that you are one of the problems that must be solved and the art of solving it. This would imply the most important techniques is how to apply evaluations to yourself and the things you care about consistently. If you learn how to flawlessly identify problems but you only identify them in the beliefs you dislike and other people then you are now worse off. Please be aware I am not very good at this sort of thing and I might be wrong.

      Uh oh, that kind of sounds like the average cult philosophy.

    That intuition and heuristics are still very useful and rational techniques have a relatively narrow scope they can really be used in, but can help make some very good decisions with in that scope.
