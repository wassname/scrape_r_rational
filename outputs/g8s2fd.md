## The Chosen One is Dead

### Post:

Anyone know of any good rational stories (fanfic or original) where the archetypical hero meant to save everyone is Dead and the characters are forced to come up with inventive solutions to solve their problem?

  Not quite Rational, but there's a substantial crossover in fanbases. Mistborn, by Brandon Sanderson, explores something similar but with more layers.

    Mistborn was the first thing I thought of as well. I would say it's rational though, everything fits together really well and the characters are intelligent, their motivation are understandable and believable  and their actions logical (from the reader's point of view) and they solve problems instead of having the answer handed to them.
    ```

      Agreed on these! It is very rational, especially the magic system. If you are expecting a capital-R Rational fic, it isn't quite that (which is not a bad thing)
      ```

      - u/Roneitis:
        ```
        I've heard the distinction rational (rational characters, world, plot), and rationalist (explicitly grappling with rationalism and themes of human thought).
        ```

        - u/derefr:
          ```
          Rational work: the writer has a rationalist skillset, and is using it to ensure the story stands up to analysis by other rationalists.

          Rationalist work: one of the characters is explicitly a rationalist.
          ```

          - u/Roneitis:

            Ehh, I'd disagree that the author needs to explicitly identify as, or function under an explicitly rationalist sorta mindset. There are rational works that don't come out of this subset of society. Not a huge number, mind, but they definitely exist.
            ```

            - u/derefr:
              ```
              Skillset, not mindset. You can learn the skills of rationality from anywhere, under any number of names.
              ```

  Pretty big spoiler obviously but it happens in >!Un Lun Dun by China Mievelle, which I very highly recommend. It isn't in any sense rational, but (like pretty much all his stuff) its great.!<

  It also just randomly happens in for no good reason in Spy Kids 3 although it isn't quite as plot central.

    Spy kids 3 is truly the greatest piece of rational media

      It really is incredible how many major stars are in that series.

  When it comes to the Chosen One tropes, there's a lot of different [ways](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/PlayingWith/TheChosenOne) it can be played with.

  The one that fits best is probably [The Unchosen One](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne) when people step up to take the place of the chosen hero.

  My favorite one is when Hermione decided just because Harry was the hero in *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality,* it didn't mean that she couldn't also be a hero.

  [Un Lun Dun](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnLunDun) by China Miéville is another good one where the book subverts, inverts, plays with, and messes with the standard Chosen Hero chosen by prophecy in every way possible. The part that's relevant is near to the beginning where it involves the hero being injured before she can preform her first ever prophetic event, and her plucky, comedic sidekick has to step up to take over.

  It happens a lot in the Mistborn trilogy where the Chosen One trope is messed around with including shenanigans by the Big Bad, but I don't remember it too well since it's been a while since I last read it.

  There's also *How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps* coming out on April 30th which is explicitly about this trope where the hero won't be born for another 77 years, but the Demon Lord is about to conquer the world.
  ```

  **The Brightest Shadow** isn't quite that, but close. It's frankly much scarier, but saying too much about it is kind of a spoiler. 

  My own **How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps** is very close - there's a cycle of reincarnation for the Hero and the Demon King, and the protagonists are trying to defeat the Demon King before the Hero's scheduled resurrection occurs. It comes out in a few days on Audible (and it'll be free for Audible subscribers for about a week). Other formats coming later.

    Do you have a timeline for the other forms? It looks interesting, but I'm not much into audiobooks.

      I think it's six months of exclusivity, but I'll need to check with the publisher to make sure.

  I can't open royal road to give you links right now, but there are some stories I know that brush up on that trope.

  Tree Of Aeons is about a guy that gets killed on a bus with all the chosen heroes. All the kids on the bus are reincarnated into heroes to fight the demon king. He gets reincarnated into a tree. Anyways turns out the demon king invasion is a once a decade event in the new, and heroes don't always have that long of a lifespan fighting demon kings. The story has some good rational elements.

  [Arrogant young master template number 4] I can't remember this exact title. Its something like that. Anyways the MC gets reincarnated into the body of an arrogant young master in a wuxia world. Meanwhile, he has to try and find genre-bending apprentices. The story is mostly a genre parody. The MC is genre-savvy, but it doesn't really feel like rationalism.

  The movie Megamind is exactly the trope you are describing. But I don't know if I'd consider it rational in any special way. It's just a feel-good comedy in the same vein as Shrek where the supposed 'monster' ends up being a good guy.

  It's pretty old, but there's a book you might like called "Magic Kingdom for Sale: Sold".

  Basically a person buys a fantasy kingdom in a catalog for a lot of money, with a money back guarantee if it isn't really magic.  A wizard takes him there, it is.

  Nobody respects the King, because there have been like a dozen mundane world pretenders in the last few months.  There's a dragon rampaging, magical races seceding, a Demon King menacing everyone and the Chosen guy?  The Paladin?  Nowhere to be seen.

    This was a fun book, I have a paperback of it, and the guy tries fairly hard to make good decisions, handle problems, etc.

      I loved it, my boyfriend at the time loaned it to me to read when I went on a holiday with my parents about.... 12 years ago ( ^god ^i'm ^old ). I had the impression it was the first in a series and every few years when I think of it again kind of idly intend to find the rest of the series.

      Was it a series or did it never get finished? All I remember is he fell in love with this naked water nymph. 

      Wikipedia: "Magic Kingdom for Sale–Sold! is a fantasy novel by American writer Terry Brooks, the first in his Magic Kingdom of Landover." - okay wow apparently there's 6 books published and a seventh on the way. How about that.

        I did read the next couple, I think... I'm also old, it was a long time ago. They maintained roughly the same level of quality as the first one.

  [Mother of Learning](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning) is not exactly what you asked for, but still a good fit. The chosen one archetype in the story isn't dead, but is basically unable to resolve the plot despite smashing his head into it reeeaaally hard and often. it was posted here back when it was still incomplete, so you may have already read it.
  ```

  Ratchet and Clank comes to mind. He didn't die, but the guy they expected to save everyone turned out to be a fraud.

  Also, I can't help but think of Megamind, but I'm not sure that counts given that the person most unsure of what to do when the hero died was the villain. He does end up with a problem of his own making that he has to solve himself though.

  Spider-Man Into the Spider Verse has Spider-Man die near the beginning and Miles Morales has to take his place. >!Though that doesn't really count since several other Spider-Men from other universes help.!<
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    It's pretty blatant from the beginning that he's a corporate sellout, though. Like, the first time he's even mentioned to the villain, the guy bursts out laughing. He's not *actually* built up as a saviour.

  I almost forgot about it, but [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com) starts off with the hero dying and the evil empire winning and taking over the kingdom.
  ```

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  The Demon Lord's Lover is a sweet romance story about one guy from the Hero's team hooking up with the Demon Lord to end the cycle of heroes and demons. The demon lord and the guy are also both in their middle ages, and the guy is a mentor to the newest batch of heroes. 

  It's honestly really refreshing in how open and unorthodox the romance is, although it does feel rooted in the world. Basically everyone's polyamorous, and most of the main cast is polygamous, in the best possible way. The comedy's pretty well done too.

  Ooh, ooh, go watch [Mystery Men!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132347/)
