  If you need a pitch:

  One day, the effects of gravity are reversed for every human on the planet.

  One bug:

  > In the first second, they’d gone one meter. In the second second, they’d gone three meters. That meant acceleration approximated one meter per second per second, which was almost exactly equal to the force of gravity, only working in reverse.

  Earth's gravity is 9.8 m/s^2 ... 1m/s^2 would be about a tenth of a gee. That would actually be more survivable, but still fatal for anyone outside.

  Could simply be a thinko by the narrator, in a stressful situation.

  Edit: also, at 1 m/s^2 in the first second they'd go 1/2 a meter, in the second second 2 meters. s = 1/2 a t^2 ...

    That was just me screwing up math. And you're right that the math is still a little bit off even when multiplying values by ten; you don't reach 10m until 1.5 seconds and 30m until 2.5 seconds. But eh, close enough for napkin math.

  Interesting. I thought this was a repost, because I saw a story with a similar premise fairly recently.

      No, it was a whole short story based on gravity reversing... though it effected more than people but less than "everything". There was a bit with someone flying an inverted ultralight to get around, and landing on the underside of a bridge. It might have been an ebook short story collection, or maybe infinity online, if it wasn't here.

          I can accept coincidence. It's the third story with weird gravity I've read in the past year. The third had gravity turned *sideways*.

  I hope you do post future chapters in this subreddit. That was pretty neat.
