  This isn't the most amazing chapter, but I'm attempting to get back on the horse and this is a prerequisite to the next one that I actually want to write.

    I liked it! I actually had the impression the story had stopped after chapter 3, so glad to see there's more to come
    ```

      ```
      It didn't so much stop as stall. Everyone got so overpowered so fast that I was going "ah shit how can I have a satisfying resolution to this?". I subsequently figured one out but it took a while to get back into writing.

  ```
  Not as good as the other chapters... but the other chapters were absolutely brilliant, so this chapter is still well above the average for fanfics.
  ```

  Escalating escalation escalates.

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    There's really nowhere to go but up when your starting premise is "competent people get ahold of a genie"
    ```

      I mean, you could always introduce the person who originally made them make the vast majority of the rules who has been sitting around for a while.

      And I mean, if [you really want to Escalate...](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/2e6at5/respect_skitter/)
