  This story seems to be rather basic and unoriginal at its face. On the other hand the way I read it Anak seems to be rather tacked on and the name of the story doesn't make much sense to me either. Am I missing something?

    Hadn't heard of the book; I based it on the same event though (my source was just https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak)
