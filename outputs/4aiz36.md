  Shrink item is a third level spell, and can shrink up to 720,000 gp worth of gold if you're at the lowest level to cast it. It will end up only weighing about 3.6 pounds, and it will stay shrunk for days. The problem is it only works on one item. But you can probably just cast fireball or something and melt it all together.

  The best solution for a high-level party is to have the wizard or warlock cast the 8th level spell Demiplane, which opens a door to a persistent dimension that is a 30 foot cube, for a volume of 27,000 cubic feet. The demiplane can be reached again by casting demiplane if you know the contents and "nature" of the plane -- depending on DM interpretation of "nature", so long as you don't let your other wizard friends visit, it should be fairly safe. There is no limitation on the number of demiplanes you can know about and use as a bank. Each demiplane can store about 1.6 billion pieces of gold, though, so you probably won't need many of them.

  Just don't get trapped inside without any way of transporting yourself to another dimension, because even casting demiplane again from the inside will only take you to another demiplane.

  Ideally you can arrange beforehand with a trustworthy army-and-police-backed legal system that you're gonna go kill the dragon (or find the dragon, depending on what the "hard part" is) in exchange for legal rights over the gold. You get the long arm of the law backing you, and they get to collect taxes from you.
  ```

  - u/embrodski:
    ```
    The local legal system is powerless against Murder Hobos, which is why they called in Murder Hobos to solve their dragon problem in the first place. They may reduce petty theft from the locals, but this still leaves you at the mercy of other Murder Hobo parties. Or Dragons/Monsters/etc.

    Honestly once you have that much gold you need to decide if you want to continue adventuring. If so, Option 1 (and hey, in a couple years you can come back and have another adventure re-liberating the same village!). If not, hire an army with all your gold and become a new regional lord.
    ```

    - u/BlueSatyr:
      ```
      In the absence of an army-backed legal system, you can't hire an army to protect your gold with gold. The soldiers would simply take the gold they are supposed to be protecting. You'd have to very carefully build up a system of loyalty and power hierarchy and charisma from the ground up.

      A chaotic system with dangerous vagabonds makes sense, but if the local legal system is *totally* powerless against even a single murder hobo, then we've essentially found ourselves in a society without property rights.  Which I think is impossible, legal systems and property rights tend to form spontaneously in non-hunter-gatherer societies. If the murder hobos are at the top of the power hierarchy, the murder-hobos themselves would form them. 

      Hmmm.. "guilds"?

      That said, I mean... you killed the dragon, right? So you must be at least approximately as good as the dragon is at personally guarding the treasure. You've got some time to figure out what to do.
      ```

        Presuming you have at least one *magic-inclined* Murder Hobo, there are all sorts of solutions to this.

        But even if you don't, an interesting thing is that—for the *price* of 100 grunts—you can likely hire one good wizard who can set things up to protect your money from far *more* than those selfsame 100 self-interested grunts. This doesn't even require continuous employment; just some "contract work" plus a casting of Permanency. That done, you can switch to the 100 grunts as a long-term solution, knowing they won't be able to overcome the wards/compulsions/illusions/whatever.

        Either way, you want both magic *and* grunts: the magical protections you've got on your treasure might be "good enough" in some strict sense, but the main point of the grunts is actually to harry and interrupt the would-be adventurers who are trying to deconstruct or dispel your protections without triggering them. DRM works... if you never get more than a few seconds' time to look at it before someone charges at you.

        And, yes—this same thought process is exactly where all the dungeons you're raiding yourself, came from. :)

      Different incentive structures. Dragons live on gold and the occasional foraged cow and/or princess. Murder Hobos live on ale, which requires coming to town and dealing with an economy functional enough to support a brewery. Dragons don't care if the kingdom falls — they can eat moose and barbarians instead of cows and princesses if they have to. Murder Hobos do care, because if Arnö Alewright has to go back to subsistence farming, the ale will stop happening.

      No, don't do it! You're just going to ruin their economy even more!

  Use the gold as a material component to craft extremely valuable but extremely small magic items? Such as 10k gp bags of holding. 


  And splitting the hoard evenly between party members in separate bags of holding isn't that unreasonable. It's both portable and spendable that way.

  I always thought it would make a lot of sense for dragons to be bankers themselves.

  One rational dragon who wants lots of metal to sleep on could do worse then to effectively act as vaults/banks.

  Make deposits and get a nice credit note.

  If some one tries to forge the notes then they get angry dragons and so on.
  ```

  - u/Aabcehmu112358:
    ```
    One of my favorite on-and-off supported theories is that dragons require precious metals, gems, and other things that are connected to wealth (as considered by magic) in order to begin a metamorphosis, transforming into lesser divinities, like some of the smaller gods in the draconic pantheon.
    ```

- u/trifith:
  ```
  Don't forget the inflation effects.

  A massive increase in the local or regional money supply from the dishoarding of a dragon will raise prices across the board. Oh, you want a room at the inn? That will be 1000 gp. A meal is another 500. 

  Why? There's suddenly a lot more money chasing the same number of goods.

  **tl;dr:**

  *Situation:* You (a party of adventurers) have just killed a dragon that was menacing a nearby village, and are now in possession of its hoard.  
  *Problem:* You need to move that treasure to a shop (far away from this small village) in order to buy anything with it--but a dragon's hoard consists, not of value-dense, easily-portable magic items and art pieces, but of heavy gold coins, since a dragon wants money it can sleep on, not money it can spend. The coinage necessary to buy a magic item may weigh more than an entire party member!

  ---

  *Solution 1:* Take all the coins that you can carry and walk away.  
  *Problem:* This small portion of the dragon's hoard may not be commensurate in value with the effort that you expended in killing the dragon. Also, many other people, both good and evil, will eventually learn of this abandoned treasure and rush to claim it, putting in danger the village that you just saved from the dragon.

  *Solution 2:* Rent or buy magic items ([Portable Hole](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#portableHole), [Bag of Holding](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#bagofHolding), [Handy Haversack](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#handyHaversack)) to carry the gold.  
  *Problem:* Renting may be exorbitantly expensive. A Portable Hole can hold the entire hoard--but a rogue party member can steal it easily. A Bag of Holding or Handy Haversack is only a temporary measure--you must have cleared out and secured another dungeon as a depository location beforehand, and that brings with it all the problems of Solution 4 (see below).

  *Solution 3:* Hire goblins or dwarves to transport the gold through the ground to a depository location.  
  *Problem:* Setting up the contract takes time, during which you must guard the hoard. The contractors may charge exorbitant fees, or steal some of the gold as they transport it, or tell other people about your depository location. You must have set up the depository location beforehand (see Solution 4).

  *Solution 4:* Secure the dragon's lair and make it your permanent depository location.  
  *Problem:* You don't want to be tied to a single location that must be guarded. You're a party of adventurers, not a party of dungeon keepers! Also, what happens if you kill *another* dragon?

  *Solution 5:* Call in a large bank and give the hoard to it in exchange for an equivalent amount of credit on its books.  
  *Problem:* The bank can now make demands on you, holding over you the threat of confiscating your credit.

    What do you need this gold for exactly? Either you intend to spend it on somewhat lighter weapons/materials/artifacts... or what?

    If you plan on spending it then any temporary solution like the BoH one should work fine. And buying the bag would let you use it on the next horde too.

    If you plan on hoarding it longterm... Well I wouldn't, I'd certainly at least invest it in something, even if that means letting a country borrow it with interest, or starting your own city (possibly on top of the horde). Of course you could get betrayed by whoever you let borrow it, but hey, you're adventurers. Betrayal is just another plot hook, and frankly its their loss if they're dumb enough to double cross dragon slayers.

    >A Portable Hole can hold the entire hoard--but a rogue party member can steal it easily.

    That's not a problem specific to portable holes; it's a problem with any easy-to-carry form of treasure.  If you've excluded all solutions that make the treasure easy to carry, of course you're not going to be able to carry it.

    >Solution 4: Secure the dragon's lair and make it your permanent depository location.
    >Problem: You don't want to be tied to a single location that must be guarded. You're a party of adventurers, not a party of dungeon keepers! 

    While making it your *permanent* depository location is bad for this reason, you can make it your temporary depository for long enough that the other solutions which involve time can be implemented.

    >The bank can now make demands on you, holding over you the threat of confiscating your credit.

    If you're powerful enough to kill the dragon, and if the bank was not powerful enough to kill the dragon, then you're powerful enough to force the bank to let you have the credit and not confiscate it.

  How much magic is being allowed? Because this article brings in text from the rulebooks.

  Bringing in text from the rulebooks is a mistake.

  Wishes exist. Rings of Three Wishes exist. Wishes can be used to create magic items worth up to 15,000 gold pieces, which includes Rings of Three Wishes.

  Having an infinite supply of anything is awkward in economics, but an infinite supply of wishes is especially nasty, since wishes are inherently transferable to a large assortment of other form.
  ```

  - u/JaceyLessThan3:
    ```
    This of course is dependent on the rule system -- in D&D 5e, the ruleset most cited in the article, wishes cannot create magic items, and using a wish to do anything but replicate the effects of another spell has a 1/3 chance of leaving you permanently unable to use the wish spell.
    ```

      So it does! I had mistakenly assumed that it was referring the 3.5 srd, based on the footnotes.

  First Adventurer's Bank, now open for business!

  Come see us at the old Dragon Cave!

  Live 'on' the hoard.  It was good enough for the dragon.  If you had the magical and physical oomph to kill a dragon, you should be able to turn the cave into a reasonable keep with some effort.  Hire dwarves to do the work after you set up security measures.

  Once you have everything all nice and organized, if you want to move somewhere else, build a new place first, THEN move your gold in a controlled fashion.

  In old-school Dungeons&Dragons the idea was that the game will progress from dungeon delving into barony management and such as the adventurers gather funds and fame (and levels).  Partly this was probably because of the miniature wargame roots of DnD.

  So one alternative is to not convert a dragon hoard to a portable form, but instead to invest in real estate, armies and other forms of power.  The drawback is that this is more localized, but the advantage is that it can produce gains if managed well.  From a fiction point of view this just provides another kind of challenges and story hooks.
  ```

- u/LesserWrong:
  ```
  And don't forget that you need someone to start harvesting the body for parts as well! Dragon organs and body parts are used in crafting magic items and as spell components.
  ```

- u/LesserWrong:
  ```
  You better have a wizard handy to spam prestidigitation and organize that treasure as well.


  Now I kind of want to see someone melt down a dragon horde and cast Animate Object...
  ```

- u/MugaSofer:
  ```
  >Dragons are not going to nap on 3d10 art objects.

  Gems, magic items, and other precious metals (such as platinum) *were* introduced to D&D for exactly this reason. From an OOC perspective, you could just use those.
  ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    In-universe, though, most of the entities from which the dragon exacts tribute (small towns and villages) are paying primarily in gold and silver--and the dragon has no incentive to convert those ordinary denominations into gems and platinum pieces, let alone magic items that it won't use.
    ```
