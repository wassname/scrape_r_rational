  This was a bit much for my SoD, unless it's a result of some mental manipulation (in which case, why?). Maybe I'm just miscalibrated and people actually do tend to accidentally make allegations of murder out loud IRL.

    I think accidentally speaking out loud IRL is probably less correlated with the seriousness of the content than with the level of *surprise* at the thought - or it least it has been for me personally.  Validation would be tricky though - it might be impractical to get a valid statistical sample of people IRL having come to sudden realizations about murders.  :)

    That said, I admit that bit was likely inspired more by drama than "naturally follows from everything preceding", but it still seemed plausible enough to me.

  Jesus Christ, what's the body count at Beuxbatons?

    ```
    To be fair, he's in the middle of a speech the main purpose of which is to create an impression that Pomfrey was very virtuous and important. He wouldn't be the most unbiased source for a student safety appraisal at the best of times, but during this particular speech he's even less likely to prioritise factual accuracy than usual.

    suspected

    >Try to go to bed early the first time you test it, so in case I've missed the dosage you don't end up missing classes?

    It is phrased a bit awkwardly, as you are ending an imperative sentence with a question mark, which is something one does in actual speech, but I at least would refrain from in written speech. Also, you used both "missed" and "missing".

      Gotcha on the first one, thanks!

      On the second - when I write dialogue (or internal monologue), I always write it as it sounds, which I think helps with voice and characterization.  I agree the sentence is a little clumsy - I did ponder for a while on how best to phrase "missed the dosage" - but in the end I left it...Nurse Wainscott has multiple excuses to be less polished in her delivery.  :)

    Agh, good catch, thanks!

      You're welcome! And thanks for correcting!
