  I like that scar doesn't really get one because he essentially won.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    And the only reason he subsequently lost was because of a drought totally out of his control. I guess in the rational!Scar version Simba would have returned just to find the Pride Rock completely abandoned. Because a smart king Scar would have listened to Sarabi.
    ```

    - u/LiteralHeadCannon:

      I was about to say that in the rational!Scar version, Simba would be *dead*.  This is, in fact, what lions in the real world do.  But seeing as the lions in The Lion King have human-level intelligence, it's probable that this would be socially unacceptable for Scar to openly do.
      ```

        Not strictly true - lions only kill cubs younger than nine months - the reason for the infanticide is not to eliminate competition but to get the lioness ovulating, and after nine months killing the cub wouldn't help matters so there is no reason to. Older cubs just get ousted.  And of course, there's no real reason to kill Simba since lions don't typically inherit prides. 

        Besides, Scar and Mufasa were a sibling coalition - killing your nephew and sibling coalition partner is not adaptive. Since Scar is not physically imposing, Scar's pride is super vulnerable to attack by other males. BiologicallyTypical!Scar would have kept Mufasa around for defense purposes. Plus, a wild Scar would be uncertain about Simba's paternity - Simba could well be his own cub. So Scar's betrayal is, in fact, a betrayal even by wild lion standards. 


        And as long as we're talking about inaccuracies, Mufasa, being the more physically powerful lion, should have gotten the black mane. It's thought that dark manes are honest signals of fitness among lions because they're too warm.
        ```

        So have him murdered discreetly, duh.

        That's the standard-issue solution to dynastic disputes among humans, and historically discretion was optional.
        ```

        - u/LordSwedish:
          ```
          Isn't that what he did? He sent the hyenas after Simba and they just reported that he died or am I remembering that wrong?
          ```

          - u/PeridexisErrant:
            ```
            Not dead until you've seen the body, held an open-casket state funeral, and cremated him. 

            Trusting minions is a basic mistake.
            ```

      - u/Sylocat:

        Especially since it's based on *Hamlet*.
        ```

      - u/DCarrier:
        ```
        It's socially acceptable for lions to openly kill and eat other intelligent animals. Why would infanticide be different?
        ```

    - u/ishaan123:
      ```
      I think it was implied that Scar's hyenas sharing the hunting territory seriously contributed to the lion's problems during the drought. But Scar needed the hyenas to maintain power, so he was stuck with them.

      But you know, even after all that, part of the tribe remained loyal to him and Scar's heir ultimately inherited the throne. All in all, I think Scar's scheming came out in net-positive, as far as Scar's own metrics of "positive" go... even if he didn't win everything forever, he got more than he would have gotten. Although he might have gotten an heir even otherwise.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        I prefer to ignore the second movie. It just makes zero sense. Where did all the never seen before Scar-like lions come from and what were they banished for exactly?
        ```

    - u/Uncaffeinated:
      ```
      I thought the implication was that Scar was such a horrible ruler that he even managed to mess up the weather somehow.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        That's what his religious enemies would say, yes. You know, the kind that talk to their dead fathers in the sky.
        ```

      - u/TastyBrainMeats:
        ```
        It is kind of implied to be a Fisher King scenario, combined with overhunting to feed the lions *and* hyenas.

  Wishing for more wishes was explicitly banned. 

  I'll give the Cruella one the benefit of the doubt, though to my understanding there's a difference between young animals and older ones when it comes to making things out of them. 

  Not sure if Gaston's obsession, in itself, counts as stupidity. As I saw it, the thing that made Belle attractive was that there was effort involved. 

  Ursula works. 

  Unless I'm forgetting something the Stepmother didn't think that Cinderella would have been picked anyway. 

  Wicked Queen works.

    > Wishing for more wishes was explicitly banned.

    But wishing for more *genies* was allowed. At least he could turn himself into a genie, so why not turn someone else? Bam, three more wishes. Also, Jafar can mind-control people into making wishes for him, bypassing the three-per-person rule.

      Not certain that mind control would work. It wouldn't surprise me if you have to make a wish of your own volition. We never saw one way or another.

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Yeah, the Gaston one ... it's pretty clear that he doesn't find all women interchangeable. Solving his problem by changing what he values isn't really solving his problem at all.
    ```

    - u/Tholo:
      ```
      I don't see this as changing his values, but as recognizing there are likely other women who could meet his values in the same way Belle does. I grant that the "million other hotties" probably don't fall in that bell curve, but if you handed me a random nerd who was hung up on a girl to the point of organizing a coordinated attack against her chosen partner and a nerd who, once rejected, looked for other women, I think it's clear who I would think is more rational. 

      That being said, I do like the [Twisted](https://youtu.be/q9vgqq8KyZo?t=205) interpretation, in which Gaston loved Belle for who she was, and saw her love for her captor as Stockholm Syndrome, and led the mob against a criminal.

        > I don't see this as changing his values, but as recognizing there are likely other women who could meet his values in the same way Belle does.

        The thing is, Gaston didn't really care about Belle because of any trait of hers, at least not by the end. At first he was just pompous and vain, he only went berserk when she turned him down because No One Says No To Gaston.

    Didn't Cruella want puppies because their fur and hides are softest?  I'm pretty sure that was stated somewhere in the film.  Also Dalmatians used to be kinda rare back when the film came out, the film was what propelled their popularity, so it's not like there were tons sitting around waiting to be adopted.

    Also how does a *step*mother become part of the royal family when the stepdaughter marries? Seems to me that since she isn't the mother of the new queen, she doesn't get shit. Especially if the queen hates her.

      ```
      Broker a deal. If Cinderella identifies and works as her servant, technically she's property of the house. She could literally sell her either for money, or write into the contract that in exchange for the girl, the previous owner gets semi-royal privileges or a stipend. If Cinders is uneducated, starved, and worked to the bone, she's probably not going to have the gall to oppose her stepmother offering her freedom and marriage in exchange for signing her name to a piece of paper.

    Cruella wanted to skin them before they developed their spots.

      No, she was really angry to see that the newborns lacked spots.

- u/LordSwedish:

  These don't really work. Sure a rational Jafar might have decided to just remain as the most powerful person in the world and maybe even use his last wish to find where other genies are but you can't wish for more wishes and it doesn't make much sense that a genie has the power to make more genies.

  Cruella de ville's plan was perfect and would have worked if it wasn't for the fact that animals can talk to each other and some random farm animals found the puppies.

  Gaston liked Belle because she didn't immediately like him so changing that is changing what he's attracted to, not making him rational.

  Wasn't the whole point about Ursula that she had to get Triton to give up his power willingly so that she could control the trident and not get blasted into tiny bits?

  The stepmom in Cinderella woudn't have though Cinderella had a hope in hell unless she saw her all magic'd up. 

  The queen....why didn't she just stab Snow White?

  Edit: While I stand by the others in general I have to admit that there are many ways for the Jafar scenario to work that requires very minor tweaks.

    However, that is _precisely_ what happened
    ```

  - u/360Saturn:
    ```
    If Ursula kills Eric and thus captures Ariel with a contract she can't fulfil, she can still work a hostage situation with Triton as she did in the actual film. His trident for his daughter back; Ursula still becomes queen of the sea.

    If Cruella's all that rich, surely she could've hired better thugs and maybe a mansion with a cellar, or some kind of metal doors. Pretty sure the pups escaped in the first place through a hole in one of the walls.
    ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      Ursula didn't think humans could challenge her and were easily fooled. She was completely correct regarding this and if she hadn't grown huge everything would have worked out well. In hindsight the evil overlord rule " I will not turn into a snake. It never helps." should probably include the clause "I won't make myself enormous to the point where I'm not in my element anymore" as well. 

      Cruella...that's a good point. It should be noted that there aren't that many people you can approach with the idea "can you make a puppy proof room where we can gather almost a hundred stolen puppies that will be skinned" if you want it to remain a secret but it really could have been done better.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Except that genies absolutely can make new genies, which is where new genies come from. If Jafar can wish for Genie to make Jafar a genie, he could wish for Genie to make ALADDIN a genie instead. And then use his first wish from Aladdin to make Aladdin perfectly loyal, and then his second to make Jasmine a genie, and her first to make her perfectly loyal, and so on netting +1 wish per transformed person. If he really wanted, he could use his third wishes on freeing all those genies, who would still remain loyal, and would retain however much power Genie had after being freed which was not a small amount. But now he has armies of them.

    Snow White is younger and probably *far* stronger (remember all those chores?). Physical confrontation is risky.

      So give her the apple first. Then, instead of walking away, stab her and *then* walk away. The point is you don't dispose of an enemy by just putting them to sleep when there's nothing (including moral objections) stopping you from solving the problem permanently.
      ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      Yeah but if you go up to Bruce Lee and plunge a knife into his back several times while his back is turned the physical difference doesn't matter much.
