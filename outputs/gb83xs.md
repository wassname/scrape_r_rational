  >"Hi everyone!" Murray translated, his voice becoming a gentle tenor. "I'm Athos and it's great to be able to talk to you at last! I'm so excited to be here with you!"

  D'aww.

  I hope that Athos is able to corrupt Murray to the Good Boy side.

  Thoughts as I go:

  Ooh, more dog!

  bulbuous -> bulbous?

  How can Athos tell visually that they're pipes?

  "sniffed each other's tails" - continue to like the dog perspective and idioms.

  Ah, visible poor people in fantasy city. Interesting that there are fae(?) in a demon city, but I guess that just shows it's a large cosmopolitan place.

  Eugene continues being an asshole, but feels like less of one than previously - maybe he's not as angry any more?

  "jittery malaise" - ooh, is there some kind of demonic mind-effect? ... yeah, as I go through this section it's fairly clear there is.

  As we go through the city, I can't help but feel the alien-ness is a bit... underexplored?

  Okay, demonic moneychangers, makes sense.

  ... Huh? Marza doesn't have whatever kind of soul these demons work off? Interesting but not really relevant yet.

  Finally a bit of exposition about the Patchwork Realms?Hooray! And we find out that Bjorn's from a sci-fi realm.

  Negotiation scene... eh. No feelings about this bit.

  Murray has had three lines and I already like him. Probably a bad idea, since he's an infernal.

    Fixed, thanks.

    They're round, metal, and smooth instead of cabled or braided.

    Thanks.  I've been making an effort on that. The hardest part is colors; dogs apparently see in a spectrum of yellow and blue, which makes descriptions somewhat limiting.

    Yup, I was going for cosmopolitan.  Also, I wanted to draw some pros and cons...open borders, inclusive of different cultures, open carry and no major limitations on weapons, lots of wealth floating around, significant (literal) market activity, at least some strong communities, limited or no social safety nets, large amounts of poverty and vagrancy.  Classifying those into pros and cons is a highly political issue so I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader; the point is to show that it's complicated and to make the city feel real.


    >

    He's mostly gotten over his rage, at least as far as Athos can tell.

    > ... translator? dug.jpg

    I loved that movie.


    > As we go through the city, I can't help but feel the alien-ness is a bit... underexplored?

    Which alien-ness in particular?  There's a limited amount that I can explore it just while characters are walking through the city not talking to anyone, but I did try to showcase it as much as possible.

    > Finally a bit of exposition about the Patchwork Realms?Hooray! And we find out that Bjorn's from a sci-fi realm.

    Yup.  I had originally had a vague idea about doing the standard "nomad warrior from far away, serves as a cultural contrast for the main character" but decided that was too on the nose and too clichÃ©.   Instead, I decided to go for "starship engineer".


    > Murray has had three lines and I already like him. Probably a bad idea, since he's an infernal.

    I'm glad you like him.  He was fun to write.
