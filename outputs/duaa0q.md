## [Spoilers] Practical Guide to Evil Doubts - Volume 3 Chapters 8(Lies) to 15 (Bestowal)

### Post:

I have some doubts relating to Catherine's encounter with the winter fae.

Please explain my doubts which are presented below

1. I did not understand why Catherine was put in a story with the role of Princess Of High Noon. How did this happen? And how did she know she was being manipulated into a story?please explain in detail. 

2. Why was did winter and summer attack Creation in the first place? [if the answer to this will be revealed later on in the story, then please refrain from answering this question]

3. How did she win the fight against the Duke by using the fake prophecy?

4. Why did the fae allow Catherine and her team into the place knowing that the invitation was fake?

  The main thing to note is that stories matter a lot in Arcadia, and so they have magnified effects on the fae and on reality.

  1: The fae trapped her in the story by giving her the costume of Princess Sulia and essentially giving her the role of Sulia. They were trying to continue the traditional Winter/Summer cycle, and now that Summer is attacking Calernia, they're using Cat as a replacement "princess", which works because from the perspective of the overarching narrative there is no meaningful difference.

  2: Summer attacked Calernia, so Winter had to attack as well to balance stuff out. Again this is because of the narrative tying their hands: the courts have to move in symmetry.

  3: She made a story of "the daughter killing her long-lost father only to realize afterwards", but then because she bargained for "the right to always have had that ring" (and thus the ability to retroactively gain the title of Duchess/heir to the Duke), she won against the Duke by retroactively making herself his "daughter" and leveraging the story to kill him. In the process she gained a fae title as well.

  4: The story forced them to. Cat forced them to go along with the story of the King of Winter inviting a foreign despot to his realm.

    If I remember right summer attacked Akua, I haven't seen a smoking gun for if this was summer natively objecting to what Liesse was being crafted into, or because somone meddling with a narrative.  There is a RAFO reason for winter choosing to attack Catherine.

  The answer to #2 hasn't been revealed yet at your point in the story, but it's a pretty great answer.
