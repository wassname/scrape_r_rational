## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Recommend me the top novel you've read in 2021. I'm new to this sub. I've only read Mol,Worth the candle,Harry Potter.

    For me it would be Practical Guide to Evil (webnovel series), and the first Murderbot Diaries. I also liked A Backwards Grin (pokemon fanfic).

     If you have a lot of time on your hands, Worm is what people usually try after your list. Or if you want more Harry Potter and DnD, Harry Potter and the Natural 20.

    Can't decide between these three, so I'll pitch them all:

    [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=JS58p2oVe7&rank=1). Dude is left behind when a Mars mission is cut short, struggles to survive until the next mission can bring him home. It's pure competence porn, and if you're at all interested in engineering, this is crack.

    [Catch-22](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168668.Catch_22?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=eJoa1KK5jQ&rank=1). Satirical novel about war. Not rational, but then again, is real life? Certainly not bureaucracy, which this mainly makes fun of.

    [The Name of the Rose](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119073.The_Name_of_the_Rose?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=8StfYgbE3p&rank=1). Medieval Monk Murder Mystery, with clear Sherlock Holmes inspiration and a character who talks enough about philosophy of science that it almost rates a Rationalist tag. Occasionally dragged down by page-long descriptions of irrelevant details.
    ```

    - u/loltimetodie_:
      ```
      ++ for Name of the Rose. Personally, the waxing lyrical about minutae added to it for me. Really helped me feel totally immersed, since the writing (and translation, really) can be super evocative. I guess what I'd cite in support is the segment where (spoiler-free) the PoV character gets so lost in a religious carving he starts undergoing an actual religious ecstacy.
      ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Dune 1, 2, 3. It's not rational but it's pretty compelling. The movie is great as well.

    In terms of webnovels Ar'Kendrythist. Not a rational protagonist but the world is rational, and excellent exploration of magic and use of foreshadowing. Every arc manages to tie together several disparate threads from the past 20-30 chapters and it's always well done.

      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        That's true, but it's something that comes into play like 110 chapters into the story, and I feel like telling people to "hang on for just another 1.5 million words" is a bit much lol. It's my top litrpg, but it doesn't have the wide appeal of something like Mother of Learning.

  I basically can't write a summary for it that explains *why* I'm recommending it without spoiling the first chapter... which is a big deal because CH1 alone has like 4 different WHAM! moments. I guarantee it's not what you'd expect reading the Mangadex summary, and it's also not what you'd expect after having read halfway through the first chapter.

  The Ward audiobook project just finished, I highly recommend it but not necessarily Ward. The quality of the audiobook/podcast throughout is honestly amazing, I don't remember any "bad" microphones, and I think having a large cast takes it to the next level, especially for the interludes. Certain voice actors just "are" specific characters to me now. It's wild to compare it vs the Worm audiobook, which was overall decent but high variability.

  That being said, I don't generally recommend Ward itself. Unless Worm was great to you and you just want more. Otherwise it's just decent in my opinion, as someone who has now read and listened to Worm twice (the doofcast Worm commentary is also great). I didn't like the PoV nearly as much, particularly in combat, there's little/no "grand mystery", and I found the pacing bad. It made big gains in emotion and description, but got worse elsewhere and overall.
  ```

  - u/-main:
    ```
    I'm really coming around to the Cool Stuff theory of literary criticism. It's the reason Fate/Stay Night is actually good, despite the writing and the awful, forced-into-the-worldbuilding sex scenes. It manages to be awesome in concept and has a *lot* of Cool Stuff. 

    Wildbow has levelled up as a writer significantly between Worm and Ward when it comes to mood, character writing, emotion, theme, and general literary practice. Some of the interludes, and the team of characters, will stick with me for a long, long time. (Thinking of Kenzie's interlude in particular.)

    But Worm was channeling a whole lot of Cool Stuff into one story, in the "takes three decades for your first album and a year for your second one" style. He just had saved up storylines and plot points and grand worldbuilding to get out. Ward.... not so much. For all that I liked it thematically, it failed to be awesome.

  I've been reading [Gone Native: Earth Saga \(DBZ/DC Comics\)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/gone-native-earth-saga-dbz-dc-comics.949015/page-164). Tarble, the MC is a fascinating character, I read this without reading its prequel [Going Native](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/going-native-dbz-dc-comics-complete.789109/) since I didn't know it existed at the time I started, I was able to follow it well and piecing together what must have happened in the previous installment was fun.
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I'd recommend Going Native too, although yeah you can kinda read the sequel without strictly having to read the first. But Going Native is interesting in just how much the protagonist changes due to his circumstances after transmigration, even though he's a earthling at first. It's pretty good.
    ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    I also recommend these as DBZ fics, tho it must be emphasized that there is a *lot* of emphasis put on JUST GOTTA PUNCH THEM *HAAAARDEERRRR*.

    Since the universe seems to run on that logic, it's not explicitly *un*rational, but that's certainly not a focus.  There are some quasi-rational aspects to it however, such as how Tarble has to try and figure out how on earth he's going to politically spin his integration of things like "strategy" and "technology" into his army of meatheaded beat-em-up monkeys without getting scorned as a dishonorable wussy.

    Gone Native is definitely a midpoint, I don't know if I would recommend jumping halfway into the story.  I'm not really a fan of serial authors changing titles halfway through a story like that, when really it's just more chapters at a different link.

    I have to say tho that it has possibly my favorite running joke of all time, where all the martial arts technobabble >!is replaced with Saiyans explaining things like "This form is straightforward, first you pull on your chi like HHHHRRRRRGH and then you twist it like HHHYYYAAAARRR and then all you have to do is put it all together with an AAAARRRYYYRRGGHH, so you shouldn't have too much problem."!<
    ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      Oh yeah. *Every time* >!a Saiyan tries to show another one something about chi!< that really is what works for them, lol. It's so in character.
      ```

  - u/MoneyLicense:
    ```
    As a DC/DBZ cross it's a fine read, but as a rational rec I don't recommend this one. My biggest problem with it, is that characters don't spend enough time thinking, discussing, or planning. Further, not enough time is dedicated to detailing the beliefs and attitudes of characters, so I find myself leaning on my prior understanding of the cast to justify their actions (and lack there-of).

    More specifically:

    * >!Initially neither the Teen Titans nor Superman react appropriately to a possible planet conquering threat. Whether emotionally or strategically, their first interactions lack weight/tension, so the those exchanges read more humorous/cracky.!<
    * >!MC seems to care too much too quickly about the opinions of the heroes. He intuits their combat potential and political importance with little effort. He spends too little time doing any research. He doesn't have to work for plot-relevant information.!<
    * >!Despite being a potential genocidal conqueror, and the reason for the Justice League's founding, it's not clear at all that they've done anything to prepare for/defend against MC. Similarly the Teen Titans don't seem to have a strategy and seem to just be hoping that naïve ethical discussions/being teenagers will inspire MC not to conquer the earth. !<

    tl;dr Not enough tension, Not enough strategizing. Too "Teen Titans/Dragon Ball" not enough "Young Justice".

    This might just be an issue of being a sequel + double fanfiction, integrating all those tones, themes and topics can be hard. I only partially read the first installment a while back, and the both source material a much longer while back.

    EDIT: Although I will say I enjoyed the story a lot more from **Chapter 11: The Line** onwards I still wouldn't recommend this as a rational fic.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      I finished the first fic all the way through, and while it wasn't really rational, I did find it interesting how the author tackled the transmigration and Earth memories to the MC, who pretty much does go native as it were. I wouldn't call it rational either, but it was enjoyable.
      ```

  - u/netstack_:

  Request: **Factorio** Fanfiction. 

  Or anything that gets into a lot of engineering or practical sciences. Heavy on vernacular and terminology would be a huge plus. 

  As an example, this scene ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmGKlWjQHic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmGKlWjQHic) ) from George Lucas's movie THX-1138 is a great example of what I mean by vernacular and terminology.

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    [Factory Isolation](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.30535/) is a multicrossover where the protagonist gets the powers of the factorio guy. He conquers the factory planet and goes into other worlds and butts in their plot. The crossover worlds are pretty unique, and not really done before as far as I've read. It's honestly pretty decent, if generic. I had a good time.

    Also, Brockton's Celestial Forge is like 90% vernacular and terminology. I had to stop because it went above my tolerance for vernacular, but you might like it.

    There's [fate/first order derivative](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-first-order-derivative-fsn.47581/), which throws an OC timelooper into the fifth grail war.

  After a three and a half year hiatus [*Saga*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_\(comics\)) has returned. 

  It's kinda hard to describe *Saga* to those who aren't familiar with it, but I'd describe it as a mix of *Romeo and Juliet*, *Star Wars*, Fantasy and LSD. It's a comic about a bi-racial (or bi-species?) family on the run from the law of both their species, which are in the middle of a galactic war. Both species are afraid that they undermine their war effort since they married instead of killing each other.

  The story really delves into the characters and the motivations. There's a huge, diverse cast, trans to cis, straight and gay, mixed-race, etc. Since it takes place over several years, and we see character grow; they mature, change for the better (or sometimes the worse), get depressed, deal with PTSD, redeem themselves, and move on.

  The Atlantic did a really good review [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/03/saga-comic-series-image-issue-50/556481/) if you're interested and want to know more (some mild spoilers but nothing big).

It's definitely not rational, and the last episode of the six kind'a falls apart from that perspective, but the bubblier alt-near-future vibe plus the mostly less serious tone made it plenty enjoyable.

  In the mood for a xianxia/wuxia cultivation novel, but looking for novels with half decent main character. I abhor reading about evil mc's and most translated cultivation novels seem to be about some sort of monster in the skin of a human so its hard to sift through to find something readable. 

  [Here's a list](https://www.novelupdates.com/viewlist/21394/) of my favorite eastern xianxia/wuxia if others are interested in well written novels with mc's that have some semblance of morality. (40 Millenniums, Earthlings are Insane, some IET novels, ect)

  I've also read many of the more popular Western novels like Cradle, Defiance of the Fall, Forge of Destiny, Bastion, Arrogant Young Master Variation ..., Ave Xia Rem Y, ect.

  I have been recommended Lord of the Mysteries and I will read it at some point, but the lack of a romantic subplot is something that turns me off. Not a big fan of harems, but I'm a lesser fan of no romance at all. That said, if you do have a recommendation that has a decent main character with no romance please do recommend anyway.

      Read a couple dozen chapters and it's pretty interesting so far! Premise is interesting and unique. Has a very relaxing vibe to everything and I appreciate that the mc doesn't carry a blood feud against anyone who slights him. 

      That all said, everything seems much too easy for the mc. So far seems like a novel I'd drop after a hundred something chapters once the novelty of surprising everyone with his underestimated excellence gets boring.

        I'd say that's more or less a universal for Chinese webnovels, including the ones that I've read on that list you posted. The readers aren't reading them because they're nail-biting thrillers; they want an op MC who crushes problem after problem and enemy after enemy without having to worry about losing.

          True, it's a fine line to walk and everyone has different levels to how much that bothers them. I guess for me some of the others novels had enough going elsewhere (worldbuilding, interesting plot points,  my boredom, interesting characters, cookie cutter romance that distracted me, ect) that I was able to find ignore the flaws.

          Just have to hope that this one gets to that point like the others I guess.

    A practical guide to sorcery kind of fits, although it isn't exactly xianxia per say, it works exactly like one through a western lens of an above average intelligence author. 

    &#x200B;

    They get more 'mana' capacity by casting spells and the more they cast the more powerful they become, it takes a long time and there are tiers, apprentice, master, grand master.. There are wards, artifacts, elixirs the whole thing. But again with western names and general vibe, while feeling exactly like a xianxia without the OP mc cheats and other crappy cliches.

    Read Divine throne of primordial blood. I think it kind of fits in this sub but not exactly. You'll read about a Real smart Mc who calculates everything. The romance is good. Even though it has a harem tag i would say there's no stupid harem but the romance is focused mainly on one Fmc. Give this a try. I also put Fmoc at the top of my list. Did you read Issth? Give Er gen's novels a try. I would say start with Issth. If you liked it read Awe,Pot,Ri.

      Divine Throne is alrightish? It starts off good, but at some point the story falls apart with the mc loses brain cells and starts acting much dumber than he was earlier and though they aren't human, him >!committing genocide against all the other intelligent races!< isn't something I find enjoying to read about.

      Issth was very frustrating for me. >!Meng Hao was discriminated against and taken advantage of as a junior. He was on the receiving end of actions he felt were unjust, unfair and the bullying caused by terrible people.!<

      >!He resists them and fights against their tyranny, but as soon as he gets powerful he starts running his own, even more efficient mafia racket. He has his subordinate demand significant amounts of the resources from poor juniors. Becomes just like the people he was complaining about and fighting against before.!<

      >!I don't need mc's I read to be sticking their neck out to save everyone, but not being a dick is not a big bar to clear imo. Really hard to read about arrogant hypocrites. Meng Hao could have just taken his revenge on the bullies, moved up and moved on. He didn't have to be the type of person to even try to stop bullying in general. But becoming the bully he just destroyed? Not my cup of tea.!<

      AWE was much better and a lot funnier so I read a two or three hundred chapters of that before I dropped it out of boredom.

  Having enjoyed a PA/battle tech crossover
  [Iron blooded commander](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/battletech-planetary-annihilation-si-iron-blooded-commander.979266/#post-80364270)
  Are there any recs for PA fics(crossover or not) where the PA portion provides a narrative drive/plot, not an opportunity to fantasise about technology
  Ta in advance
