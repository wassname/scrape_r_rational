## "Mother of Learning" audio book gone?

### Post:

I listened to the "Mother of Learning" chapter 29 on spotify 2 days ago, and now no audio chapters are shown anywhere.

What happened?!

Was it really taken down?

    This is fantastic! It's great to see that both Voraces and nobody103 will get money for this, and who knows, with it as an actual product and not a hobbyist thing like this there is even a chance that it will be completed faster this way, although that's probably a stretch.

      By the way, I don't know if I understand it correctly, but does this mean that physical copies might get released?

      I'd love to have this in my collection.

        If he's publishing the book then it's likely it gets a physical release yes!

          Voraces commented on Discord that, as far as he knows, nobody103 is only working on publishing the audiobook.

            Boo. I have literally less than zero desire for an audiobook, but I would happily buy a physical copy to put on my bookshelf.

              I get that, but the audiobook is absolutely amazing.  Voraces does a better job of it than I've heard from a lot of other narrators, he adds so much more to the story.
              ```

                I don't doubt that, I just have no interest in listening to an audiobook for any reason ever.
                ```

            ah that sucks, I'd also love an official physical copy of the book!

    Oh... that's simultaneously disappointing (I really enjoy Jack's podcast) and really exciting (I really enjoy Jack's narration, and now he and nobody103 will hopefully make some money off of it!).

    Thank you very much for your efforts.

    It's very sad that it's gone for now...

    Great news, he deserves to make money off it, I enjoyed it a great deal.

    Pity. Past audible screwups are one reason I'm kind of soured on encrypted audiobooks.

      Pretty sure you can buy individual audiobooks on audible without a subscription. But you should expect to pay at least $20 for something like this anyway.

  this was the first post I saw about it:

  I just successfully downloaded all 87 chapters using Podcast Addict. Not sure where they're pulling from, but that still worked for me!
  ```

  - u/therealgoldroger:
    ```
    So there were only 87 chapters released by jack? The other 20 chapters never got an audio release?
    ```

  !remindme 180 days.

  MoL audiobook released?
  ```

- u/Copiz:
  ```
  Anybody know if he is doing edits for when it is published? Or will it be as is?
  ```

- u/therealgoldroger:
  ```
  Are there copies still around somewhere? Iâ€™ll still buy it but I kinda want to listen to more.
