## (Question) Chapter 49 of mother of learning

### Post:

I'm only upto Chapter 49 so no spoilers please. 

Spoiler! ["Honestly, that might actually be a good thing," Kael speculated. "Red Robe thinks you are part of an army of time travelers out to get him, right? If so, it might actually be suspicious if you don't periodically do something big like that."](/spoiler)

What? I must have missed something? When and how did this character come to this impression of being hunted by an army of time travelers?

  From chapter 26,

  >!The matriarch told Zach that she could bring people into the loop, and Red Robe read Zach's mind. This was a lie that was meant to trick Red Robe. You can tell that the trick worked and that he really is concerned about it, because of his line, "But I'm not as violent and unreasonable as I might first appear, you know? If you tell me the names of other people the aranea have brought into the time loop, I promise I will leave you alone"!<

  Remember when Red Robe confronted Zorian and slammed him against a wall, demanding answers? He wanted to know *how many other time travelers there were*.

  And then he tried to pull the answer from Zorian's mind, except even as a novice Zorian was better than him at mind magic and shot him in the chest.

  The spoilers shows up in my browser. The way to get it blacked out is "/>/!this/!/<" without the /s (backslashes): >!which looks like this!<.
