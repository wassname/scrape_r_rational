## [Q] What proof would you need to believe in God?

### Post:

To begin with, I'm asking this out of curiosity because I want to see the discussion, not as an attempt to convert anyone. Yahweh, God, or Allah: What proof would you need to be convinced that God is real, as opposed to an advanced alien trying to trick you, or your own insane mind?

### Comments:

  An exorbitant amount.

  It'd be comparatively easy to prove that a godlike being exists when compared to the amount of evidence it'd take to prove a God from the Abrahamic religions does in fact exist.

  A godlike being could convince me of its power by preforming actions which either breaks the laws of physics as I currently understand it (assuming that I am capable of seeing through any 'tricks' to fake the abilities) or feats which are impossible for current level of technology.

  Note that the above cases are distinguishing between supernatural abilities, or highly advanced aliens.

  However for the existence of a religious God, my requirements simplifies to treating religion like any other scientific hypothesis and finding evidence to support it. The main reason why religion isn't considered to be scientific is because the existence of God can't be falsified. But if God exists and there is evidence of God's existence, then we can apply the scientific method to proving God's existence.

  After all of that, it'd boil down to me deciding between the existence of God, or me living in some stimulation of the universe with a construct of God.
  Evidence sufficient to convince me of a God as described by Judaism, Christianity, Muslim, or others of a similar type would require events such as religious prophecies coming true, priests/rabbi/mullah developing genuine abilities which can't be replicated by science in any form, **AND** the revelation of a valid argument for how an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent God could exist while allowing the current state of the world to occur.

      That argument almost works to convince me that a moral God can exist and still allow evil to occur. It just means God has decided that it's more important to have a large quantity of goodness even if it allows a small amount of evil over a small amount of good with no evil at all.

      I wouldn't agree with the morality of such a God, but it works well enough to convince me that a benevolent (by my standards) God can exist and still allow the current world to exist. Congratulations! You have convinced someone on the Internet!

      Of course, this brings up the question can a objective moral system exist where it is considered good from every individual's subjective perspective?

      This is a hard problem in logic and philosophy where you can have different axiomatic systems which are each internally consistent, but disagree with each other.

      Note that I'm distinguishing between a God who follows a moral system (especially one we can understand and agree with) which seems to be the type you are describing, and a God who is perceived as 'good' by every single sapient being which every religion uses to persuade people by saying "You can't question God, He's perfect in every possible way! Never mind that it's logically impossible!".

          I'm not entirely sure, but I think the point that the argument is making is that God is only allowing our current universe to exist is because God has already created all other possible universes which are more 'good' from an objective point and if our universe is any more 'good', it'd be identical to one of the other universes already created.

          > The need for many universes seems like they are existing only for us to compare against.

          That's kinda the point of the argument.

          Although....it brings up the interesting scenario, is there any reason for God to have created our particular current universe, assuming that there is only ever exactly one universe?

        Omnibenevolence doesn't require an objective morality, you can just integrate over all the subjective moralities, instead.

          That doesn't make sense to me. What does it mean to integrate over multiple moralities? Also, there is no guarantee that it's even possible to reconcile different moral systems.

          For example, our culture considers cannibalism to be a deeply unethical act (barring circumstances where both people would starve to death otherwise). However, there have been other cultures throughout history who considered it to be a necessary ethical behavior to eat the flesh of our ancestors once they have passed on out of a 'life is a cycle' style philosophy.

          How do you reconcile two moral systems who have opposite opinions of the same action?
          ```

          - u/SirReality:
            ```
            When he says 'integrate over all the subjective moralities' I believe he's just saying to take the average over everyone's individual subjective morality.  I can't write it well in reddit's markup, but take its own actions, and sum how moral those are perceived to be by EVERYONE, and divide by number of people judging you.  

            In your example of cannibalism (good choice, btw), a 'omnibenevolent' being would seek to maximize their total moral character as seen by everyone - thus, if more people think allowing cannibalism is morally abhorrent than not, it is not allowed.

            Caveat to all the prior: I don't actually agree with this as a sound moral framework, as it inevitably leads to tyranny of the majority extending to definitions of morals.  It is, however, an interesting model, and one I can see a bit of in society as a whole; once something gets majority approval, it ceases to be morally repugnant for that society.

                Seems like for any morality system you could define a (possibly very ugly, possibly just an arbitrary list of values) function M1 = f(x) that outputs the moral value of any possible action.

                There is exactly one moral system defined by M2 = -f(x), the function of an agent who would be seen as pure perfect evil under M1. (and to it, agents operating under M1 would be seen as pure perfect evil)

                Any summing or averaging or integrating of all possible moral systems seems like it would produce a function that calls every possible action morally neutral, ie 0.

    Eh, I don't really think anything can be considered to be non-scientific. Basically all proofs made outside of axiomatic systems, are going to be probabilistic.

    If we pick another hypothesis like: 'the sky is green'. Then if we observe evidence to the contrary, I can make a hypothesis to explain the new data such as: 'the Illuminati hypnotised everyone'. Even though we might scoff at it and call it a rationalization, it is still a valid hypothesis.

    The only difference between 'the sky is green' and 'god exists' is the number of people willing to support it. So it's not the hypothesis which is non-scientific it's just people not acting rationally.
    ```

    - u/Phhhhuh:
      ```
      While I agree with you that scientific methods can help us estimate the probability of God's existence, *technically* only falsifiable theories can be scientific theories. God's existence is famously unfalsifiable, since religious people like to point out that if God exists (and is omnipotent) he can easily confound any tool used to look for him. While that's true, it's an extremely cheap argument to try to explain the lack of God around us. To me at least, it's a clear sign that religious people are starting to give up, how the mighty have fallen.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Ah, just to head off communication issues before they happen, I should mention that I'm an agnost. With that said, I feel like you should avoid statements like: "how the mighty have fallen". It needlessly polarizes a discussion, and is basically acting anti-rationally. 

        Aside from that, I do not believe falsifiability to be a necessary condition, for the scientific method to be applicable. As I stated above, that limitation would restrict the domain of science, to axiomatic systems; and while we all agree that math is the foundation of science, I do not think anyone would say it is it's sum total.

        So, if I'm understanding your thoughts correctly (which you may correct me on, if I am not). You believe religion to be non-scientific, on account of the inability to use evidence to refute it. But the same can be said for any other hypothesis, in the same vein as the story of the Dragon in the Garage (http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/). 

        The point I was getting at in my previous post, is that, in order to gain information one needs to make certain assumptions. An example of a common assumption is Occam's razor, but one can make alternate assumptions (Such as, a religious one). How you treat evidence, is dependent on this perspective.

        Under this guise one can think of rationality, as a sort of meta level assumption. In words it would be something like: 'I will assume that which will increase my expected utility, by the largest amount'. Which means people who hold a *belief in belief*, are generally acting irrationally.

        Now, it is my personal **opinion**, that arguments in favour of religion are as irrational, as arguments in favour of the sky being green. But under another set of assumptions, I could be made to believe otherwise. This does not affect the applicability of gathering evidence, either for or against a hypothesis, it only reflects my personal assumptions. So as per my previous post, it isn't the hypothesis which is non-scientific, it is the people.

          Really? That wasn't my intention at all, I only meant it as a commentary on how organised religions have gone from being dominant world powers to the lesser position they have today. Maybe I could have been clearer! I think that everyone can agree on that, regardless of whether one is religious or not, so I hope it doesn't polarise any debate.

          >I do not believe falsifiability to be a necessary condition, for the scientific method to be applicable.

          Well, this right here is the root of the matter then. By definition, scientific claims must be falsifiable (they must make predictions that can be tested), otherwise it is not scientific.

          >You believe religion to be non-scientific, on account of the inability to use evidence to refute it. But the same can be said for any other hypothesis, in the same vein as the story of the Dragon in the Garage

          I know religion to be non-scientific, and I disagree that this can be said about any other hypothesis, though it can be said about some. For instance, my statement *the sun will rise before 07:00 tomorrow morning* makes a prediction and is quite testable. The claim *there's a dragon in my garage* (without modifiers) is also testable, and thus subject to scientific inquiry, but the claim *there's a dragon in my garage and there is absolutely no way to tell* is not. I hope that explains the point.

          The fact that God's existence isn't a scientific hypothesis means that it's hard to gather strong evidence against it, but it also means that the claim in itself is "weak" in the sense that it isn't very useful. After all, what's the point of knowledge if it can't be applied to other knowledge in some way, such as making predictions?

          Now comes the part where I think we will agree: the fact that God's existence can't be directly tested means that we can't acquire any hard knowledge on the matter, but that doesn't mean we can't make an estimate with educated guesses. So, we can assign some sort of probability (or rather an interval of probabilities) to the existence of God, not because it is a scientific hypothesis but because it is a statement about our world, and they can all be assigned some probabilities. The key point here is that our guesses about non-scientific claims will be much more loose than our guesses about scientific statements, all other things being equal, which is mirrored in the width of the probability interval. With the specific case about God we do have an advantage; we have a very long period of data to review. Nowhere in recorded history is there any evidence for God's existence, which do give our estimation some strength simply by virtue of a lot of correlated data.

          >it isn't the hypothesis which is non-scientific, it is the people.

          In conclusion, the hypothesis is non-scientific, and so are the people.

            I agree with you, but I think our reasons for agreeing on this are different.

            AFAIK, "Science" is a method to determine better/best/good questions. Ideally, you can use information theory and Science! to determine the "question which will teach you the most" (information quotient), although I don't think that's usually possible. Still, ideals to strive for and all that.

            As such, non-falsifiable claims aren't useful (scientific) because they cannot result in questions with answers.

            Note that this means Science! can be applied to subjective things, which is pretty cool (it's just that the subjective learning can't be applied to other people).

    I'm not incredibly familiar with the rationalist community but I haven't seen anyone yet talk about the falsifiability vs. verifiability distinction. As you say, what makes a hypothesis "scientific" is that it is falsifiable. But try to create a falsification test that I exist. You cannot, one because to disprove my existence you would need to search the entire universe and not find me and two because I do, in fact, exist. Like my existence, any hypothesis seeking to prove God's existence must be a test of verification. Am I making any sense?

    If my argument stands, then searching for God using the scientific method would a bit like looking for a rose while wearing rose colored glasses. You're excluding the possibility of finding it by the method you're employing.
    ```

    - u/Nighzmarquls:
      ```
      You can solve the existence thing by cutting existence down into parts or 'dissolving the hypothesis' into smaller chunks.

      I could be wanting information of many kinds.

      Like I can ask a question "is there a shape of matter which obstructs moving sticks through it that matches your shape definition?" that is easier to falsify and test.

      To be more specific and even more broken down I can test "Is there a shape of matter defined as you that obstructs me moving a stick through it which is actually in reach of my stick poking?"

      We can break down to simpler or move on to different discrete tests for the capabilities/properties of 'things' like 'god' and 'you' until we run out of attention, resources or questions that are useful.

      So yes I can't falsify 'you existing' but I can narrow down the properties about your hypothesis of 'you existing' until I don't care about whatever extra semantics you want to throw at it.

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      FOR EVERYONE - Here's a good [link](http://www.openscience.org/blog/?p=312) that better sums up the difference between falsification and verification for anyone reading this who may be confused.

      FOR RATIONALFIDEISM - You are right that proving your non-existence is difficult because it requires searching the entire universe for you or evidence of your existence (for example this post is sufficient to prove you exist even though I have never seen you in person). It is only after searching the entire universe (or just planet since you are assumed to be human) that I can actually say that you don't officially exist.

      However, the above paragraph has detailed an entire procedure for how I can conceivably prove the statement 'Rationalfidiesm doesn't exist'. When it comes to God, there is no test that I can even conceive of to prove to people that God doesn't exist. It's only the fact that we have never found evidence of God weakly proves the statement 'God doesn't exist' (I know other people think they have found proof, but I don't consider anything in religion to be evidence).

      To clarify further, let's do a thought experiment. Pretend for a moment that a subatomic physicist has been thrown to the ancient past of humanity around 100 B.C. There is no way for him to recreate any of his physics experiments to prove his knowledge due to lacking the advance technology to prove it. Yet he can still imagine some theoretical test which doesn't violate any laws of physics (otherwise it'd be just a thought experiment), making his knowledge falsifiable.

      It basically boils down to whether or not that there exists some potential test to disprove your statement (regardless of the feasibility of your test) that determines whether or not the statement is falsifiable.

  * The Catholic church, the Anglican church, all the various denominations or protestants and pseudo-protestants, they all shed the 2000 years of obvious nonsense that have been layered on top of their religions, stripping everything from Saul's letters onwards out of their holy books, and the Council of Nicea is undone.
  * Priests that are insufficiently Christ-like spontaneously leave the church and take up secular occupations.
  * Prayer is unambiguously answered, laying on of hands actually heals people, and so on.

  I don't think I'd remain skeptical in that situation. And, hey, that's how things are supposed to be, right?
  ```

  - u/NotAHeroYet:

    I'd change that to prayer is unambiguously answered to individuals who meet certain parameters. It's not just an excuse, praying to god to summon a million demons to destroy the world is a good reason for god to have added acceptance parameters. Presumably, true christians could do it consistently, though, and expirimentally prove it worked.

      The answer to prayer may be "no". Unambiguously.

    Great question, I should have clarified this in the OP. "God" is the creator of our universe and has the attributes and history described in the relevant religious text. An advanced alien either evolved naturally or was created by God, and did not create our universe, although it may have visited earth in the past to do the things attributed to God in religious texts.
    ```

- u/nevinera:
  ```
  A definition of "god" that is sufficiently rigorous to discuss, and which implies some testable difference between a world in which he exists and world in which he does not. And then multiple tests of that difference, and a few years of analysis attempting to come up with alternative explanations.

  If *you* are God, then the proof I require can easily be provided by simply making all diseases non-contagious for one year, and causing a pizza to appear spontaneously in my living room. And if you could tell the zealots to lay off the gays, I'd appreciate it.
  ```

- u/Jiro_T:
  ```
  There's a difference between "prove there is a God" and "make me think the evidence for God is a whole lot better than it is now".  Having some entity come down from the heavens and perform a miracle wouldn't prove there is a God; it could be an advanced alien or a magician.  But it would certainly be one *step* towards proving there is a God; my estimate for the chance of God existing would be a lot higher after that.

  If the entity were to then explain how many apparently incoherent philosophical claims made by religions really were coherent after all, my estimate would go even higher.  Likewise if science suddenly started finding evidence that religious texts predicted things about the real world that could not possibly have been known or guessed by the authors.

  At some point, the evidence would be so good that I would agree that there is a God, even though

  -- no specific piece of evidence completely proved it and

  -- nothing can be proven to certainty.

        Well... god*like*.

The beings who built the kit or game might not be the ones responsible for it coming up with our particular universe.

        Heck, if it's a game engine, it might provide a game arena by simulating a Big Bang and a trillion years of fast-forwarded evolution before the game starts. We could just be part of the automatic precalculation process; extrauniversal beings might not start interacting with our simulated spacetime continuum until well after our sun goes dark.

  The last time I was asked this question, I took a certain inspiration from the site "[Why won't God heal amputees?](http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/)". Direct experience of such an event could be considered a necessary piece of evidence, if not sufficient in itself. However, since, as I don't anticipate any removed limbs of mine to be able to be replaced, I have no incentive to put any putative deities to the test by removing one of my limbs and having them replace it, I came up with an equivalent test: Just have me grow a new limb, in a fashion current science couldn't manage. A nice, long tail would be ideal.

  (Why yes, I did suggest to certain people that if they wanted me to avoid the pains of hellfire for not believing as they did, that they should pray for me to grow a lovely tail. I have no idea whether any of them actually did or not.)
  ```

    ```
    Wait, would that actually convince you? I mean, I *believe* in God and I'd still blame that on aliens.
    ```

    - u/DataPacRat:
      ```
      Not by itself, no. But remember, just as every theory needs to pay rent in anticipated experiences, every question has to pay rent by letting you change your behaviour depending on the answer. If a putative deity can't do at /least/ one small miracle on demand, then I have no reason to put said deity to further questioning. Thus, growing a tail is a particular example of a class of miracles, the demonstration of any one of which would be necessary to start considering further questions and evidence, even if, on their own, they are insufficient to differentiate between God and aliens.

      Having heard of various stories where someone demanded, "Prove your power by doing X!", and having X demonstrated to the demander's sorrow, out of that class of miracles I simply picked one that had the combination of highest predictive power (as in, being incredibly unlikely to happen without Something Unusual going on) and the least likelihood of my regretting it should it actually happen (ie, I'm reasonably confident that I could live a happy life with such a tail).

      This particular piece of evidence also has the interesting property of, very likely, being time-limited; in that, depending on certain advancements in various possible technologies - robotics and cybernetics and human-computer interfaces, or biotechnology, or uploading minds into software form with customizable virtual bodies - then me living with a tail may turn out to be something that can be accomplished within the century, without any alien or divine intervention required.

  I could be persuaded into believing in a  creator of our universe. I feel like that proof wouldn't even have to be difficult, show me the universe untethered by a linear time point of view. That'd probably do it.

  If I was at a bar, and a person sat down next to me and was like "I'm God, check it." And then showed my brain the universe from start to end without the complication of time. I'd totally believe.

  The belief wouldn't change anything about my life though. I believe a creator of our universe may exist. I do not believe in God as any religion on Earth frames it, because people are bullshit, and the more people there are, the more bullshit happens. A human being cannot even keep their own memory straight. You can introduce false memories that people will fervently believe are absolute fact with very little coaxing. I can't imagine **any** religion is even **close** to correct on what God is or represents. 

  I'm not even certain that we're not just like the cells and/or neurons of God's mind. Maybe we're all just autonomic functions of God's being that it is barely aware of. 

  The average human breathes 12 to 20 times per minute. How many neurons does that take to make sure that task functions? I don't know, but are you aware of every firing of each neuron that it takes to make you breathe roughly 20,000 times per day? Are your cells aware that they are part of a larger being? Awareness relies on definitions of consciousness that the greatest philosophers throughout the ages have yet to come to consensus on.

  Do I believe in a creator? I cannot prove or disprove nor am I qualified to make such judgements. 

  Do I believe in anyone's "God"? I cannot.

  I could not accept any religions version of God. Especially a judeo-christian God. Any omnipotent being, who sets moral codes of behavior for humanity and then sits by and allows those doctrines to be blatantly broken, to the suffering of "God's children" is no deity of mine.

  A God that fulfills the conditions of theodicy? There's no such proof. The existence of any such evidence is a logical impossibility.

- u/NotAHeroYet:

  Very little to believe he exists. To let it actually alter my paths, a lot more. I've examined my internal beliefs, and I do believe in God. I just don't believe in that belief. I disbelieve my belief, so to speak. It's a facet of my upbringing- i know there's no reason to believe he exists, but at the lower levels, i believe in him. if i stop and think i don't, but until then i do.

  I don't believe in him at the level in the religious texts... but i do believe he exists, even if as propoganda and excessively moral absolutist.

  In other words, in the same way i know reality is really made up of lots of complex things, i know god doesn't exist. but in the same way i don't conciously think of everything being made up of atoms, when i'm not conciously planning it, i'm far too superstitous.

  It wouldn't take a ton to prove his existence beyond my doubt level because of that, but for me to think it's worth changing plans would require substantial proof and deviation from the religious norm.
  ```

  - u/pizzahotdoglover:
    ```
    That's very interesting. Many people who are religious believe in their belief, but aren't actually capable of the core belief. In other words, their self image includes them believing in God, but deep down, they don't truly hold that belief. /u/EliezerYudkowsky wrote a very interesting [article](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/) on this topic that is worth reading if you haven't yet. I came from a very religious household, and after long discussions with my parents, I am confident that my mother truly believes deep down, while my father only has a belief in his belief.
    ```

    - u/NotAHeroYet:
      ```
      Yes, that might be it. The reason is inverted though- deep down, I believe in god. But I do believe in a world where god, gods, could exist. I don't know how delusional that is. On the other hand, examination implies god either doesn't exist, or is so subtle as to be irrelevant to my mental model of the world.

      Unexamined, I believe god exists, that that's an immutable facet of the universe. I've adjusted my parameters for god's behavior over the years, but i never really disbelieved he existed, merely that his defeinition of good was accurate. For me, God is like some lovecraftian deity, or a paperclip AI. His priorities are close enough to think we can know him, but more than far enough away to prove futile, and powerful enough to avoid our gaze if it would be counterproductive. As such, if he is defeatable, the best course of action is to plan around him and if neccessary, to wage war on him, and if he isn't, pursue your goals while trying to avoid his gaze and minimize his harm to your life. I don't think he's omnipotent- or if he is, he's doing this for the game, like a video game player- they could hack in and insta-win, but that wouldn't be any fun, so they follow rules anyways- but i do think his power outscales ours tremendously.

      I tend to find myself thinking, or even planning as though this is the case, if i'm not careful. little, superstitous things, like not taking deities' names in vain or believing in providence rather than luck. It's an undercurrent of belief, i suppose.

      If someone walked up to me and tried to prove god existed, I'd be far too credulous, I suspect. Carefully examined, I believe god doesn't exist. but the instant i turn my back, i find myself thinking like he does. It's not a huge difference, but it is there.

      I don't believe God doesn't exist, but I should, hence why I said "I disbelieve in my belief." But that doesn't change the fact, that when you asked if there is a creator when i'm distracted I'd say yes, before pausing and correcting myself. 

      If you asked where god is, I'd say I don't know, but if you asked if it would be possible to see him with omni-knowledge i'd say yes- because it's not a matter of throwing the flour in the garage, it's a matter of a single invisible dragon somewhere in the galaxy. 

      But since most don't have any proof he does exist, I believe he doesn't IFF I stop and check my beliefs, or manually replace them. But it just keeps sitting there anyways, a subtle trap for any future plans.

      Tested, reality implies god doesn't exist, or doesn't have enough power, or doesn't care to meddle with us- that this is all some salt crystal collection, and our existence is a coincidence, or that our origins aren't from a meddling creator, so it shifts my plans very little.

      But very little isn't none. It leads to a slight bias towards what I consider moral behavior, which doesn't always overlap with right behavior, in the same way belief in karma might.

      It might be belief in belief, but I want to disbelieve in god. It's just not that easy. Wanting to disbelieve doesn't make me disbelieve it. It's a bit of "disbelief in belief", really. I believe something, but I don't want to believe i believe it.

      huh. I notice i am confused. Something in this is probably innacurate... on the other hand, i'm talking about how the map i use automatically doesn't match up with the one i'd use if i manually thought it through. of course i'm a little confused.
      ```

      - u/pizzahotdoglover:
        ```
        This is a really well thought out reply. Perhaps there could be a God that retreats upon examination, like a computer simulation creating more and more of the map as you explore. E.g., there was no need for atoms or quantum particles until people performed experiments that demanded answers. Or the only stars that existed were the ones visible to the naked eye, until the telescope was invented. I'm not sure exactly where I'm going with this, but I'm sympathetic to your point and I think it's a reasonable position. I suspect the best answer we have is that humans have evolved an evolutionary bias towards believing in the supernatural because those types of beliefs and resulting actions have kept us alive through either rudimentary science or social cohesion.

  To echo some other comments here:  I will treat [X] as if [X] = [Y] if enough evidence is provided that [X] = [Y] is the most compelling hypothesis.

  To portray this in terms of Occam's Razor:  badly-faked, it's a simpler proposition that [X] is only pretending to be [Y] and is in fact something else.  Perfectly faked, it's a more complex proposition to imagine levels of pretending (more so if successive).  The most likely version of reality will be treated as true, always while keeping in mind that I could in fact be a brain in a tank or a vacuum fluctuation or similar.  (There's the perspective of 'if someone is willing to go to these lengths to fool me by satisfying my curiosity, I might as well give up and reward their dedication'.)

  In practice, both 'reality as consistent with that deity existing actually make sense' and 'it doesn't just make sense, something with that level of control actually exists' would need to be demonstrated, at least ideally.  If minds really didn't die when they were thought to, but 'woke up' from a simulation (or afterlife, et cetera) then a lot could be explained in terms of permitted ethics (though easily disagreed with, regarding suffering).  For example, I'd be much more okay with {agreeing beforehand to put myself through the fear of death without risk of death} than I would be with actually facing the risk of death, and I might be willing to forgive a lot if I learned I had never actually risked death.  That said, while it would be wonderful if there weren't actually any risk of death, it's not at all convincing that that's the case, and so it is wholly appropriate to act as though there's no safety net.  ...though then there's the valid perspective of 'even if a being shows you an afterlife, should you devote your life to immortality research to improve your chances in the slim-subjective-probability event that you're being tricked?'.

  If your brain's inner workings are being messed with, then your final mental state is disconnected from your processing intentions beforehand in any case.
