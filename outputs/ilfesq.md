  A much-improved rewrite of [You Needed Opponents With Gravitas](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/you-needed-opponents-with-gravitas-worm-the-culture.512650/), this story is a crossover between Ian Bank's *Culture* series and Worm. The focus is primarily on Taylor as she acts as the face of Contact.

  I *HIGHLY* recommend this one as well, it's *really* nice.

  It's basically a super advanced alien civilization doing an intervention on Earth Bet with the goal of bettering humanity as a whole.

  Still a bit on the early stages, but an absolute joy to read nonetheless. Not sure if it's quite rationalist per se, but it has a bunch of rational elements in it.

  Ohh, I think I read the original, and liked it. Wasn't great, but was definitely good; excited that it's gotten a redux.  


  Update:  
  This is \*amazing\*. I remember the original, and the core idea is the same (including Taylor's "powerset"), but the approach and writing are all immensely improved. It almost reads like a Culture novel, I'd say.

    After reading the available chapters of this (Redux) story, I've become more intrigued by the prospect of the Culture novels--previous encounters in the form of synopsis-perusal have consistently given the impression of vast dramatic backdrops overshadowed by petty storylines.  Do the novels themselves have scenes resembling Taylor's use of suites to predict (the actions and stances of) and interact with clueless authority figures who have no idea how they're being puppeted?  (Any perspectives of Minds setting up Chessmaster-like plots?)  If so, I may urgently need to revise my evaluation of how interested I should be in reading said original novels.

      It's been awhile, and different Culture novels have very different vibes. Usually, the Culture isn't a major presence; YNOWG has a much greater Culture role in the story than the original works.

        Ahh.  Thank you!  Does my original impression seem applicable, then?  Grand backdrop, typical/mediocre interactions?
        ```

          Gosh no. I'm not finding the interview, but the author has stated the Culture folk are too mentally and emotionally healthy to make for good stories. So by implication, the characters that are front and center are interesting, and broken, and the like.

          The Culture itself is more the backdrop to the backdrop.

  I'm really enjoying this one. Binged it last night.
