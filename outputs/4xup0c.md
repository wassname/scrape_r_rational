  OK. I don't know what to think of your story.

  I can't not categorize it as rational, yet it feels so different. All the characters are fucked up, humans are violent weird fuckers, the monsters are crazy, and I don't even know. Colin is definitely crazy, yet somehow he's the only sane person in the story. Except he *isn't* sane.

  I don't know how you did it, but you made a story I'd expect to be unsatisfying to be *very* satisfying. Your story is so good, but I can't even.

  I await to see Book Five. You've done some nice work so far. Kudos!

    Thanks.

    Yeah, it's not strictly rational other than in a general 'realistic' approach which I often abandon when there's a gag to be made. I only post here (usually at the start and end of volumes) because others have posted discussions of the story on this sub previously and I have quite a lot of readers who frequent this subreddit.

    It's been quite a divisive story because (I think) I tackle various triggering issues and have a number of difficult female characters. It gets me a lot of downvotes, but I still mange to find readers interested in reading a less obvious approach to fantasy, so I guess it works out for most people. Glad you're one of them.

      A huge portion of your readers go fucking ballistic whenever Jenny's name is mentioned, and I still have no idea why.  I've never seen anything like it.

        IKR? Somebody described it as going around a dungeon with the final boss in your party.

        I wanted her to be a challenge, not a waifu and not a tsundere, but the reaction from some has been really violent. Her trying to manipulate him while obviously liking him just threw a lot of people. Felt real to me. Maybe too real...

          Having just binged through the whole thing, what I *think* might have happened is exactly what Claire warns us about. Namely, the readers (myself included) spent too much time with Colin and we all got kind of suckered into his style of semi-justified paranoid thinking. It probably doesn't help that we can see how she's *successfully* changing him both in ways that he notices and ways that he doesn't really seem to.

          While reading, I went through a whole slew of different theories on what she was trying to accomplish as a long con (My favorite is still the period where I was *convinced* that Jenny was dead/captured and had been replaced by a shape-shifted troll.) Now, at the end of book 4 she *seems* to have meshed into the party permanently, but my brain keeps looking for what she could be up to by habit.

            I think most of my readers identify with Colin and part of the stories popularity is down to how many pissed off young men there are in the world. And they tend not to like Colin either being too happy or too messed with (by girls in particular).

            At the same time, I often get attacked for both being misogynistic and pandering to the PC crowd, so there's no winning.

              Aside from the specific details regarding which two groups are doing it, I think that's called 'being an author.' 

              I'm writing a story where the main character is a BTVS vampire. The MC, Jack, is literally a demon in a human suit. I don't get *attacked* but I have reader commentary both pulling for him to be both more and less of a sociopathic monster. Often citing the same act/decision taken.

              Readers, being a naturally varied lot, are rarely going to unanimously agree about anything. Unless maybe if it's a typo of some sort.

    I think it's that the story is very focused on the main character and his team's reactions to the shit going on around them. 

    Sure, there's a plot going on, things are happening, but I don't know that it's actually important to the story. In the sense that I'm fairly certain Colin and company could have set off into the woods and done most anything else and I'd have enjoyed reading about Colin banging his head against the metaphorical brick wall about as much. The story could have been about Colin's merry band of misfits doing MMO style fetch and FedEx quests and that group of characters would *find* a way to make hilarity ensue.

  I think I tried the first couple chapters of this and didn't like it, should I skip ahead or give up?
  ```

  - u/mooderino:

    It does start off quite slow and takes until the end of the first book (more or less) to find its feet. This was because I winged it from the start (as an experiment). It does get better, but I wouldn't jump ahead as there are a lot of call backs to stuff that happened early on. It also depends what you didn't like about it. If the characters didn't strike you as interesting you probably won't warm to them any time soon. 

    Mind you, I am the author so it's hard to be objective.

    I found Book 1 kind of slow going, too. It does pick up after that, and the writing is brilliant. You can start with Book 2, maybe around Chapter 48 even.
