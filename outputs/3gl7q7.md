  The real problem with gattaca is that the 'evil' megacorp is actually right and the real villains are the main character's parents.

  They're recruiting for a one man mission to Jupiter, and they don't want an astronaut with a heart condition. Fuckin' NASA wouldn't let that guy fly today.

    It's even worse, it *wasn't* a one man mission, it was a multi-year mission with a crew of at least half a dozen. The main character was the *navigator*. If he dropped dead halfway through, the rest of the crew might have become stranded in space.

  Am I misremembering Gattaca? I thought the advantage was less about having "special" alleles, and more in being able to select a whole matching basket of alleles, excluding all the dodgy ones that would otherwise appear with a frequency dictated by chance. Children born of random promiscuity wouldn't be able to inherit all of the parents' advantages without going through the selective screening test-tube process.

  Although I suppose eventually you'd have an elite class who were all homozygous for a converging set of "preferred" alleles, and their offspring would be certain to receive at least one copy.

    Came here to make this point.

    Sex between a genetic musical genius and a genetic basketball player could result in a genetic loser; it's almost certain not to result in an incredible basketball playing musical prodigy. This is even more true of the general spread of such genes; each may not even be positive if not combined in a specific fashion.

  Why wouldn't human GMO's be protected by the very same thing that protects food crops? Any modified human is rendered sterile (it's a feature not a bug, have as much sex as you like!). If you wanted children you were going to go to the genetic councellor anyway...
  ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    I think trying to make that a selling point would run afoul of some pretty basic human drives.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      It's not about sterility, it's about contraception. If there currently existed a product which would stop my child from becoming (or causing someone else to become) pregnant until they *explicitly chose* for that to happen ... well, it would depend on the price point and who would ultimately hold the keys (preferably not a corporation) but if the price point were "free" and my child didn't have to risk corporate blackmail to get reproduction turned back on, I think that would be a no-brainer.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Yes, true.  That is a no-brainer.  It's just not going to stop deliberate allele thieves, call them the Bene Gesserit, from not taking the drug/surgery/whatever.
        ```

        - u/derefr:
          ```
          Why would you assume a drug/surgery/whatever? Why not just have the same gengineering responsible for the great individual traits also completely foul up the reproductive process? Make the males produce no sperm, make the females produce no eggs, make the uterus unable to support implantation, and on and on. In such a world, when you want children, the parents' diploid DNA gets sampled from their regular tissue, feature-mixed manually on a computer, and a viable zygote protein-printed.

          Effectively, the genetically-engineered are speciated from humans, and have a reproductive process with three parents: a mother and father who contribute DNA, and a computer in which the contributions conceive life.
          ```

            That was the kind of scope I was thinking of, yes.

            Ok, and now the revolutionary or activist groups among the poor just yank out the desirable alleles and splice them into someone who isn't sterilized.

              ```
              And *then* we get lots of casual sex?

                ```
                Basically.  And then advantageous alleles spread to fixation the ordinary way, yeah.

      ... they said, while living in a society that sells birth control over-the-counter.

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        A society where reversible sterilization is reasonably cheap and safe, and yet few take advantage of it.

          Fair point.

      Yes, but if the technology is accepted as "How you make children if you want them to be successful", then a lot of people would overcome that drive. I find the idea of impregnation extremely sexy, that doesn't mean I have sex with strangers without a condom.

        One word. Grandchildren.

  I got the impression that the invalids were that way because their parents didn't want to play with their children's genes, not because they couldn't afford to.

  Also, it was still really early in eugenics becoming popular again after that crazy Austrian dude made it stop being cool. Next generation there will probably be less of a difference, although the valids will still have genes that go well with each other.
  ```

- u/puesyomero:
  ```
  while methods like extra artificial chromosomes and germline cell modding would indeed be inheritable, there are various ways where enhancement and treatment could be achieved without it being inheritable. Such as tissue-specific virus vectors who would only target where needed, or chimerization via implantation of modified stem cells (muscle, denser bone, better neurons, etc). these both offer a company the control over its intellectual property and parents are free to reproduce naturally without the worry that their sight enhancement on their eyes result in a baby who has photoreceptors instead of skin nerves. Non inheritable methods are also attractive to parents who want their kids to have the *latest* in gene fashion and not only inherit their crummy  Ãœbermensch V.1.2 that was in vogue when they were born!  of course tech tends to trickle down and if governments today pay for vaccines I don't see why they wouldn't pay at least for some gene therapy in the future.

  They may have something like hybrid vigor, superior genetics based off a crossing of genes that is lost if they breed.

  They could even have malformed offspring if they breed with poor people. They could have genetics that don't match well with standard humans.

  There are varied possibilities.
