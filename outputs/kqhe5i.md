## Limited rationality

### Post:

So I had the office on in the background while I did some other stuff and it hit me that Michael Scott usually explains his logic behind his arguments, actions and beliefs. Not always, but every now and then. So it got me thinking. 

&#x200B;

Would it be a valuable exercise to try to use rationality in a very limited way like he does? Not in your life, of course but for fiction. Could we write a rational fic about Michael Scott himself? I sometimes finds his logic.. kind of sound and I can't really pinpoint why I know better. Sometimes it is experience, sometimes it is rationality, sometimes it is knowledge. If I had a more limited experience with physical exercise and less knowledge of metabolism I would definitely buy that filling up on pasta alfredo before a marathon is a good idea, you want to have access to fuel to burn, right? It takes a long time, so you'd want a lot, right? You're not about to eat during the marathon so no need to leave space for more, right? Exercise burns calories, so it will probably remove the full feeling fast, right? 

I feel like knowing how to do something bad, in this case rationality, you can learn how to do it better. Is there anything to this idea or do I just have a deep-seated need for a Michael Scott rational fic?

  I think you're thinking of "Right for the Wrong Reasons" trope
  https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons

  "[D]idn't Aristarchus and the Pythagoreans propose heliocentrism in ancient times? If only they had prevailed, we might have had real science millennia sooner. What was their evidence?
  Well, you see, fire is nobler than earth and the center is a nobler position. So fire has to be in the center. QED.
  There are many names for this sort of thinking, but 'scientific' is not one of them."

  Example:
  The climax of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone sees the Golden Trio going through the trapdoor guarded by Hagrid's pet three-headed dog to try to beat Snape to the Stone, which they believe Snape is trying to steal. Yes, the Stone is in danger of being stolen, but what Harry discovers at the end of the road is one of the first indicators that he and Snape were on the same side all along.

  One show that I think you would like that has this premise is:
  Dirk Gently Holistic Agency is a tv comedy show and book series by Douglas Adams that's a really good example of this. Basically everything falls into Dirk's lap by the universe helping him/special ability/luck.

  There is also Joker's joke at the end of the comic book "The Killing Joke":
  "See, there were these two guys in a lunatic asylum...and one night, one night they decide they don't like living in an asylum any more. They decide they're going to escape! So, like, they get up onto the roof and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the rooftops of the town, stretching away in the moonlight...stretching away to freedom. Now, the first guy, he jumps right across with no problem. But his friend, his friend daren't make the leap. Y'see...y'see, he's afraid of falling. So then, the first guy has an idea...He says 'Hey! I have my flashlight with me! I'll shine it across the gap between the buildings. You can walk along the beam and join me!' B-but the second guy just shakes his head. He suh-says... he says 'What do you think I am? Crazy? You'd turn it off when I was half way across!'"

  The tropes page has a bunch more examples.

    I really like Dirk Gently! I see your point about the trope, but it doesn't really apply to my example, or am I misinterpreting it? He isn't right at all, it's more like he is wrong for the right reason? We have the knowledge to know that he'll be ill and out of it because your body can't handle being really full and do exercise. 

    And is it a good exercise to write a rational character that is significantly less able than you are? Would that help you be more rational at all?

      Well scientists always make this error. There are countless models that have been thrown out as more information is learned. So perhaps you can have a rational character be a scientist. Either that or a detective. You can always come to a rational conclusion that is ultimately false given a set of truths that arenâ€™t complete. I think that even happened a few times in HPMOR where people believed things to be true one way when given limited evidence. Maybe if you make the character an alien? There are those comic strips, Strange Planet, that takes everyday things and makes them seem weird to any observer alien. Perhaps the main character can behave like that.

        Yeah, that could probably be actually rewarding. Writing something from an outside perspective. But I realize now that I just wanted a Michael Scott rational fic. Read his thoughts as he untangle the problems he encounter.

    I actually think the OP is more describing "wrong for the right reasons." Michael scott is trying to use logic to come to good conclusions but failing due to incorrect or incomplete knowledge at the start.  I think showing an inexperienced and faulty rationalist whose deductions fail could make a good story

  Leaning heavily on the prior probability is sometimes like this.

  In statistics, a strategy for [beating the bias variance tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff#Approaches) is to use a dumb model that's inexpressive in conjunction with a smart model that's overexpressive. That might describe the underlying dynamic you're picking up on. I've been thinking about it a lot lately as a heuristic in my personal life, and it's a very general pattern. Try to optimize your decisions, but respect cultural wisdom. Try to stand out from the crowd, but don't look like a weirdo. Look for a spot in the market where you have an edge on assessing value, but practice bid shading.

  We could also say that maybe Michael offloads much of the computational work going into his decisions into different places than someone who emphasizes explicit verbal reasoning. Perhaps he's able to get away with using very simplistic arguments because he's got very good filters for selecting simplistic arguments running in the background.

  A bit late to the party, but I'll chip in.

  A rational story written from the perspective of Michael Scott would be functionally indistinguishable from a rational story written from the perspective of a child.

  Michael Scott isn't just a Man-Child - he actually is truly childish. He somehow managed to absorb almost no useful information about how the world works until the beginning of the series, and he also completely failed to develop a full/adequate Theory of Mind. At the beginning of The Office Michael knows almost nothing about anything, craves attention above all else and, while he does have empathy, does not really understand how other people think or feel (e.g he can never understand why his employees don't enjoy his antics). Michael's character arc throughout the series is fundamentally indistinguishable from that of a child growing into an adult - he grows more worldly, more understanding of others, less dependent on external attention to satisfy his self-worth., etc...

  So yeah. If you want to write a 'Limited Rationality' story, just write a story about a really smart but really young (and not too observant) kid. A character like that would naturally not have much prior experience with anything (including other people), and would be almost naturally inclined to the sort of experimentation that would result in antics like 'filling up on pasta right before a marathon'.
