  OK, I'm sold.

    Same, you picked the perfect line to hook any given member of this community.

    Wait a minute. That's exactly what my dying brain would show me if it were trying to distract me from the experience of death by drawing me into a well-crafted fiction... ü§î
    ```

    - u/Geminii27:
      ```
      Well... as long as it's well-crafted. I'd probably mind a lot less, even if theoretically I should be panicking about my imminent demise. There's a lot to be said for the distractability of good writing, though.

    Statistically it's unlikely your near death hallucination would be internally consistent enough to have this conversation.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      Yes, but would you be coherent enough to *notice* those inconsistencies?
      ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        Oh yes, would you be coherent enough to have that conversation?
        ```

    That quote is like catnip to the rational literature community.

  Fun so far, but I'll hold off until there's more than three chapters before really digging in.

    I have read a lot further into this book than is posted so far, and I can absolutely recommend this thing whenever it has more chapters.

  This is why you're supposed to choose the goddess as your boon instead of a system ability üòÇ

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Well he did not really get to choose much of anything.

    "Hey you are eligible for a reincarnation!"

    "Cool I guess."

    "I'll just press this button and SHITSHITSHITFUCK!"
    ```

    - u/Kuratius:
      ```
      It was a Konosuba reference.
      ```

- u/Tell31:
  ```
  Do you know the update schedule?
  ```

  - u/Saffrin-chan:
    ```
    looking at the dates on each chapter, it looks like once a week for now
    ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  Interesting so far, although I agree that there's not enough to make any firm judgements yet.

  Starting a story *in media res* is...  I'm not going to say it's a *bad* choice, but it's writing a check that you'd better be confident in your ability to pay off.

  There's some blatant narrative contrivance here, but I don't have any problem whatsoever with that when setting up the premise of a story.  Just as long as it isn't indicative of a habit (which, again, way too early to tell).

  I'm a little confused by the story having the framing device (narration from the POV of the character as she's being tortured) at the beginning of the first two chapters, but not including it for the third.

  I like the tone, I like the snark (first person smartass is the best story perspective), I like that I can see mysteries already starting to get set up in anticipation for future chapters; hopefully, those are paid off well.

  Thanks for sharing it!

  (You may want to post why it belongs in r/rational somewhere)
