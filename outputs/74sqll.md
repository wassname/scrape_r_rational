  This is just one of those Gobsmaking worldbuilding statements statements that has made my day.

  I think I'd really like to read "the usage precedents for the Grs'thnk law it was based on.” and the volume it's resident in.  Not now, the story is awesome, but if you want a suggestion for a writing block project that could eventually be your Simarellion I think Grs'thnk legal policy and the history of their Acceleration period would be interesting.

    There's probably a _couple_ of Silmarillion's worth of potential backstory in this. :)

    Also: +1 for the flair.

  Apparently Hellfire missiles just aren't filling enough. She needed to go for something heartier ;).

    Oh boy.  Thank you.  I stuffed too many ideas into The Maker's Ark, so I had to push the resolution of some of them into future stories to keep it from growing to A Storm of Swords level in length. Theoretically, I am 5-6 chapters from the end, and it could be done in 3 months.  But it might be 8 chapters and 6 months.

  In case anyone was wondering what Black Swan has been up to lately.
