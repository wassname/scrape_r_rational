## [Biweekly Challenge] Man vs Nature

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5wmkww/biweekly_challenge_games/) the prompt was "Games", and our winner was /u/viceroychobani, with [their story](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5wmkww/biweekly_challenge_games/denakqw/, The Galactic Games). Go read it now!

##### This Time

This time the challenge will be **Types of Conflict: Man vs Nature**. The story should depict a person pitted against an animal or some other external force of nature. The most common type of Man vs Nature conflict is a natural disaster, though simply surviving in a hostile environment counts and some varieties of hunting stories do as well (so long as the thing being hunted isn't given human characteristics). Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, March 29th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time the challenge will be **Weirdtopia**. Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to write a story set in a world which defies sensibilities rather than confirming them in a positive or negative way like (most) utopias and dystopias do. [See this article](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/) by Eliezer Yudkowsky. The weirder you go, the better, but remember that the world *also* has to make sense. Prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 3/29.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5zofiv/challenge_companion_man_vs_nature/).

  Note: this takes place in the same world as a previous story I submitted for megastructures: [The Unending Land](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VetRhoNY0GCNxsMJrc5rkRK7v47durtMHPCduGw41WI/edit?usp=sharing). I tried to make the story as independent as possible.
