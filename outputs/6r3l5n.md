Rational/rationalist Overwatch fanfic. Many different POV chapters and various idea debating as well as a over arching plot to keep it all in a good direction story wise.

### Comments:

- u/rationalidurr:
  ```
  In this chapter we learn that courts have a higher requisite for evidence and that groups of similar thinking people can decide on a idea based on emotional reasoning. Good thing robo-monk is here to save the day, at least until the resident time traveler gives a vague enough warning that renders all the evidence talk unnecessary.

  Benedict , I have to say letting the group be swayed by their friends warning is character consistent but not rational consistent. I can understand if you're pushing for plot advancement over detailed discussion though.
