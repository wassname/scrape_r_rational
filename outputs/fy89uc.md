## Saw another story posted here with "Among the Stars" in the title, so figured it's a sign to post my own. This is a space opera based on the French Revolution - and its consequences. For space naval warfare, politics, and intense drama reminiscent of the regency: "Virtus: Empire Among The Stars"

Revolution is a fragile thing.

Yulia Novikov, born at the end of the Final Struggle, earns a  commission with the Union Battlefleet. The fragile peace that she  enjoyed her whole life is threatened by the vengeful remnants of the  Noble Sio, the aristocrats that were massacred and driven from Earth  after the Revolution. In her struggle to save the Union, every ideal she  embraced is shattered; every word from her father is discarded, and  through the encroaching madness of war, she faces off against the Virtus  Sio: Madman, Liberator, King.

Virtus: Empire Among the Stars is a Space Opera reminiscent of the  French Revolution, and the chaos that followed it. Who is justified? Who  is good? And who decides the people's fate?

Posting 2 chapters per day until I'm caught up, and then it'll be approx. 1 chapter per day.

  What makes it a rational story?

    Several things. One is the characters' rationales for their political systems, sometimes however immoral. It's also about people's behavior, and how top-down authoritarian systems in the story try to second guess it to advance their agendas. Finally, the ultimate end of the series will be about the existential end goal of a civilization in a universe doomed to heat death, and so it's going to explore that topic and focus on what's 'rational' to do in those situations. There's also going to be large-scale strategy in warfare past the halfway point of the story, so there's a lot of rationality in that.

    Nope. It's going to be free from front to back. I'll eventually go through and do some major edits and revisions, and release that as a series on Amazon, but until then, I swear I'll never put up a pay wall. I'll do an 'early release' system on Patreon once I've got an audience, but even then, the last chapters will still be released in the same timeframe as the free chapter.
