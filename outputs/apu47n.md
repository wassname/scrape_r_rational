## Funny rational fiction?

### Post:

I'm realizing that it's difficult for me to get into fiction that's too serious. The big reason I loved HPMOR/Natural20/Unsong so much is that they're hilarious. Can you recommend some stories with a similar lighthearted tone and comedy?

  It's not _rational_, per se, but it's pretty smart, and it's the funniest fanfiction I know: [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux).

  > "I defeated Voldemort as a baby. I've only gotten better since then."

    Oh lord, you weren't kidding about it being funny. "[Dumbledore] was fifty steps ahead of everyone else, so far ahead that--by the time his plans came to fruition--everyone involved had already died." *I'm* dead now.

    Seventh Horcrux is basically just >!HPMOR, played for laughs.!<

      Honestly, isn't the original played for laughs about 1/3 of the time?

        The rest of hpmor makes up for the third. Takes itself far too seriously, to the point of sheer ridiculous

      It was hilarious, but for my sanity, I must never read it again.

    So many moments that I loved that I could never choose between them...

  [The Wiz Biz book series by Rick Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Cook#Wizardry_series) is hilarious, ingenious, and began my love of rational fiction.  I have the first half of the series in storage somewhere, and intend to re-read and finish it someday.

  Probably the most memorable non-magical moment in the series is when the Wiz travels back to Earth and attends a computer conference where new software is shown.  He runs across some guys who wrote a computer program that interprets any sufficiently large/complex file into a still pornographic image.  The concept intrigues him, and he asks how big the main executable of the program is, and what happens when they run it through itself.  They ponder it for a moment, try it, and then wonder how many state decency laws they just broke.

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Wiz Biz was fairly unrealistic imo, because when given the option the main character uses magic to recreate Emacs instead of Vim.

  I think Game By God: Sludge Reformation is very funny.

  It made me laugh out loud quite some times already, though it is an ongoing series so not quite as extensive yet as these other ones you listed.

  >A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero?! 

  Is funny if you are not shocked/disgusted by BDSM/sexual topics. Although the protagonist does read kind of like male fantasy of a female nympho.

        this is an interesting discussion, but I will note just for the record that it doesn't have much to do with *A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero?!* which >!has no harem!< (Not that you said that it did.)
        ```

        - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
          ```
          Well, it's got one particular very-high-status man who ends up entangled with the female protagonist in a way that gives her tremendous power over the relationship, and this female protagonist is a virgin who does not have sex with anyone else or express sexual attraction to anyone else over the course of the story.  But I can understand how this would confuse people into perceiving a male fantasy of a female nympho, since the female character has any sexual thoughts, at all.

          Conjecture but not a confident one, since you can't read the minds or intentions of people from their writing: OP has never read a romance novel.
          ```

    - u/t3tsubo:
      ```
      More often than not, females don't fantasize about female nymphos. 

      In addition, the author is male so the protagonist is by definition a creature of a male mind. The point I was trying to make with that adjective might have been better served if l  described it as "an Eliezer fantasy of a female nympho"
      ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:

      Kind of related, but think of it as analogous to "what men think male objectification is" to "what women actually want to see". 

      The Hugh Jackman magazine covers:

      [men's magazine](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fb31c940546058386acfdb6274f94b3/tumblr_inline_oqj6lkD52P1qbxpiu_250.jpg) Shows wolverine all muscly and strong, shirtless - "male power fantasy"

      [women's magazine](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7b799b79b007c2bf247281891fc15d75/tumblr_inline_oqj6nks2w31qbxpiu_500.jpg) Hugh is smiling, wearing a shirt, and looks like someone's Dad. 

      So a male fantasy of a nympho woman might have the woman pursuing strong men, or possibly men who are actually the author's SI; a woman's fantasy is more likely to feature men who are attractive for reasons other than BRUTE STRENGTH. I mean, not always, not exclusively, but personally I'd rather sleep with Dad Hugh than Wolverine Hugh.

        Note that this sort of thing could easily be cherry picked by choosing what magazines to look at. Like, given that a magazine exists called "muscle and fitness", I don't think the fact that it sells itself with pictures of muscle bound hunks tells us much more.

        I wondered if Cosmopolitan would have different pictures of Hugh than Good Housekeeping would. [It appears not](http://m.coolspotters.com/brands/adidas/and/magazines/cosmopolitan/media/1054009), so that corroborates your position.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          Now I've decided to do a google search of [Hugh's magazine covers](https://www.google.com/search?q=hugh+jackman+magazine+covers&safe=off&rlz=1C1GCEA_enAU807AU807&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY9aevy7fgAhUOcCsKHRB9AwwQ_AUIDigB&biw=1680&bih=917). It seems, in general, he looks classy/friendly rather than "RAWR WOLVERINE". 

          Here's a summary of what showed up on my non-anonymous search (YMMV):

          DT (spanish-language high-end men's magazine): wearing a nice suit, adjusting his tie. 

          muscle & fitness: muscles. wolverine.

          ioacquaesapone: some sort of italian magazine. seems general, not aimed at a market. He's wearing a tux and adjusting his tie and showing off a nice watch. 

          good housekeeping: dad!hugh

          GQ: men's fashion. he's looking very... stylish? he reminds me of a submarine captain

          men's fitness: you can see his pecs and arm muscles, but he's not looking like a bodybuilder, just a standard built man

          vanity fair: he's surfing(?) i think he looks pretty attractive like this with his hair wet?

          tv media: smiling with a woman's hand on his face wtf. he looks cute?

          men's fitness 2.0: tighter shirt, more obvious arm muscles 

          GQ 2.0: he looks like he's got a hunched back i don't even. he doesn't look like a dad, he looks like... a politician? idk

          augustman (singapore high-end men's magazine): he's wearing a coat and kind of covering his face a bit with the collar? I don't understand this

          men's health: arm muscles obvious, he's doing a kind of "claw" motion with his hand and looking grumpy

          okay i think i've looked at a bunch of covers now and all I can really tell is that high end men's magazines show hugh wearing expensive clothes and looking fancy and fitness/health magazines show him looking a bit buff, and there is like only one women's magazine in the list so that was a kind of waste of time

          note: i'm actually faceblind so I'm taking it on faith that all these covers actually depict hugh jackman

          other note: my post was meant to be a demonstration of the sorts of differences one might detect rather than, like, a peer-reviewed paper.

            "I'm famous. I wear stylish, good-looking clothes. I'm well-built, but not unreasonably so. Perhaps this magazine will contain advice that will allow you to emulate my success on one of these fronts." With more of an emphasis on 'well-built' on the fitness magazine covers.

            I haven't *seen* these covers, but that seems like a reasonable theme, from your descriptions.

              Nah, the fitness magazines he's wearing like t-shirt and jeans: probably meant to convey "if you follow the 10 quick tricks for leg day in this magazine, you too can look like Hugh Jackman! He's down to earth! He wears t-shirts!"

                Yeah - buff, but *achievably* so. Something that can be reasonably matched.

    In chapter 3 he plagiarized both Ghostbusters and the quote from HPMoR that incorrectly claimed that transfiguration=FTL signalling.

    Other than that, it's an okay story.

      The early chapters are a little rough, but once the author finds his groove it gets really good. The mental duel with Baroness Kohl in [chapter 60](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/33512/60/myouve-gotta-be-kidding-me/battle-of-wits) in particular is amazing (even though Kohl's power is literally just Tsukuyomi from _Naruto_). Shame it is dead, but if you ignore the last two chapters the story actually comes to something like an ending.

  recently, I've been trying out non-japanese translated novels (cos i read or dropped all the japanese ones) and so far two I've REALLY enjoyed, one of them being quite funny:

  [https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-novels-extra](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-novels-extra)

  I recommenced trying a few chapters before dropping cos it starts as a really generic isekai story, but rightfully deserves the spot of number 1 in novelupdates rankings IMO.

  I found [Postnuptial Disagreements](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements) very funny. It's also rationalish in the sense that the main characters are intelligent and the story escalates very nicely. You might need some knowledge of the Fate/Stay Night series though.

  I also second the recommendation of Seventh Horcrux  but that's less rational I think.
