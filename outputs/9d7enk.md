  Holy shit guys. [The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/) is *so* good.  It's got the banter and mood of Practical Guide to Evil with the wide cast and worldbuilding (and length) of Worm.  

  It's a DnD-esque fantasy setting on the tail end of a magical industrial revolution, where the age of marauding adventurers and heroes is limping its way to a close.  The Pantheon are a group of known and (mostly) approachable deities who interact with the world through their respective cults, and are themselves mortals who ascended eight thousand years ago following mysterious circumstances.  The story follows a group of young magical oddities, prodigies, and scions who attend an adventuring university ran by infamous 3,000-year-old adventurer/archmage/menace/magnificent bastard Arachne Tellwyrn, who has graciously decided to pass down her historic ass-kicking skills to future generations.  

  It's got intrigue, plots, manipulation and counter-manipulation, thrilling action, appealing character arcs, twists galore, and excellent banter (and it's also got one of my favorite tropes, which unfortunately is a spoiler just to mention, but still).  I much appreciate the author's willingness to timeskip the boring parts and focus on what matters, with liberal sprinkling of interludes to cover side events and backstories.  

  I can't recommend it enough.  If you enjoyed Practical Guide you'll like this.

    TGAB frustrates me, because on paper I should love it, but in practice I couldn't get into it at all. The humour always felt a little bit too forced, and the characters, for whatever reason, didn't feel like actual people. Maybe I'm just weird. I stopped reading about the time they found the hot springs on the field trip

      It definitely hits its stride once it stops narratively following Trissiny exclusively sometime after that point. 

      That said, if you didn't like at least some of the humor by that point, then yeah I doubt that aspect would get any better for you.

  Anyone who has not read [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/reader) should read The Erogamer now. Yes it's annoying that it requires a signup to the site. Yes it is worth it.

  If you don't like written sex scenes just skip those parts. They do not factor into how up this sub's alley it is.
  ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    HIGHLY second this. The Erogamer blows my mind every time a new update comes out (Sexual innuendo only *somewhat* intended). It also has some fantastic moral questions, and is extremely inclusive, sexuality-wise. If you liked Masego being a good Ace character portrayal in APGTE you'll likely enjoy the most recent arc of The Erogamer, where an Ace character (and the protagonist) have to resolve the question of "if reality is being remade like an eroge, where do non-sexual people fit in? Or if they don't... what happens to them?"

    Following up on that suggestion... if you've enjoyed The Erogamer but also enjoy videogames, I would recommend [The Last Sovereign](http://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/). It's less meta than The Erogamer, but, uh, keeps the same kind of genre. It's a free RPGMaker game that's being constantly updated, and while the setting is inherently sexual (you're in a world where the Incubus King is threatening to turn all the nations into sexual slave states), the decisions are extremely rational in execution and the MC is much the same, using his sexual power to advance his agenda. Perhaps it's more... rational-adjacent? Either way, it's a fantastic game, and the choices you make early on may come to haunt you later. The sex scenes (and there are MANY) are all text-based... or 8-bit graphics... so don't worry too much about skipping them. Sex is a tool in this game - totally not the goal.

    You'll need to download both the game and RPGMaker to play it, but both are in the link. Can't beat the price (FREE!) either!
    ```

      I have not read Erogamer but would like to put a good world for the Last Sovereign. The best definition I can give is:

      "I began it for the boobs, I remained for the plot."

      If you are even mildly interested play the Prologue (it is really short) to know what it is about.
      ```

  - u/vx12:
    ```
    I have to recommend against it. As porn it's not very good with how slow-paced it is. As a story that tries to take itself seriously, the main character is not likable at all IMO. >!She has a very twisted attitude towards consent and morality. She thinks losing her virginity in consensual sex would be unsatisfying since it wouldn't make her feel desired enough, so instead she manipulates a good man into thinking that her powers are due to her being an alien and that he has to rape her in order to save humanity.!<
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      No, it's not good as porn, but I don't think it's meant to be, any more than Game of Thrones is meant to function as porn just because it occasionally includes people having sex. Obviously the theme of Erogamer is much more pornographic, but the point still stands, I think.

      As for the spoilered text, >!In my view, the author tried to take a very delicate and rare theme and play with it from both sides. On one side you had someone with a (clearly and self-admittedly unhealthy) kink for non-consent, and on the other side you have someone who's in the absurd "what if you actually had to rape someone to save humanity?" position that often remains the "Last Exception" of consequentialist morality.!<

      I think it handled it really well, personally. I get that not everyone would be comfortable with the concepts being explored, but neither character came off as unrealistic or unlikable to me afterward.
      ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      That was my reaction to it as well. It does a bunch of things somewhat OK, but it doesn't do much particularly well. Not much sex for erotica, not much room for rationality given the reality warping power, I didn't find the emotional storytelling very compelling especially with all the lying, etc. It may have gotten better since I stopped, but I wouldn't really recommend it to people even aside from the fact that it's a porn fic.
      ```

    - u/ArisKatsaris:
      ```
      Can I suggest reading how the most recent chapters handled the fallout of the situation you are talking about? Because you're talking about a thing that >!the protagonist has regretted doing.!<

      I'm talking about chapters from " [(6.7.5) Confession](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/page-213#post-2116196)" all the way to the most recent " [(6.8.4) Ways of Repairing Mistakes](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/page-221#post-2155481)". I feel you can read them (including the chapters in between of course) and understand the situation well enough without needing to read the previous chapters, because >!it's the first time the characters meet face-to-face since the thing you mention in the spoiler text happened.!<
      ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      > As porn it's not very good 

      Agree: it's not good as porn. The updates are never guaranteed to be erotic.

      >  the main character is not likable at all IMO, She has a very twisted attitude towards consent and morality 

      Disagree: The character is potentially  likable, in that very few people have been in Cindy's position. But she lays out her position straight... it's pretty clear. She absolutely has a twisted mentality to consent and morality, but to be fair:

      1. Her idea of consent is HEAVILY debated in the comments.
      2. Charles is NOT a "good man," as has been the subject of recent chapters. He thrives off non-consensual encounters with Starry. There's a good argument that he's been molded to like that, or Starry craves it, but... at this point, it's on Charles. And as recently as two chapters ago, he's willing to let Starry get used by others.
      ```

      - u/vx12:
        ```
        >!I stopped reading at that point so I wouldn't know what Charles becomes like later on, but that still doesn't justify Cindy's actions at all and doesn't redeem her IMO. The whole scene was very gross and the way Starry manipulated, lied, and essentially blackmailed him into having sex with her was very off-putting.!<
        ```

        - u/AurelianoTampa:
          ```
          >I stopped reading at that point

          I mean, that's fair, but if you stopped reading ***literally months ago***... why continue judging? Starry's current arc is dealing exactly with what upset you. It's like judging an alpha build for the 3.0 resolution. 

          Not saying you need to like it. I disapprove of like... half of Starry's choices. But that's the nature of a quest fic, no? Your argument is good against a specific plot point, but if you stopped reading... like half a year ago (or more!).... why do you think you understand the current issues?
          ```

          - u/sicutumbo:
            ```
            > I mean, that's fair, but if you stopped reading ***literally months ago***... why continue judging? Starry's current arc is dealing exactly with what upset you. It's like judging an alpha build for the 3.0 resolution. 

            If you only ever get reviews from people who have continued following a serial, you'll get a skewed view of how good it is. Unless they stopped reading very recently, most negative reviews would be disqualified under this criteria because the people who didn't like the work wouldn't continue to read it.

            The solution would be to have the person who didn't like it catch up to the current chapter, but I think we could all agree that that would be too harsh on the reviewer.

            I don't think a software analogy is apt. Software gets rewritten all the time, while stories generally aren't. Unless the author invests a lot of time into rewriting their story, which most serial writers don't, the current story will build off the parts that the person didn't like. If you were to force a video game analogy, it would be like really disliking a core mechanic of the game, like platforming in Mario games.

    If you've signed up already, give Polyhistor Academy a shot on the same site. The first year is complete, the second is in progress.

    It's very much a 'time management' sim, but the author manages to convey a rationalist character and world within the constraints of a 'modern fantasy' environment. If you participate it's a little wonky, and closer to a holy war for a lot of the regular posters.

  These were helpful to me, maybe they'll help some of you.

  Adblock origin. This is an ad blocker, it blocks ads on pretty much every site you go to. It saves you time and makes your browser faster and safer..

  &#x200B;

  Utorrent. It can be useful if you are a kid without a credit card. A good website I use is [zooqle.com](https://zooqle.com). Don't buy into the fear mongering out there, most people are just afraid of what they don't understand while spreading anecdotal false stories they heard about it from some random uninformed source. Watch a youtube guide and you'll be fine.

  &#x200B;

  [libgen.io](https://libgen.io). You can download pretty much any book for free there. It can be useful..

  &#x200B;

  Watch youtube at 2x speed when trying to learn things.. You'll get used to it and it can make boring things less boring and fun things more fun.

  &#x200B;

  \*Edit Requested from the replies.

  Use Ublock origin instead. This was a typo, I'm actually using ublock origin myself, it was late and I was tired sorry.

  Utorrent is apparently not good anymore. I never noticed because I use an older version of it, my bad, instead use one of the alternatives from the great replies bellow.

  I think that's all =D
  ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    You should use uBlock Origin, as it is far and away the best adblocker available. I assume Adblock origin is trying to piggyback on its good name to sell exemptions to ad companies, or sell user data. It works by preventing the blocked stuff from even being requested in the first place, so it actually makes pages finish loading faster, unlike every other adblock I know of which just removes them after download.
    (Not to be confused with uBlock, which was the old version which some company bought out. The guy took the money and immediately made uBlock Origin.)

    A supplemental extension, uBlock Origin Extra, also deals with sites trying to insist you turn off your adblocker to access them.

    &#x200B;

    Don't use Utorrent, it started leaving exploits open from version 2.2.1 onwards, and in 3.4.2 literally installed a bitcoin miner. Use Deluge or Transmission, which are essentially the same thing (torrenting clients) except not bundled with ads and malware. (I use Deluge.)

    &#x200B;

    I'm not familiar with libgen.io, but I can confirm that watching tutorials on youtube at 2x speed is a huge timesaver.

    &#x200B;

    **EDIT: Went and re-familiarised myself with Utorrent after having stopped using it over half a decade ago, it's worse than I remembered. Also apparently in that time they bought out BitTorrent and did the same thing with that, so don't use that either.**

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        I don't recall I actually did at the time - I think I'd already switched clients by then. A quick google shows a bunch of articles explaining how to remove the bitcoin miner, which seems pretty decent confirmation. I think it was discovered due to the large increase in CPU usage?
        ```

  - u/randomthrowaway14823:
    ```
    Hasn't µTorrent become bloated with ads? [Deluge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluge_(software\)) is what I would recommend for torrenting.

    And if someone wants to play around with the bittorrent protocal, but doesn't want to violate copyright law, [behold!](https://archive.org/details/bittorrent) The Internet Archive was granted an exemption from the DMCA in order to archive vintage software, so there's a lot of very old video games even.

    I actually had one of my professors tell me about Library Genesis. And later a different professor told the class that he selected the textbook because it was the best one that could be easily pirated. I don't know if my math department was just full of pirates, or it that's a general feature of academia.

  I feel like I'm always requesting recommendations but I feel like everything I would recommend here has been discussed a ton.

  So I'm struggling to get through Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. It was recommended by my therapist but I can only read a chapter every few days. Can anyone recommend something similar that isn't as grating? Preferably something focused on better communication and social skills.

  Secondly, I want some good hardcore fantasy like Malazan of the fallen but not as long, if that's possible.

  Thirdly, biopunk. Similar to Twig or something with lots of fridge horror.

    Very good and breezy fantasy: 
    Steven Brust: The Jheregh books are all relatively short, and even if the series as a whole is very long, it is also very episodic - it is not one long story. (he also writes very wordy Dumas pastiches in the same world, but you can just skip those) Also interesting because it is a world where magic has been industrialized to an astounding degree. 

    Scott Lynch, the gentlemen bastards series: Very good, not very long. Elevator pitch : Heist novels, but fantasy.

    Lois Mcmaster Bujold: Penric and Desmonda novellas. 
    These are tiny masterpieces. Bujold is always very good, and these are her taking advantage of digital distribution channels to be good at a length the book market has very little space for (just over a hundred pages per book)

      Second the Penric recommendations.
      ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    *How to Win Friends and Influence People* is actually kind of good if you read it a certain way. There is a sense in which the advice is obvious, but few people actually follow through. It's stuff like actually care about what people are saying. You might try reading it and forcibly suppress the eyerolls, you would probably get a lot out of it if you can do that.

    The INTJ types that hang around here have a hard time with advice on social interactions because the advice isn't intellectually interesting. That kind of practice can't be boiled down to algorithms and we tend to think we already know the heuristics. As an INTJ type who once had poor social skills and now has a wide network of friends and a much enriched life, it ultimately comes down to repeatedly putting yourself out there and attending to the needs of others. It can be intellectually engaging in some respects but not the way we initially want it to be.

      I agree with everything you said. Just as an addendum, myers-briggs is not scientifically proven, and mostly disregarded by the psychological community as a whole.

      You can do some googling, but the only current scientifically accepted personality type system is the Big Five.

  I enjoyed binge-reading the webcomic [Dragon Husbands](http://dragonhusbands.com/) last week. It's a cute gay fantasy story, sometimes NSFW (penises, sex), set on a space colony with a magical underground.

  Also, James Clavell's 1975 novel *Shogun* was good. It's very Neal-Stephenson-esque in that the book shows the effects of a character upon the setting, but the book remains about the character's progression, not the setting's progression, and the setting's major plot is unresolved at the end of the book. It's a very good presentation of culture clash.

  [*Nioh*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/485510) definitely is the most-fun game that I've played in several years, on a level with *Dark Souls 2* and *Crusader Kings 2*. [I've recommended it in the past](https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7obqov/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/ds8ese9/), but here's a supplement to persuade anyone who's heard that it has "too much loot" or "overpowered magic".

  ---

  As I said previously (more or less), *Nioh* is a combination of the cautious combat of *Dark Souls*, the flashy combat of (rebooted) *Ninja Gaiden* and *Dynasty Warriors*, and the equipment effects of *Diablo*. Some people (*e. g.*, Joseph Anderson and Bick Benedict) have complained that the *Diablo* influence is excessive&mdash;that they're paralyzed by the complexity of judging, editing, and equipping items, and that they're annoyed by the necessity of constantly having to dump items out of their overstuffed inventories.

  I really can't see any merit in this complaint. *By no means* does *Nioh* require the player to min-max his equipment's special effects if he wants to be good at the game. If you want to ignore your equipment's effects and focus exclusively on your equipment's level&mdash;to simply equip your highest-level stuff and sell/disassemble/donate/discard your lowest-level stuff&mdash;you can do that without putting yourself at a disadvantage. Indeed, it's actually *recommended* that you *ignore* the special effects on the lowest difficulty level and *refrain* from wasting your money on tinkering with them at the blacksmith, because the equipment that you get on the lowest difficulty level (Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Exotic) isn't completely compatible (for blacksmith purposes) with the stuff that you start getting at New Game Plus (Divine) and at NG+3 (Ethereal). In my estimation, even the *most casual* player, who shuns the blacksmith waifu as if she were a leper, can go all the way through NG+1 without trouble.

  NG+2, I admit, probably *does* have the blacksmith's "soul match" function as a requirement, and I suspect that NG+3 and NG+4 get into the territory of *requiring* min-maxing of equipment effects and magic self-buffs&mdash;but the game is great *even without* those difficulty levels. I've spent my 300 hours of playtime *almost entirely* on NG, NG+1, and NG+2 (in two separate playthroughs), with NG+3 barely started and NG+4 not even unlocked, and with equipment effects and magic self-buffs hardly explored.

  In a similar vein, some people have complained that the magic in *Nioh*&mdash;particularly the Sloth Talisman, which drastically slows down for several seconds all the animations of the enemy who's hit by it, making dodging the enemy's attacks much easier&mdash;is overpowered to the point of sucking the fun out of the game. This may be *close* to true on the lowest difficulty level, but I personally think it's a vastly overblown problem. Yes, you can use the Sloth Talisman to make some bosses into jokes in NG, but you certainly aren't *forced* to do so. In any event, debuff magic like the Sloth Talisman becomes next to worthless on harder NG+ levels (debuff durations on enemies are greatly diminished, to the point that a Sloth Talisman's effect lasts for just a few seconds on a NG+2 boss&mdash;not enough time for you to get much benefit out of it), and you'll be spending most of your time playing on those harder difficulties, so it really doesn't matter.

    Does it play well on mouse+keyboard, or would you say it's a console game mainly?

      > Does it play well on mouse+keyboard?

      The combat of *Nioh* is somewhat faster *and* somewhat more complex than that of *Dark Souls*. If you've successfully played a *Dark Souls* game with mouse and keyboard (ISHYGDDT), I *guess* you could try to play *Nioh* in the same fashion (M&K support was added in a post-launch update), but I wouldn't expect too much success.

      > **Or** would you say it's a console game mainly?

      That's badly worded. Many PC games can accept controller input, and some console games can accept mouse-and-keyboard input.

      For PC, I highly recommend the Xbox One controller. To use it on PC, you'll additionally have to buy the USB adapter&mdash;or the Bluetooth dongle, if you prefer playing wirelessly (and spending money on batteries)&mdash;but it definitely is well worth the money.
      ```

        Yeah, fair that it was badly worded. I just don't like controllers :P

    For what it's worth, some people just don't like having that kind of information present at all. Having it means that you have to spend at least a little bit of effort ignoring it and filtering it out, and some people aren't good at it.

    https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126 By Alexanderwhales is quite popular on this subreddit. Im not the biggest fan of where its been going in recent chapters, but I still follow it and I definitely enjoyed the beginning.

    https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-layer-zero-terminus.587245/ is a great nasuverse SI; per typical fallacies, it’s great writing, great idea, great research...and on hiatus, which prevents it from gaining the first slot.

    The two year emperor by eaglejarl probably also qualifies here, but I think the second part of the plot seriously suffers and won’t give it an unqualified thumbs up

    https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/eye-of-the-gorgon-fate-grand-order-si.610048/ And https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-bottom-of-the-barrel-fate-grand-order-si.640522/ are a pair of F/GO SIs; they’re the only two good FGO SIs i’ve found, unfortunately.

    https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872/1/Vapors and https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine are two fairly solid Naruto SIs, but fair warning I wouldn’t call either one of them even rational adjacent.

    Moving a bit further afeild there is isekai / isekai tensei (to another world / reincarnated in another world) as fairly popular genres, but the main problem is that almost all isekais are complete, irredeemable garbage. I would genuinely reccomend Youjo Senki (+fanfic https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13002064/1/A-Young-Woman-s-Political-Record), and would hesitantly reccomend Overlord just for the writing quality making up for a lot, but that’s pretty much it. I havent really combed isekai that much, though, so there’s almost certainly some middling to good stuff there I missed.

      Sword Art Online is pretty good isekai. Just joking...

      Or am I? I thought the SAO: Progressive light novels were fairly entertaining YA fluff, that fixed most of the inconsistencies in the source material. It's a shame it's probably stopped on book six. Having more focus on Kirito and Asuna's buddy-cop dynamic instead of harem antics really makes the story so much better.

        I agree that SAO abridged is actually, unironically good, but I wouldn't really call it an isekai. Even if you do, though, it's not the kind of isekai ih80takus is looking for.

    I liked https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine though got tired of it after ~100 chapters. It's very angsty though :P

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      Very angsty and obsessed with treading over every single station of canon, including the anime filler. I really don't understand why this keeps getting recommended.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I think it's because it's really old and does most of it naively, rather than the sort of rancid meta-informed angst that populates fanfiction these days (like bashing). Also, while I know following the stations of canon is generally bad, I've yet to see a single story other than Dreaming of Sunshine go through all of the filler, and the author is competent enough that it doesn't feel completely irrelevant, so it gets points for novelty.
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It's just kinda fun. Slow plot is  annoying, but the writing quality hasn't really suffered that much for it and even with the slow pace it's enough to keep me interested; during the earleir parts I would defintiely have reccomended it more enthusiastically but I would still consider it worth the read.

      I have previously stopped reading stories because they were too angsty but I never got annoyed with this one for whatever reason.  One of my favourites.

      Good list. 
      I would add Taskmaster (UK) as my favourite TV show. Its commedians given absurd tasks and they come up with creative solutions or do rediculous things thinking they are creative solutions (which makes for a great show). 
      They are all great but you can start with series 2 (/r/panelshow has links if you can't view it in your country).
