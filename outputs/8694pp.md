## [Challenge Companion] Premortem

### Post:

**tl;dr: this is the companion thread to [the biweekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8693yv/biweekly_challenge_premortem/), post ideas, thoughts, or recommendations here.**

Generally speaking, I don't think you see too much of this sort of thing in fiction, though I think it's pretty ripe for use as a form of exposition. The problem, as far as a the narrative goes, is that the Unspoken Plan Guarantee exists for a reason, and that reason is that we don't want to hear people discuss a plan, then see them carry out that plan exactly as discussed. There are a number of ways of getting around that (e.g. through the use of black swans) but it makes "people go over a plan or course of action in detail" somewhat tricky to pull off.

  This is something that I frequently see high-level Magic: The Gathering players do, especially in situations when they're in a commanding position to win.  The way I often see this phrased is, "How do I lose from this position?"   In asking this question, a player who is on track to win might identify an unlikely-yet-possible avenue by which they could lose a game, and then play in a way to avoid that outcome, often described as "playing around your opponent's outs."  The best players tend to be those who can take a position where they have a 85% likelihood to win, and play in such a way that they convert that into a 100% likelihood to win by cutting off specific possibilities for their opponent to get back into the game rather than going on "auto-pilot" and playing the game in a way that might feel like "winning harder" but doesn't account for the specific contingencies available to their opponent.

  This makes me think of strategies against opponents with some kind of save-scum mechanism e.g. looping in time, antimemetics, reloading new instances of your upload, etc. Develop a plan, then realize that your past selves would also have thought of that, so if it's such a good plan why didn't they already do it successfully?
