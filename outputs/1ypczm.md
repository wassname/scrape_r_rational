  Some of these have been posted here before, but I found some that I hadn't read before so I thought I would share it.

  This has been suggested before, but shouldn't we also be having these sorts of discussions? A single link with a collection of the fiction that was well received in this community that could serve as an introduction to the genre would probably make it easier for people to get started on rationalist fiction.

    We tried to make a TVTropes page once.  I should go check what happened to that.
