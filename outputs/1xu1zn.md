## [D] Romance in Rationalist Fiction

### Post:

The topic seemed appropriate, given the holiday. I don't want to talk specifically about Rationalist Romance, but rather what the title states.

> I'm sorry Jack, but I my friends and I talked it over for sixty minutes by the clock and now uniamously agree that the optimal outcome is for you to be friendzoned for exactly four months while watching me date a series of increasingly suitable males before your heart breaks and you stop following me around like a creep.

  What would be the defining qualities of romance in rationalist fiction? 

  * Clear communication?
  * An honest assessment of strengths/weaknesses/compatibilities/incompatibilities?
  * A rejection of cultural scripts and cached rules?
  * Optimizing for acquiring the best partner?
  * Game theoric dating?
  * Hacking human biases (/r/seduction)?
  ```

    > Clear communication

    Absolutely. I see so many romantic problems in fiction that can be solved by the partners sitting down and talking honestly for five minutes.

      Actually, *bad* communication in relationships in fiction is often so fucking bad that it veers into Contrived Stupidity, so it *definitely* shouldn't appear in rationalfics.

      Alright, well since conflict drives story, what's a romantic problem that can't be easily solved by clear communication? I imagine that if there's to be any tension in a romance in a rationalist fiction, you'd want to have a romance that's ill-fated for some reason - it conflicts with societal views, there are underlying ideological disagreements, biological attraction doesn't match up with stated values?

      I pitched a story idea to a friend awhile back about a modern retelling of Tarzan (in the public domain!) with some steampunk/biopunk trappings, and I realized that it's got the capability to be a good romance, specifically because the inherent tensions internal to Jane that can't be solved by simply sitting down and talking things over.

        My solution was to simply build in really, *really* significant reasons for the two characters who make the most romantic progress to fall in love, namely that one of them has a terminal disease that would get the other executed for hanging out with them, and that the second person is stuck between the most dangerous man in the world and an organization that wants him for his secrets. Either of them rapidly, completely opening up to the other basically guarantees that they would die horribly.

        Of course, the relationship progresses anyway.

          I wish I had something constructive to add to this scenario, but I don't.

          Romance is incredibly low on my list of things I consider desirable in life, so my inner maths went along the lines of "Further progression of this scenario is inoptimal and may result in harm to one or more parties. Optimal solution is to break off contact, and pursue other avenues."

          Which doesn't exactly work as a romantic development.

        Or, have a story that includes strong romantic relationship/s but isn't about them. Brandon Sanderson's *Mistborn* trilogy fits this pattern (by the last book, at least).
        ```

        Easy. 
        Step one : Laverne - being moderately bright, but a shining exemplar of the rationalist virtues of Luminosity, Conscientiousness and Honesty is very good at monogamy. Over 130 years she marries trice, all three unions ending in the untimely demise and subsequent freezing of her spouse. (Traffic, War, lab accident) 
        Step two: The march of progress finally achieves the grail of resurrection of the frozen. 
        Step Three: Drama.

    Brienne and I do 1-4, I know a couple that consensually does 6 on a long-term romantic basis, and I'm not sure what you mean by 5.

    However 1-4 are defining qualities of *rational romance in real life*.  Fiction is about conflict, no exceptions.  I suspect that a good rational romance *story* would need some *actually good reason* for clear communication to not occur, such as somebody being a secret agent.
    ```

    - u/DeliaEris:
      ```
      I think there's room for conflict from the characters being uncertain or mistaken about their own desires. Clear communication of beliefs does not imply clear communication of facts.
      ```

        I like that.  Putting some more human back into rational humanism.

        Rationality doesn't necessarily mean knowing your desires perfectly, although ideally you'd effectively use evidence to narrow in on it.  Changing your beliefs about what you want can be emotional and would be a good internal crisis (which of course should be backed by an external one to tell a good story).

        There's also the problem of zooming in on a local maximum instead of an actual ideal.  Which sounds dry when I put it that way, but if the protagonist is in a happy, committed relationship with someone who closely matches their current idea of an ideal partner, and then they discover someone else who's completely different but better, well, that's rational and a stock romance plot.

        Or to give that one a bit more of an edge^* you could have the protagonist discover someone wildly different, worse than their current partner, but close enough to suggest that someone else like them might be better.  Do you break up with your current partner?  Throw out monogamy?  Do you date the new slightly worse person to learn about that area of potential-partners-space, or wait for an actually better one?

        ^* The  edge is the part of the story you accidentally cut yourself on.

          > Rationality doesn't necessarily mean knowing your desires perfectly

          If we knew our desires perfectly there would be a whole lot of work in a *certain field* we wouldn't have to do at all.
          ```

  I'd find this really difficult to pull off without falling into the "rationalists are emotionless and cold" thing.

  Of course, it doesn't help that I'm an aromantic asexual (nothing to do with my rational-fic fandom, since it far pre-dates that!) and most of my stories, where they have romance, have some nasty twist or other in it.

  Noteworthy examples of love in rationalist fiction:

  * HPMOR's Lucius Malfoy's love for his son. Familial rather than romantic, but very, very touching.
  * Luminosity's Bella and Edward. Not interesting, to me, for romance's sake alone. Interesting because of the worldbuildy predestiny soulmates thing, which turned out to be minorly exploitable [later in the story](#s " when they deliberately showed a mugshot of a kidnapped vampire to a bunch of unattached vampires, *with the intention* of one of them bonding to her and thus persuading her to leave her current situation. Also exploitable because soulbondy pairings turn out to be immune to other relationship-affecting powers.")
  * Got more examples? Feel free to add them in a reply! I can't think of any at the moment.

    > Luminosity's Bella and Edward

    As far as I can tell, Alicorn doesn't think highly of Bella and Edward's relationship in Luminosity. They have to be together *because that's the story*, but there really isn't that much chemistry, either portrayed or intended.

    [The other Bells](http://edgeofyourseat.dreamwidth.org/2121.html) (who seem to have rather more fun) at some point describe Luminosity!Bella as using Edward as "a glorified thought radio" (and thereby, likely, a firewalled container for moral agency, relieving her of the Bad Feelings she'd get from *choosing* to invade other people's minds herself.) Not too romantic, that.
    ```

    - u/LuminousAlicorn:
      ```
      [Effulgence] (#s "I have plans to do some Bell/Edward relationships that I think will show off the virtues of the pairing to better effect in forthcoming Effulgence universes.  (The Animorphs verse is going to have an Edward, too, but in that one the pairing isn't overwhelmingly likely for various reasons having to do with setting details.)")  The way Bells interpret each other's relationships has to do with more factors than how good I think those relationships are!

      [Effulgence] (#s "(Also, after Golden has coins she renders Edward's power voluntary, although we've been doing an inconsistent job of mentioning that, so she's not even doing the thing you're suggesting with the firewalled container for moral agency.")

      Feel free to ask anybell (and anybell's partner(s)) about this and related topics in the [thread for that](http://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8955.html) if you want a more context-free character opinion.

  This actually sounds like a decent way of totally, utterly shutting down a creepy stalker.  It makes you come across as such a Straw Vulcan Ice Queen that you become completely undesirable.

    I was reading [this article](http://lesswrong.com/lw/70u/rationality_lessons_learned_from_irrational/#more) on Less Wrong, and this sounded almost exactly the same:

    > So I broke up with Alice over a long conversation that included an hour-long primer on evolutionary psychology in which I explained how natural selection had built me to be attracted to certain features that she lacked. I thought she would appreciate this because she had previously expressed admiration for detailed honesty.

    Which is really pretty funny.

  There was a comment thread somewhere in here or /r/hpmor a while back about this. I can't find it now.
