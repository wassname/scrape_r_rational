  Ooh, that sounds fun.  [clicks link]  Annnnnd, it's mostly politics.

  I feel palpably disappointed.  I was expecting something more whimsical.

    The later ones became more political, which [unsurprisingly hurt the concept](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/n5xT2RJy2fWxCA3eH/politics-and-awful-art), but if you scroll back you can see the earlier ones were pretty good. Or you can [see some of his most highly upvoted tweets](http://web.archive.org/web/20141206220615/http://favstar.fm/users/hardscifimovies) on the defunct favstar.fm. Some highlights:

    >Using technology a man is imbued with superhuman strength and stamina. He is stripped of all his Tour de France medals.

    >A supervillain plans to hold the world hostage by hacking all Internet. He is unable to clarify his requirements when pressed by IT staff.

    >The dead are returning to life, filled with rage. They are mostly stuck inside underground coffins. Everything is fine.

    >A computer interface requires users to navigate a virtual 3D environment to access files. The designer is ridiculed by his peers and fired.

    >A mathematician finds a message encoded in pi. He goes on to prove that all possible messages are encoded in pi an infinite number of times.

    >Robots design a huge machine to use humans trapped in virtual reality as a power source. After a feasibility study, they opt for wind power.

    >A man is driven to the shores of madness by non-Euclidean horrors he cannot describe. He drops geometry class.

    >A hacker must break the encryption on the explosive device within 60 seconds. This would require a computer the size of Mexico. He dies.

    >A scientist would usurp God, to toy and tinker with the very fabric of life. The resultant kumquats have increased mold resistance.

    >A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, a group of non-humanoids perform actions incomprehensible to we who lack any cultural touchstone.

      Now those are fun, though you can see some of the decay touching as he starts talking about real world people, like Lance Amstrong.

      > A man is driven to the shores of madness by non-Euclidean horrors he cannot describe. He drops geometry class.

      Apropos of absolutely nothing, a long time ago, I played in a comedy TTRPG called *Teenagers from Outer Space* as the son of Cthulhu, whose bottom tier Driving skill was explained by him being unable to understand Euclidean geometry, like traffic lines.

  I don't understand the dislike of the political ones. There's some genuinely great savage humor in there. (Well, I guess I can understand it from certain angles, such as "I don't like thinking about this because my primary coping mechanism is avoidance, not humor". It's just that my primary coping mechanism is in fact humor.)

  If anything, it's the most anodyne/least-referential ones that fall flat for me. The Tour de France joke is great because of what it skewers and because of the context of the joke, and the kumquats one is great because of the broader (political!) context of Christian naturalism and opposition to GMOs; the "dead are returning to life" one isn't particularly funny because there's no *there* there, the bomb defuse decoding one isn't particularly funny because rivet counting isn't all that funny.

  (That said, the message encoded in pi one is my absolute favorite in part because it's the kind of joke I save up for when my daughter is old enough to appreciate it, and by appreciate I mean hate me for it.)

    Apart from the aforementioned ["Politics and Awful Art"](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/n5xT2RJy2fWxCA3eH/politics-and-awful-art), where political jokes are held to a lower standard than non-political jokes, there's also the problem that you will only like the political tweets if you happen to agree with the author's politics. If you support Donald Trump and George Zimmerman, you won't find "A con-artist uses reality television and the intelligence apparatus of a foreign autocracy to win the Presidency of the United States" or "In a violent America, select individuals may pursue, judge and execute people on the spot. They are known as Neighborhood Watch Coordinators" very funny. Whereas everyone on r/rational can agree that "When a test pilot crashes his plane, scientists decide to rebuild him. They have the technology. Their efforts allow an open-casket funeral" and "A wealthy playboy scientist invents a powerful robotic suit for the military. The suit proves invaluable in quickly unloading cargo" are hilarious regardless of their opinions on _The Six Million Dollar Man_ and _Iron Man_.

      I don't find the argument in the linked "Politics and Awful Art" to be compelling, but I don't have any interest in arguing with a third party's opinion.

      "The political jokes are disliked by people who disagree with their premise" is fair enough, though.

    ```
    The bomb defuse one is mocking a specific movie, *Swordfish*, and the message in pi is from the ending of the book version of *Contact*.
    ```
