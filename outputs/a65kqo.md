## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Slay the Spire is a wonderful deck-builder roguelike game (and as it's exiting early access with a price hike next month, I can highly recommend getting it now or during the winter sale before then). Some time ago, the devs decided that they wanted to include a "beta art" mode to allow players to use the shitty mspaint placeholders that the devs had used, but there was a problem: some art was unusable due to copyright concerns, some art had been misplaced, and some cards had never had shitty art to begin with.

  So the devs held an open contest and let people submit shitty mspaint art for any cards that needed it. I made some eight submissions, and six of them made it in.

  Here are the submissions I made ("real" art on the left, beta art on the right) :

  I have to say, it's pretty fuggin cool to see something I made be immortalized into an actual game like this.

    Sadistic nature and the two strike cards are fantastic. Beam cell is also pretty darn good.

    Yeah, I play the daily almost every day. It's my favorite game of the last few years, and the one that I play the most consistently (in part because it's an hour and then done with not terribly much compulsion to turn a scheduled hour of playtime into five or six hours).

      *sideways glance* Uh... yeah... Good thing that never happens... *coughs*

      Five or six hours is extreme, but I've definitely had runs terminate in some bullshit that incensed me enough to start a new one and at least get back to where I was. I clearly lack discipline, and once I beat Ascension 15 on everyone and checked out Act 4 I decided to uninstall. Super fun game though.

    Those are awesome, nice job! The two Defect strikes in particular made me laugh.

    I am *loving* Slay the Spire. It's fantastic.

    Fantastic game, and incredible money to entertainment value. If anyone is slightly interested in rouguelikes or deck building go watch "NorthernLion" on youtube play the game. Watching his mistakes single handedly made me buy it and I'm glad they did!

    Also your artwork is hilarious!

    That *is* pretty fuggin cool.

    Seconding the recommendation for *Slay the Spire*. It's got an excellent blend of chance and strategy.

  Only 7 chapters in so far, but [RE: Trailer Trash](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash) is pretty good. (Congratulations to the author for making the best rated page on RR! Well earned.)

  The title pretty much says it all as far as the plot, and like many redo stories it could be considered a little Mary Sue like, but it's well done and doesn't go for the silly/comedic feel that you might think it would.

  Anyone else have literary pet peeves? Parts or styles of literature that you understand but hate?

  Two for me are: too many points of view and non-linear stories.

  Too many points of view: stories with a large number of characters is absolutely fine with me but I tend to highly prefer books with one point of view character and actively avoid any with more than five. Something about the constant character swapping, usually during cliffhanger moments, makes me go through phases of "I'm really interested in this character/part why leave?" and "I don't care about or enjoy this character, do I really want to read their part?" Books that have multiple points of view but don't swap back and forth don't bother me as much but can still get into this.

  Nonlinear stories: This one kills me with Kurt Vonnegut specifically. I understand the point of it but this really makes me want to sit down and try to create a timeline to place each of the stories on but I'm not going to do this and I think looking one up shouldn't be needed to better enjoy the story. Even for nonlinear stories I enjoy this ranges from "Huh this must be before/after this other part" to "Ugh this doesn't seem to make sense based on this other part?!"

  Having written this out I think the common denominator is that I believe these styles detract from the reading experience itself in order to enhance post reading enjoyment. These styles are also commonly used to create cheap shocking moments and tension, but I don't think that's an inherent part of them.

    My problem is almost never with the fact that there are too many characters, it's that one of them is boring, unlikeable, or just not my thing. *Normally* if I ran into a problem like that, I would just put the book down and move on to something else, but in the case of a book with multiple viewpoints, I feel compelled to slog through the thing that I don't like so that I can understand the thing that I'm reading for.

    I think my biggest pet peeve with books is when they take too long to get going. I'm fine with a slow burn, at least to some extent, but that's somewhat distinct from spending too much time on setting things up, or just a stylistic choice to be slice-of-life for eight chapters before the plot actually gets moving.

    Opposite this, I also tend to hate action prologues, especially if they're followed by a flashback to the actual start of the story. To me, that just smacks of bad pacing and a lack of faith in the reader. (Much more common in movies than books though.)

    The constant swapping in Game of thrones really killed the book for me once I realized I was just slogging through everything until I got to an Arya chapter.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    My strategy when reading Vonnegut was to just let it wash over me. If I didn't understand what was happening, I assumed I wasn't meant to and just kept going.

  I have been reading light novels again. This week it is The Rising of the Shield Hero. I highly recommend it. It is not rational but it is smart. It can be found here https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ht04kyuro88vmf1/AADXv2rgLQBcrZ7MN3_a9rFFa?dl=0

  If you want to get into light novels check out /r/LightNovels and/or pm me.
  If you have read shield hero tell me what you think of it.

  - u/JohnKeel:

    I'd like to un-recommend Shield Hero, personally. It feels like the setting is designed purely to justify the main character's hatred/fear of women, to the point where it's unreadable without making me wonder what the hell happened to the author. Everything bad that happens to the MC is either directly done by a woman or caused by a woman (in extreme ways to boot), and it's just... gross the way the story deals with that.

    Especially bad but more subtle is when the slave the MC has purchased is freed by the people who hate him because they think he's mistreating her. Her response is to tell them off because he isn't, which is fine... but instead of going on to experience character development where the two of them can interact without the control of slavery, she GOES BACK TO BEING HIS SLAVE, and it's presented as a good thing.

      Agree.

      I read that as her saying she wanted to stay with him but knew he was to fucked in the head to trust her without the slave seal/brand.

      What is it with isekai/LN and slavery? It's at the point where they're lampshading it: "oh, I'm in a fantasy world? Right-o, off to the slave markets." I don't seem to see this in even the most gary-stuesque of the western self-inserts.
      ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    The shield hero manga is pretty solid, although not spectactular. 

    Amateur translated LNs almost always piss me off because the authors try to stick really close to the original work, and sacrafice entertainment for accuraccy. Pretty much the only amateur translation I've seen done well is for Kumo Desu Ga. In all honesty most manga translators aren't that much better, but the visual humor carries more of the story's weight.
    ```

    I liked it.  It was kind of ridiculous, making characters exaggeratedly cruel just for the purpose of making his revenge more justified, but fine, I can tolerate that given how good the story is most of the time.  I like stories with main characters who have clear and consistent character flaws that skews their perceptions in ridiculous and funny ways.  I liked "The Seventh Horcrux" Harry Potter fanfic for similar reasons.

    If you haven't already read it, I recommend Mushoku Tensei, as it kind of felt similar to the Shield Hero story, though without all the revenge stuff, and is less gamified.
