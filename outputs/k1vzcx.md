## Conversations with Level 3 Intelligent Characters

### Post:

If you’re anything like me, when you read something with particularly vivid characters, their voices stick around with you for days or weeks after you finish the book. After finishing HPMOR, for example, I had a cynical professor following me around everywhere going, *Ah, perhaps you only pretend to care about brushing your teeth. Tell me, have you actually investigated whether Colgate Whitening Plus with Fruity Mint Flavor is truly the ideal toothpaste, or do you only use it because it is expected of you?*

Similarly, I live with a grumpy yet remarkably insightful policeman every time I finish a Vimes book. Revisiting *Huckleberry Finn* gives me the company of a boy lacking book smarts but with a remarkable ability to see the moral truth right in front of his nose (and very good tips about fishing and good living). 19th century romance novels tend to give me matronly women evaluating potential romantic partners for me on the basis of their economic and social suitability. (This last one is surprisingly useful.)

I just finished reading [Strong Female Protagonist](https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/), the superhero webcomic our society needs but *definitely* doesn’t deserve, and as a consequence there’s a blonde invincible chick in my head who wants to know whether writing stupid things for the Internet is *really* the best way for me to spend my time.

It’s great. Go read the first three chapters because I’m about to spoil them, and it’s great so you should just read it first.

Seriously, go read it. Reddit will still be here when you get back. I promise—NAY, I PRECOMMIT—to upvote your comment if you take a month to reply because you were reading the first three chapters.

*******************

*Strong Female Protagonist*, or SFP from here on, becomes full-blown rational*ist* fiction in chapter three, and I’m going to spend half of this essay just gushing about it.

Chapter three sees our main character and Super(wo)man stand-in, Alison Green, on a road trip with her mind-reading Lex Luthor of a boyfriend, Patrick, to visit an old friend of hers. On the way, Alison and Patrick bond over conversation about movies, burgers, and the dark recesses of the human soul. Their trip takes them into the heart of the South, and they are unpleasantly greeted at the hospital they arrive at by a Christian receptionist with a decidedly Satanic attitude. Patrick informs Alison that his telepathy, which he cannot control, direct, or turn off, has uncovered an important secret of the person they’re visiting. Alison thanks him and goes in alone to see her old friend, Feral.

Feral is a regenerator, basically Wolverine on steroids. You can stick a sword in her face and she’ll just find it annoying. She stops dudes from getting away by chopping off her own feet to stuff in the tailpipes of their cars. Alison and Feral once teamed up to fight crime, where Alison’s straight-laced comic-book seriousness made for an odd-couple clash with Feral’s drinking, smoking, cursing, fuck-the-plan-and-let-me-at-’em ways, but as they eat bullets and throw shoes at psychics together, they realize they have a lot in common and develop a friendship.

So Feral kisses Alison, Alison punches Feral through a window, and with all of the psychics defeated, they part ways. While Alison is busy being the poster child for what government-controlled child superheroes should be, Feral’s life falls apart. Her local support group collapses, and Feral isn’t good at anything except not dying. She makes a lot of bad decisions and hurts a lot of people while she tries to figure out her life—or rather, tries to figure out how to die.

Then she turns on the TV and sees Alison do what Alison does in chapter 2: quit.

Basically, the inciting event of SFP is the one where Alison Green aka Mega Girl aka Girl Superman declares on live national television that being a superhero is stupid. Having defeated all of the giant robots and clown-themed bank robbers before the start of the story, she announces that her expertise on punching things really hard does not translate into expertise on solving all of the remaining problems of poverty, social justice, hatred, politics, and emotional issues—all of the problems that *actually exist*, instead of being invented by an author for the sake of exciting comic book battles.

Alison takes off the mask and goes to college to learn how to solve all of the world’s problems, which is the expected skill set of a recent college graduate. And Feral, having experienced her own life problems totally failing to be solved by her superhero lifestyle, decides to do the other thing you can do instead of going to college, which is take a year off to explore the world.

Feral travels. Having never really been out of the Deep South before, has her mind blown by the kinds of things she sees and the people she meets in Europe and Asia. And because she’s a regenerator, when her mind is blown, it comes back together, bigger and better than before.

There are two really significant experiences Feral has while overseas, as she explains to Alison in her hospital room. One is simply seeing all the different ways that people with powers (“anomalies,” as they’re called in the comic) are treated depending on the culture. In America, everyone is expected to be a superhero and fight crime. In Western Europe, you’re expected to be a normal person who might be able to fly or turn invisible or something. In India, you’re a deity involved in some complex cultural conflict. 

And second, Feral sees a *lot* of poor people. She meets a tremendous number of people suffering in all kinds of ways, and she has no idea how to help them.

Because there’s no one to beat up, and yet that's the only problem-solving skill she has.

So in the span of just a few pages we watch Feral’s worldview alter radically. Her sense of the size of the world, and the amount of suffering in it, expands from her hometown in Mississippi to something global in scale. And between Alison’s public declaration and the different ways people with superpowers behave around the world, Feral starts to realize that she doesn’t have to conceive of her anomaly as something that’s only useful for fighting.

She starts to connect these ideas: *What can I do about all this suffering?* and *What can I do with my power?*

The conversation ends. Alison meets back up with Patrick, whose telepathy has uncovered the full details of Feral’s plan. Patrick explains that Feral plans to spent the rest of her life in perpetual surgery, her organs constantly being harvested to donate to needy people to save as many lives as possible. This plan will require her to be in constant agony and leave her no time whatsoever for anything remotely resembling a personal life. She is to become an organ farm for the human race.

Alison is understandably horrified. But after getting over her initial shock, her subsequent conversation with Patrick reveals that her problem with Feral’s decision isn’t the size of Feral’s sacrifice but rather how *little* it will accomplish. Donating organs will save lives but do nothing to address the poverty and institutional problems that makes saving those lives necessary in the first place.

Tired of having the most depressing conversations in the universe, Alison flirts over Loony Tunes, steals all the chocolate in the world, and goes to bed. 

Alison and Patrick return to the hospital the next day, where they are greeted by the sight of a group of protesters. These protesters are a bunch of white, angry Deep South Christians protesting the donation of superpowered organs. They are portrayed in a deliberately stereotypical fashion: the spitting image of the sort of “real American” Christian whose ignorance of science is only exceeded by their ignorance of the Bible—the protesters helpfully carry signs that say things like “Share the Body of Christ, Not the Body of Satan” and “Not what the Founding Fathers wanted.” Alison, a liberal, college-going New Yorker, is about as interested in their ideas as you’d expect.

Anyway, Alison goes in to the hospital to try to talk Feral out of her plan. There’s also another powered individual there that Feral knows from London, a teleporter named Johnny trying to talk her out of it as well, albeit from a very different perspective than Alison. Alison and Johnny argue, Feral declares her intention to follow through with her idea despite their objections, and says her goodbyes. Many tears are shed. But not by me. Because I am very tough and do not cry.

While Alison and Johnny continue their debate out in the lobby, Feral is strapped down to begin the never-ending operation. The receptionist from earlier lets a masked man in through the back who barges into Feral’s operating room with a flamethrower, incinerating the doctors and Feral (though the latter recovers.)

Alison bursts in and one-punches the man through a wall, killing him. She then goes out to the protesters, identifying their attitude as the driving force behind the attack on Feral and the doctors, and threatens to murder them all if they don’t give up the people behind the attack. A police officer tries to arrest her. She eats his gun.

Patrick attempts to calm her down by pointing out that he can blackmail these people much more efficiently than she can intimidate them. Finally, Feral’s still-regenerating body crawls out to put herself between Alison and the scared fuckhead protesters. Alison takes a chill pill and the chapter ends with her visiting a supervillain to talk about her fantasies of mass murder and finally her megalomaniacal desire to make the world as good a place as it can possibly be. Yay!

With the events summarized, there’s a lot of amazing things about this chapter from a rationalist fiction perspective and I’m just going to talk about some of them in no particular order.

******************

Ideological Conflict

https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/empathyrespect https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/moral-conflicts  https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/realistic-viewpoints 

One of the most obviously impressive things about SFP is the realistic and engaging ideological disputes in which conflicting viewpoints are all represented in ways that feel very honest and real. There are various examples throughout the chapter, but the clearest one is the debate between Alison, Feral, and Johnny in the hospital room about the moral correctness of Feral’s decision.

Alison, Feral, and Johnny are extremely different people. Alison is a trained, experienced soldier with great parents and a great education. She’s intelligent, caring, and just a *teensy* bit fed up with the way the world is. Feral, meanwhile, is poorly educated and grew up in the poverty of the Deep South. She’s as broken up by her lack of faith in her own ability to make the world a better place as she is by all of the suffering in said world that needs to be made better.

Finally, Johnny is a London fashion designer. He’s wealthy, cool, and all about enjoying the life that’s given to you. He’s also a teleporter, but as he makes clear, this is of secondary importance when describing him.

Alison and Johnny are both here to talk Feral out of her plan, but from completely different points of view. Hilariously, they end up arguing with each other more than with Feral.

Basically, Alison thinks Feral’s plan doesn’t go far enough. Feral’s plan doesn’t solve poverty or death or institutional problems that preserve poverty and shitty health care systems. And it sets an impossible bar for self-sacrifice that other people won't be able to meet. Meanwhile, Johnny totally rejects Feral’s selflessness—as he says, “Your life is nobody else’s to lead. You don’t owe those fucking people anything.”

Alison politely invites Johnny to go fuck himself. Feral jumps in to defend Johnny’s right to share his viewpoint—from Alison’s perspective and ours, Johnny is an intruder, but from *Feral’s* perspective, Johnny is a close friend she invited to be here to say goodbye to. Alison tries to further articulate what’s wrong with Feral’s plan: “Give a man a heart, and then what? Watch him get obliterated in the next ethnic cleansing or natural disaster.” 

That's when Johnny decides that Alison has jumped the shark. Of *course* Feral is doing the right thing. That’s the problem! He blames Alison for infecting Feral with do-gooder morality: “My God, stop! Can’t you see you’ve already got her ass-over-tea-kettle with your nonsense?”

Feral rejects both of their viewpoints. She can’t be self-centered like Johnny. And as she tells Alison, “I know you wanna fix it so the day stays saved forever. But it might not shake out that way, and until it does, the rest of us got helpin’ to do.” 

That’s the end of the conversation. To me, what’s most impressive and most subtle about it is how intensely emotional it is. Each character clearly has an ideological viewpoint—Alison’s “figure out the best possible thing and do it,” Johnny’s “Obsessing over morality fucks everything up, live for yourself,” and Feral’s “I’m going to do what I can to help people right now.” Yet while these perspectives are presented unambiguously, no one ever lectures or sounds like a typed-up explanation of a particular point of view. Instead, they all struggle to articulate themselves, cut each other off, and express their perspectives in ways unique to their own personalities and the details of the situation at hand. In particular, Alison and Johnny end up arguing with each other more than with Feral even though they share the goal of talking Feral out of her plan because they find each other so morally incomprehensible.

But the *writer* must have comprehended both of them in order to write them. 

They’re all quite persuasive, too.

Reproducible cognitive development

https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent 
https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent

When we are introduced to Feral, we learn two things about her very quickly: one is that she’s violent and backwards and barely aware of, let alone concerned about the bigger picture, and two is that she’s quite intelligent. 

(We also learn that she’s all kinds of gay, but that’s not relevant to this essay. It *is* relevant to my forthcoming essay: “Rationalist Fiction: Gay As All Hell?”) 

So despite the fact that Alison went to a good school and has modern liberal parents who invested every economic and emotional resource they could into her whereas Feral grew up in the Third World of the United States, they develop a chemistry and a rapport. Alison is a nerd, as Feral repeatedly observes, whereas Feral spends her time in bars and has lots of sex, and yet Alison is ultimately quite comfortable in Feral’s company, and a big part of that is because Feral is smart enough for Alison to enjoy talking to her.

But Alison is taking on threats around the globe whereas Feral is taking on threats around her neighborhood. So they don’t see each other for a while. Feral, like most people, ends up conforming to the standards of her peer group, which unfortunately is quite low. Her local gang of powered buddies are drug users or violent criminals or just plain losers. Until finally, seeing that Alison has gone to college—basically a foreign country in and of itself to Feral’s catlike eyes—she decides to get out of the United States and see the world.

Feral’s journey consists of about five pages depending on when you want to start counting. Yet the *experience* it conveys rings incredibly true to me as someone who also traveled the world and found it mind-opening. Instead of deciding to sacrifice my own welfare to provide the world’s entire organ supply, I chose to write dumb reddit posts, but otherwise it was basically the same thing.

So much about Feral’s gradually evolving mindset is conveyed in such a tight space that it allows the reader to go along with her while being thoroughly entertained. One way you could state the basic concept of a Level 1 -> 2 -> 3 intelligent character is that they represent increasing levels to which you can follow along with the character’s thoughts without something going wrong.

A level 1 character is someone whose thoughts you can follow without breaks—someone whose thoughts are continuous (but not necessarily differentiable). They don’t just stop thinking or suddenly swerve in some unexplainable way to make the story work. 

A level 2 character is someone whose thoughts you can follow along with and be genuinely impressed by their intelligence because their thoughts did something with the details of the story that your own thoughts didn’t but in retrospect probably should have.

A level 3 character is someone whose thoughts are so imbued with a helpful cognitive pattern, or whose thoughts evolve from something common but not helpful to something uncommon and remarkably more useful, that the simple act of reading their thoughts can reproduce said pattern or prompt said evolution in the mind of the reader.

Note that in this definition a level 3 intelligent character can be stupider than a level 2 character. Feral is not a genius; she’s smart enough to keep up with someone going to a decent private school and that’s all.

(Then there are level 4 intelligent characters. These are characters written so vividly, whose intelligence is represented *so* faithfully on the page that they actually *are* intelligent and can, with time and resources, escape the boundaries of their book bindings. There is only one rule for level 4 intelligent characters: NEVER WRITE LEVEL 4 INTELLIGENT CHARACTERS!) 

I’ve never tested this—and am totally not a hypocrite—but I’d imagine that Feral’s story could genuinely help a lot of people experience the same kind of development that she did. It’s easy for me to imagine a young person reading this story and using Feral’s journey to take themselves out of their local concerns and into the realm of thinking about global issues and serious moral questions.

Within the comic itself, the test of Feral’s level 3ness (do *NOT* start going around evaluating characters by whether they are level 1, 2, or 3 intelligent, it is NOT THE POINT!) is that *Alison* can follow her thoughts and receive Feral’s cognitive patterns to such an extent that Alison can use them to learn about her own reasons for disagreeing with Feral.

(Feral can be wrong because her evolved cognitive pattern is a *useful improvement* over her previous one which saw her in a downward spiral, but hardly represents the best or only way to think. Saying that a character has level 3 intelligence is an *empirical assertion*, not a *compliment*.) 

Alison talks it over with her telepathic buddy Patrick, whose mind-reading skills help him to articulate thoughts that she’s too emotionally overwhelmed by to discuss. To wit, Feral’s cognitive evolution constitutes going from *animal-like selfishness* with no greater understanding and no moral concerns beyond securing her local environment to *global moral concern*—or, as Patrick puts it, “trying to save the world.” And in perceiving that this is how Feral thinks, Alison, through Patrick, is able to recognize that her thinking has gone beyond saving the world to *changing* it.

In other words, Alison learns by exploring her model of Feral’s mind, which she’s able to do because there *is* a model of Feral’s mind which is strong enough to reproduce Feral’s mental patterns when tested against ideas that do *not* come from Feral’s mind.

Writing the alien

> You have to comprehend Draco as a truly alien intelligence, sapient and capable of complex language use, yet so extremely different from life as you know it that he doesn’t even know what a gene is. You have to leave the comfortable confines of your own mind and enter a mind with different concepts and heuristics, a mind that is still a powerful intelligence even though it doesn’t agree with you about certain things. 

(Read the comic up through chapter three before you let me spoil this one for you. It’s genuinely a great moment in comics, web-based or other.)

When Alison and Patrick get started on their road trip, Alison wants to put on some music because she is a human being. Patrick, a telepath who cannot turn off his telepathy, requests something without lyrics. He finds it disconcerting to hear a human voice without being able to hear the thoughts behind it. Similarly, he hates watching movies and TV because he can see people moving and talking but he cannot hear their thoughts.

After their emotionally draining conversation about Feral’s plan and some other horrific stuff, Alison decides they are going to watch some TV. Patrick protests that he hates watching people on a screen, so Alison has a bright idea and puts on Loony Tunes. Patrick, who had a bit of a rough childhood, has never seen a cartoon before. He studies the screen intently as the classic gag plays out in front of him: Bugs Bunny versus Daffy Duck as they debate who is to be blasted in the face by the hunter, Elmer Fudd. Daffy Duck insists it is rabbit season, Bugs Bunny declares it to be duck season instead. They go back and forth with the intensity of Federer and Nadal: Rabbit season! Duck season! Rabbit season! Duck season! Suddenly a switch: Bugs Bunny says rabbit season. Daffy Duck is so caught up in the pattern of contradicting Bugs that he declares it to be duck season. Moreover, he announces that he's done with the argument, and so promptly gets shot in the face.

And Patrick bursts out laughing. He cracks up like a crazy person. It’s literally the funniest thing he’s ever seen. Because Patrick is a telepath, jokes cannot surprise him. He always sees the punchline coming. And watching live action movies or TV just feels wrong. But a *cartoon*? He’s not expecting to be able to read Bugs Bunny’s mind. And so the joke hits him with enough shock to reduce him to tears.

(Also, pay attention, fellas: It’s at the moment of him loving Loony Tunes with an undiminished boyish passion that Alison starts making *eyes* at Patrick. More webcomic-based dating tips to follow!)

*******************

Uh.

I don’t really have a strong conclusion. This essay was originally going to be about all of the ideological conflict in SFP but just working on its presence in chapter 3 turned into this. And there’s something about writing 4000 words about this webcomic that constitutes a self-refuting act: how can Feral be a level 3 intelligent character when I read her story and then wrote *this* instead of, like, donating my kidney?

But the writer and artist probably didn’t donate their kidneys either. What a pair of jerks!

Alison lives in my head right now, and I’m going to make her pay rent, damn it: If I don’t get a hundred upvotes, I’m kicking her out on her broke ass. 

So while the main point of this essay is that you should go read SFP, the other point is something I don’t really understand about the point of literature, which is to collect voices in your head. Because there are level 3 characters who will make you stronger, but there are also level negative 3 characters whose thought processes will reproduce themselves in your mind *evilly*, like a wasp laying its eggs inside you. These are thought processes which will make you angry and stupid and selfish and a victim of your own mind. 

The purpose of reading—the whole dang point of it, I’m going to unjustifiably assert here—is to collect voices in your head for the sake of using them to augment your powers, pretty much exactly like equipping the right Charms in Hollow Knight for the next boss. Some Charms will give you the ability to fly and shoot laser beams and become invulnerable—metaphorically speaking—and others will drain your health and sap your will to fight.

I also realize that some people probably don’t have voices in their heads just like some people don’t have images in their heads, and the empirical implication of my above assertion is that these people don’t read, and that probably isn’t true, so I guess I’m wrong.

but, um

At the end of the chapter, Alison visits her old nemesis, Cleaver, a mass murderer, a bladed, mutated monstrosity and one of a very small number of people who’s even remotely a match for her physically, inside his specially designed prison. I’m gonna let Mega Girl close this one out.

> And here’s the thing, Cleaver! [I’m not really that different from you.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent) I look like how I look and you look like how you look. The people that were supposed to take care of you didn’t. The people that were supposed to take care of me did. It wouldn’t surprise me if there were only a handful of moments, a handful of decisions that make up the difference between you and me.

> Why are you telling me this?

> Because I know what it’s like to feel alone. I know what it’s like to live in a paper world, to be good at hurting people, to think everybody should just shut up and do what you say. And then I remember that deep down, people are good, everybody’s trying and nobody deserves respect just for being powerful. So if I’ve got the voice in my head that tells me to crush people, then I think you probably have the voice that says the other thing too. If people keep calling us heroes and villains, they’ll never know how close we came to listening to the other voice all those times.

>...

> Mega Girl! If people were as good as you say they are, they’d know it’s your choice to help them. If your parents hadn’t raised you to be a good little girl, they’d be fucked. The only reason their world makes sense is because you keep it that way. Do you really think they deserve all of this?

> No. They deserve better.

  Ugh! This sentence made me twitch in annoyance.

  I love what you have written here and SFP is fantastic in how it portrays moral difficulties and ethical debates, but you are using that word wrong!

  Precommitment does NOT mean to firmly promise something that you will follow through no matter what. It requires imposing an outside force which will force you to follow through on your promise no matter what, even if you yourself change your mind and try to break the promise.

  Odysseus precommited to ignoring the sirens by tying himself to his mast, instead of promising really hard that he wouldn't jump overboard. Couples are precommiting to who gets what in a divorce by writing up a prenup instead of just relying on a verbal promise before marriage. Harry is precommiting to save the world as safely as possible at the end of HP:MOR because he's under an Unbreakable Vow which makes it impossible to take any action which would doom the world.

  You'd be precommiting if you had a friend who will perform the upvoting based on posting times even if you asked them to do otherwise in the future, instead of saying you'll do an upvote yourself.

  What you are doing is just regular promising aka everyday commitment.

  Nothing against you personally, just a pet peeve of mine when I see that word misused.

  I really can't see SFP as rationalist fiction. The entire premise is to take the author’s political biases and to raise them up as something good. Having a gay character selflessly agree to torture herself infinitely for people who hate her only for the evil conservatives to flamethrower the doctors is so blatant that I cannot overlook it. There is also a serial killer who is treated as sympathetic because she only kills rapists and the only conservative hero is, of course, a secret rapist. But that aside...

  Yes, the main character ponders about how to fix the world, but cynically declaring that small scale acts of kindness are pointless if they don’t fix the whole is *not* rational. And after telling Feral that donating organs won't fix anything, what is her own solution? Setting up a woman’s shelter. Yes, that’s right, the optimal thing for a superhero to do in a world full of magic and super technology that could fix everything is... to set up a woman’s shelter.

  Not to use her fame to raise money for women’s shelters, mind you. No, she has to do it personally or else it’s not noble enough. She can’t just tour the country and convince people to donate to effective altruism charities, no. She has to personally build up yet another woman’s shelter because she is a strong female protagonist and it’s part of her *identity*, gosh darnit.

  Not even a shelter that allows men, in recognition of the fact that abused men receive less support. Oh no, it can't be anything that would make the reader uncomfortable. The *optimal* thing for our heroine to do is to reinforce precisely those biases that the intended audience already has.

  I read the story to completion, so it’s obviously not bad. It’s well written and has good art. But it’s also a cautionary tale of what rational fiction should precisely not be.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    The main character doesn't have to be a perfectly rational being for the work to be rationalist. The premise of the story is that Alison is trying to figure out how to be and do good, not that she's an ethics genius who already knows how. Her points of view on morally sticky topics like Feral's organ donation are presented alongside strongly argued opposing points of view, not framed as obviously correct. She makes mistakes in her actions and reasoning and tries to learn from them. It's not irrational to write characters who are human enough to sometimes act or think irrationally.

    I also think your description of the "rapist serial killer" arc is misleading. It's not framed like "oh it's totally fine because she only kills rapists." The character is depicted as someone who has built up a moral framework that she views as internally consistent and that comes from an understandable emotional place, but that is ultimately harmful and hypocritical. If she'd been written as a one-dimensional straw villain whose motives were totally unsympathetic, then she might as well just exist in a regular superhero comic instead of one whose "battles" are mostly ethics debates.

    My own interest in writing this essay is to express how SFP excels at certain qualities which would be of interest as useful examples to anyone trying to write their own rationalist fiction. Those qualities can be used to express any kind of cultural or intellectual ideals.
    ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    I thought about what you've said, and I think I agree that there is a bias, but I don't agree with your conclusion. I think it still classifies as rational (and even rationalist) fiction. 

    If I'm going off sidebar definition, then it hits most of the points. If I go off "rational fiction is what the subreddit thinks is rational fiction", then SFP has been recommended multiple times.

    There was a point raised a while ago, that fiction shouldn't be excluded from 'rational fiction' for being bad. That for the distinction of rational to be as useful as possible, it should include both good and bad fiction in it.  

    I would say "SFP is a rational fiction, but has attributes that detract from it", or even "SFP isn't perfect, and some of the ideologies should be taken with a grain of salt", and these are sentences I could apply to any rational fiction.
    ```

    - u/Sophronius:
      ```
      But SFP isn't bad - I liked it. It's just explicitly anti-rational. The fact that it's thoughtful and deals with issues related to rationality does not change the fact that it comes to the exact opposite conclusion.

      Let's go through it point by point:

      \-SFP does not have characters creatively applying their knowledge and resources. It's explicitly about a character \*rejecting\* their unique advantages and refusing to use them because they feel guilty about having them. This is anti-rational.

      \-There is no satisfying intelligent solution to the problems SFP brings up. Like I said, "build a women's shelter" is not an answer to "the fundamental problems in the world." Dismissing organ donation because it doesn't solve oppression is a straight-up rejection of utilitarianism.

      \-The powers are treated as magical, and more importantly, the characters don't try to exploit them in any meaningful way.

      SFP is a cautionary tale precisely because it \*feels\* rational at times, by bringing up rationalist-adjacent topics and having smart-sounding characters spend thousands of words talking about them. But optimizing to \*feel\* as if you're doing something is exactly what true rationality teaches us not to do. You're supposed to optimize for the real thing.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        >It's explicitly about a character *rejecting* their unique advantages and refusing to use them because they feel guilty about having them.

        That isn't accurate. She didn't stop using her powers because she felt guilty about having them; she chose to retire from *traditional superheroics* because she didn't think she was effecting meaningful change by punching things really hard. She still uses her powers and the story is about her trying to figure out *how* to best use her powers to accomplish good, hitting various pitfalls and encountering a variety of conflicting philosophical perspectives along the way. 

        Regarding "dismissing organ donation"--spoilers ahead, but she ultimately doesn't convince Feral not to go through with it, it's made clear that her initial opposition is based in emotion and in an acknowledged blind spot she has re: preferring idealized "one-punch" solutions to partial-yet-significant steps forward, and she later doubles down hard on helping Feral donate organs at an even faster rate, so I don't know where you get the idea that the *comic* is saying organ donation is a pointless or inadequate path to utility. Hell, when they get to the big moral conflict over whether it's acceptable to force people to cooperate to maximize utility, helping Feral donate more organs *is* the utility maximization end of that equation. I feel like you're taking the main character's flawed perspective at one point in her development as the authorial voice stating what is Objectively Right, and I don't think the comic has ever framed her as a moral authority in that way.

        Finally,
        >the characters don't try to exploit them in any meaningful way.

        You yourself mentioned the organ donation thing. There are other examples too. Off the top of my head, Patrick using his mind-reading capabilities to "copy" other people's skills, languages, etc, and Alison applying Max's power to Feral's instead of making him make her even better at punching or whatever. It's true that not *every* character tries to exploit their powers creatively, much like not every real-life person would do so if they had powers.

          I'll admit it's been a while since I read it, but what does the protagonist do with her powers, then? I don't remember any analysis of the new power she gets halfway into the story, or any attempt to exploit it. She doesn't try to learn the science of it either IIRC. Superpowers are mostly treated the way zombies are treated in "pride and prejudice and zombies" - a way to spice up a story that doesn't really need them.

          You're right that Feral's organ harvesting is an example of munchkining. But first of all, it's something you can come up with after 5 seconds of thinking. Secondly, I got the distinct vibe that Feral was doing it out of self-loathing and self pity. I mean... here we have a depressive and suicidal character subjecting herself to infini-torture. It just doesn't strike me as an action that's optimized for helping people. And the fact that it's a gay woman (of color?) doing it, who is then torched by evil conservatives for her trouble? Ehhhhh.... that doesn't seem like the authors were trying to teach the readers a lesson in rationality, exactly.

          I get that all the introspection and dialogue makes it feel like the story might belong here, even if none of the conclusions are explicitly rational. And again, you're \*definitely\* right that the dilemmas are not presented as purely black and white. But it's pretty hard to not see the "our team good, people who disagree with us bad" angle of it all.

          Maybe we could meet in the middle and agree that it touches on "rationalist themes"?

            Different poster, but wanted to chime in after having just read through the comic from start to finish this morning, so it's quite fresh in my mind 

            I think you're both right and wrong about the story's treating the powers as a "way to spice up a story that doesn't really need them", but that in and of itself feels like it's effectively the theme/point of the story. There's a background theme/subplot in the story that partially addresses some of what you're saying - the strong psychic has discovered evidence that there's a hidden group in the background that is explicitly killing anyone with powers that are applicable to truly changing the world, with the characters who seem best able to doing so either having been possibly intentionally distracted from doing so by the government superhero control program (pintsize) or having successfully hidden themselves from those programs, preventing them from acting overtly.

            From a rational perspective, it also takes the premise of "give a snapshot of births superpowers and then turn off the faucet" to what seems to be a logical and internally consistent end. There's not adults with superpowers because of the premise, and a significant chunk, possibly the majority, of the kids who received them, at least in the areas shown on screen, literally became child soldiers, which is likely to pretty heavily interfere with learning things.

            There is some exploration of how the powers work that happens mostly off screen, done by adult scientists, but as you already mentioned, this is largely a story about what happens if you can't find a quick "I win" button in the superpowers (possibly because *The Powers That Be*™ are preventing that because they would stop being *The Powers That Be* in that case?)

            I don't at all disagree that this is also clearly a story that is pushing a specific, identifiably liberal/progressive political worldview, but I will disagree that the main character's actions are being presented as morally correct/right, since more than half of the text in the story seems to be a very literal philosophical exploration of ethics itself, in light of the in-universe reality of superpowers. I still agree that the comic is still pushing the progressive views as mostly correct largely through the characters that are presented as viewpoint characters and who gets screentime, but I think it's largely exploring the various failure modes of that ethos, just very clearly from the inside, as seen with the storyline around the non-human-looking characters, which seems to do a very good job of capturing a lot of the risks and nuance that can be lost when you try to group a large number of people with very different wants and needs together and say "we're trying to help all of you, together!"

            I also strongly agree with your assessment that the story touches on "rationalist themes" in the very traditional (for this genre) sense of having a cast of characters with fairly different experiences and thought processes exploring very philosophical concepts on screen. I'd also agree that it's less typical than the ur-rationalist fiction, in that the philosophical concepts it explores are less "how to think about thinking the right away" and more "how to think about being good (and no way is the right way)"
            ```

            - u/Sophronius:
              ```
              I'll sign off on all of that.

              The one thing I would like to clarify is that I have no problem with the story promoting progressive views - that's perfectly fine. It's more that all the characters who disagree with the author's worldview are portrayed as completely unsympathetic. I'm thinking here of the right-wing fire hero in particular, who expresses the view that fake rape allegations exist and then promptly turns out to be a rapist himself (I think? at least he was accused of it by Moonshadow, don't remember the specifics).

              Rationality is all about seeking out opposing viewpoints and coming up with ways that you yourself might be wrong. This is not the way to go about that, I think.
              ```

              - u/CeruleanTresses:
                ```
                No, the fire guy turned out not to be a rapist. At least, Moonshadow ultimately concluded he wasn't one. This was a big deal in the story because she didn't want to kill him once she had confirmed this to her satisfaction, but her actions got him killed anyway. It was a failure mode of her philosophy.

                It's definitely a social justice-themed story with left-wing bent. But you mentioned it's been a while since you read it, and there's a pattern across your comments of remembering versions of plot points that are a lot less nuanced and more heavy-handedly partisan than what actually happens.
                ```

                > It's more that all the characters who disagree with the author's worldview are portrayed as completely unsympathetic.

                Agreed, at least along a political axis.

                > At least he was accused of it by Moonshadow

                That actually seemed like one of the weaker aspects of the story to me; Moonshadow used that scene to prove that she was (in my view) unrealistically cautious about who she killed, by showing that while she suspected him off being a rapist, she actually planned to drug him with a magical truth serum to find out if he was actually a rapist or just cared about theoretically being called one enough to threaten to murder any woman reporting being raped. (I'm calling it magical here because such a thing to my knowledge doesn't exist in reality, but it was not treated as a superhero invention or even as an extraordinary thing to exist, despite being one of the more world-breaking things to exist, if true.)

                His perspective did feel a bit on the nose as more of a stereotypical internet commenter, and was definitely portrayed as unsympathetic, made worse by the fact that this was being placed literally as a contrast to someone who was actually, successfully committing murder of people she suspected of being rapists. 

                Coming from the perspective of someone who identifies fairly strongly as a fairly far left progressive, one of the reasons that I opposed the death penalty (and punitive carceration in general) is that most evidence that I've seen shows that increased punishments, up to and including the death penalty, don't seem to be very successful at deterring unwanted behavior. As such, the perspective of the characters that essentially either endorse or at least condone Moonshadow's behavior, while presented in a very sympathetic light, come across very poorly to me.

                > Rationality is all about seeking out opposing viewpoints

                In character, it does feel as though the main character is working her way towards this, but showing an honestly fairly realistic progression, from being very sure of her actions earlier in her life to confronting and seeking out those who disagree with her as well (and in many cases, failing to do so, but that seems to be portrayed as a character flaw, not what she should be striving for), even if she mostly confronts those challenges which are hard for her, but not necessarily (personally) for the presumed progressive reader.
                ```

          - u/CeruleanTresses:
            ```
            I think it might be worth a reread, honestly. It does seem like you're misremembering parts of the story, both in terms of the events that happen in it and also tonally. For instance, interpreting Feral's motivation as self-punishment was plausible at one point in the comic, but it's ruled out later on when she's unreservedly thrilled about being able to help more people without having to be on the table 24/7. 

            I'll agree that they don't get super deep into the underlying mechanics of how superpowers work, but I also think that would be a very different story. You could certainly write a rationalist story about superpower mechanics, but this is more of a rationalist story about ethics that uses superpowers as the catalysts for moral conflict. They're certainly not just "spice;" you couldn't have the story without them, the whole point is exploring how ethics intersect with superpowers. A rational or rationalist story doesn't necessarily deep dive into everything it covers; it's okay to have areas of focus, and often that makes for better storytelling, especially in a medium like comics where a digression about how superpowers work on a quantum level could take weeks or months.

            Re: Feral, I think it's worth considering whether your own politics are affecting how you interpret the story and what stands out to you. Do you think the same events would have bothered you if she were straight, and do you think you would have registered her straightness as a characteristic in its own right? Is there anything inherently irrational about a gay character doing something good? If Feral being gay is a problem because she does something profoundly heroic, is >!Moonshadow!< being Asian fine because she's a serial killer? I think it's worth being wary of the impulse to write off a scene as being wholly motivated by a political agenda just because a gay person is in it, you know?

  I’ve not read SFP yet though as others have said in the thread, your description encourages me to move it up my list. (Also the kind of people who didn’t like it, and the clever and generous way they express that dislike, encourages me further.)

  Have you read Worm and Ward? Your article reminded me a little of Glory Girl’s journey from brutal Superman-ish flying brute with emotional overwhelm bonus powers, to body-horror victim of her adoptive sister’s “healing” powers (healing being Amy’s very irrational interpretation of what her powers *really* do), to civil service pseudo-cop (strong parallels to Alison/Mega Girl going to college) to leader of a supergroup formed in group therapy, and eventually to saviour of the world again. You would probably enjoy it, if you haven’t read it; word of warning, the whole thing is like six million words.
