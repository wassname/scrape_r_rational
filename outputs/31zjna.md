## Are children more intelligent than adults?

### Post:

I just listened to a podcast on Freakonomics radio that gave a strong case for children being smarter than adults. Some things it said was that it's much easier for a magician to fool an adult than a child and children have a much easier time figuring out how the magic tricks work than adults; also they had a child psychology researcher come onto the show and she described children as the "Research and Development division of the human species" and adults as "production and management".

What does the community make of this?

  I have not listened to the podcast. 

  Based solely on your summary, this feels like one of those cases where somebody takes a weak, unsurprising but true claim ("carps have more chromosomes than people") and inflates it into a paradoxical, surprising-sounding and untrue or borderline-meaningless claim ("carps are more evolved than people! [are carps the next step in human evolution?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)") 

  I don't think children are smarter than adults. Even the smarter ones often struggle with logical problems that adults solve much more quickly. There's a reason you'll learn more mathematics during a single semester in university than during the first 4 years of school. There's a reason they adjust iq tests for age. I don't think we should twist the truth of all that so that we could say something that sounds surprising. 

  That said, as far as I can tell kids do seem to have some... let's call them "weird mental superpowers", and the younger they are the stronger those powers are. They learn languages quickly. They learn games like Go or Chess quickly, to the point where it becomes embarrassing for the adults. There's probably much more that I don't even realize. The podcast probably gives some other great examples.

  Haven't listened to the podcast, but that doesn't sound like 'more intelligent' to me. It sounds like children and adults have different approach to the 'exploitation vs exploration' dilemma, which makes a lot of sense. The children brain should be much more open towards looking for new solution / learning new laws. The adult brain, which has collected much more signal, can and should rely more on previous knowledge.

  The older you get, the more heuristics your brain learns to use to prune and filter and summarise the inflow of data it gets. Most of the time that's advantageous - it lets you get to the important details of a situation more quickly and make more accurate guesses from limited information, but the misdirection used by magicians is *specifically designed* to exploit your heuristics and pull your attention towards the irrelevant while concealing the real trickery.

  It does also have other effects - from what I hear children are more able to tell apart (for example) individuals in a group of animals, because they haven't yet learned a mental filter that categorises all sheep as "A sheep" so they're still genuinely looking at the individual details. By the time you're an adult you've learned that the specific identities of sheep are rarely important, so they all look the same because you're not really paying attention (unless you're a shepherd, in which case those individual identities are useful information and you either don't learn or gradually un-learn that filter).

  The adult brain has its advantages too; if memory serves there are whole regions of the brain that don't become fully functional until you reach your mid-20s. Which perhaps explains why teenagers are prone to risky behaviour and short-term thinking - they literally don't have the circuitry required to properly assess risk, or appreciate long-term rewards. Thinking at high levels of abstraction is also a skill that takes time and age to develop, which is a useful component of 'intelligence'.

  That depends on how you define intelligence.  We can't even agree on a solid measurement of intelligence in adults.

  No. The reason it can seem that way depending on how you list the data is that "intelligent" is a poorly-defined term. Children are typically more observant than adults, but less capable of reasoning about consequences. They are more plastic in the way that they think (more capable of picking up new mental skills or habits), but less able to make logical inferences and rule out classes of solutions at a time.

  Children have the same number of neurons as adults, but more synapses (i.e. more connections between neurons). This means more neuroplasticity - children are better learners than adults.

  So yes, children might well be "more intelligent", depending on how you define that. I don't think that's a completely accurate picture, but it's pretty close to say that children are "as intelligent" as adults. Someone once said "a child is an adult with less experience".

  You can certainly give a fairly good understanding of quantum mechanics to an eight year old, if you can get them to sit still long enough. You just have to start from first principles a lot more often than you would with an undergrad.

  I have not listened to the podcast, they probably said most of this.

  ```
  If this is true, we would expect children to be more sought-after than adults for jobs where intelligence is important. This has not been my experience.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Children tend to have greater neuroplasticity, partly due to age and partly also due to receiving genuinely novel stimuli on a *far* more regular basis, and also, in the probabilistic sense, have *much* less informative (ie: higher-entropy) priors.

  To corrupt the work of Terry Pratchett a bit, children are better at First Sight, even while adults are better at Second Thoughts.
