  Finally - a little new system information. 

  >!Ethereal Aura (0/10)!<

  >!User may exempt the aura from environmental effects at will.
  Aura gains 5% resistance to environmental occlusion and absorption.
  Environment receives 90% aura output.
  Requires 10 ranks in Mana Manapulation.
  Requires 10 ranks in Aura IFF.!<

  And *finally*, a new *LAIR*!!! Does this mean possibly, finally, a chance to level???
  ```

  - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
    ```
    >!A useful skill, but I thought that Radiance/Shroud would be a far more practical choice since they merely darken/brighten the environment. Taking two Tier 1 offensive auras instead of a Tier 2 is Rains worst build move so far I think!<
    ```

    - u/poequestioner2:
      ```
      You're not entirely wrong. Rain probably should've been more patient and waited until he had 5 ranks in Refrigerate so he could get Shroud. He ended up getting Immolate instead. Ah well, it does help with the cold. It's Winter where he currently is.

    As a Patreon reader, >!let me answer your question about whether this lair will mean that Rain gets to level up: Lol nope!!<
    ```

    - u/TychoBrohe:
      ```
      Thanks. Can’t say I’m surprised at all. I think I might need to put this down and come back in a year.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        It all comes back to the fact that Delve has a great pacing for a book, but it's slow for a webnovel. The chapters are short, events take multiple chapters to work through, and the update rate is only a chapter per week.

        The author is amazing at world-building and writing compelling characters, but I would much rather have a book (or just 50 chapters) released per year instead of this drip-feed of a story I can't stop myself from reading.

        It was tolerable when there was a chapter every Sunday and Wednesday, but unfortunately SenescentSoul couldn't sustain that pace.
        ```

        - u/thatavidreadertrue:
          ```
          I wouldn’t call the characters compelling at all. You can probably exchange 90% of the characters in the story with any other generic side character and the story wouldn’t be impacted one bit. I’m only reading this because of the spreadsheet system, and the author has already far exceeded the threshold of most reader’s patience thanks to this stalling.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Imagine thinking characters are the strength of Delve. The most annoying thing is that all the value is in the system and we never get to frigging see it and we barely ever get to "Delve". The story is already 7 regular books long. 2-3 doorstoppers.
            ```

      - u/ironistkraken:
        ```
        I have stoped and just check these updates randomly to make sure its not abandoned.
        ```

        Please try a little harder to respect spoiler tags.

      Please spoiler this whole comment.

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        Okay I just spoiler tagged almost my entire comment. Are you sure you meant my comment and not TychoBrohe's comment though?
        ```

        - u/sparr:
          ```
          I am. Thanks.
          ```

      Ho Ly fuck seriously.........

  The Patreon readers made a very interesting prediction about the Tier 3 skill that maxing Mana Manipulation will unlock in Offensive Auras. If you carefully examine the skill progression in the skill tree, you will see 2 to 3 path progressions as shown:

  ||Tier 0|Tier 1|Tier 2|Tier 3|Tier 4|
  |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
  |Skill Path #1|Immolate|Radiance|Fulmination||?|
  |Skill Path #2|Refrigerate|Shroud|Corrosion||?|
  |Pseudo Skill Path||Shear||Discombobulate|?|

  So the prediction is that Shear+Discombobulate+Mana Manipulation will unlock another Tier 3 Offensive Aura. Possibly an aura that attacks and unravel the mana of spells?

  Is she talking about what he was doing soul-diving or is this just a non-sensical Skyrim reference?

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    Yes.
    ```

- u/TheTruthVeritas:
  ```
  I’m surprised nobody in that world has seen the power of supports, refreshing my memory with those list of potential skills, a support class would add so much to a party. Damage reduction, healing for health, mana, and stamina, ridiculous health, mana, and stamina regen, damage reduction for all kinds, buffs to every stat, speed and accuracy boosts, detection, oppressive AoE damage against hordes of mobs, it’s really insane.

  I’m really curious what Rain would look like in his endgame, skills get more ridiculous with the higher requirements later on, and we’ve seen how incredible super high level monsters like Val’s dad and the plats are. The potential skills he has available right now are already insane, just how crazy are the skills once he unlocks Legendary Dynamo and moves into T4 skills and higher? I’ve had this inkling that Rain is eventually going to become pretty powerful even DPS-wise, I’ve been thinking about Aura Compression ever since it was revealed, it has so much potential to be munchkinned. Rain can compress it to 1m and get some really good results, but doesn’t that seem to defeat the point of offensive auras of suppressing masses of enemies from a safe distance? At this point all it’s good for us maximizing buffs for Rain. I think it’s extremely likely there’s going to be a hidden skill revealed later on that can change the origin point where the aura compresses into. He could compress all that damage into a single point and deal massive damage to a single enemy within his range, or focus a buff onto a single ally with massive bonuses. Nothing important, but that has just been a possibility that has been nagging at me for months, there’s no way a skill like that doesn’t exist later on with a skill like Aura Compression available.

  Looking forward to when Ascension powers up and has teams of optimized parties, although it’s looking like we’ll still be waiting many months. There’s a lot of things that really get me curious, like what is going on with Rain’s soul, and what is going to happen with Dozer and the curious bond between them? It feels like there’s definitely something game-changing within one of those.

    > I’m surprised nobody in that world has seen the power of supports

    The empire has. We just haven't seen much of them.
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      On the topic of the empire, isn’t it stated that they only have a bunch of slaves they feed super low level blues to, and they only unlock the 4 seasonal auras? I think they’ve only scratched the bare surface of supports with only measly seasonal aura slaves for massive armies, nothing on the level of dedicated full blown support monsters per party like what Rain is planning and doing.
      ```

      - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
        ```
        It's also stated that they make use of the mono-attribute classes even though most of them literally cannot survive without assistance.

        So we know they use mutli-people builds, we know they use support aruas. It's reasonable to assume they have higher level supports out there too. I think they had some illusionists in the army that beseaged the barrier too...
        ```

      - u/sparr:
        ```
        It's stated that that's what their army at large uses. I suspect they have level 25 or even 50 supports for their level 75+ heavy hitters.
        ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Pretty sure the ancient civilization whose name I forgot also had the right idea.  No way they got that advanced without some better leveling than the watch or guild have managed so far.
      ```

  - u/TychoBrohe:
    ```
    Ditto on expecting a high-tier aura skill to move the point of origin. That would really be a gold/platinum level boost!
    ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    Just using the basic stuff up to silver allows Rain to become absolutely nuts in terms of damage.

    Like he hits damage cap pretty easily in spikes.
    ```

  - u/sparr:
    ```
    I think the problem is that high level supports generally can't protect themselves, similar to high level crafters. Rain took offensive auras so he's got a little bit of damage output, but nothing compared to a similar level and mana pool that focuses on damage.
    ```

  - u/poequestioner2:
    ```
    At level 18, Rain is able to do about 5000 damage for one or two seconds, 1 meter range.

    At level 25, assuming maxed out skills at rank 15, he should be able to easily do at least 94k damage per second, 1 meter range. It'll cost about 12k mana and he will have about 24k mana if he boosts his Focus to 160.  About 12-13k total mana if he keeps it at base Focus. Level 25 is well named as 'The Wall.' The moment he increases his max rank to 15 and levels them, he'll see a massive damage increase. This is not taking into account any special bonuses he'll get with a legendary class. I'm only calculating the max rank change to 15. 

    For comparisons sake, at level 24, he'll only do about 6600 dps. 

    At Level 50, damage will go to about a million dps if he boosts it in the same manner as he does now. Now that I think about it, at level 26, he'll have Prismatic Intent. Instead of inefficiently boosting one aura, he might end up using his more efficient boosters to boost multiple offensive auras.

  ```
  So wait... Did his three accolades combine while he was meditating and create the lair in front of them? We don't even know what they did? 

  Also, anyone on the patreon able to say if Vestvall claims the lair before they can get anyone new awakened? Does he convince anyone to go passivist?
  ```

  - u/steelong:
    ```
    Passivist:  >!On passivist builds, it looks like one of the people they just awakened is planning on taking that build.  It's still too early to see it in practice.!<
    ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    The accolades didn't combine, he still has two. I think he succeeded in attuning one, which short-circuited his soul and knocked him out. No idea whether it has anything to do with the lair.
    ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    Patreon: >!They crack the lair before Vestvall does anything. No full passivist builds yet (probably because it's a big risk to take and you need a bunch of levels for that to really spool up) but there was at least one full support build popping up.!<
    ```

    - u/Nick_named_Nick:
      ```
      Thanks! I'm teetering on the edge of "should I get the patreon chapters". Like most who haven't, I'm worried that paying to remain as up-to-date as possible will just end up costing me 2 months of nothing if I am disapointed by the chapters.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        On whether or not to sign up for Patreon: >!it's a pretty good time to join Patreon as the current Patreon chapters cover the events of examining the lair, entering and beating the lair, what to do for the slots to awaken, dealing with the issues of actually getting the people to awaken, and destroying the lair. The latest chapter ends with them leaving the Essed Frostbarrows. You'll get an entire mini-arc to read through with minimal cliff-hangers at the end.!<
        ```

        - u/EsquilaxM:
          ```
          You put the wrong name there at the end.
          ```

          - u/xamueljones:
            ```
            Shoot, you're right! I mixed up two names. Nice catch.
            ```

      - u/Reply_or_Not:
        ```
        it will def cost you two months of nothing.  I will never pay for patreon for Delve again.

        Imo. just drop the story and catch up every few months
        ```

  - u/hwc:
    ```
    What's “passivist”?
    ```

    - u/grekhaus:
      ```
      Chapter 77:
      > One that had caught his fancy recently was something that he’d dubbed the ‘passivist’. It was a shame that the pun really only worked in English. It was all about picking up as many passive skills as possible, with only a few actives for utility as well as some pre-combat self-buffs. He had no idea how viable it would be in practice, but on paper it was putting out some impressive numbers at level eighteen. It was a lot more rounded than his own build, with good offense and defense, just a bit lacking in utility.

      > Mana Striking was an odd passive that used mana to boost damage on any physical attack, armed or not. Combined with the multiplier from Strength of Arm and a few other things, basic attacks ended up doing a few thousand damage, which was insane. He wasn’t that sure of the numbers, just going by the damage of punching practice with Carten as the punching bag.

      > Additionally, the build had great staying power. That was thanks to Mute, a skill which tripled all regeneration, health, stamina, and mana. It did this at the cost of temporarily sealing other active skills. He’d heard about Mute a while ago, but as nice as getting another regen multiplier would be, it wasn’t compatible with auras. Winter was better after all the boosts he had, but it wasn’t surprising that most people went with Mute for recovery between fights. It was a great skill, assuming they were willing to spend the points to unlock the prerequisites. The so-called Passivist would be able to keep it going constantly as it didn’t affect passive skills. They’d only need to lower it to recast buffs.
      ```

      - u/hwc:
        ```
        Thanks for finding that.  I have no memory of that passage.
        ```

    - u/TwoxMachina:
      ```
      A build focused on passive skills.

      Was thought about by Rain a while ago.
