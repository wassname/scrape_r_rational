  Finished reading book 1 a few days ago. It isn't awful, and I enjoy the concept, but making all the characters as anime tropes inherently means that they're 2D. Obviously this serves the story, but it causes serious issues with enjoyable characters, when there's really only one. Even Josh, who is supposed to be a real person, is basically a side character for the bulk of the story. 

  I enjoyed the 'twist' halfway through, but holy shit does the MC have bullshit powers. I was hoping for a story where the powerless side character has to scheme his way to survival, but instead he's probably more powerful than anyone else.

  3/5

  This story has one of my biggest bugbears, which is continuously giving the MC random OP powers right as he needs them trivializing any situation. I like when the MC gets a set of powers beforehand, then thinks about possible applications for that power, and then uses those powers in interesting ways. *The Simulacrum* constantly gives the MC new powers for no real reason, which overshadows him being genre savvy(which is the most interesting power he has). 

  Here's a quick overview of his powers/knowledge/resources as of current chapter.

  >!1. Is genre savvy and aware he is in a battle harem romance comedy.
  2. Doesn't need to sleep.
  3. Can see magic.
  4. Has ridiculous allowance giving him essentially infinite money.
  5. Can dispel magic by touching it.
  6. Can engage in mystical battle with fauns or something.
  7. Can view anyone he has touched at any distance and hear what they are saying.
  7.5 Can use viewing power in radar mode to know when they approach.
  8. Has foresight like reflexives that makes him impossible to hit.
  9. Body is extremely athletic.
  10. Can do short range teleportation.
  11. Has a weird 4th dimensional tentacle appendage that lets him dispel magic too?
  12. Has access and control of the angels entire intelligence network.
  13. Has access to the dragon royal family library.
  14. Can speak faun language fluently.
  I'm sure I forgot something but these all came to mind immediately but there are more I'm sure.!<

  It's not even that none of these powers were used in rational or interesting ways, because they often were. But it feels like the author just came up with a power, thought of a situation where that power would be cool, and then just moves on. The MC just feels like a standard OP protagonist after a while with a completely ridiculous bag of tools.

  I think *The Simulacrum* had a reasonable start but quickly jumped the shark and lost what made the first couple chapters decent. I think if it focused on the MC quickly resolving typical narrative tropes as his main power instead I would have liked it a lot more. After a while he just becomes typical OP protagonist half oblivious to half the cast being in love with him even though he should know and act better.

    Now that I think of it, the novel lacks struggle, isn't it? To save the novel from becoming just-other-Gary-Stu, the author really need to create problem that challenge his main character. Problem (seemingly) insurmountable it'll require Leo to use his power creatively. I guess I was too enamored with MC's no-nonsense attitude I forgot he hadn't mentally endeavor yet.

    Anyway, I now see why this subreddit is not very enthusiastic with the novel. I'm not really interested to discuss it with other community, but suppose I want to, where should I recommend this novel? (I'm looking to find other novel with no-nonsense attitude).

      The thing is the author really really wants the MC to be mostly rational. But so many of the MC successes just come from randomly appearing new powers that it completely detracts from the rational aspect of the story, until it feels like an afterthought. The MC spends a lot of time "researching" but it happens mostly off-screen and doesn't really lead to anything.

      As to where else you would discuss this, I have no idea =s

  The first couple of chapters were interesting, after that, I felt like I was reading a particulary boring high school type light novel with no redeeming qualitis(Which means, Terrible dialogue, One dimensional characters and basically no plot to speak of). The "gimick" is the awerness the MC to his situation but it has almost no impact on the story.

    I found main character is particularly strong in hijinks. That's what keep me reading. The setting is terrible I agree. Maybe purposely terrible. But automatons that populate the world promise a supernatural mumbo jumbo. It might deliver a good storyline in the end, who knows.

  Although I did enjoy the story, I am a bit disappointed that the parody of a haram comedy just turned into a literal haram comedy.  


  I do enjoy deconstructing a genre, and subverting tropes.....  But in order to do that, you have to ACTUALLY subvert the tropes....  I feel like the story lost that about half way through.

  Man is thrown into a world that is, he perceive, artificial. The problem is, he has no recollection how he ended up there. He forgot everything that happened until just a moment ago. He also recognize a programmed instinct that compel him do whatever he supposed to do. Being afraid is an understatement. He desire to know, and if situation allow, be free.

  Leonard Dunning maybe an isekai protagonist. Except there's no Truck-kun who sent him, no God who granted him absurd skill, and soon he will know, no harem will be formed around him. But those tropes, he found, is very much real here. Prologue, just like many prologues of similar works, can be ignored entirely. Just jump to chapter 1 and you'll be fine. At least that's what I feel until book 1 completed. He is a genre savvy character, though not very savvy. Just like Leonard Dunning, you can recognize plots and characters from miles away. Unlike Leonard Dunning, you most definitely can see twist much earlier than he could.

  I call him a rationalist because he actively seeks answers. The world may not readily give him what he want, but he's not shy venturing experiments. Character interaction is superb. Pacing is nice. Setting could use little work (but hey, author imitates typical Japanese Isekai half-assery, maybe we should not expect solid world building). Action scene is passable. Good webserial stuff, in my opinion. Tell me what you think.
