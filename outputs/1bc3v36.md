## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

- u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
  ```
  I started reading [*The Winter of Widows*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-winter-of-widows-si.1140307/) and I'm really liking it. It's an ASOIAF SI-OC that inherits the position of the lady of a new and failing house right after the Dance, and has to essentially keep everything from falling apart. Oh, and winter's just started and the Ironborn raided their food stores, and there's a plague on the horizon.

  The fic focuses on female characters, and there's a broad range of them. Similar to ASOIAF, being a "strong female character" isn't just a woman who picks up a sword and knows how to fight. There are fighters, but also noble woman, mothers, spies, clergy, (former) whores, peasants, inventors, and so on. The MC is very much at the bottom of the noble social ladder, both for being a woman, because her house is new, relatively poor, and because she's unmarried. Instead of a sword and shield, she has insights clever words.

  It does play up the "peasants loves the SI" trope and it can be a bit grating, but in fairness there's a reason for that. The MC puts her money where her mouth is, and shows that she's willing to suffer alongside her people. She works hard, instead of just having everything go well because she's and SI that's invented something neat. There's more focus on administration and politics than modern technology, though R&D does play a significant role in her house's fortunes.

    I cautiously second this. The writer is good and is improving with every chapter, but she's stated that she loves/was inspired by Dread Our Wrath, which is IMO absolute dogshit wankery, so I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. So far so good though.
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      I think the fact that the MC is a woman - and is written as a woman - is going to make all the difference here. 

      DoW jumped the shark when >!Baelor went to visit the MC, and essentially threw away his old beliefs in favour of the MC's after a single day, and became a completely new person!<. This isn't something that can really happen in TWoW - in DoW the SI is a man, and can get away with a lot more than Ursula can because social conventions work in their favour. They don't have to worry about things like being forced to marry a man with a medieval mentality (a man is legally allowed to beat their wife up to *six times* with a rod), usurpation via marriage, pregnancy, or being accused of witchcraft, which are all things Ursula has to balance. 

      The author has shown that the Ursula can't just ignore social conventions because they don't meet her 21st century standards. The author in DoW has their MC constantly challenge them and get away. Ursula has to convince people to be on her side and support her instead of them throwing in with her because she wants them to.

      That's not to say that there aren't some of the usual SI tropes (concrete and glass, for instance), but at least it's a bit more reasonable, at least to me.
      ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      > ... Dread Our Wrath, which is IMO absolute dogshit wankery ...

      Ooooohhh!!! Tell us more!
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        Even leaving aside the almost complete lack of conflict or challenge, the bullshit ticky tacky uplift, or how the SI, a new, low ranking member of a martial aristocracy, is not just visibly engaging in base commerce like some kind of merchant(lower than peasants in every medieval hierarchy) but is constantly praised for it, the writer made the SI(himself?) the center of the entire world! 

        Dread Our Wrath is basically the adult male version of My Immortal, a world where everything and everyone exists to caress and exalt the ego of the SI.

        Don't, actually.  This is not that sort of subreddit.  Don't like, don't read.

        - u/H265:
          ```
          De-recs and other criticisms are quite common on this subreddit (at least in the weekly threads), and I would argue that they are very useful - at least when well-reasoned. They aren't just for bashing disliked stories, they are genuinely useful for finding new stories to read.

          I have a pretty good idea of which problems and tropes are likely to lead to me dropping a story, and which ones I'm able to look past. Knowing which aspects of a story caused someone else to drop it is a useful barometer for figuring out if I'm likely to have similar issues with it, and there are several stories I've enjoyed that I read specifically because of de-recs or otherwise critical posts found in the weekly threads here. Seeing a de-rec where the major criticisms listed are things that I know don't bother me too much - or in some cases might even enjoy - is likely to make me give the story a try if it seems otherwise interesting.

          The reverse is also true, there are some tropes that I know are very likely to kill all enjoyment of the story for me, but that many others either enjoy or have no issues with reading. Knowing that others have already dropped the story for similar reasons is useful to save me time, and may convince others with different tastes to read it.
          ```

          - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
            ```
            Brief de-rec?  Sure.  Going into greater length about "absolute dogshit wankery" after hearing "ooooohhhhh tell us more"?  That takes the subreddit in a direction I would not like to see it go.  Other people, obviously, enjoy the work; and they're valid.  So politely, briefly, neutrally say why you didn't enjoy it yourself, attributing your perceptions to your own eyes rather than intrinsic universal properties of the work, with an eye to not spoiling the fun of people enjoying it.  Don't dunk.
            ```

            - u/GlueBoy:
              ```
              That's a good point. There's a difference between being critical and sneering, and I see that I crossed that line a few times recently. I'm going to try to dial it back from now on, especially with the freely offered work of hobbyists/amateurs. Thanks for speaking up.
              ```

  - u/loltimetodie_:
    ```
    I'm kinda middling on this one, the first half broadly ticks the boxes for me but the latter half seems to be snowballing an a way that's a little eye-roll worthy, like having >!some random villager invent the spinning jenny!<. What's the point of setting it up as some dire situation (winter, poor fief) limiting the already-limited protagonist's (trainee nun, woman, isolated) ability to uplift if all of those drawbacks are so rapidly either transcended or ignored? Strips the draw out of it IMO.
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      >like having >!some random villager invent the spinning jenny.!<

      Honestly that's probably one for the more believable things in the story. The actual >!spinning jenny!< was invented by an [illiterate weaver/carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hargreaves) with no formal training. He got the idea almost by accident (supposedly) and built and sold several of the devices by himself.

      I get what you mean about things being too convenient when it comes to SIs. If it happened too often it would be an issue. Personally, I think it's not a bad idea that the MC encourages her people to show initiative and is willing to sponsor them if they have good ideas. And that she's not the sole source of all good ideas for tech development.

      I have some problems with Theo, but that's a different matter.
      ```

    - u/viewlesspath:
      ```
      Yeah, there was a similar thing that made me roll my eyes in the latest chapter. The Tully castle is observed by the PoV to be colder and draftier than the SIs newly built keep because of building techniques or something. It was just an offhand observation, but it felt like such an arrogant dismissal when you consider that Westeros would have thousands of years of experience surviving sudden and arbitrarily long mini-ice ages. If you think about it just a bit you would realize their methods and techniques should, by logic, be better and more sophisticated within their tech base and material constraints than anything we can imagine. 

      To my mind this is the core issue with uplift stories, why they're so easy to fumble. When the premise of your story is an SI being capable of singlehandedly uplifting a society solely based on a vague, generalist understanding of history and tech(and the gumption to associate with social inferiors of course), the author has to portray a shallow and unrealized world full of people that are not just ignorant, but willfully incurious and incapable. That way the MC can swoop in and appear like a genius by plucking all the delicious low hanging fruit that all the NPCs are ignoring. 

      (I'm still liking winter of widows, though I hope the writer chooses to focus on the interpersonal stuff and gives the tech uplift a rest.)
      ```

      - u/PresN:
        ```
        I think for that you can blame GRRM for making such a slapdash world, one that's simultaneously low and high medieval and early renaissance and somehow has been for thousands of years. It could maybe be explainable via repeated social fragmentation destroying knowledge, but then GRRM has houses ruling countries for countless generations and an entire continent-spanning organization retaining knowledge. There's no clear reason _why_ random backwater houses don't have better non-industrial technology after so long, so SIs get to invent them without consequence.
        ```

  ```
  Help remember superhero story I lost long time ago.

  It's not Worm.

  Basically there are three main characters and the story rotates POV between them each chapter.

  Teenage/young adult girl who got some sort of advanced technological costume, she decides to patrol the city.

  Some sort of villain. I don't remember what his chapter was about anymore, but some sort of crystals were introduced.

  And unpowered and depressed desk worker, working in some sort of government organisation for superheroes.

  I might have gotten some details wrong. Hopefully this isn't that far off from what it actually is. I only read a few chapters of it.

      Well, I read all 16 chapters on Ao3. It's really fun. Has some great scenes, I really liked the ones with Amy, but I didn't really like Tattletale. Somehow I really liked Tattletale in Worm, but in every fic I've read she's incredibly annoying. The lewd scenes were fun too.

      I haven't read Ward so I don't know much about the >!Shard stuff!<. But it's kind of interesting I guess.

      And I'm interested in what happens next. >!She's had a huge power spike in recent chapters,!< so it'll be fun to see what happens next. 

      I'm not really sure I agree with the cons in the reply to your previous post. The PRT are villainous, but I don't think they're one dimensional, or at least they're not much worse than canon. The PRT has its fair share of skeletons in the closet, so why not play that up if the protagonist is a villain?

      I did skip reading past the author's comments around halfway though. But as long as the story is interesting, and it's not constantly mentioned in the work, I don't really care about what they're like.

    Supper Supportive, pun intended, which gets its updates posted regularly currently, features a vegan protag. However he gets forced into the lifestyle by magic symbiosis style, and never thinks about the ethics of it much, and it is fact annoyed about this, I think. 

    Theres tons of vampires who are human-free, or voluntary humans only, though most still eat animal blood, see Alicorns Luminosity / glowfic expansions.  

    Theres the extended Daevinity glowfic universe: where matter conjuration makes cruelty-free meat so cheap that animal rights advance considerably. Protagonist Cam frequently conjures food for everyone, and the ethics do come up. Start here for the very short premise: https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809486    then follow up with this: https://glowfic.com/posts/2310     Finished^TM :good stopping point, premise is played out to an extent, rest is left as exercise for the reader.  

    Leareth, eviiiiil styled utilitarian deuteragonist of "A Song for Two Voices", does not shy away from murder, if its a net good - mostly eating animals is net bad, theres magic that proves they have feelings. He gets a minor breakdown when he learns that the highly advanced scifi human civilisation of 2007 Earth does evil things to animals, and in other fics it comes up too: Poor evil Carissa is very confused about an purportedly evil archmage who refuses to eat animals because they have feelings! Not sure what a good starting starting point for Leareth fics is, perhaps this Animorphs crossover? https://glowfic.com/posts/4063   Finished.

    Child Fëanor, of the Silmarillion, gets dropped into Worm pre-canon. Upon learning of industrial farming practices he goes at least vegetarian, scene is pretty early in the plot. https://glowfic.com/posts/733  LotR elves are deeply weird and magical canonically. Finished, with a satisfying end! 

    In this fic, by Eliezer, the stereotypical isekai world has a spell that allows people to determine if animals are smart enough to have qualia, and upon learning that the protag switches to Fae-free diet. Its by Eliezer, so of course really very tremendously fun, but unfinished. Still highly recommended. https://glowfic.com/posts/3866
