## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  [Allomantic Electrum](http://coppermind.net/wiki/Electrum#Allomantic_Use) from /u/mistborn's Mistborn books.

  Precisely how the power behaves has yet to be spelled out in exact terms by either the books or Word of God, so I'll take the liberty of defining the constraints using some educated guesswork, as well as simplifying the mechanism down to the bare bones/assuming mastery:

  You are an Oracle. By consuming electrum (a gold/silver alloy at ~$20/gram), you can know the future. But only *your* future.

  For every gram of electrum you consume, you can "burn" it at will to annihilate it, for a total of five minutes of burning. While burning, you see a "future-shadow" of your future self (including clothing and held items) exactly as and where you will be 2 seconds from now. This shadow doesn't obscure your vision, isn't actually dependent on your eyes (so 360 vision), and your mind is enhanced to the point of being able to track it without undo mental strain or distracting you from other activities.

  The shadows are branching and non-recursive. For every reasonable alternative course of action you might take based on information gleaned from the future, another shadow is spawned to represent its consequence. Each shadow acts exactly as you would if you stopped using your power *right now* and went about your day for another 2 seconds: so no passing back sign-language messages for 10 hours in the future.

  -To be clear, you are the only person with such "options": the shadows are always right. If you had the ability to see other people's future shadows, then you would see a single shadow that their body inevitably followed through on; the only exception would be if you communicated your own future-knowledge to them: at that point their shadow would branch into two shadows.

  For sanity's sake, let's say you'll get at most a dozen simultaneous shadows at once, representing the 12 most reasonable branches of the future actions you might take. Your ability to process the extra information scales as more shadows spawn, but there are diminishing returns.

  There's more detail/example/background to be had, but my first draft was egregiously long, so I'll leave it at this. Munchkin away and good luck taking over the world.

    The limit on shadows means that I can't brute force passwords (or lock combinations) which is a shame. In fact, that limit means that I'm pretty much limited *only* to passing information back to myself from among 12 candidate futures.

    I guess I go to the casino first, divide my shadows up into bets on the roulette wheel, and hope that I can overcome the costs^1 involved in burning electrum, which really shouldn't be that hard especially if I start with seed money. Hand signals from my future selves allows me to send information back. If we're keeping to a limit of two seconds though, I think I'm probably not going to be able to place any bets quickly enough on anything but slots (and even then I would have to pick one that was very fast *and* was programmed in the right way to get different values from its RNG).

    From there I hit the stock markets, where I engage in human-assisted algorithmic trading that intends to make the largest possible profit within the timeframe of a few minutes. Hopefully this doesn't attract too much attention. Again, the limit of tracking only twelve futures mostly just slows things down, but I'm immediately a better trader than pretty much anyone without that power. (We're still some ways from seeing stock markets in Mistborn, if we ever do, but I have to assume that they'd be radically different given the existence of electrum mistings. Actually, *Alloy of Law* should be past the invention of the stock market if it's close to earth standards, though I can't remember if it was mentioned in any of the books.)

    But that's about it. No manifold futures means nothing all that broken, and the time limit means that I can only evaluate extremely short-term things. If I could see *all* future selves, then I could use a computer to generate ... well, virtually anything that I could see within the span of a few seconds.

    1. The Mistborn RPG book says that electrum burns at a rate of 10 minutes per charge, with one of their examples being 4 charges in 1 ounce, which means that ~7 grams gives you 10 minutes of future-sight, or about ~$14 per minute.

      I'm not sure your uses are maximizing the biggest opportunity here, which is the ability to get the most out of one-time events.

      You might not be able to brute-force many passwords *instantly*, but some passwords are made safe only by cooldowns. For example, a 4-digit PIN might allow you 5-10 guesses before it locks, but you can brute-force this at ~6 guesses per second, or in roughly 13 minutes, without raising *any* alarms.

      As another, consider disarming potential bombs. Consider finding out what's inside a container without permanently damaging the container. Consider running prohibitively expensive tests for free (testing nukes comes to mind, but that's probably a terrible use of your powers).

    > For sanity's sake, let's say you'll get at most a dozen simultaneous shadows at once

    Is this immutable? If I'm able to distill things down more, such that I only need to know a little about each shadow, would it be possible to use more? One particular idea would be to have the shadows all do *almost* the same thing, but at slightly different offsets - I would then only care about the extremum of the union of the shadows, rather than each individually.
    ```

    - u/Kurkistan:
      ```
      The source material uses language like "cloud of images", and the feedback loop of two people looking at each other's futures (not-spoiler: that's a thing too, just not with electrum) is described as making "dozens" of shadows. So 12 might be a lowball estimate, on reflection.

      All that aside I said 12 more for the sake of establishing firm constraints and stopping people from solving arbitrarily hard search problems more than anything else. So if you've got some zany idea that involves unions of shadows then have at it, though I'd judge that it's likely a bit beyond the scope of what Sanderson would ever do: examples given for how electrum might have mundane utility are [combat and tennis](http://faq.brandonsanderson.com/node/162), not computation, so any computation you squeeze out of it is probably from the margins (assuming you're going where I think you're going).

    Obvious benefits: hand to hand combat and competitive sports chamiponships, where the two second additional reaction time is a game winner. 

    Money making: only blackjack seems more it'll reliably let you know the information you want within the 2 second time limit (did "hit me" result in a bust or not?) 

    You can also run red lights more safely, and have a safer/more successful career in law enforcement or firefighting.

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Can multiple people working in concert get exponentially many shadows if the situation is set up right? Ie gather them in a circle with headsets, each nondeterministically says a number between 1 and 12, a computer does some computation using those and shows everyone a green or red light, and everyone was told to do what would lead to a green light.

  How to deal with a smart enemy who is immortal via preemptively destroying all timelines where they die, including timelines where they undergo sufficient brain damage to be considered effectively dead?  IE, whatever chance they have of surviving a given scenario, that chance will always happen.
  ```

  - u/Sagebrysh:
    ```
    Did they also destroy every timeline where a potentially bad thing happens to them? Did they destroy the timeline where they fall in a hole and are buried alive for millions of years? If by deal with you don't mean 'kill' and you just mean 'take out of the equation' then it's just a matter of finding a scenario that removes them as a threat *without* killing them.
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      Yeah, there are a lot of win conditions here that don't involve literal death. Messing with their body and brain, containing them, convincing them, etc.

      You might be able to convince to willingly deactivate their power if they can, but any timeline where that happens might be prematurely destroyed (which would also allow them to precommit to turning off their power in timelines where their goals are sufficiently thwarted, which would work in all but the "permanent coma" situation).

      **EDIT:** And if they can't turn off the power, then they're incapable of suicide no matter how unbearable their circumstances. That's horrifying, in a way, but on the plus side they'll avert the heat death of the universe at least in a small radius around them (enough to keep them supplied with the prerequisites for survival).
      ```

      - u/zarraha:
        ```
        The power lets them cause literally anything that has nonzero probability if they can precommit to turning off their power and committing suicide unless that specific thing happens.

        However, I think the vast majority of people, possibly everyone, lacks the ability to precommit that strongly.  There are likely many timelines where whatever event they claimed would trigger it happens or doesn't happen anyway, but something extra happens that causes them to not follow through.
        ```

  - u/gods_fear_me:
    ```
    Why is one of my characters in a Munchkinry Thread?

    Really, your answer depends on how pre-emptively the timelines were dealt with. If it is a short time then you could hypothetically engineer a trap that allows for no chance of survival at all but that's tricky to arrange. If there is sufficient forewarning then it's not possible.
    ```

    - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
      ```
      There are no futures where they wind up dead or mind-wiped, period.  If a course of action could ensure that they wind up dead or mind-wiped, then that course of action won't happen in the first place.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        So get them into an automated prison where they will be fed for however long forever needs to be.

        Or do something Clockblocker-ey, if that exists in the setting. Does it count as dead if their time is frozen?
        ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    The difficulty here is that if you imprison them, you need to be sure they have no way of committing suicide, because while that would never happen, it would still keep those timelines from existing.

    I think the best option is simply to capture them and then restrain them so they would have no way of killing themselves. Then anytime you need to take them out of their restraints simply knock them out with drugs. Honestly it's not that hard if you have government resources behind you. If you don't however then you will need a lot of money.                   

    The difficulty here is that being sedentary nearly constantly, and being frequently drugged unconscious, might reduce their lifespan. So as a result timelines where they achieve immortality might be much more prolific in if they don't get caught.                       
    Of course a lot of this depends on how they were eventually going to obtain immortality since any path to that will become certain.                            
    However on the plus side this person's very existence makes certain types of unfriendly AI less likely. Of course it's also possible any superintelligence will find out about them post-takeoff and plan accordingly to keep them alive regardless of friendliness.
    ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    I think having them as an enemy would be worthwhile.  I know that we will develop anti-aging treatments within their lifetime, there won't be a gamma ray burst annihilating all life on earth, no plagues, etc.

    As for *fighting* them, step one is to hope that they haven't figured out the power of precommitment yet, and step two is to destroy their armies (if any) and then throw them in jail.
    ```

  - u/t3tsubo:
    ```
    Stop being their enemy, kiss their ass and go for the long game where you can alter their values to match your own given sufficient time being their underling/lover/friend.
    ```
