  Note that the author is also the guy who wrote *The Traitor Baru Cormorant*.

    Yes, as well as several beautiful short stories apart from the one I linked, like "Kumara" and "A Plant (Whose Name Is Destroyed)."

  This story is an old favorite of mine. As far as I can tell, it's been a few years since it was last posted; hopefully this will be a chance for new folks to discover it!

  Edit: Someone asked for a blurb but the comment is gone. I'll provide it anyway. The story is an extended allegory about the eternal war between natural selection and cognition as mechanisms of change, which plays out across the backdrop of humanity's struggle to bring about the Singularity and defeat entropy.

  Wait, so I'm going to see if I understand this correctly.

  Essentially the universe is stuck in a loop, always resetting when Sekhmet eats Set. And this is because once Sekhmet eats Set and returns to a point earlier in the beginning of the timeline, Set is reborn from her the moment 'Thought' comes into existence once more, with the evolution of the antecessor apes.

  And each time, if I'm getting this right, Set gets a little stronger. He grows a bit bigger, the difference between the two of them getting smaller and smaller. And this is good, because the ultimate goal of life is the creation of the trans-humans that could arise from the reconciliation between cognition and natural selection.

  And so in the end, when Sekhmet turns to run, is it because the cycle has been repeated so much that Set has finally become strong enough to hunt Sekhmet? If Sekhmet hunts and absorbs Set, the universe simply ends in enthropy; so I'm guessing if Set manages to catch and absorb Sekhmet, the way forward will be clear?

    I think it's something like that! It's not *entirely* clear to me, but I think the idea is that humanity reconciled the two algorithms by making Set-strategies the most fit. Sekhmet is now forced to reward the "strength" that will defeat her. I think the ultimate goal is not necessarily the creation of the transhumans, but the transhumans succeeding at preventing heat death. But I'm not 100% sure, I find the ending kind of hard to interpret.

    My headcanon is that the allegory is playing out in a massive simulation being run by Coeus and the other transhumans, hence the iterations, but I don't think there's anything definitive on that point in the text.
    ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    I think this is mostly spot-on, but for the very end: "Behold Set..."

    I took that to mean that the Sekhmet who speaks with Coeus *becomes* Set for the next iteration. She says that Set was born from her own flesh, a corruption of her paradigm--which is exactly what a Sekhmet who starts believing in something besides raw strength would be. So Sekhmet, who is the only deity for 99% of the universe's timeline, births and becomes Set, and then chases herself until she meets Coeus and the cycle moves forward.

  Thanks so much! I've been looking for this forever to read again.
