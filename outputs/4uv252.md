## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Double jumping was a thing in real life, what effect would it have on society? Certain sports would be different, sure,  but what affect could it have on architecture or military formations?

  Let's say all of a sudden in the mid 1800s, double jumping became a thing. If you jump in the air and extend your legs to land properly, your legs meet with a force enough for your muscles to propel you even further, but only as far as you can normally jump. If you don't extend your legs fast enough,  the force gives way and you fall again.


  If you don't have your legs in a position to jump a second time, it won't activate, so when you do have your legs in position, it will activate.

  The source of this power is irrelevant.
  ```

    ```
    It would have virtually no effect on architecture; regular architecture is designed without the use of *regular* jumping, so I don't see how double jumping would change anything. This is in part because some people can't jump due to age or infirmity, and buildings need to be accessible to everyone (this applies even before the ADA and similar).
    ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    The arbitrary nature of this power and more specifically its introduction should be immediately obvious to any even halfway decent armchair physicist. Expect to see society swing towards the much more religious as interference by an intelligent and powerful entity is more or less confirmed.

    This would probably not be the case if the power was introduced in prehistory rather than the mid-1800s.

    Walls, fences and basketball hoops would be made somewhat taller, but other than that there wouldn't be big changes.
    ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    As /u/alexanderwales suggests, it probably wouldn't affect architecture much, since buildings need to be accessible and safe to people who can't jump at all.

    Humans don't jump very high. The best athletes get their centre of mass a little more than 1m into the air; the real trick in jumping over things is more to do with how you move in the air than with how high you can jump.

    With that in mind, can you double-jump sideways or backwards? If in mid-air, you brace yourself to jump off an invisible wall, can you quickly change direction? Can you repeatedly jump between an actual wall and your double-jump to run along a vertical or near-vertical wall? What if you're vaulting over a brick wall, and you use your hand to push off the wall - do you count as "grounded", and can you still double-jump?

    This would dramatically affect the development of parkour.
    ```

    so that basically gives humans the ability to fly by having a temporary platform under them every second jump that's attached by a retracting cord. pulling yourself up by your tail, but literally :P
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      Have you tried jumping ten or twenty times in quick succession? It's exhausting. People would get tired and fall before they could fly to any real height.
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        If people could double jump, the ability to jump would be a lot more useful, and we could expect to see a lot more people practicing jumping.

        And that's before the clear evolutionary advantage of being able to jump more often-- by now, we'd look like kangaroos.
        ```

        - u/Dwood15:
          ```
          We wouldn't look like kangaroos after only 160 or so years. Maybe a thousand.

  A sapient species that can survive vacuum builds a city on an airless planet. What unique challenges and opportunities would this present? What details might stand out to a human reader?

  Aerodynamics are irrelevant, so vehicles can be whatever shape keeps their passengers from falling out. No windscreens needed. They might be able to build faster cars/trains with no air friction to slow them down.

  Controlled flight is only possible with rockets. No birds, airplanes, copters, or dandelion seeds. If plants exist, they may need to launch their seeds (ballistichory).

  Cooling is much more of a problem.

  Meteors and cosmic radiation are a hazard.

  No sound, so people will need some other way of talking. (sign language? built-in radios?)

  With no weather, there's no material difference between indoor spaces and outdoor spaces. Walls are for privacy and to keep out intruders, not for shelter. Roofs are still useful if you need shade.

  What else?

    Ballistic travel would be relatively safer, since there is no wind to introduce unpredictable influences over distance, and you can precisely calculate how you will land. Everything would be engineered for temperature extremes, either to tolerate or prevent them. It would be easier to maintain temperature extremes, so cryogenic applications including superconductors would be common. Refining processes might include ultra high temperature plasma separation, particularly in the absence of liquid water. All liquid water would have to exist in pressurized vessels.
    ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Dust is going to be a serious problem, so walls are still a thing.  This also causes problems for vehicles - maybe lightweight tubes around tracks are worthwhile?  Static electricity might be useful.

    Roofs protect from sunlight, including the problematic non-visible bits that our atmosphere filters.

    There are no volatile compounds (water, biological, etc) on the surface - they'd sublimate into an atmosphere.  Many implications for geology and geomorphology - expect something like Mars or the Moon, with fairly loose material at the surface.

    A magnetosphere would be very useful regardless for radiation management.

    Vacuum-welding makes metal equipment a (relative) liability.

    Can we use nanoassemblers?  Grey goo?

  Over on the discord server, /u/nighzmarquls, I, and a few others having been working on revamping a bunch fantasy/D&D creatures and phenomena to better fit our personal tastes as well as a sort of psychological theme we've developed. If you visit the server, our (long and rambling) discussion is in the re-mythedfantasy channel, and we have a google doc where we've been dumping ideas, available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDDTh1F80oiQy82DtKQcEilFgYfBgxwaOvLnIabAMO8/edit?usp=sharing).

      For me personally I mostly tack on some magical like principle like "ghost are real"

      or "magic happens" then try and find how that can fit into chemistry, physics and psychology as I understand it.

      Since a lot of this stuff starts with "what is the theme/feel of a thing" and then goes from there it really depends on "what if" then play through ramifications.

      The magic and the science being blended together in odd ways is an intentional feature, but the selection process is very much to taste, I really like science so I tend to find most of the universe cool, I just also want to put dragons and star beasts and unicorns in it.

      I also lately work from a basic principle that most forms of magic are assumed from the start to be a source of potential infinite energy.

      On the psychological thing, it's mostly just a 'mind will effect body will effect mind' feedback loop that is sort of just an assumed principle of this universe and thus results in "things".
      ```

      - u/Dragrath:
        ```
        Makes sense I guess it is harder for me to think that way as I tend to put rules in place for magic (even if said inhabinants of the world don't know them) 

        When I read through your page it seemed most of them are alterations of humans or other creatures based on psychology making the mental state far more important which is interesting as it forces the worlds inhabitants to pay more attention to such things.

        It does make an interesting contrast to how I tend to go about fiction where when doing what if scenarios I try explore every possible ramification or path that I can think of. This tends to make a multiverse like aspect where I get two ideas from one and mesh ideas that fit well together into each other which tends to create further offshoots. 

        For instance I have one fantasy idea where everything is closely grounded in biology and physics. This has created some unusual ideas such as demons really being various types of parasitic worms that alter their hosts behavior and physiology in order to maximize their odds of passing on their genes. 

        I understand the urge to bring outer space into play(You must have written the vampire idea :) ) one of my main fantasy ideas involves extraterrestrial lifeforms hitching a ride of a remnant fragment of their former planet (it is still a pure fantasy however) but in the prologue I hint at a gravity assist to shrink the orbital pass to allow them to shrink the orbit thus return quicker after a failed attempt to take control.

    They'd show up on military radar, as a small flier built from non-metallic materials. But a radar that sensitive would also get a lot of false positives, from flocks of birds and things like that, so the superhero might slip through.

    They might show up on a spy satellite, if a spy satellite happened to be watching the area they flew over at the right time.

    While they're in space, they'd look like an unusually large piece of satellite debris. [We already track a lot of those](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris#Tracking_and_measurement), but I'm not sure how well those tracking systems work for objects that aren't in a stable orbit.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:

    Probably depends on speed and body shape, as well as if there are any military around checking their radar (which, for the southwest, might be likely.) We can almost certaintly see them (The F22 radar can see something on the order of 1cm at 10 miles or something (I'm underestimating)) so it's less of a question of whether they can be seen and more of a question of whether they think it's a cruise missile/aircraft versus large bird.

    Virtually every task that is currently computationally expensive but solved would become trivial.

    Humans lose to robots at every single sport or game ever invented, possibly even to the same fundamental system (i.e. a general-purpose game-playing algorithm that requires only training data).

    Humans are relegated to aesthetic roles in engineering or architecture except on the bleeding edge where people haven't yet made algorithms for it. Basically, you mould the output of the designing algorithm to get the desired appearance and user experience while it ensures that the technical requirements are met.

    Algorithms predict the expected performance of new products based on various combinations of prior art, marketing, and target demographic. This results in some people pushing back against the dominant culture, favouring "unlikely to succeed" products, until the algorithms adapt to the new data and try to pin them down again. This is already happening, albeit with people instead of explicit algorithms.

    Likewise, there's a resurgence in artisanal products allegedly designed without the aid of any algorithms. People associate these with homeliness and personality, whereas algorithmic products are considered impersonal and sterile. Naturally, there are algorithmic products that seek to recreate this feel, including introducing artificial imperfections to give it the craftsman touch. Even self-proclaimed experts can't easily tell them apart (though actual experts can).

    Humans are almost completely removed from roles where failure could cause death where those roles are amenable to algorithms. For example, the entire aviation industry (maintenance, piloting, air traffic control, even scheduling) is monitored by humans but actually executed by algorithms.

    The above algorithms themselves are all checked by simulation and static analysis and any failure modes are corrected if possible. Most of the remaining cases are to do with humans in some way, such as when they fail to follow procedure or override the system.

    All the "@home" projects (e.g. SETI@home, Folding@home) are quickly completed and any potential benefits follow on from that. People keep finding replacement problems; in the long term this process solves, well, everything solvable. Have a look [at this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distributed_computing_projects) for inspiration.

    Larger organisms can be simulated at the neuron level. I believe we've mapped the connectome of a flatworm (or something like that) and verified its correctness, but that's only ~14 neurons. We're working on a mouse connectome, but I think that's going to be limited by our scan rate even if we had the CPU for it. That's a whole other can of worms, especially if simulating a human mind is reasonable.

    There's probably way more. Really, the limiting factors are what we can actually program (for explicit algorithms) and collecting data (for machine learning).

    Oh and google or its in-universe equivalent would be an unstoppable juggernaut floating ever higher on a tide of data.

      > Even self-proclaimed experts can't easily tell them apart (though actual experts can).

      Once the algorithms are good, I doubt even actual experts would be consistent in identifying true hand crafted just by their creativity... it would probably come down to tiny features and differences resulting from using machines, and I think if the machinery imitated human artisanship closely enough, not even the experts could tell (for example, a machine using a robotic hand to smooth wood with sandpaper might look exactly like a human's polishing, unless experts go to the trouble of figuring out any slight differences in the robotic hand vs. a human's and then comparing them, but even that might have false positives from humans that hold the sand paper differently than normal...).

      > Larger organisms can be simulated at the neuron level.

      I think we still don't know enough about everything neurons do to simulate a larger organism even if we had the computational power.  I don't know a good review off the top of my head if you want citations, but I am pretty sure I can find papers illustrating some of the ways are knowledge is lacking (if you want sources)... for example, we still don't entirely understand the role dendritic spines do, and although there are some models of their activity, I don't think we have a model that we could just plug into an overall neural computational model that would accurately capture their function.  Also, even if we had a mouse connectome, for example, this might not capture all the information we need.  To go back to the dendritic spines example, they can demonstrate plasticity on timescales on the order of minutes, so a connectome made by plasticizing and then cutting up the brain may miss information.

      > Virtually every task that is currently computationally expensive but solved would become trivial.

      I think there are some tasks that grow large enough that even with ridiculously cheap computing the standard "solved" algorithm might not be good enough... don't know of any good examples off the top of my head.
      ```

    ```
    By then we've probably hit uploading/GAI (or at least extremely competent AI) so there are probably plenty of stories answering that question already.

    In brief, we're probably going to see extremely efficient social networking (the system known who you'd like to interact with), consensus-modification software (it's much easier to convince someone to your viewpoint, unless they've made a specific effort to shield themselves) massive automation in nearly every sector that human employees aren't preferable solely by being human (ex. exotic dancers, sporting events), as well as many other large and small changes.

  Immortal monarchy.

  I did a brainstorm with people over at discord over how an immortal might hold on to rule a country for two-three centuries well into an analogue 20th-21st century for a recorded history of only about a thousand year. 

  There were couple of ideas:

  * Matrilineal succession - This is a requirement since the immortal in question is a female.
  * Symbolic office - I don't know how to best describe it...but when someone succeed, one must become a symbol. That means dressing and acting in some way according to tradition. So it becomes acceptable for the person to wear a mask.
  * Mask culture - In the imperial household, all the royals wear mask. Everyone, such as servants and guards, who works with them also wear masks. However, the royal family are total unknown. Nobody knows their face.
  * Only the family knows the truth about the immortal empress.
  * There are fable and tales alleging immortality, which some thought it might be immortality.
  * There are conflicting tales about the nature of immortality in the royal family. Some says reincarnation based on taking the crown. Others say that the empress impersonate her daughter or sister from generation to generation. Another says that the spirit adviser is passed from one generation to the next.

  I got no clues about how one might justify monarchy.

  For context:

  Yipang is an liberal monarchy, ruled by a secret immortal and is a world power. Parliamentary politics exist, complete with a nobility class. The right is a stronger supporter of monarchy yet don't support her majestcy's policy as much as the left. The left has stronger parliamentarian bias, but is stuck with a monarch that support their ideas and policies. 

  Sorta like Japan, but not really. It taken on the whole East Asian, mostly Japanese aesthetic. Regardless, one should not invite a Yipangese to a Japanese gathering, as there will be just as many social impasse and gaffe committed by them as any westerners.

  Setting is a world called Gaia, an analogue to our Earth, yet with a different world history, nations, and so  on. Time period is around their version of WW2. You may have read previous worldbuilding thread about my idea for a trans-dimensional story. This is where that story take place.
