## Request - anyone remember this story?

### Post:

My google-fu is failing me. :( Does anyone remember a story, which I think was originally at Less Wrong, of a robot that had been tasked with preserving the cryogenically frozen heads of it's ten human creators? The world goes to hell, and in the post-apocalyptic hellscape the robot figures it can keep these heads preserved about 100 years. 10 years later it runs into a much larger robot that's preserving 200 heads. It says that it can preserve the smaller robot's 10 heads, in addition to it's own 200, for approximately 3000(?) years, if the smaller robot is willing to disassemble itself right now so the larger robot can use it for parts. 

Anyone recall this, or what it was called, or have a link to it?
