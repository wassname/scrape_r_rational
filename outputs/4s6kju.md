  Okay, so, willing to bet (like, literally, I'd be willing to lay down $5 on this) that the body Sarah wants made is Sarah Michelle Gellar.
  ```

    I think it could be anyone.

    (Get it, because it's an NE-1 series Macbook?)

    (Also, what's Sarah Michelle-Gellar famous for in this universe, given that broadcast television stopped being a thing in the mid-80s and televisions are an endangered species?)

      Guessing that Sarah Michelle Gellar actually fought demons from hell in this reality and is honored as one of the heroes that perished in the failed assault against hell...
      ```

      You know, I was thinking pretty much all that.

      $5 is an amount low enough that it would be trivial for me to lose, but a boon for me to gain, so I figured it's a good stake to lay out in case someone were to take me up on it.

      It's probably a safe assumption (given that she's still famous and all) that Sarah Michelle-Gellar, as a burgeoning young actress, starred in movies rather than television. She had a big role in I Know What You Did Last Summer the same year Buffy started, for instance.
      ```

        I guess my confusion comes with the cultural association. In our world, Sarah Michelle-Gellar is/was a geek icon, so it makes sense that a geek like Aaron would have her as his wallpaper, as opposed to some other pretty actress. In the Unsongverse ... it would seem slightly out of character for Aaron to pick an actress from, for example, a summer horror movie from the late-90s.

        (Buffy was also a movie, but Sarah Michelle-Gellar wasn't the star. And I'm not sure that Buffy could/would exist in the same form given that a lot of it was about angels and demons.)

          These are good points. Honestly, this has piqued my curiosity quite a bit. I might actually make a post about this on /r/unsong.

    Wanna explain your reasoning? Finden that There are no vampires in unsong, I fail to See the "coincidence".

      Sarah the computer, who was given a soul in chapter 4, has a picture of "Sarah Michelle-Gellar striking a sexy pose" set as the desktop background, and was named after Sarah Michelle-Gellar.
      ```

        Already sold, but even better: she's meeting with a Watcher.
        ```

          OK, that clinches it.
          ```

        Well, now I wont take you up on your bet. Good eye for detail!
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Sarah thinks she ugly, she has a wallpaper of a female, god made adam first. Sarah has gender/body dysphoria.
    ```

    Would you be willing to gimmel that too?

      I don't want to put that much money on the line, my bank account might be lamed.

      Edit: Someone downvoted you. Clearly they didn't get the joke.

    Huh, I took that as acted shame rather than actual shame; Sarah (if it is Sarah) said it because it increases the appeal for Gadiriel and is a way to ensure secrecy/compliance. Same reason that Sarah phrased it as favor/gifts rather than a transaction. I'm not sure whether I'm being paranoid or not, but it seemed canny rather than genuine (and fit in with Gadiriel's schtick).

    I'd guess its offering the same Names because they are the least valuable ones it knows. Any other names are secret, but these are already known.

  I wonder whether any other cities or places have resident deities. Does NYC have a deity of insomnia?

    ```
    I assume New Jersey has the angelic equivalent of Sauron, and that the locals love him.

  > Eons ago, the heavenly host had sent some lower-ranking angels to Earth to watch over humans and make sure things proceeded apace. They learned the ways of people, started to grasp concepts like lying and manipulation and gray areas.
