## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Someone laughs. You make an inquiry regarding the reason. Unfortunately, it isn't a quick joke or silly image but something that requires a fair amount of context (say, between one and five minutes of explanation). 

  Would you prefer to get that context, or just be told that there's a lot of context that you don't have and so it wouldn't be funny for you?

    Depends on the person and what sort of time I have available, but usually I'd rather learn something than remain ignorant. Even if the joke isn't funny once tediously explained, I'm still closer to being amused by such jokes in the future. And, more importantly, I have some degree of understanding of a cultural touchstone.

    I just got back from seeing it. I thought it was one of those frustrating movies where I could see the germ of something good, but it was obscured by ... well, action was a big part of it, but also a little bit too much pandering, especially with regards to morally reprehensible characters being set up for the audience to hate, then extended sequences where they all get killed by dinosaurs (which I'd call textbook torture porn if the movie wasn't PG-13).

    Germs of good stuff:

    1. Claire gets called out on her complicity in the events of the first movie. Given more runtime and less of a focus on action sequences, I feel like this whole movie could have been about her overcoming her guilt over what happened in the first movie.
    2. There's at least some focus on the question of commercialization, which seems like fertile ground. The dinosaurs were initially created in order to be a tourist attraction, and in this movie there's a definite question of "but what are the dinosaurs *for*?", which gets a few lines but not much more. If they wanted to do a deep dive on animal rights, that would have been the way to go; dinosaurs cost time, money, and require a lot of expertise, which just isn't going to happen without some economic *purpose*, short of a billionaire bankrolling the whole thing. Admittedly, [spoiler](#s "this is what they thought they were getting.")
    3. I actually thought that the little girl was a brilliant addition ... that was completely squandered. If you wanted to provide parallels to [spoiler](#s "'not being able to let go of the past' or 'recreating things from the past, but inevitably different than they were before'"), then that's a great way to go, but it all remains unexplored subtext, probably because it's a little bit too divisive of a question for a Hollywood action movie, especially if it's not going to be a focus. The movie did basically nothing with it.

    > That's not as much of an insult as it sounds like; I long ago came to the conclusion that movies are an inferior medium for conveying narrative

    I don't see why. It's a different medium with different constraints, but there are stories that are more suited to a movie than a book or a TV series.

        Movies give pretty good enjoyment value per unit of time spent watching them, and are cheap time investments. Yeah, a good book is amazing to finish, but if I spend 10 hours reading a book for it to end unsatifyingly, then I'm going to feel much more put out compared to a 2 hour movie that was similarly bad precisely because I had much less time invested in the movie.

        Also, I think action movies don't have good translations into other mediums. There's action in books, certainly, but it isn't precisely the same to me, and live action movies are much better able to do action scenes well than similar live action TV shows. Mad Max: Fury Road couldn't have translated it's action scenes into a TV format, because a TV series wouldn't have made as much money, and thus wouldn't have had the same budget. There's animated action movies of similar scope, but that's basically a different genre given the relative budget and importance put into the different mediums.

        You can somewhat consider the MCU to be a long running, expansive TV show where each episode happens to be a 2 hour movie, and given it's popularity I think that does lend credence to your idea that TV is better than movies.

          I'm particularly a fan of DC animated movies. They nail a tone and type of action scenes that you can't really get in live action movies.

            I really enjoyed Assault on Arkham, and they're generally fairly good I agree.

        You're saying that like the longer something is, the better.

        Speaking for myself, I've stopped watching hours-long let's plays, and moved on to formats like Ross's Game Dungeon, where the content creator spends time polishing the result instead of giving me a dull hours-long stream-of-thought. When I do watch stream-of-thought type media, I tend to accelerate it x1.5 or x2 or I lose attention.

  So, the US Supreme Court [ruled](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-494_j4el.pdf) this week that states can force companies outside their borders to collect taxes from the state's residents, or so called Internet Sales Tax. It was a 5-4 decision, but a mixed bag of liberal and conservative justices on either side, so the politics is somewhat a wash. The jurisprudence is an absolute disaster (Kennedy doesn't seem to have a strong grasp of the English language). In particular, the problem is that a state cannot force a company to collect taxes unless it has some connection with the state, like a physical presence. Kennedy decided that a *virtual* connection is sufficient, like say, because everyone is virtually connected by the internet (hence my complaint that he doesn't understand language). He makes all kinds of arguments about "authority" to impose taxes, but isn't that somewhat different than power?

  So, my question: How is a state supposed force compliance? Is a state supposed to send their state troopers into another state to seize assets from a non-compliant company?
  ```

  - u/gbear605:
    ```
    Presumably the state would sue the company, and if the company doesn't pay up after the court case, the state that the company is based in would have their police/government help, just like how it works with any other court case across state lines.

    If it's across country borders it becomes a lot more questionable, but it probably depends on the country's relationship with the US. If the other country is entirely hostile, what would happen is that if the owners of the company ever entered the US, they would be arrested.
