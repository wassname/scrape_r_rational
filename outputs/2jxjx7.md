  > (As a side note, those superheroes who develop or invent entirely unique powers, and then hoard them? Screw those guys. When Edison invented the incandescent lightbulb, did he keep its secret to himself, and then bust nocturnal crime as the Illuminator? Fighting the nefarious Doktor Lightning with the help of the Amazing Flight Brothers? No. Because, as a man of Science, he was familiar with Newton's statement about the shoulders of giants.)

  Edison did, however, engage in extensive litigation around the patent rights to the incandescent bulb, and was fairly notoriously litigious about the use of "his" inventions. Edison *absolutely* would have hoarded his inventions if he could have made money that way. Tesla was the one who eschewed patents and shared his discoveries and inventions.

    Is it wrong that I immediately assumed this was ahistorical because it was a positive thing about Tesla on the internet? (too much Tesla hype relative to Tesla substance these days)

    One search later: vindicated, I guess. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nikola_Tesla_patents

      From Tesla's Wikipedia article:

      > Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.

      Which is what I was talking about. There's also this quote from him about Marconi's use of his patents:

      > Otis Pond, an engineer then working for Tesla, said, "Looks as if Marconi got the jump on you." Tesla replied, "Marconi is a good fellow. Let him continue. He is using seventeen of my patents."

      Though the Patent Office reversed their decision and inexplicably (though probably through bribes or use of political power) granted Marconi the patent for radio, which made Tesla furious since that meant that Marconi could sue him. (The Supreme Court later reversed that decision.)

      There are a number of other instances as well.

        Again, this positive thing about Tesla on the internet sounds shaky. In fact, it sounds shaky at nearly every point. Wikipedia has no citation for Tesla forgoing patents (particularly relative to other inventors). The quote sounds too snappy to be verbatim. Impugning the motives of the patent office sounds like motivated reasoning. The fundamental principles of radio predate both Tesla and Marconi - calling anything "the patent for radio" sounds like it's obfuscating important technical details. I seem to recall something about the Supreme Court case being more complicated than you imply, and there being a third patent that predated either Tesla or Marconi.

          The quote is from [this PBS website](http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_whoradio.html). So take that how you will - I don't want to derail this thread into a debate about Tesla, which I have no real stake in.

      Given that Tesla had an order of magnitude fewer patents than [Edison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Edison_patents) did, It's probably safe to say that relative to Edison he eschewed them, unless he invented fewer things or had fewer opportunities to patent.
      ```

    ```
    Patents are shoulders of giants all the same (although a patent may slow the release of other inventions relying on it). The difference is between outright secrecy and release to the public.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I just wish that the example had been someone like Elon Musk, who [released patents to the public](http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you) for (semi) altruistic reasons.
      ```

  Everyone makes fun of superheroes until an Endbringer attacks.
  ```

  - u/Azkaban_Guard:
    ```
    Anyone curious about Endbringers should set aside a month or so to read Worm, at parahumans.wordpress.com

    It's a rational superhero setting, with a world full of hero's and villains with developed, realistic motivations.
    ```

    - u/t3tsubo:
      ```
      I swallowed worm in 2 weeks. A++ would recommend again, just had to skim some of the tedious fights about 5/8 through
      ```

      - u/comport:
        ```
        I also went through it in a couple of weeks, and I would recommend the fic, but I wouldn't recommend trying to power through it. 2 weeks of 14 hour reading days had weird effects on me, especially when I started getting to the horror arcs.

          I did it in five days when I was unemployed. Intense is about the best word to describe it. 

          Slow and steady is a much better pace.
          ```

  >And if you do, somehow, develop a special power or device that allows you to anticipate crimes or teleport to the scene... well, then you have the choice of either becoming a superhero with it, or patenting it, mass-producing it, becoming insanely rich, and putting it in the hands of the police who are already equipped and motivated to fight crime far better than you can anyway. 

  My desire to put that kind of surveillance network into the hands of the police is *pretty* low, even if I could build one using off-the-shelf software-defined radios and a bit of hackery. There are better things to work on.

    >that kind of surveillance network in the hands of the police

    Let's face it, that pretty much exists already - at least to intelligence agencies who can be less accountable than police.  

    If it could be build cheaply, I'd give it to *everyone* and then start working on actual security.

  May I also recommend the same writer's webcomic, [Leftover Soup](http://leftoversoup.com/), which consists of 1)pretty good rapid-fire jokes 2)pretty good rapid-fire amateur philosophy 3)realistic, intelligent characters with very different viewpoints on the world 4)slow, detailed plot (time progresses fairly slowly in-comic) that progresses in a sensible, usually predictable way.

  It's not necessarily /rational/ (the most-main character has hit several diabolus ex machinas), but it has many properties in common and is likely to appeal to this sub.
