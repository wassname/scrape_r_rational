## Hermione Granger and the Silent Country, ch. 1: Look Both Ways (pt. 1 4 of There is Nothing to Fear, a Gryffindor!Voldemort AU)

### Post:

The latest chapter, "Look Both Ways," can be found [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/66202159). 

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

**This series is being posted in various places:** 

* Initial updates can be found on Sufficient Velocity [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.49249/) and on Spacebattles [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/).
* The polished version can be found on Archive of Our Own [here](https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368), with a one-week delay. 
* I'm publishing a chapter to Fanfiction.net [here](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13715432/1/There-is-Nothing-to-Fear), every week. The first thirteen stories are getting published on FFnet as a single 23-chapter story, which some folks may appreciate. 

**Updates every other week.**

  I love this series, but as I recommended it to a friend the other day I struggled to properly explain why. Part of it is the worldbuilding of course, everything seems thought through and both taking from and building on canon in clever ways. But there is something else that is really drawing me in - I can't tell if it's the story or writing style or what, I'm just absorbed when reading. I'll try to figure it out, but for now I'll just say kudos and please keep writing. 

  My favorite detail so far is the Roman Wizarding Republic - "not Roman, not really a Republic, but at least a Wizarding" is how it remember it going. Funny and clever.

    Alluding to a famous quote about the Holy Roman Empire presumably.
    ```

      ```
      Yes. 

      (For anyone who isn't aware, it's a quote by Voltaire: "The Holy Roman Empire was neither Holy nor Roman, nor an Empire." The Wizarding Roman Republic, on the other hand, is not Roman, and not much of a republic, but at least has wizards.)

    Thank you! The worldbuilding's a point of pride for me, so it's always great to see another person get excited about it.

      Well deserved pride. In fact the level of care in the worldbuilding combined with your username made me suspect you were one of Alexander Wales' alt accounts! Do you have any other works published anywhere?
      ```

      - u/callmesalticidae:
        ```
        Some short stories published in print media, a lot more that are in the pipeline, and a couple of Creative Commons flash fics [here](https://wmbsaltworks.wordpress.com/category/fiction/). 

        I also have a lot of worldbuilding resources [here](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/10909/WMB-Saltworks), and a (dead) serial called [Heroes Save the World](https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/), which petered out mostly because I was in grad school + homeless.

  Hm, where is one supposed to start reading the series? AO3 shows me 2 separate series in the link you posted, Part 1 of There is Nothing to FearPart 4 of Other Faces of Tom Riddle, for the first story in the list, Men Who Are Resolved.Edit: Aditionally, FF[.net](https://Fanfiction.net) and AO3 show different first chapters for the parts listed, the story I listed above is the second chapter on [FF.net](https://FF.net), the first one is with the Minister.
  ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    Men Who Are Resolved. 

    "Other Faces" is more like a collection, but folks have bookmarked it so I'm reluctant to just dissolve it. 

    (I'll probably reach out to the people who've bookmarked and let them know I'm reorganizing things)
    ```

    - u/bjayernaeiy:

      Thanks for the clarification!

  i read through this recently and figure it’s about the only good hp fanfiction i’ve found in the last three years 

  reserving judgment overall since the plot hasn’t untangled itself yet 

  any idea how long it will be when finished?

  thanks for writing
  ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    Thank you! That's high praise. 

    > any idea how long it will be when finished?

    Probably 3-5 years, based on my current outline and my bi-weekly update rate (every chapter goes through multiple drafts before I post it on SB/SV).
    ```

    - u/Valdrax:
      ```
      Oh my, I like that you have it planned out that far and am willing to make a commitment in spite of knowing that it will be for several years.  You give me high hopes for completion.
      ```

      - u/callmesalticidae:
        ```
        Thank you! 

        Now that I’m out of grad school, probably the only thing that’ll actually kill this story is just...not getting any kind of reader engagement (which seems unlikely, because engagement has been pretty steady). There’s a risk of burnout too, I guess, but the publishing rate gives me enough breathing room to work on other projects too (at present: an original fiction novel, some worldbuilding resources, and another Harry Potter AU that’ll be *much* shorter than TINTF).
        ```

        - u/Valdrax:
          ```
          Well, from what I've read so-far, I only expect your readership to build.  It's a *fascinating* concept and well executed.
          ```

          - u/callmesalticidae:
            ```
            Thank you! That means a lot.
            ```

- u/bjayernaeiy:
  ```
  What philosophy have you drawn from and has been the most influential in your character development of Tom Riddle?
  ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    Reductionism, with respect to personal identity, is the idea that "the self" doesn't exist. Put simply, what we call "the self" is *reducible* to simpler components. 

    What this boils down to is that Tom Riddle's desire to never die is perfectly compatible with his apparent death (in the conventional sense), because he chooses to identify himself not as "a particular subjective point of view" but as a *pattern*, and not simply as a pattern predominantly composed of experiences and memories (as most reductionists would) but as a pattern predominantly composed of beliefs and values (what we might call "Death Eater-ism"). 

    The most thorough work on (identity) reductionism is probably Derek Parfit's *Reasons and Persons*, but you could probably commit murder with a hardcover edition, so I would recommend *Personal Identity and Buddhism* by Mark Siderits for a more approachable work that isn't (checks book) 500+ pages with a tiny font. 

    (This is my attempt to explain some of what's going on with Riddle without (a) spoiling future story developments or (b) writing a dissertation on the topic, which I guess could be fun but... I'd say "but it probably wouldn't be of interest to anybody here," except that I said that about the Margaret Thatcher letter and was proven wrong on that count, lol)
    ```

    - u/bjayernaeiy:
      ```
      I would be definitely interested to read something more along those lines, in respect to the discertation comment, if you end up doing something like that in the future!  
      Keep up the good work, I very much enjoyed the first two stories so far, and thanks for the references. Not familiar with this philosophy so will have to read up on it.
      ```

    - u/Roneitis:
      ```
      This is a /fascinating/ response
      ```

- u/GreenSatyr:
  ```
  Great chapter! Isn't the kidnapping a bit at odds with Riddle's professed politics of being muggle-friendly?
  ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    Riddle’s nice to muggle-borns, not muggles (he’s a magical supremacist, basically), and argues that “leaving muggle-borns with muggles” is basically child abuse by way of neglect and endangerment.
    ```

- u/RMcD94:
  ```
  I was greatly misled by "Chapters:2/19" I was getting ready to enjoy a good chunk of text

  Though at least I got to enjoy reading the rest of it. I'll add my voice to the songs of praise. If only there was a few million more words
  ```
