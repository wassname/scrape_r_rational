## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  So I think /r/place is the best argument against anarcho-capitalism I've ever seen. Given unlimited freedom but limited resources, groups have banded together, waged war aginst other groups, solidified their territorial boundraries, and built alliances and civilizations (well, pixel art, but they're basically the same thing).
  ```

  - u/NotACauldronAgent:
    ```
    What I found interesting is the cooperation that groups built. When the German and Belgian flag intercepted, they cooperated to make a hot dog thing. When PlaceHearts overlapped with FTB, FTB added a heart to their design. Somehow, PrequelMemes managed to write out their entire script, and there have been some big artworks. Even in this no-rules setting, cooperation beats out disorganization, easily.

    Sounds to me like people managed to compete, cooperate and create without a central authority with a monopoly on legitimate violence. How is this a point *against* anarcho-capitalism?
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      People created their **own** central authorities with monopolies on legitimate violence. You had to run changes through your own faction or territory owners, or the faction at large would revert your changes. Indeed, there were even super-factions that regulated the efforts of individual factions. For example, r/ainbowroad was closely watching the area around helix, and required permission before modifying or creating stuff around it. I had to check into their discord to make sure the /r/parahumans sign expansion was OK.

        There's nothing about anarcho-capitalism that forbids hierarchical authorities, as long as submission is voluntary and exit is free.

          >There's nothing about anarcho-capitalism that forbids hierarchical authorities

          It's not really an anarchy if there's a hierarchical authority.

          >as long as submission is voluntary and exit is free.

          By that definition, we (that is, americans) currently live in an anarcho-capitalist state, because there's nothing preventing someone from renoucing their citizenship and leaving the nation.

            Not strictly true. Anarcho-capitalist states permitting X does not mean that the presence of X implies anarcho-capitalism.

            Anarcho-capitalist states presumably also permit breathing and existing, after all.
            ```

            - u/GaBeRockKing:
              ```
              >Not strictly true. Anarcho-capitalist states permitting X does not mean that the presence of X implies anarcho-capitalism.

              I was speaking in conjunction with the "hierarchical authority" part. That is, /u/BadGoyWithAGun said that hierarchical authority can be a part of anarcho-capitalism, so long as conditions x and y are filled. I was pointing out that allowing for a heirarchical authority with control over legitimate violence dilutes the meaning of anarcho-capitalism to the point where ancaps might as well just choose a new term.

              Essentially, my argument goes like this:

              1.) Take a broadly anarcho capitalist landscape  
              2.) If some group creates a  hierarchical authority, voluntarily or otherwise, they are no longer anarcho-capitalist, but instead their own type of government (Whether tribal, feudalistic, democratic, or whatever) that is surrounded by anarcho-capitalism, rather than being ancaps themselves. The /r/place equivalent is factions who decide to work on projects in the middle of the chaos.  
              3.) From here, as demonstrated by the pixel arts that flourished across /r/place replacing the chaos or single-person projects, established factions will outcompete and either incorporate (convince people to join in making a piece of art) or subjugate (immediately replace changes made by free agents) the surrounding unorganized people.  

              tl;dr: anarcho-capitalism gets outcompeted
              ```

    ```
    I think you're underestimating the pre-existing condition of people doing those things *on purpose*, purely for fun. What I saw was a bunch of people wanting to form factions as quickly as possible and start building storylines, especially those reenacting the button. There was a huge roleplay element to it in the "primative tribal" stages which shouldn't go unmentioned. The bigger argument is the meta-problem of rampant botting advertisements, IMHO.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      >I think you're underestimating the pre-existing condition of people doing those things on purpose, purely for fun. 

      But that too is part of the argument-- people already exist in a state where they want societies. Even if the ancaps managed to systematically dismantle the government, they wouldn't manage to change *everyone* minds, and like on /r/place, the uncoordinated majority gets overtaken by the coordinated minority.
      ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    What actually was r/place? I keep seeing posts about it but don't know how it worked or what art had to do with it. Maybe it's because I'm using BaconReader so I'm missing something visual from the website.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      yeah, baconreader didn't have it, although evidently the offical reddit app did.

      But in short, it was a 1000x1000 pixel canvas, where each account created before april 1st could place one pixel every 'x' minutes, where 'x' was common through all accounts, but was changed multiple times over the project. (First 'x' was proportional to the number of people on, capping out at ~10 mins, and then it was changed to 5 minutes.)

      Because of that time requirement, placing anything virtually mandated cooperation between people. The larger the group, the larger the item they could work to create, although there were diminishing returns as bigger items attracted more vandals (See: the OSU! near the bottom right-hand corner.)

      Groups tended to coordinate either on their home subreddits, specific place-based subreddits linked to on their home subreddits (what /r/parahumans did), discord channels, private messaging anyone who flipped your pixel when you tried to do something new (I did a *lot* of this), or just basic pattern recognition (for example, the flags, the rainbow road, the green lattice, and most infamously, the all-consuming blue corner.)

      If you look near the center of the map, above and to the right of the american flag and the rainbow, there's a squirtle holding the portuguese flag, and a kangaroo on a box. Between those two items is the "read parahumans" banner I wager most of the /r/rational people who frequented /r/place worked to create, expand, elaborate on, and defend.

      The whole thing was a lot of fun, so it's a pity you missed it.

  An immortality idea - Possible now, but a very long shot. More realistically doable in the next 100-200 years, though still a long shot then I'd say.

  To start out with, a lengthy six paragraph intro. Fair warning in case you want to skip the justification for the approach, and get straight into the approach.

   biology is hard. As a biologist it is staggering the amount of mathematics actually involved with understanding systems like the genome let alone the brain. The interdisciplinary interplay between biology, is necessary to understand something is incredible. Math, chemistry, and physics are all necessary to understand what is going on and be able to learn more. You can get summaries, but that's different from really understanding something. You need a large number of people working together to understand these interdisciplinary subjects, which makes understanding something as large and complex as the human life span a daunting task.

   I'm not an expert, just completing undergrad, but the amount we have yet to learn about the genome, let alone gene expression makes me think progress on that front is going to be very slow. 

  We're not particularly close to understanding aging. We don't have a good idea of how gene expression changes with age. Gene expression is difficult to study in part because we don't understand the human genome completely, so the epigenome is more difficult to study because of that. Then there are ethical limitations on human experimentation (which we really do need to have) that slow research down. Even if we were to get rid of those ethical considerations human beings are not good model organisms. We have small numbers of kids with generations times at minimum of around 13 years. Consider to study a single gene generally dozens of generations of an organism are observed. 

  Working with model organisms can speed up studying homologous areas, but there are inevitably large differences between human beings and say *C. elegans* that studying the nematodes will simply not be applicable. In effect, I think it is going to be more than 100 years before we make serious progress on understanding human aging let alone doing something about it.

  Given that I think aging research is going to be slow and I'd like to see something happen in my lifetime, I think it would be better to narrow the area of research one is trying to do.  The brain is the interesting part related to consciousness. "Well duh," says everyone, but bear with me. Narrowing our focus further; For our immortality purposes, we aren't interested in genetics or gene expression in the brain, We are interested in the connectivity and signaling.

  If there are zero signals ([action potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential)) in your brain, you're brain dead. If there are no connections in your brain you are also brain dead, considering with no connections there is no way to pass a signal, and in effect no signals can be passed.

  Pardon the large intro, but I hope it gives context for my approach.

  I think to take a shot at immortality in our lifetimes we need to focus on generating new connections with the brain from outside of the brain. I think that given that the connections made, and the signaling patterns that result, are what ultimately make up consciousness, we might be able to extent some part of our consciousness outside of our skull and into a neuronal circuit in vitro. Something like a cell culture.

  The main sticking point is can you actually use or somehow interact in a meaningful way with a neuronal circuit grown outside your brain? This is tricky and would require a lot of research, but requires far less work than a total understanding of aging.

  The advantage of this approach is that we don't necessarily need to understand anything about aging or consciousness. We just need to understand enough to introduce a new connection to our nervous system and then grow that system. We don't have to necessarily understand how the circuits we've connected to are growing and work. We just have to know enough to initiate development.

  The general approach is basically to let the developmental processes that resulted in our brain happen again outside of our skull while we are attached to this developing nervous system. It may then be possible to imprint ourselves onto this developing in vitro nervous system, such that when the body that houses our skull dies the nervous system dies we suffer something more akin to brain damage than death.

  If we were able to utilize enough of the in vitro nervous system for our conscious processes before our body died we may have then been able to train the system to house our consciousness. Whether such an existence would be worthwhile is another question.

  tl;dr It might be possible to exploit developmental processes rather than wholly understand them, and thus allow for some continued existence after our normal life span.

    If you look at the efforts of organisations like SENS to achieve longevity and eventually immortality, they agree with you. Biology is hard. 

    But fixing the things that break does not require an understanding how that thing came to be and the intricate processes that led to it breaking down (and especially no need to understand how you would edit a human to not break down in the first place).

    It just requires observation of a problem and working out how to fix the problem (temporarily is fine, as long as it can be repeated or superceded). 

    Building a car that runs forever is very hard. Keeping a car in working condition is comparatively easy. 

    Aubrey DeGrey of SENS often speak of "longevity escape velocity". You develop some techniques to fix some issues and give people some extra years. During that time, medicine advances and some more things become fixable, granting some more years. Since technology develops exponentially, we can expect even more breakthroughs during this time, granting more years. And so on. Eventually the technology to prolong your life (or rather, prevent your death) is constantly available within your latest lifespan, effectively granting immortality without actually turning any human into an immortal. 

    This aproach feels to me like the most realistic to work anytime soon.

    It's an interesting concept. I assume you'd need good VR and full body paralysis during transition so that you don't end up jostling the mechanism (unless it's small enough to be wearable?), then you'd need a good brain tissue culturing system that isn't going to break down over the long term.

    You could also ensure the new brain tissue comes with built in cybernetic electronic devices (sensors to allow you to send mental commands and control virtual / robotic bodies, memory modules to allow eidetic memory, transmitters to form non-biological communications links from one spot in the tissue system to another, and so on), and genetically engineer the stem cells it grows from with better ability to survive cryonics in the event that it is needed, avoid neurodegenerative illness, and survive better without normal organs.

    It's sort of like the brain in a jar idea, but it doesn't have to be shaped like a human brain normally is, and would more closely resemble the neural cultures we can realistically experiment with.

  Re: AI in a box experiment.
  (I thought to comment in the original thread, but I'm a little late to the party)

  I always thought that the source of the problem is that you actually want something from the AI (for example, a cure for cancer).
  Else, why build a gate at all? (or the AI itself for that matter)

  The gate keeper's goal is to allow some information flow (that could be helpful and beneficial) without risking freeing the AI (and world destruction).

  The point is, when you're dealing with an entity that is vastly more intelligent than you,  you can never be sure of the full consequences of your actions  (the cure for cancer could somehow lead to freedom for the AI).

  On a more general note,  I'm not entirely sure that the required level of intelligence for that kind of trick is even possible. A lot of people fear an AI because it might be able to improve itself, but I'm not sure that it is possible to self improve in a consistent way. Moreover, intelligence itself is not a linear property,  i.e. , in order to be twice as intelligent, you would have to invest a lot more than twice the effort. And that means that even if some entity could self improve, this exponential process does not lead to an intelligence explosion. 

  Edit: Formatting

    >in order to be twice as intelligent, you would have to invest a lot more than twice the effort.

    I'm not sure what evidence you could possibly be basing this on.. Do you have evidence that might support this such as animals with larger brain to body ratios requiring exponentially more resources from their brain than should be expected for their relative size? Because that would certainly draw my attention (though how much that would apply to a different computational medium would still be unclear) however I can't seem to find anything indicating this is the case.

    I certainly hope you're not trying to use humans as your evidence given we can't even change our hardware (and can make only relatively tiny software changes) and on an absolute scale we have quite little hardware variation compared to other species, plus attempts to increase IQ tend to be rather lackluster and work best on who score lower due to lack of familiarity with mental problems of that sort. Also given how much difference a relatively tiny advantage in social intelligence can make among humans I'm not sure the "absolute" increase in intelligence needed to make something seem incomprehensible to us would be very much.
    ```

    - u/liveoi:
      ```
      Well, Intelligence is not a very well defined term, and I don't have a rigorous proof for my claim (that intelligence is not linear).

      I could try to explain my reasoning about it.
      In the most general sense, I consider intelligence as the capacity for problem solving ([Wikipedia sort of agrees with me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence)). 

      A lot of the interesting problems are of the NP complexity class. That means that in order to become better at solving them, you need to invest an exponential amount of resources. This is true regardless of your hardware/software choice. 

      In a more abstract sense, I think that the most interesting aspects of intelligence (such as creativity and self-awareness) are poorly understood, and we have no reason to believe that simply throwing more computational resources will increase them.
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        I think you're overestimating how much of a limit exponential problems are here. Remember that people find out ways to use clever tricks to solve problems that ought to require far more computation at the cost of not being 100% certain they found the best possible solution.                                 
        It's of note that the travelling salesman problem has been solved for millions of cities within less than a percent of the optimal solution. The point is that the AI doesn't need to be perfect, that's why machine learning uses heuristics, once you only require solutions that are good enough many seemingly insurmountable problems become manageable.                

        Just because there may be problems that require exponential increases in intelligence doesn't mean they are the sort of thing that is going to significantly matter in the context of an AI foom.

        As for just "throwing computational ability" at intelligence improvements, well nobody is seriously proposing that most performance breakthroughs are due to software improvements. Similarly the idea is that human level AI will make improvements by changing it's software which for something with an ability to hyperfocus on tasks indefinitely at vastly accelerated speeds compared to a human could occur quickly.

    Bostrom's *Superintelligence* has a whole chapter on the balance between optimizing power and recalcitrance, and I think he lays out a strong argument that the difficulty curve really depends on the system in question. You can't simply say "intelligence is not linear" without knowing anything about the system implementing that intelligence, and we don't know enough about what artificial intelligence solutions will look like to say whether or not adding more intelligence is as simple as adding more processors.

    - u/liveoi:

      Interesting. But that is basically saying that we wouldn't know if it is possible to create a super intelligence before we have built one.

        I think it's worth reading, though having read through the majority of the Sequences there wasn't a lot that was new to me. It is a well-organized and cited overview of many of the arguments surrounding superintelligence (though I don't fully buy his conclusions).

  My rational gay vampire romance is very nearly finished! I'm so excited. I don't have a title yet which is killing me. I made a GIANT list of possible titles, including every single one no matter how bad they were, and I hate almost all of them and the ones I like don't really tell you anything about the story. 

  Note that to make things even *more complicated* the story is also the first “volume” of three. So I’m looking either for a title that could be for all three volumes (which together would make one full-length ~100-150k word novel) or just for this volume. 

  Also anything with the word ‘vampire’  makes it sound really low rent but the title probably should tell you to expect vampires??

  Anyway... I'm desperate so I'm going to post my list of ideas here. No more Sunday Writing Skills Thread so this will do???

  Themes:
  Fitting in, learning about a new society, making a relationship work, being in over your head, relationship between two different people, new customs

  Other thing to note: the "point of vision" character (the human who falls in love with the vampire) is named Red. My boyfriend suggested a bunch of titles with a pun on that and they make very little sense if you don't know that. 

  Also it's set in the 1940s, mostly Corsica (France) but also Rome and Columbus, Ohio.

  **Possible Titles**

  * Victorian Flower Language

  * Speaking his Language

  * Vampire Languages

  * Symbolism

  * Deeper

  * Understanding

  * One’s Sorrow Two’s Mirth (or something else from one of those counting rhymes)

  * Seeing Red (Gimmicky but there's an upside: can do a series: Seeing Red / Blood Red / Red Carpet or something using idioms with red in them)

  * Red (could be just the title of the three volume story made of the above)

  * A Platinum Tree (Somewhere I read you should title a story based on a line from the story, or an object that appears in the story. A character being given a platinum tree as a gift is what starts everything going on a downward spiral.)

  * Lemon and Lavender (Lemon and lavender also falls in there (what I made the vampire's cologne smell like after googling popular 1940s colognes), it seems like the sort of thing that kind of could be like symbolic?)

  * Electrum

  * When In Rome  (so cliched)

  * When In Rome, do as the Vampires

  * Do as the Romans/Vampires(???) Do

  * Gift Horse

  * In the mouth (way too sexual but maybe that's a good thing? .... no)

  * -->It is necessary to howl with the wolves (a literal french equivalent of “When in 
  Rome”)

  * Howl(ing) with/like the Wolf (I really like that "when in rome" in French is "howl with wolves when you're with wolves", because wolves = predators = vampires, but the universe has werewolves in it, so using a wolf-oriented title in a vampire book might be weird??)

  * ---> À la guerre comme à la guerre (“at war is as at war”: French equiv of “All’s fair 
  in love and war”)

  * Love and War (central conflict is a Vampire War, but this title has been taken a lot)

  * À la guerre (no english speaker will know how to pronounce this, probably: "guerre" more or less rhymes with "fair", at least in my accent)

  * All’s Fair 

  * At War

  * At war 

  * At war is at war

  * When at War

  * Custom (current favourite: all chapters have one-word titles, *Death Note* style, and it's a great double meaning: custom = job,  custom = behaviours both of which are important here??? - but it really doesn't tell you what to expect from the story (vampires, romance))

  * Strange Ways

  * His Ways

  * Learning the Ropes

  * Present

  * Presentation

  * Gift

  * The Gift

  * Vampire’s Gift

  * Hearts Fangs and Abs (I suggested this as a joke on a thread here a few months ago)

  * Pounded in the Butt by Vampire Worldbuilding (this is a serious suggestion)

    I like Seeing Red by far the best out of those.  Implies blood, conflict, and passion, just from red symbolism, and since we should find out the character is named Red right from the start, works as a pun.  Plus, it sounds like a paranormal romance title to me, which lets readers know what to expect
    ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    I'm ambivalent on puns, personally, and tend to only like one word titles when they're nouns that both specify and are specified by the book (e.g. Mars, or Thud!, or Luminosity), but I understand that other people like one-word titles when they're thematically or emotionally resonant (e.g. Twilight, since we're talking supernatural romance).

    If you want a one-word title, then, I'd suggest either something that is key to your book but is otherwise rare, or something that is evocative of the mood of the book (Of your list, Electrum seems most powerful in this sense. If there's a metaphor for alloying silver and gold in there somewhere, that could be cool). Totally alternately, what's your first (or possibly last) chapter title?
