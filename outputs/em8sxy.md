  The Dahl energy in this is unreal.

    Fingersmithing, death by leg of lamb...there's a lot of RD references in here.

      ```
      Would anyone else be interested in a thread on all the references so far? I've read some Dahl but I'm missing more than half on my first read-through I'm sure

  Sigh. Fine, you win. Good job arting.

  >The one person Chill Lee had wanted to come most, his greatest hero, had not been able to make it. That was understandable. It was a long way from the clouds.

  Presumably James? That explains the juice and the adventures.

  So the >!*content* of the answer was the most obvious, straightforward thing possible, and the real twist was the method of input!<! That's fantastic.

  Holy HELLS what a fake-out! This author is a MADMAN! A MAdMaN I TELL YOU! What sort of sadist wraps us in an honest ode to Roald Dahl, turns it around, tells us to F off, then turns around and says he was JOKING?! 

  Gazemaize, I tip my hat to you.

  On the one hand, I'm really happy that this continued and was in fact a satisfying marble.  On the other HOW *DARE* YOU MESS WITH MY EMOTIONS IN THIS WAY

  >"You were right about that one part with the screen," said JUROR. "If it makes you feel any better."

  I do feel [somewhat better](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ebr32p/chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_fudge_revelation/fb7twbk/), but also personally attacked.

  Well played u/gazemaize, you utter gazztromple. :D

    God dammit you people one layer of spoiler protection is fine.

      [Bu, yrg hf unir bhe sha.](https://rot13.com/)

      Also, I was sufficiently convinced of my answer that I thought it might actually spoil the fun. The ROT13 was a compromise between posting it unencrypted and not posting it at all.

      I'm very happy to have been bamboozled!
      ```

      - u/traverseda:
        ```
        Yes I do know about rot13, but spoiler tags are probably enough, and rot13 is probably enough. Together it's a bit annoying to navigate. Comments that are entirely rot13nd are a lot easier to keep track of, since it doesn't involve copy-and-pasting a bunch of small text segments, or copying the whole thing and toggling between what half is actually readable at any given time.

        - u/AnthropicSynchrotron:

          You are of course entirely correct. :)

  >!That title drop was worth the entire fic tbh. Also screw you, it doesn't make sense for a fetus to put chocolate inside a screen, my solution is still right and you know it.!<

  Also, we're doing [*another* stream](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/437697099383963668/664892078974697472/unknown.png) to finish up the Roald Dahl cinematic universe now that Chili's continuing. We did Charlie and the Fox last time, this time we're streaming Matilda and The Witches.

  Specific info's available at that link, general info on how the streams go is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ejgkla/d_friday_open_thread/fcycjiq/).

    ```
    I think Chillenial's solution was right, but needed to be chocolate coated. 

    * JUROR probably had chocolate on his finger when the page loaded, and he poked the blank spot
    * Vape lady was probably vaping chocolate smoke
    * Ocean lady's crab had probably been eating chocolate when it poked the screen
    * Good parent lady probably had chocolate coated fingers and an iPad because her parents are so good

    The non-Reedus magic fetus I don't have a good answer for, since he's in a biomech right now and can't really touch anything.
    ```

    - u/Newfur:
      ```
      Oh! He's soaked through with chocolate - remember CHOCOR?
      ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Maybe the globe-spanning Wonka panopticon actually is a thing, and if someone instructs someone else to physically place chocolate on the screen, it counts the person who had the idea as the solver. People who just stumbled across the solution, but without anyone else's help, get counted as solvers by default.
      ```

  ```
  When I saw this post on the subreddit I laughed heartily for a good 20 seconds. however I will see that this is an addition to the time sensitive nature of the enjoyment of of the authors works. I'm sure there's a better word than time-sensitive but I forgot

  I am annoyed at the author for telling us what not to call them but not giving us a name to call them
  ```

  - u/kurtofconspiracy:
    ```
    I as well laughed longer than mere humour would warrant. Surprising, yet inevitable!
    ```

- u/Flashbunny:
  ```
  I have been "fuckin rekt", to use the parlance of the times.

  Not sure if the author's note is also an elaborate fakeout of some kind, but the courtesy costs nothing, so: Well done, gazemaize.
  ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    Any consistent name is fine, we just refer to those previous works as being written by gazemaize now.

  ```

  ```
  >and then he would take the gun and shoot it himself

  I misread this the first time, overlooked the "it", which made the sentence much more surprising but made the upcoming events somewhat nonsensical.
  ```

- u/nytelios:
  ```
  A fickle and playful attitude: maize deception.

  So it was really about thinking inside the box...but did all the winners get it accidentally (or through childlike naivety)? That hurts. Especially hurts for those who thought they were smart or the best. Forcing people to confront uncomfortable truths and then making a joke out of their resolve. Bucket's still a bastard.
  ```

- u/awesomeideas:
  ```
  It feels good to be vindicated in the morning. There's a reason I didn't stop following the story on FF when the "final" chapter came out.

  I'm feeling smugger than a Very Smug Person, which I assure you is quite smug.
  ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  How many lies do you think there are in the author's note?

  Judging by past track record, there's at least one.

  *squints in suspicion*

- u/CreationBlues:
  ```
  Man, once the reveal of wonkavision happened, I knew *exactly* what was about to happen, congratulations.
  ```

- u/callmesalticidae:
  ```
  I...sorta wish it had ended with the last chapter, actually. Completed fics are rare, and I’d rather have a completed fic that ended in that weird way than an incomplete fic that simply fizzled out.
  ```

- u/Rorschach_Roadkill:

  How dare you sir

  Edit: Really happy it's not over. Hilarious story, can't wait for the next part.

  I was fairly certain the author won't reveal the answer to the puzzle. Glad I was proven wrong. This was a satisfying conclusion.

  I also have a pretty pessimistic attitude toward this fic as a whole. I wouldn't mind being kept proven wrong lol.
  ```

- u/throwaway-ssc:
  ```
  I should have given a prediction with a percentage on whether it was a fakeout, for forecasting calibration.
  ```

- u/The_Jeremy:
  ```
  I'm so confused. Chapter 7 made it feel like the whole story was a depressingly long setup for a truly ridiculous, over-the-top pun that never materialized.

  There are a lot of references in this story to Dahl's works. I'm either too unfamiliar with them to get the level of humor involved, or these are just homages thrown in for the sake of it.

  I'm not trying to rain on parades. I would love for someone cleverer to tell me what I missed on my read-through that made this an amazing and wonderful tale. I'm 100% certain that I missed a huge number of references or in-jokes, but I would have expected the story to stand up without those pillars.

  Can someone shine a light for me?
  ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    It's just fun prose. There's a pretty obvious shared Dahl universe going on but that's not really the point.
    ```
