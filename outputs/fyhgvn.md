## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Does anyone know whatever happened to E. William Brown? Perilous Waif is still one of my favorite books, but the author seems to have vanished. The sequel was to release in fall 2019 IIRC.

    His blog has been silent for a year, but it looks like [his Patreon-equivalent](https://www.subscribestar.com/william-s-corner) is still posting monthly content. (I'm not a subscriber myself.)

    I second the recommendation of Perilous Waif.
    ```

      I guess he's alive then. I wonder what he is posting, if he is just releasing the sequel chapter by chapter I might actually pay him. Shame it doesn't say what you're paying for.

      Anyone here who is subscribed?

        Not subscribed but I looked this up a couple months ago and [someone who had subscribed said he was still working](https://www.reddit.com/r/DanielBlack/comments/ddh7a9/is_e_william_brown_still_alive/). No chapter updates on his patreon-thing, just like bonus/side-story stuff but Perilous Waif sequel should be coming soon.

    I am subscribed to his Subscribe Star account. He is still putting out chapters for Merciful Troubleshooter. It should be coming out sometime but he hasn’t set a date. He has 13 chapters done on his subscription service.

  I really would like for Monday and Friday automatic threads to be switched. Monday is when I need to work and Friday is when I really could use a plethora of new exciting stories. Does anyone have good arguments in support of the current system?
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    I don't particularly care either way, but: if you check out the Monday thread on Friday there will be more posts in it.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      Extending that argument there would be even more posts the next Monday.   
      The thread Monday means that it's new and exciting Monday, and with reliably new stories either Monday or Tuesday I find myself easily spending time reading when I should be working.
      ```

  - u/ExiledQuixoticMage:
    ```
    I'd vote for the Monday/Friday threads to be switched as well.  I think the open thread makes more sense to have on Monday so additional discussion topics can trickle in over the week, while having the weekend to go over recommendations makes sense to me.  

    It's just a mild preference though.
    ```

- u/xamueljones:

  I've been thinking about how things can be improved for r/rational, and I have an idea that I'm not sure is a good idea or not.

  I know that it's possible to write an autobot that can automatically post an update link to reddit for when a story is updated. But we don't do that. Instead we leave it up to the people who frequent this subreddit to manually do it themselves.

  Would people prefer to leave it up to the whims of chance that certain stories get update notifications here, or to switch to automatic notifications and lose out on the karma points?

  Note that I have no plans yet to actually code up an autobot for this unless a lot of people here mention a desire for it. In which case, I'll post a top-level post for further discussion first.

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    There is nothing that makes a subreddit feel deader than when half the submissions in it are posted by bots. I agree with GaBe,  organic is best here.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    I'm against it. The current system has authors self promote as they start a story, but lets the community as a whole decide whether a story keeps being posted in an organic way.
    ```

- u/Air_Ship_Time:
  ```
  Why does this sub use only one sticky thread? Shouldn't the recommendations thread stay stickied all week with the other threads use the second slot?
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    We semi-regularly have other things in the slot, such as writing contests or whatever. Admittedly we haven't had anything recently.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    People don't upvote stickies, so they don't show up on peoples' front pages.

  I spent the last eighteen months living on a farm with extended family, intentionally restricting my media and news intake. I had internet access but only went online twice to make sure no one had stolen my identity. I picked a terrible time to rejoin society, but it was a good experience.

  What has /r/rational been up to? I only lurked but it feels slower than I remember. Are there any good new stories/fanfiction/books this community made/recommends that you can sell me on? Humor, romance, and fantasy preferred. I want to laugh.

  Any big happenings specific to this community?

  How cautiously should I take the COVID situation? Is it overblown?Moving back to the farm is an easy option for me if I do it soon.

    It's pretty bad. Go back to the farm.

    Mother Of Learning is complete. Chilli And The Chocolate Factory is the newest hotness.

    > How cautiously should I take the COVID situation? Is it overblown?Moving back to the farm is an easy option for me if I do it soon.

    It's very serious. If you and everyone you live with are able to work from home and willing to take the quarantine seriously, then isolating in the city is safe enough. Whether that's preferable to going back to the farm is up to you.

    I also expect the situation to last a very long time in the US, and any other country relying on social distancing to manage the pandemic. Until the government is able to implement case-tracking (very skeptical the US can do this) or a vaccine is developed (could be a year), the disease will pop back as soon as social distancing is relaxed.

    >How cautiously should I take the COVID situation? Is it overblown?

    There are different ways of looking at 'overblown'.

    Do I believe that shutting down our entire country / creating a new Great Depression / allowing a massive expansion of government power is worth the difference in the amount of lives saved between a full country lockdown vs a series of more targeted quarantines?  No.  I think there are several more efficient ways of handling this that won't have as many long-term ramifications.  I further think that these aren't particularly hard to see but are driven by systemic bias on the part of decision makers and media (eg, everyone making decisions lives in big cities, and the risk to rural areas is minimal and doesn't merit lockdown).

    But for **you** is there any value to leaving your isolated farm to rejoin society?  No also.  There's no society for you to rejoin.  Everything's closed by law.

  Not trying to be pessimistic or anything but this economic/labor question has been bothering me for a while:

  Doesn't the prevalence of essential employees working for the same pay during a pandemic mean they were "over paid" before? If we are willing to keep working jobs at higher risk, due to the pandemic, for no increase in personal benefit doesn't that indicate we are willing to take worse cost/benefit jobs in general? 

  I'm not advocating that anyone quit, especially if your work saves lives, but from an economic view raising the job risk significantly without increasing compensation would be expected to encourage people to quit their jobs. Or is it just that the loss of other jobs raised the value of any current jobs enough to compensate? In the USA this could be explained by people needing job's medical insurance, but I'm not hearing about this in other countries either.
  ```

  - u/DeepTundra:
    ```
    Yeah, the limited available jobs increases the availability of individual workers and those workers’ desperation for some kind of employment, so quitting is just as impotent of a threat as always. 

    Also, iirc, not many groups of employees in the US have collective strike or bargaining organizations, so there’s no way for workers to negotiate greater pay in response to the exposure risk.
    ```

  - u/MereInterest:
    ```
    I would argue no, using analogy with gasoline consumption.  As gas prices go up, consumption of gas does not significant decrease.  As much as people grumble, they still need to get to/from work.  Over the short term, demand for gas is very inelastic.  Over the long term, though, people adjust their decisions to recover gas usage.  This may be by buying a more fuel-efficient vehicle, by moving closer to work for a shorter commute, or by pushing for expanded public transportation.  Over the long term, demand for gas goes down, even though it didn't in the short term.

    Applying this same logic to essential jobs, in the short term, it is very difficult to quit when living paycheck to paycheck.  Rent still needs to be paid, and food needs to be purchased.  In the short term, supply of essential workers does not dry up with drastically changed working conditions.  Over the long term, though, people will preferentially avoid taking essential jobs, driving up the wages required to compensate.

    Also, this is all with the caveat that economic predictions are based on the assumption that people are inherently rational, and that the market is always at equilibrium.  Neither of these are particularly good assumptions at modeling groups of humans.
    ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    Price in a market is a function of supply and demand.

    People don't want to go into work because of the virus, so supply has gone down.  You would expect a wage increase from this.

    However, jobs don't want as many workers, so demand has gone down.  You would expect a wage decrease from this.

    Demand has gone down a *lot* more than supply has, so we're lucky we've seen wages stay the same.
    ```
