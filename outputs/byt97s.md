  God and it makes so much sense we've seen Cat beat down the fae that couldn't curb their excesses before, and Larat was right freaking there to witness it, of course he yields when the story is completely against him!
  ```

- u/notagiantdolphin:
  ```
  Oh, great, so Larat's made a bundle of divine power and left it up for grabs to anyone who lays their grubby paws on it. King of tricks indeed.

  For the Fairest.

  How did nobody see this coming?  I've been watching both threads and the comments section and I don't think *anyone* saw this coming!

  edit: Holy shit this might have been the Tyrant's plan all along!  He gets the crown, then crashes it into the Serenity, then starts pissing off the Gods themselves as there is no one left on the continent that can match his Traitorousness.
  ```

    Because we've been thought that the complete absence of a [Chekhov's gun](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun) means there is no way something can happen. There was no way Larat giving up the crown would work because the story we were told looked good enough and we hadn't been given *any* hint what might have happen if it didn't. Writers don't just subvert their own stories without set up but apparently *this one does* because subverting stories doesn't need set up in this one.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      There's a huge amount of Chekhov's guns before this!  We've had tons of buildup about *giving up crowns* for the last 20 chapters!  We've had Cat's unexpected surrender to the Pilgrim to win!  We were giving up crowns to give someone a crown, why couldn't they give it up too, just like Cat did?  We didn't see it coming but the foreshadowing was there.

      edit: Cat also gave up her crown of Moonless Night to Sve Noc.  Has this been a theme for a whole book and we haven't noticed?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Those were all also on theme for Cat’s plan. Everything pointed at this going exactly as she intended with nothing saying otherwise, which is why we didn’t look for it.
        ```

        - u/lolbifrons:
          ```
          Except EE has pretty routinely hammered it home that when things seem to go as planned, a wrench _will_ be thrown.
          ```

      - u/Gr_Cheese:
        ```
        > Cat also gave up her crown of Moonless Night to Sve Noc. 

        This seems to be what Larat is mimicing.

        But will Cat reward Larat as Sve Noc rewarded her?
        ```

- u/MimicSquid:
  ```
  Larat, you magnificent bastard.
  ```

- u/windg0d:
  ```
  The twilight king is an awesome title, but who's gonna take it?
  ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    Totes Abigail.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      Take?  No.  Be promoted to against her will, kicking and screaming all the way?  Sure.
      ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    We know who we can rule out. Tariq and Catherine both gave up their rirght to rule, to empower this very crown and the Sisters respectively. Masego is out of it, and Sve Noc or any drow claiming it would just bring us back to the problem of a Court sworn to Below.

    So might Amadeus, but between losing the Name of the Black Knight and generally unorthodox methology he might haggle a deal (with anyone but the Saint of Swords). Laurence already has a domain, so she may be able to extend her **Decree** over it, and worst comes to worst, Cat will just go with the old plan of killing the newborn goddess. Ronald is probably not interested, and Kairos may care too much about being the successor to Theodosius the Unconquered to give up the Name he inherited, but who knows? Hierarch will likely explode if the crown gets put on his head, but that's far from the only thing he can do with it.

    The drow may have also brought someone from the battlefield below, but no candidate there is exactly fit to be a god. I'll laugh very hard if they take the crown and use all the spares lying around (Spellblade, Thief of Stars, the Stolen Crown, Tyrant, Hanno's coin, Keter) to make an even bigger god.
    ```

    - u/bitzer:
      ```
      Catherine didn't give up her right to rule (as evidenced by the fact that she's currently still Queen of Callow; she was even one of the possible "final" crowns that could be used with the seven), so it's still on the table for her.  But I'd be surprised if it went that direction.  She seemed much too pleased to have rid herself of the last court/mantle to really want to pick up another.
      ```

    - u/NZPIEFACE:
      ```
      Why not Cat? Twilight is the antithesis of Night, as we've been told before. So if she takes this...
      ```

      - u/ArcTruth:
        ```
        Saint will gank her so hard.
        ```

        - u/NZPIEFACE:
          ```
          lmao, but who else gets it
          ```

      - u/Banarok:
        ```
        well cat don't want it, she likes her mortality, same with archer really and Masego is knocked out.

        &#x200B;

        our primary contenders are, the tyrant, the saint or a drow, we can't rule out another fay either but "shrug" don't see any of them making a beeline for the crown if their king gave it up because if you wield it you get murdered, and the king is the essence of his court, hence everyone of them should be somewhat simular in that regard.
        ```

- u/Orpheon73:
  ```
  >“The last story is mine,” I said. “It is made of crowns and debts, the desperate trick of a fox chewing through its own foot for fear of the night.”

  Looking back, I actually can't interpret this applying to anything else than Larat, who having brought up the story of the fox is probably meant as the fox himself. He just gave up right to rule to escape the trap that would have pitted him against the Night, literally.

  I'm hesitant to vote on "Catherine planned this" solely because the chapter isn't an Interlude, really. I don't understand her reference otherwise.
  ```

- u/NZPIEFACE:
  ```
  >Sovereign Under the Night

  Not even Moonless even more.
  ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  And then the Empire Ever Dark implodes.

  Edit: We know the Bard can interact with Fae, she did it back in Book 2 to keep Black from getting to Marchford until the battle was already over. Could she have influenced Larat to do this?

  Edit 2: Hold up. Pilgrim gave up the star. Not just his right to rule: his claim to the Blood. Is he in danger of losing his Name too?
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    The worthy take, the worthy rise. Larat knew what he was doing when he abdicated in the middle of the drow army that followed Losara Queen's bid to power.

    And Bard probably did more than that. I doubt the King of Winter decided to deep-six his Court just in time for Diabolist's plans being looked into by Thief and Squire. The invasion escalated their threat level from "didn't they siege that city a year ago" to "oh Gods why are there so many zombies". The Summer's advance helped to level up the Diabolist and Squire while giving Akua enough time and fodder to make her plans actually work instead of Thief sneaking a crate of goblinfire into the room where the captured Deoraithe were held.

  So, I know this is not currently a popular opinion, but I believe the Rogue Sorcerer will ( in the end) accept the crown.  


  Think about it: he has sympathy from both villains and heroes, and the last chapter explicitly states that "people who don't want to rule are especially well suited to ruling".  
  He obviously doesn't want it, but he has no other obligations or stakes in the story ( in the sense that the Audience doesn't know/care about his own character arc that he's doubtlessly going through).  
  All the other people in the band of five are very unsuited to taking it. Cat will in no case accept it, she just regained her mortality. Swords is not about ruling at all, and is important to defeat the Dead King. Pilgrim just gave up his right to rule (although the crown, being made from it, might restore it), and more importantly has too central a role in supporting the fight against the Dead King and uniting the Alliance (and it just would sound off tune, if you know what i mean).   
  Archer... I don't know how to explain it other that it's just not her role.  
  Tyrant might make a play for it, but no one will allow him to take it.  


  Masego regaining his power this way would feel cheap, and binding himself through very strict creation rules just goes against what he's about.  


  The Rogue Sorcerer is also thematically compatible with the Twilight Court, i think.
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    There's two layers of narrative here: first is the in-universe narrative which Cat and co. can read, and the second is the meta-narrative that EE is setting up.

    Even if Rogue Sorcerer would be a halfway decent match narratively, the meta-narrative is really lacking. We don't know him or anything about him and thus we don't care at all what sort of arc he goes through at this point. Introducing him so late to the scene just to take the fall for the highway wouldn't feel very satisfactory.

    For that to work out, there would have to be an unforeseen twist like having him be Malicia with a hat on or something.
    ```

  - u/CarsonCity314:
    ```
    I think you need to go another layer or two.  The Rogue Sorcerer is likely the best conscious choice.  Then the Tyrant will do the betrayal thing again.  At that point, the third candidate either (a) needs to pay a price the Tyrant didn't expect they'd pay or (b) be a player the Tyrant didn't account for.

    At that stage, (of characters currently present) I'd guess any of (a) Akua, (b) Crows, (c) Archer, (d) Saint.
    ```

- u/thatsciencegeek:
  ```
  I have a feeling Larat's actions here are orchestrated by the Intercessor, and everyone except for Neshemah is dancing to her tune :(

  Here's my take on Twilight King 2019:

  Peregrine: Would restore his right to rule (not that he's using it).  Probably one of the better developments.  Would get the Pilgrim out of Cat's hair without killing him.

  Saint: Taking the crown would make her less of a sword.  Not going to happen.

  Masego: Too easy a solution to the "no more magic" issue.  Creates too many narrative vulnerabilities for Cat's liking.

  Cat: I think sure could get it without getting ganked by the Saint, Pilgrim, or Tyrant, but it's not how her story works.  She pays the costs of her power up front.

  Tyrant: No clue.  He'll probably make a play for it, but he's got a very solid streak going of *nearly* getting what he wants.

  Dark horse candidate 1: Roland.  About all we know is that he steals power and makes it his own.  Might be the best option for Cat for having someone reasonable get the power while remaining recognizably human.  I bet on him being the first proposed candidate before Tyrant's inevitable betrayal.

  Dark Horse candidate 2: The Crows.  Maybe they've developed a taste for fae power.

  Dark Horse candidate 3: Akua Sahelian, after Tyrant's betrayal has been drawn.
