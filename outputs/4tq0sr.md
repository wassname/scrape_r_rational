  The protagonist only starts shining after the 10 chapter mark, as the story was originally written by a separate person before they dropped it and the artist took over, which made it a much more interesting work.

    That does explain the drastic personality change.  Chapters 1-9 had him acting as your typical all-loving shonen protagonist, showing concern for his sister, refusing to kill because that would be letting his friend down, etc.  Then ch. 10 comes along and retcons all of that, [culminating in Ch.11:](#s ""I have just been faking caring about humans".")

  As someone who's only seen part of the anime, I have to ask, in addition to the obvious which is better, are the old guy's motivations ever actually explained? Similarly, is the initial public opinion on ajin addressed? I'd understand vaugely derogatory sentiments,  but outright calling them subhuman p-zombies has to be engineered.

    ```
    Hat man is, and has been, a psychopath all his life, and finds killing people fun. Now he just has the power to make sure his fun isn't cut off too quickly.

    As for the prejudice, after the artist takes over the story it drops off heavily, until Hat man gives the public a reason to fear Ajin through terrorism. However, some regular citizens still understand that you can't generalize a group through one radical.
