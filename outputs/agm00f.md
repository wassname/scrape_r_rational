## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  You and your people barely escape your world's destruction by fleeing through a portal to another dimension. You get there and everything is enormous, positively gigantic. The trees are the size of mountains, and even the smallest animals and insects are around your size. 

  You realize that it's not the things that are bigger, you're all smaller. Around 1/20th the size (~10cm/4 inches). 

  Some mechanism you don't understand is maintaining your bodies so they function identically to before, so your cells and molecules don't collapse or implode or turn into antimatter or whatever. Even weirder, it also allows you to eat and digest the native fauna and flora as normal.

  Now what? 

  ----------------------------------------

  Some thoughts:

  * The square cube law and so on would mean that their physical capabilities would amazing for their size. Like how an ant can lift many times its weight, or a flea can jump hundreds of times its length. Falling from great heights would also be less fatal, as would being swatted around. 

  * Because their strength to weight ration is so high, and because the air pressure is also high relatively, a person with some big artificial wings could potentially generate enough lift to fly! For the same reasons, building aircraft would be a pretty straightforward process. 

  * Assuming their caloric requirements are also similarly scaled down, very little time and energy would be needed for sustenance. A single stalk of corn would feed hundreds, a few acres of various crops would be enough for a city of tens of thousands. (It would be a very different kind of story if their caloric requirements stayed the same. A little 10 centimetre human needing to eat 2k cal a day would be terrifying.) 

  * This also applies to other, previously scarce resources. Energy would be way easier to come by, though the engineering challenges would still be considerable. Things like windmills, watermills, steam engines, even fossil fuels. 

  * They could devote that extra time to building beautiful stuff. Huge buildings (relative to their size) could be built relatively easily. Their cities could have massive domes and towers and minarets and so on. A skyscraper that is 1km high(relatively) would not be a huge challenge, structurally.

  * On the other hand, protecting their cities and crops from animals would probably be their primary challenge. Humans would be at the bottom of the food chain. Even insects and small scavengers would be enormous threats, not to mention the bigger stuff. A small tunnelling pest could undermine their entire city single-handedly. Imagine how hard it would be to fight off birds the size of houses, carnivores the size of stadiums, or even just a swarm of mosquitoes. 

  * Can you imagine trying to produce enough gunpowder and ammunition to protect from so many casual threats? 

  ---------------------------
  Anyone have any further thoughts?

    The biggest issue with a serious shrinking story is that every part of an organism is highly calibrated to the scale they live in. Shrink eyes, and even if they can detect the photons and focal length is fixed, everything will still be far dimmer. Every source of heat in the body would be far too active to avoid cooking, and as you already covered, every other life form of that scale would be far more mobile and deadly.

    Hand made rifles would be even worse than normal scale ones, due to massively higher air resistance and the expansion factor of gunpowder.

    That being said, simply applying intelligence to a small creature or group has a lot of potential for jumping off into original world building. Intelligent spiders could learn to build farms for their food, rodents could set up micro forges to make tiny batches of worked metal, butts could map out immense areas to select a new meeting site, and so on.

      It's true, if you think deeply on it the whole thing falls apart. It wouldn't work as a science fiction story without heavily stretching suspension of disbelief. But what about a fantasy story? What do  you think of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/agm00f/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/ee95g8f/) elaboration of the idea?

      In my brainstorm I had an idea to make the situation even more precarious. The idea that the mechanism that allows people to function at 10cm tall is mana. Everyone who crossed the portal now produces a certain quantity of it at every moment, and if they run out and can't maintain their existence upkeep they will instantly die. 

      The interesting part is that people produce varying amounts, a normal distribution. At the left of the bell curve are the few who produce very little, barely enough to survive. The middle, the vast majority, produce a little bit extra.The last group produce a lot more than needed to survive. Those people can become mages, and use their excess mana to produce other reality-altering effects, like telekinesis, pyrokinesis, and so on. 

      Mana has another interesting property: it causes all animals in this new dimension to be unreasonably aggressive if they come within a certain range of it. There will be no domesticating the fauna in this world, or even co-existing. Humans will always be at war with anything that moves. 

      Thoughts?

        1) Is the aggression reasonably reasonably scaled to the mana? (Mages have agro.) 2) The people who produce very little mana - how do they get along with animals? 3) Can these effects be altered using magic? (Aggression aside, if animals can detect people via their mana, then spells to minimize this may be essential for stealth (and getting anywhere, or hunting).) 4) Can the mana of 'most people' be harvested? 5) Is it possible to use mana to get to a normal size? Do the animals have mana?

          >1) Is the aggression reasonably reasonably scaled to the mana? (Mages have agro.) 

          I think that would be the more interesting option. It would give people on the lower side of mana production an interesting role as scouts and rangers and so on, and it would balance out the advantage of being a demigod mage with the disadvantage of being beset at all times by kamikaze critters. 

          What do you think?

          >2) The people who produce very little mana - how do they get along with animals? 

          Any mana provokes aggro. The quantity only changes the range it can be detected at.

          >3) Can these effects be altered using magic? (Aggression aside, if animals can detect people via their mana, then spells to minimize this may be essential for stealth (and getting anywhere, or hunting).)

          I would say yes, but not extensively. Enough for a quick expedition, but nothing more. Eventually constructs can be made to stealth a city, but it would not scale down. 

          >4) Can the mana of 'most people' be harvested? 

          Somewhat. Mana is an anomaly, and apparently exists only inside living beings who crossed between dimensions. Nothing else has mana, and nothing can really contain mana. Constructs that use mana in predetermined ways can be made, though. I see constructs like subways or trams being powered by the passengers themselves. Instead of consumer appliances and electronics powered by electricity, a lot of those would be made to run on mana. (undecided about how electricity would factor into the world)

          >5) Is it possible to use mana to get to a normal size? Do the animals have mana?

          The initial iteration of this idea was to make it xianxia inspired, with cultivators becoming increasingly larger as they progress, with no upwards limit. That's been mostly scrapped. 

          Any living being who cross the portal have an innate mana production.

    As a note, due to [Kieber's Law,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber%27s_law) calories scale to the 3/4 power, rather than according to the usual square/cube law, for a multitude of reasons. Which means that your average citizen will need about 200-250 calories per day, if I did my math right.

    Edit: Whoops, I think I really bopped the math. Showing my work now, I think that the real difference would be ( 20^3 )^(3/4), which is about 845. Dividing the average caloric consumption of a human by that gets you about 3.

      3 calories total? That's fascinating, thanks.

        Looking at mice and rats, which should be comparable, mice need about 3.6 kc per gram. Rats have a requirement of 60 kc per day, and doing the math with the numbers for mice means you ~10 g human would need 30-40 kc per day. So i'd recommend running your own numbers, just to be sure.

          After some thought, I'm inclined to go lower rather than higher. If you think about it, 1 grape is 2 calories, so is 1 gram of chicken. A grape is about the size of a 10cm human's head, certainly bigger than their stomach. If they're required to eat the equivalent of 20 grapes a day, which is a huge amount of food in terms of volume, that would be pretty weird. They would be spending all their time eating and shitting.
