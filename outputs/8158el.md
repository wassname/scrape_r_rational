  Did the planning in this chapter strike anyone as particularly irrational?

  * the ranger tells them they’re not ready, and they immediately discount him without any thought

  * they don’t seem to have any discussion about Absol’s abilities and take the first conclusion (superstition) without exploring any alternatives or asking other trainers

  * they seem to have an overwhelming type and strength advantage versus the diglett team but it still seems like a fight that was on the edge between going ok and going poorly

  * the only decent planning they have is baiting the Absol with the meat, but they immediately rush in and abandon that plan without even waiting for it to work, leaving them to battle the Absol straight up

  *  no disaster/failure planning at all?

  Did these discussions just happen off screen with no hints at them? It seems to go against what the team was just learning about at the gyms. Maybe that info will show up in the next chapter or after the battle.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    These are some excellent points, and without spoiling anything I can only say that 2/5 of them actually have hints in the chapter about things that will address them!

    Well, 2/3 I should say, after answering these:

    >they seem to have an overwhelming type and strength advantage versus the diglett team but it still seems like a fight that was on the edge between going ok and going poorly

    Yeah, as /u/ketura says, type advantage only goes so far in this world, where other factors like how outnumbered you are and the terrain and "invisible levels" can also sway the battles.

    >the only decent planning they have is baiting the Absol with the meat, but they immediately rush in and abandon that plan without even waiting for it to work, leaving them to battle the Absol straight up

    I may not have made this clear, but they thought when the absol stopped responding that it had eaten the meat and fallen asleep, when in truth it basically stopped eating it as soon as it tasted something off :)
    ```

    - u/sharikak54:
      ```
      But they only waited about a minute after the absol stopped responding...  It feels like way too short for it to have calmed down after hearing a mating call.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        It took them a while to reach the chamber it was in too, but yeah, I could make them wait a bit longer.

      It seems like they set up the speaker without considering how it would affect the pokemon endemic to the tunnels they're in, and now they're going to be swarmed in an area where it is really difficult to evacuate.  They definitely needed more preparation.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        They did actually consider that, though it's not mentioned explicitly in the text. I figured it was too obvious a thing not to consider? But apparently that's not the case.
        ```

        - u/Ibbot:
          ```
          I might have thought so, but then it seems at the end that the digletts' reaction takes them entirely by surprise, and they don't seem to have prepared for this eventuality.  It seems like something they shouldn't be so caught off guard by if they did their research.  Although I also think I was primed for that interpretation.  The conversation with the rangers makes them seem like a group of underprepared glory seekers.  They seem more concerned with being the ones to catch the Absol than with being helpful, and the reasons they give why they can do it don't seem nearly as well articulated or substantial as the ranger's reasons why they can't.  As much as Blue says it isn't about pride, it reads as though it is, and I wasn't expecting it to go well.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            >but then it seems at the end that the digletts' reaction takes them entirely by surprise, and they don't seem to have prepared for this eventuality.

            Out of curiosity, what from the text gives you this impression? Is it just a narrative convention you feel was set up from the chapter, or is there something specific? I feel like I may have written something poorly if readers are having this takeaway.
            ```

            - u/Ibbot:
              ```
              I think a mixture of both.  We see that only Elaine has experience with tunnels \(and then not much\), and the ranger thinks only Glen is equipped to deal with the absol.  No one person has both skills, and half the team has neither.  It's sort of a Chesterton's fence thing, where even though the Rangers' advice isn't binding in this instance, I would expect a strong reason not to follow it, and what we see doesn't qualify for me.  I don't think they really address the rangers' concerns about whether or not they qualify to get involved as they would like, and so I expect failure.  We see them get started, and I'm primed to see bad decision making.  Blue even gets clawed in the very first diglett encounter, which doesn't bode well.  We see some ideas for preparation, but it's stuff they didn't prepare to do, like standing on container boxes.  But this is all background stuff that just colors how I look at it.

              Most importantly is how the chapter ends.  With how uncertain Blue seems and how he has to figure out what's going on, it doesn't seem anticipated by the characters, and I don't really anticipate it either.  So when it says the diglett are coming, it seems like an epiphany, a revelation, like no one realized the diglett were going to react this way.  Which is very dramatic at first, but then it's like what?
              ```

              - u/DaystarEld:
                ```
                Got it, thanks! My confusion was mostly centered around the idea that the diglett take them by surprise, since as you said, the chapter ends with Blue recognizing that he hears diglett coming, so there was no moment of actually showing their reaction to the diglett :) I understand from a narrative perspective why it builds up that way, and obviously used that as part of the revelation for the readers.
                ```

                - u/Ibbot:
                  ```
                  Makes sense.  I look forward to seeing their reaction.
                  ```

  - u/empocariam:
    ```
    What I noticed was before they got to Golden Hills, they were actually planning pretty well, considering risk/rewards on taking the shorter route, etc.

    I would bet that there really is something to Absol's bad luck field, since their really cocky arrogant moves started once they got near by, even before the party was right up next to it. Absol does have access to Perish Song at high levels, which could be some sort of probability collapsing effect that manifests as "Bad Luck".
    ```

    - u/The_Magus_199:
      ```
      Don’t Absol canonically just warn of natural disasters, rather than actually causing misfortune?
      ```

  - u/Icare0:
    ```
    I think that is kind of the point. This is the first time Blue has to plan something like this alone since leaving Pallet and he feels first hand the absence of his two buddies. The chapter even shows Blue expecting either Red or Leaf to reply even though they are not there.

    I actually called this adventure going bad last month. I was partially kidding when I said that Blue would descend into a spiral of hatred due to everybody here dying, but it was well foreshadowned that it would not go as smoothly as Blue expected.
    ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    The types thing shouldn't be that big of a surprise. Typing is super important in a situation where essentially all else is equal (prowess, strategy, etc) but strikes me as an edge rather than the meat of a fight, especially when fighting wild groups. 

    Besides that, all fights are a toss up when your opponent only knows to try and gang up and murder you, type advantage or no. In this world, it looks like fighting Earthbending moles in a tunnel of their own make is straight up always going to be difficult, nearly regardless of what you bring to that fight.
    ```

  Hey everyone, welcome back! Nothing exciting to announce, other than that I started reading Worth the Candle in a poorly considered choice of how to spend "some" leisure time this week and ended up spending way more time reading it than I planned to. It's written by my podcast cohost Alexander Wales under recently revealed pseudonym, and like all of his work, it's fantastic. If you haven't given it a shot yet, you can [check it out here](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126)!

  Oh, also, if you're wondering what a diglett's body looks like... it's a mole. It just has a mole's body. No big mystery: [here's some fan art that fits what's in my head.](https://87freeze.deviantart.com/art/050-Diglett-and-051-Dugtrio-213676753)

          Nope! Is that how many classes there are in it?

          (I should probably read their rulebook...)
          ```

          - u/pokepotter4:
            ```
            The current maximum is four classes, but I think they're changing that for 2.0 , which is in beta at the moment.
            ```

- u/Trips-Over-Tail:
  ```
  I never expected [](#s "The diglett are coming") could sound so ominous.
  ```

- u/Icare0:
  ```
  So, my previous prediction that this would go horribly wrong and end up in terrible trauma for everyone involved seems to not have been so far fetched. Fighting a obviously higher level fast sweeper plus a bunch of digletts and maybe some dugtrio while deep inside a maze-like tunnel is bound to be trouble. 

  The lack of Red and Leaf is showing. The group is obviously underprepared for this expedition. Taking a day to practice cave-delving and fighting digletts would be the correct course here. Ya, maybe you lose the absol, but you also probably won't face death risks. Furthermore, what if there was more than one absol? Blasting mating calls could easily attract both, and fighting two absols would spell disaster to Blue's team. 

  I also see no reason to use tangela against absol when it is the only ground resist the whole group has. Elaine has a graveler that probably could tank some hits from absol and is pretty much ununsable against digletts. They also didn't diglett-proof this chamber, did they? Seems like an oversight, to not insulate yourself in the place you expect to be weakest in. It might spook the absol, but that would be better than facing this exact situation.

  The absol may be weakened, but he also weakened most of the big shots in team. Machoke, Kemuri, Tangela and sandslash are bleeding. Maturin has recovered, but took some damage last fight nonetheless. That leaves the Lax as the big trump card against the digglets, but they cannot coordinate correctly behind the huggable giant until the absol is dealt with. I cannot see them surviving this without casualities.
  ```

- u/Ceres_Golden_Cross:
  ```
  Your work is amazing. How you convey the feel of danger. The fearfull creatures that pokémon actually would be in the real world. I felt that in the forest. I felt that with the very first rattata. And I feeling it now. The oppressive caves, the chance of been attack at any moment. The dreadfull silence, looking of tremors to the point you don't know if you are hearing things.
  And the absol's imposing pressence. Like it was just in front of me, with is shining fur and its night dark stare. And the deep sensation of danger, thanks to its pressure ability.

  Thank you. Thank you for giving me this experience.

  Another great chapter, as always!

  Alright people, place your bets now on what will happen. Who will die and what Pokémon will fall in this conflict? I can't see Blue dying, or Akko at this point either, but the other two seem pretty expendable as far as moving the plot forward goes. They seem less like major characters than Blue or Akko, so if anyone is going, my money is on them. Then again, Mr. DaystarEld could pull a fast one on us and have Akko die when we thought she'd be a main character. Regardless, I'm confident that Blue won't die. 

  I'm betting at least 3-4 Pokémon will bite the bullet from the Mole attack.
  ```

  - u/Icare0:
    ```
    Depends on how dark the author want the story to be moving foward, and what are her plans regarding Red's relatioship woth Blue. If they intend to actually have Red taking the Champion mantle from Blue, I can easily see everyone here dying, blue aside.

    I think at the very least Maturin and Blue are going to survive. If this story is going into Red x Blue, there has to be a reason for red to want to take hum down, and this is prime time for Blue to start changing. If that's the case, at least one of the red shirts bites the dust here. If the story isn't going there, I cannot see any humans dying unless renegades get involved.

    That could just be the large amount of nuzlocke run I've read tho, specially stuff like Apocalypse Johto.
    ```

  - u/The_Magus_199:
    ```
    I don’t think any humans are going to die here; that feels like too major of a character beat for this point in the story, I think. When somebody first dies because of Blue, I think that’s going to be during some large-scale disaster like one of the stormbringers.

  Huh, there were a lot of times where someone is "about to say something". Eliane holds her tongue like three times, the girl trainer with Bretta cuts herself off when her teammates leave. It's not like they're getting interrupted either, Blue notices these hesitations and tries to prompt Eliane to speak up. I wanna say that's Absol luck manipulation cutting off useful information and cautions (bad luck for people who wish it ill?), but that seems a little powerful for a pokemon novice-ish trainers could expect to catch. Or maybe this particular Absol is abnormally powerful, who knows.
  ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    I think it may be foreshadowing for how Blue is failing to work with the group dynamics. With Leaf and Red they act as a team mutually making decisions, but with this group he's fallen into  pattern of being leader and giving out instructions, and the social norms and respect mean people aren't disagreeing with him. They probably had useful things to contribute to the planning process which would have reduced the messiness

  Why don't they put empty boxes inside their container boxes? Low mass, so should be easily encoded for storage.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    This is a good point, if they thought to explicitly buy empty containers for this purpose :) Just putting boxes in their existing boxes would still require unpacking mid-combat, which is less useful: container boxes tend to be big and unweildy, which is why they carry as many items that they'll need for combat outside them as they can.

    Still, a good idea for those times they're preparing an area ahead of time!

- u/PDNeznor:
  ```
  I'm curious, what Blue was hesitating to push on his pokedex during the diglett battle, some sort of distress beacon? How would that work underground? Same with the trackers on their vest, does the world's poketech have special equipment for underground wireless signalling? If so, then I'd imagine the caves to be littered with such devices, not just for distress calls, but also for things like: communication in mapping the tunnels, tracking large groups of pokemon, organizing groups of tourists. You know, important things.

    >I'm curious, what Blue was hesitating to push on his pokedex during the diglett battle

    Good question :D
    ```

  - u/Electric999999:
    ```
    One guess based on what we've seen before is that it might be a recording of some other pokemon, a predator the diglett might fear perhaps, the effectiveness of this here is debatable and Blue would know that, but the fact that we've seen them try it before means it's at least worth considering.  It could of course be some sort of distress beacon, the ability to transmit a signal even deep underground isn't too far fetched compared to some of the other technology we've seen, indeed in the various games you could use the various map/phone/watch things just fine in caves.   
    There's also the chance it does something completely new, but any feature that could help here feels like something that would have probably been used or mentioned before.

  - u/DaystarEld:

    You can absolutely say that :) It's always interesting getting different perspectives, since a fair amount of comments say the opposite and find the Blue/actiony chapters the most engaging. 

    It's good to know there's a wide variety of tastes being satisfied, as long as the "winking out" isn't too extreme. Was there any part of the chapter you enjoyed, or in general are you just not a fan of Blue's storyline/character?
    ```

    - u/ManyCookies:
      ```
      I'll register the opposite opinion, in that I *love* what you did with pokemon combat (especially gym battles, I can't wait to see what Surge has in store) and occasionally find myself skimming the Red/Leaf sections (though I usually enjoy them). To each his own, I suppose!

  I love the story so far. Really look forward to it each month. I do have one complaint though.

   I can't get passed one of the kids already having a snorlax. It just feels like snorlax should be one of the hardest to train/catch Pokémon in the world. Like if someone pulls out a snorlax everyone goes "oh shit" because they're so strong. And the wild ones should be extreme threats if they decide to go on the move. I mean I pretty much picture a two story tall bear. I mean as far as game data goes Snorlax is stronger than any starters and has the same overall stats as Gyarados. That's pretty strong. Just my two cents.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I hear you. Snorlax is indeed a big deal, and Blue did note how unusual it is for someone with just 3 badges to have one when he first finds out Glen does :) That said, it is on the younger side, so it's not at the height of its power. Also, Glen is the oldest among the group, at 16.

    Glad you're enjoying the story despite that though!
    ```

  - u/empocariam:
    ```
    I think in a world where even the NPCs have access to a (pay-to-win) GTS, it makes sense that a lot of rare, powerful Pokemon are more available than they would be to a game protagonist. Especially with dedicated breeding programs assisted by behavior-modifying technology found in Pokéballs.

    I mean, it's completely possible to go online IRL and play through XY, oRaS, and uSuM with just about any Pokemon you want from the start thanks to online trading features.
    ```

  - u/ManyCookies:
    ```
    Snorlax aren't *that* big in game, they're only 7 feet tall with a lot of girth. Though if Daystar wants to buff the species I'm totally down for that.
    ```

    - u/NastyNate0801:
      ```
      Yeah I tend to ignore the listed height and weight for Pokémon cause I find them ridiculous. Like Blastoise is listed at 188 lbs. I'm pretty sure if a five foot tall bipedal turtle thing was an actual creature I wouldn't weigh more than it does.
      ```

  - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
    ```
    Dark types are resistant to Dark type attacks, not immune as they are to Psychic attacks.

    Besides, I don't think it was an empathetic attack, it was its Pressure ability.
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Makes total sense that Pressure would cause "bad luck," especially if it's minor enough that you don't immediately realize what's going on as you might with a legendary. If you feel like something is "wrong," you're both more likely to notice bad things happening and more likely to make mistakes yourself.
      ```

      Off topic, I wonder if there are Fighting-typed humans around that can punch through rocks/steel and are particularly vulnerable against Psychics (and resistant to Dark).
      ```

      - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
        ```
        This story suggests that fighting types manipulate chi-energy (though it has not been scientifically confirmed). I would suppose that if that is the case, there are humans who can use fighting-type techniques, but that it does not make them fighting-typed, and as such would not inherit the weaknesses and resistances.
        ```

        - u/ManyCookies:
          ```
          I thought that was just for Focus Blast and other special-based fighting moves, though that'd explain how they could punch through steel and rock.
          ```

          - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
            ```
            I figured that if there is a baseline degree of, say, "Psychic particles" in everyone, and having more of them (or more control of them) makes you Psychic, then an absence makes you Dark. That means you have no particles to be manipulated by Psychics. An actively Dark entity might draw them in and cancel them out as an offensive technique most effective against Psychics.

            But the chi flow from Fighters is drawn in by the same effect, but not being Psychic particles they can't cancel it out, and so suffer the intended effect. So a Fighting attack delivers more power against Dark types. But Psychic attacks can manipulate the chi flow in others as readily as their Psychic potential, which is why Psychic attacks are effective against Fighting types.
            ```

          - u/Electric999999:
            ```
            The chi-energy stuff seems to be what makes fighting type attacks like double kick and focus punch different to otherwise very similar normal type moves such as mega punch, much like there was the article about the special flying type particles which are presumably what make thinks like peck and aerial ace different to a tackle.
            ```

  - u/Electric999999:

    Absol has pressure, just like many legendaries, and it seems rather powerful, probably part of why the legendary birds are so devastating (combined with them being crazy powerful and messing with weather of course), people don't react properly.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Ah. When I was a trainer, we didn't have all these hidden abilities. We got 4 moves per pokemon, and we *liked* it.
      ```

      - u/akaltyn:
        ```
        True, but there were lots of variations between pokemon  in the fluff that never manifested in gameplay. Over time the simulations obviously just got better

        The rangers have a pretty signifigant incentive to not really admit there might be something to Absol's bad luck effect.

        There jobs is protecting against Pokemon related dangers. If Absol can cause car accidents and stair tumbles, then every time people notice "something must be wrong" because a slightly unlikely but otherwise insignificant number of extra house fires happen in the same week, people will start blaming Absol, draining resources away from fighting "real" threats. So long as it is just superstition, Rangers can ignore it and not become traffic cops and paramedics (even if those incidents are *technically* pokemon-caused)

        That's probably part of the reason why the Rangers are officially unofficially dealing with the problem. Since an Absol actually is there, they know something should be done, but they can't make a whole big deal lest Absol-hunting becomes an undue burden on the Ranger organization.

        They don't all have Pressure, but it seems odd that they would not have raised the possibility.

            This is pretty close, actually: the way I envision it is more like all pokemon can have some mix of all of their abilities, but most have one that's kinda noticeable or a mix of two at a level that are barely noticeable, while a rare few have a LOT of one, an even rarer few have a lot of two, and an even more super rare few have a noticeable amount of three abilities. Some of this is down to genetics, while others develop over time/age/training depending on the ability.
            ```

    - u/akaltyn:
      ```
      Did we ever get an explanation of what pressure actually is? like in physical terms. Or is it just an known but unexplained feature of teh legendaries
      ```

      - u/Electric999999:
        ```
        Unexplained, a lot of what Pokémon can do is still unexplained.

  Another great chapter. These are always something wonderful to look forward to every month! (Would even like to look forward to them bi-weekly if that were possible... :P)

  Though only a small note in the chapter, I hope Blue or Aiko manage to find and capture a Bronzor, if they survive the mole-stampede, as I would be interested to hear more of Red's thoughts on the artificial Pokemon and how they fit into his Origins quest.

  I was wondering how you are treating the move sets of strong wild Pokémon? I know that there aren't really levels, so without the help of a Trainer, how do wild Pokémon learn more esoteric or complicated strategies (for example, an Absol with Future Sight). Maybe just age, or perhaps lesser or unwieldy version of a battle ready move?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Yeah, wild pokemon mostly just learn moves as they "age," age here being somewhat subjective since pokemon growth is accelerated by conflict :) They have some instinctual grasp on the powers they're naturally capable of that develops over time and is accelerated by combat as well.
    ```

- u/ManyCookies:
  ```
  I don't really understand why the digglet are attacking in the first place, is the Absol somehow influencing them or are they aggressively defending their territory?

  I do hope Aiko in particular doesn't die here, mostly because the fallout would set the tone waaay darker than I'd prefer (god imagine the section where Blue tells her father the news).
  ```

  - u/Electric999999:
    ```
    It might be the loud mating calls they played, combine with the fact absol is implied to have been hunting them perhaps they reacted aggressively to it (while not something you often see IRL actively hunting a predator might be fairly effective with how deadly these diglett seem to be).   
    Could also be part of pressure, I think it was mentioned that wild pokemon are more aggressive when the legendary birds are nearby and absol's pressure is the same thing, just weaker.
    ```

    - u/akaltyn:
      ```
      > It might be the loud mating calls they played, 

      I was also thinking that the sounds of the fight might have attracted them. They make a point of being silent when they're travelling to avoid attracting attention. If Absol is an apex predator si makes sense for diglett to avoid their calls, but the general sound of fighting might provoke a territory defence instinct
      ```

- u/noimnotgreedy:
  ```
  1. Does poison/sleep powder / stun spore leave a scent? (Guess: yes)
  2. Any reason a pokemon couldn't have multiple status effects?

  Figured Mean Look rather than Pressure... by the way, which chapter discussed how does the capture mechanism works? IIRC they stored the pokemon as data, but the storage wasn't enough to store people, so people ended up being MissingNo.. but another question is if any ball could benefit from the new storage solution.. granted, market forces might prevent the new storage from improving PokeMart-issue capture technology, even if it's a more efficient one. (Would Silph claim there's a NAND shortage?)
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    1) It does leave a scent, but once you've started smelling it you've probably started being affected at least a little :)

    2) Nope, they can definitely have multiple effects in this, though realistically they start to lose meaning once you layer them on.

    3) It's kind of spread out over multiple chapters rather than described in any one, but the basic idea is that humans can be stored as data, but something about the process damages intelligence in a way that is particularly noticeable in humans, so it was made illegal.
    ```

    - u/ManyCookies:
      ```
      "Alakazam is also very intelligent. Its puzzle solving skills are as complex as a three year old human's." -Giovanni

      I wonder if those intelligence tests were done pre or post capture. Would be damn hard to field test puzzle solving skills against a super psychic, but surely someone would have noticed captured Zam being significantly dumber... right?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        It would indeed be more difficult to test a wild pokemon. Also worth noting that humans measure intelligence in particular ways that don't exactly fit with what animals are capable of.
        ```

- u/Pious_Mage:
  ```
  Helllll yes Daystar! I gotta say I've beene excited for the first of the split chapters forever. I love Aiko as a character and I love the two battlers together. Not only that but I love the fact that they've lost there two most practical and smart minds and are bound to make mostakes like innthis chapter.

  So basically I'm excited for all the character growth that will come from these chapters where they don't have there foils.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Glad you're enjoying it :) Mixing up characters is fun for me too.

- u/vallar57:
  ```
  I'm surprised that nobody (in-universe) mentions the explanation from the anime: it's not Absol that *causes* bad luck, but it is (super)naturally drawn to misfortune.
  ```

  - u/The_Magus_199:
    ```
    Isn’t that the canon explanation in the games, too? I thought absol explicitly *warned* people of disasters, rather than causing them...
    ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      Now that I read 'dex entries from the games, yeah.

      The "warned" part is not applicable to this fic tho, since, you know, animal-level intelligence. But, from Sapphire game, "Absol has the ability to foretell the coming of natural disasters", which can be quite useful from the evolutionary standpoint, and if this species are scavengers and posess enough toughness and agility to withstand earthquakes (a common disaster in the region), being drawn to them rather than scared away also makes sense.

  Hey! How kid friendly is this book? I'm wondering if it would be okay to have a smart 8 year old who loves Pokemon read it.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Hey there! Unfortunately there are some mature themes that the story covers (namely, death of pokemon and humans, some of which is detailed) so I would say it's more conventionally for kids that are at least 12 or so.
    ```

      No problem! Thanks for the reply. :)
