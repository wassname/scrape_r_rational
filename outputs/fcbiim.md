## Rationalize this: Naruto's Hyūga Clan's Gentle Fist and signature technique Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms

### Post:

So this might be a thing only the small cross section of Naruto fans and Rational/Rationalist fiction fans might care about, but I figured I'd ask you all about it.

Whenever I read rational Naruto fanfiction they tend to take the stance that the Hyuga are _blatantly irrational_. That the [Byakugan](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Byakugan) would be infinitely better for a ranged weapon style than the [Gentle Fist](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Gentle_Fist). Nothing exemplifies this more than their ultimate technique being a 64 hit consecutive strike to precise locations on a targets body. While it looks cool, [Eight Trigrams 64 Palms](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Eight_Trigrams_Sixty-Four_Palms) should be more like Eight Trigrams "I stab you in the heart". 

So normally the argument goes they're a clan stuck in their ways and would be more effective if they did other things. I want to see what set of truths we can all come up with that make using the Gentle Fist optimal, with as little potential contradictions to the universe as possible. (Although if you don't know the series then just say whatever and we can discuss it!)

    I don't think this is true in canon - at least, not in the manga. I can't remember a single instance of characters not bothering to block attacks because they can't be hurt by them. There's plenty of that stuff in Bleach, but in Naruto? Top tier ninjas are afraid of getting hit with kunai or shuriken, a single punch can break ribs if it's not blocked properly and an explosive tag took out Nagato's legs. I always really liked that semi-realistic feel to it.

    Sure, there's parts in the anime where someone gets hurled into a rock and it shatters, and there's a part where Pain gets wacked in the head with a mountain repeatedly by the Kyubi, but I think those parts are best uh... interpreted in a less than literal sense. <\_<
    ```

      ```
      That's fair but if you do take it literally, then it still works. The reason they dodge other hits is because it does comparable amounts of damage. And the fact that they can _survive_ getting hit multiple times by attacks of that class or higher, prove that they are incredibly durable, even if they dodge most of them.

      Like boxers can tank multiple hits from their opponent, but they still try and dodge / block each of them.
      ```

        Maybe being hit saps chakra, which would also rationalize inconsistent power levels at different times?
        ```

        - u/KiritosWings:
          ```
          I could absolutely see tanking a hit being more of a drain on your chakra than spending it to dodge or do a reinforced block. It would make a lot of things clearer.
          ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      In anime logic, kunai being sharp means they have piercing damage. Ninja shrug off hits at speeds that would be vaporizing the flesh of mortal men when the damage is blunt.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        Garden was specifically saying that ranged attacks are useless. That doesn't mesh with what you're saying. Of course, you're right about anime logic being the problem: The reason why characters use kicks instead of knives is because if they used a lethal weapon they'd be much less likely to hit - because the fight would be over if they did. Same with a Rasengan being 99% more likely to hit the enemy if it's used as a finishing move. But if the goal is to make the Naruto world make sense, the question is how to move \*away\* from all of that.

        And honestly, I think the only way to do that is to tone things down a bit. The moment you say that some people can move at near the speed of light, you can forget any hope of keeping things consistent. You can still have people \*say\* things like that about legendary ninjas, but if it's actually true, your setting is borked.
        ```

        - u/Veedrac:
          ```
          Yeah, anime logic isn't a great basis for a rational setting, but I still think a rational take on Naruto would get closer to a recognizably-canon setting if they did make ninja tough AF and then make kunai magically sharp through chakra nonsense. Taijutsu still makes sense for keeping your hands free, and Lee's unarmed specialism can be explained by his presence on a nonlethal takedown squad, while also being strong enough to kill with his fists if it came down to that.

          There's a lack of physics understanding on most people, it just so happens that authors can also be a part of that group.. That's why when you get something like Delve people get so impressed, also balancing is a really rare skill among authors.

          Instead of making things mostly balanced between opponents and victories strategic or deception based, most opt for the power creep and move somewhere else when where everyone is stronger for reasons.

            Underrated post.

            Most of the problem is that they get stuck in linear thinking and fall into the 'power creep' mold. 

            It's better when introducing new threats not to just crank the scale up higher, but to pose problems that are at 'right angles' to the scale the protagonist is used to, where being extraordinary in a single category is meaningless.

  Capture of enemy ninja for interrogation or stealing techniques/bloodlines is far more valuable than outright killing enemy ninja, especially for the higher-ranked/more skilled enemies.  But this is rarely an option with all the ninjutsu-based strength, mobility, suicide, etc. techniques available.  (It's been a while since I've read/watched the source material--do we ever see a non-genin captured outside of a temporary genjutsu or a specialized techniques like the Yamanaka's?)

  Gentle Fist attacks shut down any chakra-based techniques that would allow escape.
  ```

- u/Veedrac:
  ```
  I don't think the Hyūga are particularly better suited to ranged combat, because the hard part of dealing ranged damage has almost nothing to do with seeing your opponent, and because ranged attacks in the Narutoverse are generally fairly lame, barring key exceptions the average ninja can't use.

  Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms makes more sense when you take into account that Narutoverse characters are shown to be incredibly tanky (like, immune-to-hypersonic-bullets tanky), and the Hyūga's CQC abilities, while effective, don't have the high damage cap that other movesets can deal.

  Then remember that ninjutsu are arbitrary. If you could design a technique that did whatever, nobody's techniques are anywhere close to optimal. Maybe the consecutive doubling thing is just how it has to work.
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    This one seems right to me. Also, at the risk of reminding people that NTBS exists and that I've been neglecting my duties:

    >Shikamaru  shook his head. “The Hyūga don’t really use weapons. They have their own  Gentle Fist style, which uses the Byakugan to detect their opponent’s  chakra points and closes them off by forcing their own chakra into their  body with their fingertips.”  
    >  
    >“What? That’s stu-” *Not* stupid,  Naruto quickly corrected himself. A technique like that might not be  well-suited to single combat, but it would be invaluable in capturing  enemy ninjas alive, since you never knew what secret techniques they  might otherwise use to escape even without being able to move their arms  and legs. Couple that with their eyes’ information gathering ability  and the Hyūga were the perfect clan to assist the Anbu and the Hokage in  making unwanted people disappear into the night. He glanced towards  Lord Hyūga Hiashi, who was sitting in a seat of honour in the front row,  watching the fight with an impassionate gaze. *No wonder they’re considered a noble clan, with a power like that…* 

    Basically, 64 Palms is only stupid if you assume it's a continuous technique that \*has\* to be executed in that order to deal bonus damage, or something. It makes perfect sense if you assume it's just a sequence to seal off the target's most important chakra points in order to prevent any chance of escape, and which you wouldn't normally use during single combat. In fact, given how valuable the Hyuga are, you shouldn't be committing them to combat *at all* unless you're desperate. It'd be like sending your medic into melee.

    This is also my preferred way of rationalizing strange things in canon. Instead of mocking something for being dumb, re-interpret it so that it makes sense. I also agree that the whole "use ranged attacks" idea is the kind of cleverness that wouldn't work in reality. It's not as if great eyesight makes you a great archer in real life.

  Look at it from the perspective of utility to the village, especially with the context that the Hyuuga and Uchiha were the founding clans of Hidden Leaf.

  The Uchiha are famed for stealing *techniques* from their opponents, which would be an incredible boon to a newly-founded village with only two clan libraries to draw upon.

  Now what the Hyuuga bring to the table is new *clans*. It would not surprise me whatsoever that one of the reasons why Hidden Leaf has a million and a half different clans is because, back before they worked on their squeaky clean image, the Hyuuga contributed to the village by capturing enemy ninja alive, keeping them prisoner via chakra blocking, and breeding a new clan out of them. Basically the same thing Cloud did in the series.

  Of course, capturing ninja for interrogation purposes has a lot of utility too which is why they've kept their focus on chakra blocking to present-day, but if you ask me that's why they started doing it to begin with.

  There is a lot of difference between say playing the knife game and precision shooting. While both may be well centered around precision there's kind a large mechanical difference between putting your fingers to a specific spot and we'll launch projecticle at someone whom your special eyes dont really help you in being able predict where they'll be or how to compensate for the fact that they can and will dodge or parry said attack. 
  Also if anything the 8 trigrams is supposed to be not overkill but overprepared to a certain extent it's supposed to cover all bases in a way that it might not have much use against a superior opponent ala mascara but if your reactions and speed are equivalent or better than your oppponent you can win the 1v1. It's I hesitate to say like a dueling technique because of how dueling doesnt and isnt supposed to be real fighting, but the way they describe it as something only taught to the Head(s) of the household means that it was like a technique made for their Clan heads to win against other Clan heads in say the Warring Clans Era. Also the fact that it continued to not be taught meant that there were fewer opprtunities for the technique to be analyzed for weaknesses by opposing forces.

  I think the main problem with ranged attacks is how fast ninjas in Naruto are. In fact in many cases I'd argue higher level ninja are faster than projectiles. A ranged style is only good for as long as you can keep your opponent at bay and in Naruto ninja are exceptionally good at closing the distance. We see only a few long-range specialists in Naruto, and the premier one also specialises in using close-ranged weaponry (Ten-Ten). A Long-Range specialist would have to rely heavily on stealth and the element of surprise - a tall order in a world so stuffed with not only super-speed, but also massive AoE attacks that destroy cover and a bunch of pretty over-powered sensory abilities that make stealth obsolete as well. It's surprisingly hard to hide in the world of ninjas, because everybody else is also a ninja. And the element of surprise is even harder to utilise properly - even if you get off the perfect snipe there's a pretty good chance your opponent has such fast, ninja reflexes that they can dodge your shot anyway and then your cover is completely blown. 

  Also an easy way to rationalize the 64 palms is this; this is a world where chakra exists, and is the foundation for so many bullshit invulnerability/avoid death techniques that it can be hard to keep track. The 64 palms (when executed as a kill technique) could easily start with the Gentle Fist equivalent of 'I stab you in the heart!', with the rest of the attacks focusing on shutting of the opponent's chakra system so they can't use some kind of bullshit back-up technique to survive the usually lethal opening barrage.

  But here is my main idea. There is perhaps one great Long-Range vs. Close Range battle in Naruto - Kidomaru vs. Neji. In this fight Kidomaru notes that he has to resort to long-range fighting because attempting to go hand-to-hand with a Hyuga is suicide; ninja are entirely dependant on chakra usage, so the moment the Hyuga lands one good hit they can often end the fight. So Kidomaru retreats and starts a long-range fight, only there is one major downside. As I mentioned before, sensory abilities are a direct counter to the stealth and surprise needed to make precision, long-range fighting viable in a world as high-speed as Naruto. And the Hyuga happen to have the most over-powered sensory ability on the planet - the Byakugan. The lengths Kidomaru has to go to just to land a few good hits on Neji are comical, and would be far beyond the abilities of any common ninja - the average combatant in that situation would be forced into close-range (where the Hyuga reign supreme) or would be forced to flee.

  So essentially the Hyuga found themselves in one of the few settings where long-range combat is actually at a disadvantage and high-speed, close-range fighting is the norm, and then went about making themselves almost unbeatable in close-range. They essentially force their opponents into long-range (and therefore into disadvantage) and are almost impossible to surprise or snipe; they can literally see an arrow, bomb, or kunai coming from a mile away. When fighting the Hyuga it is often a dead-if-you-do-dead-if-you-don't situation. If you get into close range you die, but if you stay at range you end up against someone with abilities almost optimised for dealing with projectiles.

  This whole strategy, of course, breaks down once the enemies get strong enough that they have ways to easily deal with the Hyuga ability to suppress chakra, or have projectiles over-powered enough that the defensive prowess of the Hyuga don't matter. And this of course covers most of the A-S rank bad guys in the series. The Hyuga are a finnicky, but very effective build - it hard counters 90% of their enemies, but is completely in-equipped to deal with the remaining 10%. 

  But in those few cases they also have plenty of time to see the danger coming and just run away.

  I brought this up a few other times, but my understanding is that the multi-kilometer range of Hinata was an extreme aberration and possibly an indicator that she had some kind of mutation that exchanged precision at close range in exchange for extreme range.  I believe that this is backed up in canon as Hinata is the only Hyūga who demonstrated a range on her Byakugan that extends beyond close range and the range of Neji (a prodigy) was limited to a few meters.

  This seems like a very simple way to explain why the Hyūga primarily focused on close-combat while also removing the ridiculous intelligence advantage that would come from access to such a ludicrously powerful spying tool.
  ```

- u/Disposable_Face:
  ```
  Hyuuga don't see particularly further than ordinary people though, or with particularly better acuity.

  Hyuuga advantages are

  1) can see through solid objects
  2) expanded field of view (and presumably better ability to process information to compensate for seeing more)
  3) can see chakra

  The relevance of chakra is that it's easier to spot people, so I assume that suitability for ranged combat is what you mean. But, you have to consider fights that aren't 1v1

  Expanded field of view means that a hyuuga sniper is ignoring half of his field of vision (the half behind him), and a hyuuga sniper can't have walls between him and enemies (or he'd have to fire attacks through the walls) so he's ignoring his xray vision, and a hyuuga sniper is vulnerable to return fire. If a hyuuga is assassinating a single target or participating in a sniper duel, that's fine, but the Hyuuga clan developed techniques in a time of clan warfare, as in groups vs groups.

  So a Hyuuga sniper launches a distance jutsu, kills one or two enemies, then gets bombarded with return fire, and the best defense he has, the rotation, is chakra demanding and locks him in place. And that defense is still better than what's available to almost any other clan.

  But, if a Hyuuga gets into a large group melee, the enemy can't just bombard him without large amounts of friendly fire. On top of that, in a cluster of bodies, a Hyuuga can see far more of what's happening than a normal person, and isn't as vulnerable to getting stabbed from behind as a normal ninja. 

  In this chaotic melee, the 64 palms becomes far more valuable. It mission kills basically any ninja other than a jinchuuriki, leaves a prisoner for interrogation or ransom, is quick to use, difficult to defend against, has degrees of success other than perfect victory and no-sell, takes a small amount of chakra/stamina and moreover, enemies further away still have to worry about friendly fire for their fallen comrades. Its ideal for messy, long melees between large groups of opponents.

  You know how in canon, Madara dances through an army? That's how I imagine every high level hyuuga in the Warring Clans Era

  Moreover, despite being just as strong a clan, you'll notice that the Hyuuga never had to deal with the same level of grudges as the Uchiha, which could be for a lot of reasons, but I imagine that ransoming captured ninja rather than executing them probably made them a "less bad" ninja clan to deal with than the more battle happy clans like the Uchiha or Kaguya.

  That said, I always wanted to see a Hyuuga puppeteer burying themselves and fight a battle by proxy with puppets, using the Byakugan to see through 20m of earth as chakra threads control a puppet army without putting the ninja at risk.

    That sounds absolutely dope. And canonically probably would be one of the weirdest combos since puppet manipulation was a Hidden Sand exclusive technique. I'd love it.

  Suppose that vision or aiming techniques that see people's surfaces are common but which see their chakra innards are rare. How much marginally better is a Hyuuga's aim than anyone else half decent, vs. a Hyuuga's chakra sight over anyone else's? Specialization. Real question is just why they developed it prior to living in a village to complement them, right?

  >That the [Byakugan](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Byakugan) would be infinitely better for a ranged weapon style

  Why though? Why should seeing in all directions make you _accurate_? To shoot a ranged weapon you only need to see in one direction.

  Especially when you live with sharingan users, who would in fact be more accurate.

  1 byakugan comes at a reduced depth perception, making it less effective at precision maneuvers like hitting a target at range.

  2 Byakugan requires a lot of focus, reducing your effectiveness at blocking and countering your opponents' moves, when they're not doing something rendered extremely obvious and ineffective by the Byakugan's 355 degree vision. Extra focus is also needed to keep moving your head to cover the blind cone.

  3. To make up for this weakness in no. 2 the Hyuuga have developed a technique which disables a foe's ability to attack them from the outside in. Rather than trying to slip past a foe's  defense as most warriors would call the efficient or effective route,  the Hyuuga attack each exposed point of defense, to stop it from defending the next. They attack the fingers, to force the opponent to use their palms, then the palms and elbows to disable those as points of impact.  They work on the feet and knees, head, shoulders, and work their way in slowly to set up a scenario where the opponent is utterly helpless to prevent the next strike right up until the deadly final one.
  ```

- u/RynnisOne:
  ```
  You want to make it optimal?  Make it fit a true Ninja mold--be sneaky about it.

  The 64-strike thing is an obfuscation of the truth.  There's only 5 or 6 key points that **need** to be hit.  They're not hitting an actual 64 times to do it, probably only about 12 or 16, but a majority of those are feints to hide the true nature of the technique.  Anyone who has seen it believes the target will be getting hit by the full advertised number of attacks, which serves to distract them from the truth as well as demoralize them because they believe an opponent who can pull it off is *actually that fast* and they would be fools to try and block them all. 

  It **feels** like 64 strikes because many of those are instant hits to pain nerves which react a split second later causing agony farther down the line.

  The 'exploding backward' effect it caused both by the energy expenditure of the user and a shockwave of chakra from the target as their closed chakra lines expel the energy they had been containing.  Since it's expelled in the direction of the attack, they function as tiny little rocket boosters propelling the target backward just as the kinetic force from the attacker also pushes them.

  The technique isn't use to kill, but to immobilize, capture, and demoralize.  Watching your ally get hit with it and turned into a helpless ragdoll is enough to make you not want to get hit, either.  It's also good in negotiation purposes because you can take down their most skilled/powerful guy without killing him, which makes it easier to negotiate an end to the hostilities later as they don't have families with new blood oaths to avenge against the technique's practitioners.
