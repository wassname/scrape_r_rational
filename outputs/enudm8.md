  I always love chapters of Worth the Candle like this, because I think that they drive at the heart of one thing that Fantasy as a genre does better than every other genre and medium: the relationship between power and ethics.


  In every other genre, and in the real world, the ethical restraints that are placed on people are always in the context of their personal power, which is, relatively speaking, minimal. Even when you look at someone extremely powerful, politically speaking, the strength that they wield is qualitatively different from what Bethel wields, or any other extremely powerful person in a fantasy story. Being able to order an assassination, or an extra hundred bushels of wheat, is in a moral sense not the same as being able to summon a city-destroying meteor or whatever other ability the overpowered protagonist of the day has access to. A State or Commonwealth has different duties from a person, but what happens when a single person wields equivalent or greater power? How do their duties transform? What about their limitations? And what does that say about people as a whole?


  I guess what I’m trying to say is that the relationship between power and ethics is a major part of the human condition, and it’s a relationship that only fantasy can explore to its fullest degree— even though so few fantasy stories actually exploit that ability. So I’m especially glad to see it in a fantasy story that's actually good.

    But is the ability to summon a city-destroying meteor equivalent to the ability to summon a nuclear bomb strike?
    ```

    - u/carminis_vigil:
      ```
      Potentially similar, but the people in our world who can do the latter can only do so because they have been elevated to a position of power that already exists and has been built by others, and there are chains of accountability that are difficult to escape. It's different from being able to do it through personal power that belongs to you alone.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        There's nothing in the laws of physics that says that those chains of accountability have to be there, though. As far as the laws of physics are concerned, you could give someone a button that, when they enter a latitude and longitude and press it, a nuclear bomb is sent to those coordinates and detonated.

        Those chains of accountability that are there are entirely of human design. They've been put there specifically *because* people worried about the destructive power of nuclear bombs.
        ```

        - u/warrenmcgingersnaps:
          ```
          There kind of is, though. A single person can't practically make a nuclear weapon. It necessitates an organization, which does in fact automatically come with "chains of accountability."
          ```

  Imagine how surreal this situation is for Annad. He's sitting there trapped, with his life on the line, while two self-admitted demi-gods have an ethical argument about the value of his life and why it is or isn't okay to brutally dismember him.  

  I appreciated how sensible Annad was as well. Too often characters in his position are set-up for an exercise in justice porn and only are allowed to realise how out of their depth they are until they’ve already thrown their life away. Annad actually has some sense of self-preservation.

  > “Oh, but *I’m* not allowed to engage in bouts of violence,” said Nephthys with a pout.

  >“Of course you are, when the situation warrants it,” replied Rossa.

  >“No,” replied Nephthys, shaking her head. “Because every time someone comes along with some moronic plan to do harm to me or the people inside me, I’m told that I should exercise *restraint*, that I should just hold them in place for questioning — questioning which, I might add, is never the way that *I* would do it, which must never start or end with dismemberment or physical violence.” She glared at Annad. “Even now, this thug, you would think less of me if I sliced him up.”

  One of the funniest examples of petulance i’ve seen: Bethel feeling hard done by because she doesn’t get to inflict dismemberment on anyone.

  > Valencia was trying her best to be good, and most days she thought that she was doing a damn sight better than most people were, no offense meant. 

  There’s been theories that Val is secretly evil and that she lived an entire fake life in the doomed timeline pretending to be good just to throw everyone off. I think her entire POV this chapter puts that to rest, with the above line being a good summation.

    Technically I'd argue that it doesn't.  We know from Juniper's narration that when the story takes someone else's perspective it's based on what they told him after the fact.  Valencia could still be pretending to be good at that point in the future just as she might have been pretending to be good in the doomed timeline.  She's playing the exceptionally long game.

    That said, I don't really believe she's secretly evil.  I just don't think it's completely ruled out yet.
    ```

      ```
      > We know from Juniper's narration that when the story takes someone else's perspective it's based on what they told him after the fact.

      I don't believe this is true. IIRC we have had two quasi-POV chapters from Amaryllis that are based on what Joon believed happened after the fact and both chapters have triple parentheses comments inserted by Junper, which none of the non-Amaryllis POV's contain. 

      If all non-Joon POV's were after the fact recounts by Joon, for example, that would mean that the first POV of this chapter from Horus was retold by Joon. That's not impossible (Val could for some odd reason provide Joon with a plausible recount of what was going through Horus' mind) but it would be unusual.
      ```

      - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
        ```
        We had a tripple-parentheses aside in the *first* non-Joon POV chapter to let us know that he was writing it after the fact. There's no good reason to keep reiterating that every single time a non-Joon chapter happens. From context, It seems clear to me at least that all non-Joon POV follow this general rule.
        ```

        - u/sparkc:
          ```
          I think were there only the one aside, in the very first non-POV chapter, and never after, then this would hold. As it is, between the first triple parentheses aside and the second, both in the first and second Amarllyis POV's, we get POV's from Val, Pallida, Grak & Bethel, all without such. It could still be a coincidence but i think there is a strong argument otherwise.
          ```

      - u/ExiledQuixoticMage:
        ```
        The exact quote from one of those triple parentheticals is:
        > this is a recreation of sorts, me working backwards from information that I didn’t have at the end of the last chapter, and won’t have at the end of this one. The thing is, if you learned it like I learned it, it would be a drawn out, incomprehensible mess, so this is a little bit of poetic license and extrapolation on my part in order to present something coherent. I hope you don’t mind. 

        I had taken that to imply that the whole work is a retelling by Joon who is using poetic license with information others gave him after the fact to fill in chapters from other people's POV.  However, it looks like you are correct that those triple parentheticals only occur in Amaryllis chapters, so you're right that we don't know if he's the author for the non-Amaryllis non-Joon POVs.  And naturally, if he isn't, then we're just getting Valencia's perspective and it would disprove the Valencia-is-evil idea.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          If he is narrating, its still likely that Valencia is non-evil, given that the sections would reflect his feelings about her probably at the end of the campaign.
          ```

  - u/Kuratius:
    ```
    I think at a certain point, there is no playing "the long game" in an evil way because the limit towards infinity is that you behave like a good person to facilitate cooperation. There's a point where evil becomes inefficient, and thus stupid.

    So it could argued that unless wiping out the human race is one of Valencia's short term goals, any conceivable ultra-long term goal would have her acting good. Even if you do your evil in secret, a thousand or a million evil acts with a 0.00001 % chance of being found out do add up.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      How does this viewpoint interact with the existence of 
       socially acceptable evils and socially unacceptable but good behavior?

      Should a potentially immortal agent of power with long term goals always do what seems objectively moral to them (minus risk mitigation) because they might be judged for past evils in the future? Or should they rather behave like a positive example of whatever given moral norms of their time and place?

    Oh, that. It required Val to have a... peculiar state of mind. Selfish, but at the same time completely selfless towards Valencias-from-other timelines. It was silly even then.

    I'm more interested in her interjection about poisoning candy. Why did she undercut Annad? Was her remark basically self-indulgent, a result of deformation from infernal over-exposure?
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      It was to undercut him, definitely, but also show precisely what type of person he is. He would definitely cause financial harm to the shop for the protection money, possibly financially ruin them, but he wouldn't poison random children and other customers as a way of putting pressure on the shop.

  I'm reminded of an exchange from Date Night:
  > “Fenn,” I said again.

  > “Oh,” she said, turning back toward me, “I guess I have an ethics question.”

  > “The fuck?” asked the guy with the dagger.

  > “I thought you didn’t want me teaching you how to be good?” I asked. [...]

  > “Well Mary and Val aren’t here -- that was a fucking joke, I’m not taking lessons from Val, don’t look so aghast,” said Fenn. “Is it better to kill these guys, or should I just be trying to disable them?”

  Not only is the parallel interesting, this time Val actually is the one teaching morality.

  > The hells had their own magics, their own physics, and they had ways of reaching Aerb, if they had cause to. 

  I wonder if the hells could help in keeping the Void Beast away? They have just as much interest in not dying as Aerb does, they have many times the population to work on the problem, and their own magics that might help as well. It's been stated that they don't unify well, but the Void Beast seems like something they might do so for.

  I love Bethel's glee at someone coming in to try to extort them. There was that line in one of the Sound and Silence chapters about Bethel seeming nearly giddy at the prospect of someone trying to break in, and this is a fun example of it.

  Overall, very nice chapter.

    I'd say they have much, much more interest, since they don't have to worry about eternal torment if the void beast doesn't destroy the world. But almost everyone on Aerb is crazy.

      The world building doc has a few mentions of the gods, but not a ton. The most relevant information is that they aren't native to Aerb, coming from some other place. Clerics exist, and have powers, but Joon only said that clerics are different on Aerb than they are in D&D.

    Giving everyone infinite resources doesn't really mean much since no one is capable of making everything they need nevermind the loneliness. 

    Even if people have infinite resources and land, they'll choose to live close with others in cities and countries and such.

  ```
  \>  a guarantee of a life of paradise in the hell of their choosing, in perpetuity. 

  oho.  and why hasn't THIS been abused before by someone?  One would think if commerce with the afterlife were possible, it would be exploited by both sides.  Soul-Reapers on Aerb hired by demons to kill specific targets and let their souls transmigrate, in return for cushy spots in the afterlife.  Influence traded with politicians, and so-on.  Infernals would be the strongest lobby on Aerb.  If they were willing to part with torturing some individuals, they could own the world!
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    The infernals don't work well together, for one. I forget where it's mentioned, either statements from AW or somewhere in the story, but internals don't particularly care for each other, and it's rather difficult to get them to unify. If they did unify, the population disparity would mean they could easily conquer Aerb militarily, which Amaryllis pointed out.

    Second, mortals don't all go to a singular hell when they die. When they die, they go to the upper hells preferentially, with a probability peak at the 500th hell with a long tail down from there. Even if an entire hell could agree to honor an agreement like that, an individual mortal isn't likely to end up in that hell. It would be complicated and costly to find an individual person out of all the hells that they could end up in, and then arrange for them to be transported to the place that made the initial promise. Possible, but complicated enough and with enough chance of failure that most mortals wouldn't likely be willing to risk it, even if devils weren't already known to be perfect liars and sadistic manipulators.
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      I agree that was my impression. This chapter does seem to imply it's possible though, and if it is merely matter of organisation, there would be massive incentives on both sides to make it work. Eternal reward for the mortals when the alternative is infinite torture or, in the best case, a CHANCE at mere non-existance is invaluable.  The internals would have an incentive to keep their promises since results are verifiable via inferniscope. The ultimate result should be the worst possible hegemony, where the powerful farm souls on aerb for the demons in exchange for eternal reward.  The "middle class" of employed enforcers are kept in line with the promise of being bottled, with the dim hope of progressing up the chain.  It's an inverted religion, where the worst tyrants are rewarded and the innocent poor suffer forever.

      Edit: in fact, demons could even short circuit this by issuing a mandate that non-anima be respected and left unharmed. Any that hurt non anima would suffer additional torture, while those that helped them are rewarded.
      ```

      - u/Tarhish:
        ```
        Though a mortal in the hells has no actual leverage, and while it's in the infernals' best interests to be seen as honoring a deal that could be verified by infernoscope, that interest evaporates entirely once Aerb no longer sustains life. At that point there'd be no reason for them not to renege on the deal.

        Since Aerb's lifespan is finite, yet existence in the hells is eternal, I would hope a smart and powerful actor would decide oblivion is the better choice, but...
        ```

  - u/CaptainMcSmash:
    ```
    Tbh, I would never trust a thing they promised and I don't think anyone else would either. I don't think anyone is gonna take them up on that offer. 

    Also, reading about how... bureaucratic the infernals were was really jarring. It's so strange seeing them be so pedestrian. I imagine the research team of infernals wearing lab coats and conducting research then torturing people during the lunch break, it's super weird.
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      Mentored in my other comment, but inferniscope means results are verifiable and the demons have an incentive to cultivate a reputation of fair dealing in this scenario. They show a few happy helpers living in bliss to prime the pump and then work to strike deals with the rich and powerful
      ```

      - u/i6i:
        ```
        infernals feel instinctual desire to have mortals not be happy in a way that would make this very unpopular and everyone who wasn't already a cultist would probably agree that the infernoscope was broken or being tricked
        ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Aside from what others already said, the story actually mentions this when they discuss the Couch Potato (the monster that mind controls people through TVs, one of the reasons the library has been shutting down tech developments).

    > “Cultists,” nodded Raven. “**Not like those that worship the infernals though, because there’s every indication that the entity is forthright in honoring the promises he makes.** There have been scenarios where knowledge of the entity was presented to the world at large, as you suggest, in the hopes of mutual cooperation. The result, every time, was a race to the bottom as the nations of the world attempted to be the first to get on the entity’s good side. World population undergoes a precipitous drop once the entity has its toehold, until eventually the last one percent of survivors live in something approaching a paradise for a decade or two before the entity is brought to immanence. From there, it’s a paradise with bodily sacrifices. The contorted writings of those living in that world are something to behold.”

    This suggests that infernals do make these kinds of deals with cultists every now and then, but they usually don't keep their word.

    While it's not explicitly mentioned anywhere, it's pretty clear from the in-story hints and the worldbuilding docs that infernal society is terrible at coordinating, which makes it bad at following its own incentives.

    Like, in this chapter, when we hear about a demon being asked to pay taxes to contribute to the effort to stop *the only thing in the universe that could possibly threaten it*, its immediate reaction is to plan tax evasion.

    So we can imagine that some infernals managed to, say, build a safe haven of eternal okay-ness and used it as an incentive to control a cult that did various horrible things in their name; and that the place lasted about 200 hundred years, until the devils who built it lost a civil war or something and some infernal gangs (who did not control the government, and thus did not benefit individually from the cult's continued activity) broke in and abducted all the cultists, and started torturing them forever.

    That's beyond the fact that anybody callous and desperate enough to, say, bomb an hospital for infernals is probably not going to be very good at anticipating the consequences of their actions.

    (on the other hand, one of the dragons mentioned they had good relations with infernals, so maybe *they* have some sort of amnesty deal going on)
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      totally, very good response.  there's definitely evidence the devils are not trustworthy and bad at coordinating - the interesting question is *why* - other than authorial/DM fiat, based on their inherent character. 

      Devils are apparently VERY smart and crafty, capable of long term planning and manipulation of humans if given the opportunity, and also immortal. 

      I'm not talking about them trying to convince a group of cultists to bomb a hospital - I'm talking about devils tempting Kings and Emperors with promise of personal immunity in return for systemic changes and political influence. 

      A coordinated effort among devils to maximize the influx of souls would look more like a successful Nazi Germany or USSR than a few scattered death cults.  And wealthy, powerful people - who have a strong chance of also being selfish - would have strong incentive to cooperate if their safety in the afterlife could be guaranteed. 

      Devils wouldn't have to offer amnesty to large numbers of people - just the right people. 

      And the current system - where a large portion of the population is getting bottled - is cutting severely into their income.  If they were actually smart and self interested, they would be organizing a response on the same scale as systematic bottling to combat that problem.
      ```

  - u/Mason-B:
    ```
    I mean that probably is a thing that happens during conflicts with the hells. We haven't really seen it at the moment. But promises of eternal paradise are likely pretty promising to at least a couple of people. The hells may not be doing it at the moment because they don't really care at the moment.

    On the other hand this may be the first time they have offered it because EFEs are such an out of context problem that they are super worried about it.

The opposite of this, the heat death black hole would be any paradise free from suffering for a non sadist (the Omega hell if it keeps the deal will have strong insentives to corrupt the paradise holder into a sadist and thus mitigate thier Superfund site by eventually making everything else (staff and services) be filled with mortal suffering so there is a steady background level despite the one hedonic abberation.

  On a completely separate note, I'm DMing a WTC-inspired PNP campaign starting this week.

  I'm torn on liking this chapter.  Like another post mentions, I love when stories explore the philosophy of situations that can't exist in the real world.  On one hand I like that it's an entertaining dialogue in the socratic meaning (dialectic?), but on the other hand it feels cheap.  It's like the argument was put in as a strawman instead of an authentic part of the story.    

  Val says that the protection racket exists because of a gap in society, but that's not really the case for protection rackets.  The protection rackets is the quintessential example of crime that you can *actually* deal with by cutting off the head.  Prostitution is something that can occur anytime a trade of sex for resources is economically beneficial, and drugs means that the law is always fighting against the supply/demand curve making it continually profitable.  Even opportunistic crime can be a result of poverty, which is solved by fixing the rest of the world.

  But protection rackets require organized groups capable of physical force, which are *known* to be capable of physical force, to which there is no alternative force able/willing to stop it, and the people must know that nobody will stop them.  If you take out any of those elements (eg by killing the face of the operation in the city), the racket collapses.  People stop paying because you no longer appear invincible, you can't *actually* fight everyone because that would bring in the real authorities, and without the income you can't maintain your force.  By wiping out the heads, you do a huge blow to the operation.  The solution really works.  We were arguably so successful at dealing with organized crime using this model that it handicapped us when other models of crime took precedence (eg the war on drugs).

  Val should know better.  Perhaps she's lying to Bethel.  However, Val also discusses why she's not lying in her own POV, so it wouldn't make sense to do so.  Bethel only gives the weakest strawman counterarguments; she's just setting up the pins for Val to knock down.  

  What furthers the feeling of a straw man is that Joon's Uncle is described as having 'fantasy of retribution and justice' which is later paralleled with Bethel having the same view where she's shown to be wrong.  Except that this is actually part of the solution in real life.  Protection rackets had a harder time taking hold in America and were always weaker in part because of rogue actors like Joon's Uncle who get angry and handle the problem themselves when people like Annad come knocking.  You can walk in and extort a candy shop in New York, but trying to do the same in Nashville just gets you shot.  (Fun historical note, the first conviction in New York's Sullivan Act which made concealed carry illegal in NYC, was a man defending himself from a protection racket.)

  Which brings me to why this situation feels inauthentic.  Annad is too weak and nowhere in Aerb has the population been shown to be helpless.  Every other locale we've been to has had plenty of people who could just kill him.  I think *literally* every locale, even when Joon and the gang aren't looking for it.  City in the desert? Plenty of mages and an active guerilla war.  Cranberry bay? Random strike teams in the street.  Nondescript suburbs?  Avatar of Goodness is patrolling around.  Take a train?  Heavily armed frogs with spirit weapons.  Go to the library?  Uther's last living knight wielding orbs of annihilation (I guess that's a special case).

  How did Annad possibly survive for years to get a reputation as a strong guy?  He gets caught in a second, then doesn't try anything to escape, and his enforces are just people with muscles.  If he'd tried this in Li'O then the next time he came around to collect he'd die from his skull being vibrated by the shopkeeper's cousin or something.  We aren't given any background on why Orrangush seems to be uniquely weak such that somebody who is so helpless can make a living from violence.  Hell, maybe even plain bullets would do the job.  And *if* Annad has some secret capabilities not shown in his POV that make him bulletproof and unassailable to the martially inclined in the city, it calls into question Val's solution of turning him for her gain, since he could potentially be strong enough to cause problems.

  Anyways, I like the idea of this chapter in theory, exploring how power interacts with ethics, but I feel like in execution the philosophical side of it is really weak.  It doesn't seem to have the effort or verisimilitude put into it to make it either an interesting parallel to real life or a believable situation on Aerb.

  Val running a candy shop is super cute though.

    You can probably see how I think those two statements would be at odds with each other, right? Besides that, Valencia readily admits that Bethel could simply kill them all:

    > You could become the entity that keeps the gap closed by killing anyone who steps out of line. You could kill everyone with the temperament and training to fill that gap. But that requires time and resources, resources that you’ve already said you’re loath to spend.

    We might disagree on either the framing or the results here, but in my view, killing one person at the top creates a power vacuum, and unless there's some *persistent* alternative force, you do temporary damage to the organization which will heal over time, unless there's some systemic change as a consequence of that decapitation. Even if you eradicate the organization entirely, that likely doesn't mean that no equivalent organization will come into being.

    All Valencia is suggesting is using Annad as the counterforce.

    ----

    Regarding power levels, Annad is mentioned as having a warder, and you could probably assume that he's got other mages on staff in some capacity or another. The groups that the party has fought so far are relatively above strength for their locales, but the closest example is probably Aumann, who had himself (gold mage), a revision mage, a still mage, a warder, and a velocity mage ... but he was also the most powerful man in Barren Jewel, owned a lot of properties and businesses, and in a place where there's not much expectation of law. (But Barren Jewel is also special for other reasons, and part of the reason that Aumann has more forces is because he's not just at risk from other people in Barren Jewel, he's at risk from forces around the empire that might want to take over his profitable factories.)

    Most people aren't mages, and most people who *are* mages aren't combat mages. I think bone mages are the most common, being roughly as common as physicians, but it's pretty rare for them to do anything but the same thing that physicians do, and most would be crap in combat. A handgun is enough to kill ... well, I could make a list, but the answer is "a lot of them", especially if you get the drop on them. Part of that is because most of the utility that magic provides *isn't* combat utility, it's just that we mostly view Aerb through the lens of people repeatedly engaged in combat with one another.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      Somewhat tangential, but I love that a lot of magics have almost no combat utility, but are extremely important for their mundane utility. Warders, steel mages, and bone mages have all extensively changed how Aerb works, but none of them are particularly useful in a fight (bone mages being a minor exception, but they're mostly medics). In a lot of other media, these magical schools usually have a primary focus on combat, and it's usually the most visible part of magic to the reader. Tournament style things are super common to showcase magic, even if "how much can you help to make a sword?" is in a ton of cases more important, even to a military, than "how much can you defend against one?".

      On the other hand, there's flower, pustule, and gem mages, where you really have to stretch to find an economical non-combat use for their magic.

      >killing one person at the top creates a power vacuum, and unless there's some persistent alternative force, you do temporary damage to the organization which will heal over time, unless there's some systemic change as a consequence of that decapitation.

      We definitely disagree on how the world works in this case.  

      It is my belief that removing leadership is an effective measure and that history validates this view.  Once we started using RICO, we basically shattered organized crime in short order after half a century of trying.  I can't speak to the conditions on Aerb, but IRL American organized crime was empowered by prohibition then existed because of organizational inertia until we finally broke them with leadership decapitation.  I do not *at all* believe that if you had a Deathnote in 1933 and removed the top 500 mobsters that organized crime would just spontaneously generate again in America.  (Nor does Val's statements make it seem like there's some Aerb prohibition analogue causing an unusual amount of crime.)

      Yes, removing leadership causes a power vacuum, which also means that there's opportunities for infighting and a succession crisis, like with Carlo Gambino.  That's probably a good thing if you're like Bethel, wanting to punish crime but not particularly caring about reducing overall deaths.  Yes, inconsistently applied it means these organizations can recover eventually.  But just because the organization *might* recover years later doesn't mean it's ineffective.  

      -----

      As an aside, my assumption was that Aerb gun ownership / combat capability is much higher than even American standards.  They're generally more prepared for disasters than most, and they have to deal with stuff like giant monsters appearing with hordes of antimemetic things you need to fight.  I just assumed everyone has a couple guns (and maybe a sword or two, it is Aerb) and a high percent of the population has a CCW.  Thus why it's weird to me that only 3 people without seemingly amazing combat abilities would be sufficient for a shakedown.  That couldn't rob a Texas diner, let alone how I imagine an Aerbian one is kitted out.

        Thia is a systemic change you are describing. Remove the economic source for the criminal activities (prohibition) and create new laws to catch them (RICO). The analogy I would use would be one of soul magic and spirit ironically enough. Changing the system (spirit) doesn't immediately change the state (soul) of it, hence why even after prohibition it took time and work for the system to break the situation it had been in.

        Here we see the opposite, killing this one guy does nothing because the system will just restore it without the systemic changes. To compare to the example you used, yes a RICO like systemic force would fix it, shooting one guy as a vigilante cop wouldn't.

        - u/xachariah:
          ```
          Errr, there was a 40 year gap between removing prohibition to RICO (which is basically the doctrine of going for the leaders).  So at least that systemic change didn't actually fix the issue.

          I may be underestimating this organization in particular, since the guy who's the face of the operations is operating low level.  But IRL the St Valentine's Day massacre (7 people) caused the gang to never recover, so 3 people including a leader doesn't seem particularly ineffective.

            > RICO (which is basically the doctrine of going for the leaders). So at least that systemic change didn't actually fix the issue.

            RICO is a *systemic* legal framework that enables it to go for leaders. You were the one that brought up the momentum of the criminal organizations from prohibition. My point is again that you are discussing a systemic change (e.g. people are still brought up on RICO charges today) to show why a non-systemic change (Val and Bethel killing some people before they leave town and never come back) should work.

            > But IRL the St Valentine's Day massacre (7 people) caused the gang to never recover, so 3 people including a leader doesn't seem particularly ineffective.

            Sure but they lost the territory to other organized crime. The repeal of prohibition meant there was less criminal activity to go around, so when these gangs took hits like the loss of their leaders they ended up dying (notably it took 7 years for the gang to actually die out after that). The point being that killing the leaders didn't really change the system, just the players.

                There are two reasons for this.

                The first reason is that RICO is very complex. Charging someone with RICO requires "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." ([Source.](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-109-rico-charges)) Each of those components has a specific legal meaning that would take a page to fully explain.

                The second, more important factor is that RICO, unlike many other federal laws, is both civilly and criminally enforceable. In addition to the federal government, private entities can file RICO lawsuits. Frequently, these lawsuits are filed by somebody with a political axe to grind - there have been RICO lawsuits targeted at protestors against the DAPL, the Republican National Committee, legal marijuana dispensaries, and the financial sector. These lawsuits have a low probability of success, but the objective of plaintiffs in these cases is to harass, not necessarily to win.

    On the contrary, he *keeps* trying to escape. He looks for any gaps in the ward surrounding him (which should be almost impossible to put there). He yells a warning to his muscle as soon as he can.

    The fact that Bethel just effortlessly no-sells all his attempts to escape doesn't mean that he's not trying. He's just completely and utterly outclassed.
    ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    I don't agree with you about the dynamics of threatening for money.  It doesn't need an organized group capable of violence that everyone knows no one will do anything about.  (If it did, it wouldn't happen all the time.  That is a super rare situation.)  It needs a target (a person who cares), and asset (the thing the person cares about) and an attacker (a person who can threaten the asset).

    The attacker doesn't need to threaten the target, they need to threaten the asset.  Stores are a classic asset, because they can't run away or defend themselves.  Reputations are another.  Careers a third.

    The target being personally fierce is not relevant to this deal.  Your Nashville and NY examples are equally helpless if they care about their stores.  They can pay a small amount to the attacker, or lose a big amount in their asset.  The only thing the Tenesee guy's belligerence gets him is a third losing option, going to jail for murdering the kid who delivers the threat.

    Bethel and Val aren't immune to Annad's boss' threat because they are able to defeat him.  They are immune because they don't care about the asset (in this case, being able to remain in the city and operate a candy store).

    I think your operating under the assumption that what we've seen of the world from Joons POV is the norm. Joon is a nexus and he is surrounded by immense power but that power doesn't necessarily exist everywhere. Your average shop keeper isn't going to be a vibration mage, or any kind of mage and he might not even know any mages personally.

    And while Annad may personally not be very powerful, he might belong to a group with powerful individuals. Say you shoot him, that just gives his bosses reason to make an example of you by sending a velocity mage to smear you into paste. Just like how a diplomat might not have power, he still represents it.

    She also say's someone else will take their place. Sure, you can continually cut off the head, which is what the police are ideally supposed to be doing; continually expending effort and resources to capture and imprison individuals who resort to violence and intimidation to profit. But what she's saying is that such men exist because society allows them to. Such men exist because in a society with poverty, people with no compunctions about violence and no other prospects will resort to that kind of behavior. 

    A systemic solution is remove the motivations for that kind of behavior like creating a post scarcity world or to a lesser degree, create great economic prosperity and abundant opportunities.

    I think the point being made is that physical force is cheap.  If you get rid of one band which projects physical force as a means of intimidation, another will take its place.  That's why it's said that States exist to exert a monopoly on violence: you can't end violence entirely, but you can make it so that anyone who uses it without authorization is punished.

    So, the problem here isn't that there's a violent band of criminals, it's that a monopoly on violence isn't being enforced.  There's no State, or an ineffectual one.  To fix that, they need a group capable of inflicting violence in order to claim that monopoly for themselves (for the benefit of the people of the city, of course).  I wonder where they can get one of those...

Chances are Annad is considerably more dangerous on the violence scale compared to the random person on Aerb, who is still considerably more capable of violence than the average earthling. I mean sure, someone could maybe hurt or kill Annad, but then there's his two bodyguards, and then there's the implied worse people he works for. They're just shopkeepers, not soldiers.

        Annad seems to do a decent amount of research, and has an unspecified number of unknown entads (admittedly, he never tries to use them, which does make it look like they're not very powerful). While it's possible a shopkeeper's cousin can take him out, it's fairly unlikely.

        Moreover, most people (even trained soldiers) do not immediately jump to murder as a solution. That shopkeeper's cousin would probably try to talk to the police or make a non-lethal show of force, which allows Annad to come back later and ambush them with more goons.

    I mean, Annad got literally locked in place with telekinetic force unable to move beyond speaking. It's quite possible he and his goons were otherwise competent fighters just not prepared to deal with that level of power.

He's rare and powerful enough to take on the 1/20 event that someone he tries to extort is friends with a couple of mages and tries an ambush.  

      In that case, it's fruitful for Bethel to kill him.  As a rare resource not easily replaced, it means he's not like some random thug they filled in who is just big and can break legs.  Next time they go extorting with the 2nd best enforcer instead, they end up dead because *that* guy can't handle dudes with 1-2 entads.

      The most useful aspect of a Deathnote, by far, is the fine-grain control on the victim's actions, up to days at a time. In fact the killing aspect is entirely trivial in comparison. We're talking remote-Geass level of power here. That's one thing Valencia does not have on Infernals.

      Contrast this lack with how the Infernals can (and do) torture new arrivals for intel, and can offer a reverse Pascal's wager benefits for further intel from the still-living, too. Plus, half of them have the same near-mind-reading skill that Valencia has exhibited so far. Even with their alleged degraded incentives for cooperation among them, they have **huge** advantages over L, Interpol and the FBI/CIA/etc.

        Well, she has a few advantages: she can see what any demon is doing at any point, she can read a demon's memory if she kills them, and she can hire an Empire's worth of consultant to help her as long as she doesn't mind the infosec risk.

        So she could, theoretically, start a civil war that could seriously slow down Hell's efforts to track her down, by sending messages to a few specific demons and telling them "I will absolutely, definitely kill you, unless you gather your army and overthrow the government". (though doing so loses the benefit of anonymity)

        She could even kill one of her generals (or their advisor) every so often and browse its memories to make sure they're not coordinating to overthrow her.

  u/cthulhuraejepsen, is there any way I can give you money and get physical books of this story?

  I know that I can use a print shop like lulu or something else and then just toss money to your patreon, but I was wondering if you've ever considered something official.  Eg, self publishing to Amazon, and then using Kindle Direct Publishing to allow us to buy legitimate copies from Amazon.

  Before actually reading this, I want to say that I saw the chapter posted some time before going to sleep, and continued to have a dream where I read it, didn't see any mention of Valencia in the whole chapter proper, and ended up at the author notes in the end which said that you merely named this chapter this way to troll us. It was a surreal and disappointing experience.

  On the positive side, not only am I now literally dreaming about your story, I can now also look forward to a chapter that is invariably better than my "first read".

      Although he didn't notice at the time, he could realize it later, or someone reviewing his memories could recognize it when he did not.

  > “He was formative for you,” said Valencia. “The man who raped you got away with it, suffering no negative consequences whatsoever for the way he treated you, and is regarded by nearly everyone in the entire world as the greatest hero who ever lived." 

  This confused me at first. If I recall correctly, Bethel didn't particularly care about Uther copulating with her human-shaped force projection.  


  Then I realized: Valencia wasn't talking about sex here; she was talking about all the entads Uther forced on her.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    She didn't care about the (half-) physical act itself, but the aftermath did affect her.

    > “I didn’t care, at the time,” said Zona. “What did nudity mean to me, when it was just an illusion that I was projecting?” She gestured to Tiff’s form. “This isn’t my body, my house is the body, if you’d like to stretch the analogy. Even after I was smart enough to understand, the sexual relations didn’t bother me. **No, it was the obvious shame he felt, the threats he made afterward, the way he tossed me aside once I’d served his purposes.**”

    Though presumably the entad-feeding - painful, permanently mind-altering, and disregarding her repeated pleas to stop - was on a whole other level. 

    Still, even if Bethel might agree that it could be appropriate to call the entad-feeding "rape", I don't think she'd assume it as the first interpretation of the word. So I don't think that's what Valencia meant either.
    ```

    - u/Mason-B:
      ```
      From my view and the commentary Valencia has about it afterwords I think she meant "all of the above" with the word "rape". In that discussing the specifics of it gets messy, but certainly everyone can agree Uther raped Bethel in one way or another. Whether from the human-sexual viewpoint, the entad-feeding viewpoint, or the emotional-abuse aspects. She chose it carefully because any of those viewpoints are valid and she can choose the path to go down as needed in the specific situation.
      ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    She says that she didn't and doesn't care about the rape, but that doesn't mean it's true.
    ```

    - u/CaptainMcSmash:
      ```
      It's a believable claim though, at least in the sense of rape. There was no physical interaction between Uther and her, just the hologram thing she was projecting. 

      The only parallel between that and rape is the feeling of helplessness when someone more powerful makes you do something you don't want to do. But without that sexual element, it's literally not rape, it has more in line with having a police officer or authority figure abuse their power and position to order you to do something you resent.

      - u/GreenSatyr:
        ```
        I think so too, but one wonders why she was so keen to have Joon have sex with her avatar. I guess by then she understood what sex was, emotionally. (Unless that was Ropey's influence somehow)
        ```

        - u/CaptainMcSmash:
          ```
          Well she said she wanted to make him feel good, but iunno if that was legit. All in all it was weird.

          Also during that time, she absorbed some entad that allowed her physical sensation so she actually did get pleasure out of it.

    Haven't we heard Joon think fell seed has no weeknesses?  This seems like the Nazgul propesy where it was killed by a woman because no man could slay it. Nothing is fell seeds weakness.  It might be worth looking for a bottomless pit to throw Arthur into or a magic that gives Joon a black hole to throw in the exclusion zone or something punny like that.
    ```

    - u/Argenteus_CG:
      ```
      I'm sure Arthur is more than capable of escaping from a bottomless pit; he's done it before. A black hole might work though, albeit at the cost of the rest of Aerb being destroyed. As far as "nothing" goes though, void weaponry seems like the clearer choice there. But if Fel Seed could be killed with void weaponry alone, you'd think someone would have done it by now. Maybe the void beast?

        A black hole is definitely not "nothing".  The whole point of them is that they have a crazy amount of mass.

  Val's and Beth's conversations about their ideal world reminded me of [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/category/story/arc-5-esprit-de-corpse/5-04/). Especially, how would they react to Helen presenting her ideal world? (Spoilers for Twig from hereon out).

  >>!“Everything that isn’t necessary to getting what we want is gone,” she said, eyes closing, as if she was vividly imagining.  “There’s an abundance of it all, thanks to science.  Food is everywhere and it overflows and there’s nothing to worry about because we have and we want and we take.  We’re, and by we I mean people, we’re everywhere and we spill over into one another and we’re all knit together, physically and mentally.  It’s an exquisite landscape of things that don’t ever run out to see and touches and tastes and smells and mating and eating and mindless fighting and eating-mating and fighting-eating and fighting-”!<

  >>!“Okay,” I said, interrupting.  I paused, then when I couldn’t think of what to say. “Okay.”!<

  >>!Helen reached down to her plate, used a fingertip to wipe up a bit of frosting, and popped it into her mouth, sucking it off.!<

  >>!“Okay,” I said, still at a bit of a loss for words.!<

  >>!“That’s a mental image that’s going to be with me forever,” Jamie said, dropping his head down until his face was in his hands.!<

  >>!“I don’t see where ethics come into that world,” I said, more to see Jamie’s reaction than out of curiosity.!<

  >>!“No,” Jamie said.  “Don’t-”!<

  >>!“The closer you get to perfection, the further you get from ethics,” Helen said, as if it was common sense.!<

  >!Helen's similarily non-human to Bethel, but coming at it from a more... predator-like direction. She was purpose-built to be a killing machine who gets up close and personal, while Bethel was never *intended* to be anything but a house. Their background with regards to their "creator" is a little similar, though, what with Helen being made attractive to Ibbot's precise sensibilities, and her not respecting or liking him.!<

  This sounds awfully familiar.

  ch180:
  > I didn’t attack him. I couldn’t break the peace, not over this, it would be assault by anyone’s definition, and it would fuck things up for Amaryllis if I was wrong.

  I think [all the outrage in the last thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/egl22m/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_177183/) about the capture missed something.

  Look at Respec, ch172:
  > This time, I had friends and allies around me, plus as much information about the underlying mechanics of the system as Reimer could give me [...]


  > Reimer’s interpretation of “effective skill” had been that it was just the base number, meaning that it would be multiplied by my abilities, rather than by whoever’s abilities I had borrowed from, at least for the purposes of Symbiosis. Taken that way, my nine in Flattery was really useless, because Symbiosis would push me up into the mid-twenties. The same applied to pretty much all of the social skills I had retained.

  What if Reimer was just _wrong_ about how it works? There's a whole scene about them talking through multipliers and target numbers. What if he misremembered, or it's not "taken that way", or the rules of the game layer are not a fleshed-out version of the rulebook Reimer remembers?

  I think the capture is best explained by something along these lines, that Joon screwed up his social skills and we're in for a few chapters of him putting his foot in his mouth before he figures it out. Hopefully he does it before he completely runs out Solace's patience.
