## Origin of Species theory

### Post:

I had a thought, what if Red if the result of Red honing his physic powers causes him to just use it to communicate, to give a reason behind why he doesn't seem to talk in canon.

  I like the idea that he's just too hurt to try and speak with people

  What is the idea of Red being psychic anyway? Is that something that's extrapolated from canon, a justification for something canon, or just something new and exciting?

    I think it's just exploring the psychic human aspect of Pokemon that is woefully underutilised and doing it with a point-of-view character who is already inclined to experiment on and study it.

      Yep.

    The other responses are probably closer to the truth, but I always figured it came from the running fan joke that Red's dad is Mr. Mime.

    So, afaik the closest instance of 'canon' tends to be that powerful trainers have powerful bonds with their pokemon. For Red to fulfill canon, where he's the strongest in Kanto (and effectively Johto too), he needs to have an extremely strong bond with his pokemon. Psychic Red seems to be the most popular, if only because it provides a justification for him to be exceptionally good with pokemon, even at a young age.
