## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  In RWBY, every student creates their crazy, transformative Weapons by themselves and yet, quite obviously, none of them appear to be an engineering prodigies with knowledge equivalent to a team of experienced professionals. It drives me crazy, so I tried to make this a worldbuilding exercise of sorts: just *how* a normal guy like you and me could build these Weapons?

  Also, the question of how the Weapons can break all these laws of physics by themselves can be ignored here. Just assume Dust/Aura shenanigans - we're talking about the 'creation' aspect first.

  For the length of this worldbuilding note, I’m going to assume that the Weapons of the main characters’ are not a faithful representation of an average Weapon, but the *really good stuff*. Normal Weapon would be something like Crocea Mors or Team CRDL’s Weapons, while Crescent Rose is something you would lay on a pedestal in a museum of technology. 

  Now that that’s out of the way, I propose two distinct options:

  1) [Lego Option] Remnant’s advanced technology was first created in the same way the real-life one was, with the most implausible, rule-breaking types of it working solely on Aura and Dust (thus, exploitation of Magic). Students at the Hunter Schools have access to powerful tools, like High-End 3D Printers with an enormous database of customizable ‘fragments’ or ‘building blocks’ available. ‘Forging’ the Weapon, then, would be printing appropriate ‘building blocks’ and integrating them together according to the design prepared beforehand. The connection is further secured by ‘channeling’ Aura into the Weapon. In the present world you can buy a working smartphone for 10$ at a random market in China, so it’s not implausible that the lowly weapon-smith in Volume 4 would have tools necessary to upgrade Crocea Mors. And it doesn’t take a genius to build some original Lego sets, either. Team RWBY has so amazing Weapons because of connections (Ruby, Yang, Weiss), money (Weiss), or just stealing the relevant blueprints and tools (Blake).

  2) [Tinker Option] Remnant’s advanced technology was created by reverse-engineering the technology conjured by some of the weirder Semblances or Aura exercises. Hunters create their Weapons in a process similar to Tinkering in Worm or building Lightsabers in Star Wars: it is an intuitive, meditative action. Hunters don’t have any knowledge of how their tech works – it’s the scientists’ job to make sense of it. And they did – that’s why Remnant is so high-tech. Hunters with matter-conjuring Semblances or particular talent at ‘Aura-Building’ are regularly stationed at scientific research facilities where they create things for hours. It’s sometimes done as a punishment for lazy or uncooperative teams. Team RWBY has so amazing Weapons because they are very talented (prodigious, really) Huntresses, especially at the field of Aura Manipulation.

   (These options aren’t mutually exclusive and can be meshed together to achieve greater depth.)

  Of course, in both cases creativity, intelligence, and hard-work takes a large role too. While the sole act of building the Weapon might be easy, creating the design is much more difficult. Students probably have a free access to advice from the School Staff and maybe even some professional engineers and designers. Since the Weapons are the most important tool of a Hunter, aside from Aura, I would wager there are mandatory lessons focused on the subject and the Weapon-Building doesn’t come until the later years (students would fight and train using practice weapons). 

  You can incorporate more possible worldbuilding bits based on this:

  1) The unprocessed (fresh, not reverse-engineered and built again) Hunter-Tech might be illegal to sell to the civilians and, subsequently, have a large presence at the Black Market.

  2) People with matter-conjuring Semblances might be subtly pushed into specific fields – perhaps Professor Polendina started as a Hunter, but ended up a scientist because of his relevant abilities? He is relatively weak in terms of combat power, but still retains his connections from school (James Ironwood) and insider knowledge. 

  3) Penny might be not a miracle of technology, but logistics. Professor Polendina created her by assembling a team of Aura-users with specific Semblances and using their personal abilities in an ingenious way – fusion. For instance, a Hunter who can shape material at only microscopic scales + Hunter who can create perfect copies = ultra-precise copy of a silicon ‘brain’ (hardware). Hunter who can move knowledge between the minds of people + Hunter who can give sentience to inanimate things = Penny’s Mind (software). Hunter who can create clones + Hunter with shape-shifting abilities = Penny’s Body. One by one, other useful Semblances would come through. This might be a ‘miracle’ specifically because of how hard it would be to find these Hunters, get them to work with you, keep them from babbling off the secret, and make their Semblances work together to produce exact result. Most probably, these high-level techniques are very volatile, abstract, and unpredictable. Funny idea: you can make Professor Polendina a scientist specializing in Soul – basically, a modern *actually right* version of a monk/priest/ancient philosopher/something.

  What do you think?

    I wish I had your imagination for fantastic technology and logistics because I love everything you've written here. I always just accepted this stuff as part of the plot, but you've addressed them in a way that fits so well into what we already know about the setting that I want both to be my headcanon. u/NotACauldronAgent makes some great points too, particularly about the state of AI in this world.

    The "miracle of logistics", in particular, is a concept I've always liked because it can be used to justify weird stuff while still emphasizing the mundane intelligence and hard work it required to create. I've been using the same idea so much while building the world for a [Base Raiders](http://www.baseraiders.com/about/) campaign that part of me just wants to throw crazy ideas at you and see how you creatively rationalize them.

      I've just realized most of my internet fame, especially here, is from these discussion chains. I've argued against and with much more famous people on this sub, in topics ranging from Harry Potter to AI balancing. I think that's pretty neat. 

      Also, I agree with the whole Logistical Primacy thing. With strange inputs and lots of cooperation, lots of things can be made possible. Discussing crazy ideas is one of my favorite things to do, so if you do do it, I'd love to help.

        Thanks. Base Raiders is a premise with so much story potential for a variety of genres that I've put together tons of notes filled with crazy ideas, at least half of which are thinly-veiled references. My intention is to use them for a improv-heavy sandbox campaign where the players can do whatever they want, so the GM will just grab ideas out of the bag as needed. PM me your email and I can send you the Evernote docs, though I should probably put them in Google docs instead.
