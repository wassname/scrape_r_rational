  That was a very good chapter, and I enjoyed reading.

  If the next chapter doesn't reveal that that ridiculous strawman argument was part of a ploy to make some deeper point - which, to be fair, would make sense, I can think of at least three - then I'm dropping the fic.

  It's good, but ... there's been at one jarring, SoD-breaking thing per chapter. Which would be doable normally, perhaps, but with chapters this short ... it forms a sizeable percentage of the story.

  Imagine if HPMOR had - I had a list here, but you can choose your own nitpicks - every few PARAGRAPHS, instead of every other chapter or so. It's a shame, because I do enjoy a lot of this fic, and I like the premises and even the writing.

    Yeah. It's a pity, because the HJPEV in this chapter was actually believable to me, which is an encouraging sign. But the giant strawman more than cancels that out.

  So, Ginny is a Straw LessWronger. 

  Her obsessive and irrational personality traits are much larger parts of her personality than any sense of rationality at all. She's a stand-in for that kind of person who reads the Sequences, half understands them, and parrots them back without doing any kind of deeper thought about them.

  Her actions in the cultish meeting were exactly those people criticize Less Wrongers for doing: telling people to 'Go read the [Methods/Sequences]', dropping jargon terms, acting generally condescending, etc. 

  She clearly hasn't actually internalized any of it, since one conversation with a (surprisingly rational) Luna hits her into a mental brick wall. Several of them. 

  I'm not sure if I'll drop this. It wasn't really high quality before this, but the chapters are five minute reads. But unless Ginny starts to change quickly, she's just not that interesting a character.

    I liked the first five chapters of this. Then came the logic gates, then came [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/30ei4c/rstwip_ginny_weasley_and_the_sealed_intelligence/cpszyks) and now this.

    Seconded, that broke any suspension of disbelief or any goodwill I had to plod through the writing.

    Seriously what the fuck, you have a cloud cuckoolander Luna one chapter, and the next you have her cogently delivering the standard anti-religious argument? Or Ginny actually accepting it? ( in my experience people fight a lot harder to keep irrational beliefs even when they're exposed to the techniques. If she was going to break down that easily it needed foreshadowing, and internal cognitive dissonance *before* Luna comes in to burst the dam. Alternately if you're going for something pedagogical there was a fine teaching moment missed where Luna fights back and later reflects on her actions, instead of becoming a good little rationalist in one feel swoop.)

    Hell, Harry doing the cult thing was perfectly in character for something he did in the first few score HPMoR chapters, but we've been watching him grow more mature throughout that fic. His dialogue was incredibly wooden, and that whole bit was missing Harry's whole "Well, I just earned a few dark lord points. Fuck" internal monologue. (That's not actually an issue given choice of narrators, just jarring)

    It's a shame since there's a few brilliant ideas in this fic. Not to mention that less wrong really does need chiding about its more subtle failure modes.

  The argument at the end is so blunt, and the suggested development (Ginny renouncing her religion through rationality) seem so, I don't know, trivial, that I'm suddenly worrying that the author intends to go 'one level deeper', and present Luna as an unreasonable and judgmental militant atheist, while Ginny would be this reasonable and tolerant religious person, able to reconcile her faith and rationality. 

  This would be an especially ridiculous plot for a presumably 'rationalist' fic, in my opinion, but the other option is that it's going to be a blatant atheist propaganda piece? And I don't particularly like blatant propaganda, even if I happen to agree with its points wholeheartedly.

  >"It's an issue of translation; the word Muggles translate as 'witch' translates more accurately as 'demon-summoner'."

  Hilariously enough, it's closer to "potion-maker".
  ```

  ```
  I read twice that people think HJPEV is acting normally. I disagree. He's supposed to be a smarter rationalist by now. Think of his goals:

  * Be part of the club 

  * show people he is a regular dude like them 

  * retain maximum membership 

  I just can't believe that he would think scaring everyone into action against him on the first day would be rational, here.

  Just started this fic and now I'm caught up. I was pleasantly surprised by Ginny being made somewhat likable (initially), and rational!Lockhart was refreshing. There are some good ideas here.

  That said, I felt nauseous while reading this. The rate at which characters' mannerisms change completely to fit the narrative gave me a constant sense of literary vertigo. It's like the author wrote the dialogue first, then retrofitted characters to speak it. This is terrible. Much more thought needs to go into what each character would actually say and how they would act in any given situation.

  Seeing as this is a continuation fic, it should be the case that everything not introduced by the author is held as constant as possible to MoR. Introducing Ginny, Luna, Lockhart, et. al. as characters is more than sufficient to tell the story without playing fast and loose with established characters and reinventing elements of the universe wholesale. 

  Every good moment is ruined by something ridiculous like magic as logic gates, nundus, and now apparently wizard religion. There are major problems here, and I feel the author needs a great deal more development before trying to tackle something like a MoR continuation.

  Just my two sickles worth.

  Harry wouldn't call MOR "muggle thinking techniques", but instead human.

  edit: It's not that people would lie about being a cult. It's about having a different definition than what you'd expect. Nobody thinks they are in a cult. Source: Been in a cult.

  edit2: witch is ok because of translation problem? Lol, bible has lots of problems with witches, definitely not just "demon summoning". Divination for example is definitely out.

  edit3: also yea, the religion discussion is not a good one.
