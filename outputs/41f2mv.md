  So, um. This is still pretty great. 

  It's confirming implicitly that this is a simulated / code-based universe, which given everything else that's going on I find unsurprising. 

  A callback to a previous chapter:

  >Gebron and Eleazar’s classic textbook says that only four kabbalists have ever gazed upon Adam Kadmon bare. Rabbi Isaac Luria. *The archangel Uriel.* The Comet King. *And an eight year old girl.* 

  (italics mine)

  The events of this chapter happen in 1990, about 27 years before the events of the previous chapters. 27 is 3^3, and there are three characters of consequence in the chapter (the girl, her father, and the archangel). Also, the archangel repeats the figure "4.9 seconds" three times. 

  Edit: The number of days separating the date of this chapter from the date in chapter 1/2 is 9,720 - which is the mystically significant 40 multiplied by 3 repeatedly (3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 40). 40 is often a biblical amount of time, as in the 40 days and nights of rain or 40 years wandering in the desert. So we've seen 3 * 3 * 3 and 3 * 3 * 3  * 3 * 3, so after those sequences of obvious 3's the missing sequence 3 * 3 * 3 * 3=81 must be somewhere hidden in the chapter. And, of course, it's hidden in several places - in the Archangel's thoughts of killing Sohu, he thinks about how 29.4 kJ of energy would smash her skull, which is about 8.1 watt-hours, for example. The rest are left as an exercise to the reader.

  Sooo how does a human use up too much computing ressources? People who use particle accelerators and telescopes?

    It's possible that the Names of God are function calls, which would use up more system resources (depending on what the Names do).

    Clearly some people have "superpowers" (for whatever reason) - not flashy powers, but odd privileges that they shouldn't.

    I am constantly boggled by people who have read my previous stories still being surprised that I like humor in fiction.

    But I am trying to make the book able to stand on its own aside from the humor (sort of like HPMoR or Discworld, which both included humor but weren't *about* humor), so I hope you'll stick around anyway.

      yeah I used to have that problem but I think HPMOR probably solved it permanently

          Chapters 1, 2 and Interlude ב do seem significantly different in tone than chapter 3 and Interlude א.

    I myself find am almost the opposite - I love humor, and wish there was more really good science fiction / fantasy humor. There's tons of well-done serious books out there, to be honest; the number of really well done funny ones is much lesser.

      I like funny non-fiction more than funny fiction. Bill Bryson's books are very funny. 

      I think its quite difficult to do generally accessible but intelligent humor. I like Discworld, but the humor often falls flat and IMO really damages the emotional drama of the work. I never feel emotionally invested in Discworld; I find it funny but not serious, though I enjoy the creative worldbuilding.

    Have you read _Kiln People_?

  That was hilarious (and all the not-coincidences are mind-boggling). The straight-faced humour reminds me of Terry Pratchett.
