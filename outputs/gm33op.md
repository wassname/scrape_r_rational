## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Some recommendations:

  [Mud's Mission](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31919/muds-mission): I very nearly posted this as a top level recommendation, but due to the weird way that RR works it's actually better to do that on Wednesday or so once the story's released to Trending. Suffice it to say that if you're on this subreddit and you're not allergic to litrpgs you'll probably enjoy it. 

  [Jayke Cipher](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30380/jayke-cipher): another entry in the "litrpg protagonists with unlikely names" genre. Not quite top level post material, but the main character is fairly rational. Does a little bit of the "programming is magic" thing, but I'd like more. 

  [Castle Kingside](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27456/castle-kingside): I've recommended this before but it just came back from hiatus (maybe). Uplift Isekai, starts out super grimdark but mellows out a little bit.

      That's true at first, but IMO the MC's poor choices mostly come from the fact that he's in an entirely outside context situation - not only is he in a magical world, he's also _destitute_. 

      I think the second of these two problems is actually the harder one for the MC to overcome. He starts acting like a storybook thief / beggar, largely because he has no other idea what else he could do. It goes poorly for him. 

      The parts this subreddit is interested in don't really kick in until the end of the first arc, when the MC has some resources and is more able to act in the middle/upper class professional milieu that he's accustomed to.

      Spoilers thru ch 25

      >!But then he chose acceleration over deceleration because "acceleration is better" and, no, slowing down let's you gain/regain control which he's been lacking for 25 chapters, especially since we just saw that he can  affect others and his surroundings with the spell. Guess we never got to hear what gets accelerated or accelerated  so maybe the spell will still turn out to be worth something.!<

    Didn’t think Jayke Cipher was very good, within about 3 chapters he’s given 3 of the most OP powers ever. So the author either needs to escalate a massive amount or just make him dumb to introduce any tension into the story.

    Also the writing seems off to me and reminds me of other bad litrpgs I’ve read.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      I'm pretty lukewarm on it myself, but what can I say - my standards have dropped. I blame world events.

      The writing does get more fluid over time, and the character has more common sense than in some of the other recent litrpgs (like say Unbound, where the MC's response to everything is to run at it face first)
      ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Thanks for the recommendations. I am reading Jayke Cipher first and while I enjoy the story I do have some complaints.

    I find that the protag makes awfully suboptimal decisions. He doesn't write down his code on paper. He doesn't try to store information from his code anywhere. He doesn't use his safehaven properly as a portable hole. He doesn't use that his shields can affect him including giving him flight, cushioning his falls, shoving him inside his safehaven in a pitch, and so forth. He doesn't make any code-analysing code for debugging. 


    It bugs me that the Coterie supposedly is the peak of arcane research but they don't test on anything related to arcane research during their testing process.   


    It's also a little unclear to me why the protag keep putting himself in life threatening battles. Even buying that getting into the Coteria is worth the level of risk, there is no obvious reason why he needs to do it now instead of training and examining his code magic until he's actually competent. This is someone who bunkered down for years to avoid the monsters outside.

      Don't forget he chooses to interpret "half" by number of coins....so he gives the lowest value half of the coin sack.

    Castle Kingside would be maybe 73% better if the author knew how make up interesting sounding names and words. As it is, it's very distracting when all your spells are noun+ "al".

     Acellal? Invisal? Weaksauce.

    That said, I'm still reading and hoping it leads somewhere interesting
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      A) the MC has some weird translation magic going on, the spells probably sound more mystical "natively" than they do in English   
      B) there's something going on with the endings - the spells other people cast end in -ia, only the MC's special spells end in -all. 

      I do agree they sound v. silly, though.

  ```
  The final season of Netflix's [She-Ra: Princess of Power](https://www.netflix.com/title/80179762) dropped a few days ago and now that it's complete I would definitely recommend it.  It does a fantastic job of developing the characters, in particular the main protagonist and antagonist have a very complicated relationship that I thought was handled really well.  

  Characters do make stupid decisions on occasion, but it usually feels like an understandable expression of their past experiences/traumas, rather than that they are given the idiot ball for no reason other than to move the plot forward.  I'd also say the ending was very satisfying, albeit a bit rushed, in that I think they would have done well with twice as many episodes.  On a genre level, they have some interesting twists on common tropes that I found fresh.  The world also is a fun mix of magic and technology which blend reasonably well.  

  All that said, it is a children's show, so the power of friendship is definitely the name of the game.  If you've enjoyed other high quality children's shows like Steven Universe, Avatar, My Little Pony, etc. you might enjoy this one as well.  If you do decide to watch it, don't google it because there's fairly big spoilers for the final season everywhere right now.
  ```

  - u/Weerdo5255:
    ```
    I would argue against comparing it to Avatar. 

    She-Ra has legit friendship magic and somewhat nebulous magical rules. 

    Avatar does not have friendship magic beyond following a group of kids who trust one another. 

    Both are kids shows, and do focus on the characters quite Abit more than typical, enough so that you by halfway through the show can guess fairly correctly what someone is going to do.

    She-Ra is good, and it ties up it's relationships nicely. I just feel like it's more a 'kids' show when compared to Avatar which is only really kiddy in season 1. Even if both shows avoid blood / gore and the like.

    Might be nostalgia goggles, can't really look back on She-Ra yet. Just finished that.
    ```

    - u/ExiledQuixoticMage:
      ```
      That's a fair point.  I was comparing it to Avatar in the sense that it's a kid's show that an adult could still enjoy, rather than to say that the mechanics of the worlds (or even the long term staying power) are comparable.

    I tried She-Ra, but I couldn't get into it. The characterization was too strong for me, and the development didn't feel that natural.

    On the flip side, on Netflix, I've been having a lot of fun watching [Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo!_Mystery_Incorporated) which I think is so much better than it has any right to be. The pitch: your normal mystery shenanigans, with over the top tech, an ongoing epic storyline, and character development.

    I feel like that's more a problem of mediums and audience size than it's about this subreddit in particular. The low end budget for producing a rational webserial is the only the used time whereas practically every other medium has a high production cost, and while making a story rational by filling in naturally occuring secondary effects from the world and having the characters be consistent has some cost it's not even clear if it would increase the audience.   


    That's a long way of saying that I like the idea of having some colaborated source for non-written rational stories but I can't think of many off hand.
    ```

  - u/Smartjedi:
    ```
    I think this is a good idea for sure. Checked the wiki just now to be safe and all the recommendations there are for other subs or websites to find written fiction. 

    A top level post would be good to garner some feedback on this.
    ```

- u/thebastardbrasta:
  ```
  I'd like to recommend what I consider the most interesting and clever isekai series I know of. It's called [12 Kingdoms](https://kitsu.io/anime/juuni-kokuki), and it's about a woman who suddenly finds out that she was actually the ruler of one of the 12 kingdoms in the other world! She decides to follow the tall attractive guy into the portal, but trips and lands several kingdoms away from her own, having to struggle to eventually make her way towards it. It's rational in the sense that Madoka is rational: it carefully maintains internal consistency, and presents realistic consequences and implications for events, while giving different "ideologies" charitable depictions.

  Beyond just being a well-paced and interesting take on the genre, it also:

  1. Features likable, humble, and/or interesting main characters.
  2. Elaborates on a rich and interesting world.
  3. Carefully avoids contrivances to solve plot points.
  4. Has the protagonist be rewarded for acting rationally.
  5. Has no infuriating tension caused by immature main characters.

  Unfortunately, it ends very suddenly and unsatisfyingly, and the plots following the coronation are significantly less interesting, but I still found it greatly enjoyable. The show is currently available on Crunchyroll, although watching anime through alternate means is generally accepted within the community.
  ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    I liked how well 12 Kingdoms was able to mine tension out of a premise that you'd think would kind of drain it all away.  I remember the series fondly.
    ```

- u/derefr:
  ```
  Request: a story that would start (or at least largely take part) in a dynamic similar to the one *Worth the Candle* will presumably end with.

  I want to see a human who has just freshly attained godly power—the protagonist—enter into conflicts with the incumbent Literal Gods of the setting, over the protagonist's attempts to fix the Crapsack World they grew up in, and now rule over.

  Sort of like where *Practical Guide To Evil* arrived at with international geopolitics, but one level higher up, with a lot of True Dweomers and Chosen Paladins being flung around on all sides.

  Or, sort of like the third book of the *Crystal* trilogy, but with the other AI goal-agents being *conservative* to change (wanting to keep the Crapsack World exactly the way it is, because they *already* remade it the way they like it a long time ago, resulting in it being what it is now), rather than actively working to make the world fall apart in different ways.

  Hopefully as well, the protagonist would have human friends from back when they were human, that they would still rely on and talk to even after becoming a Literal God.
  ```

  - u/Amagineer:
    ```
    [God of Eyes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26818/god-of-eyes) is adjacent to what you've requested. The protagonist is reincarnated as a god in another world, rather than having built up to godly power but it's concerned with what someone with godly power ought to do, which sounds like what you're interested in.
    ```

  /u/skytroupe recommended [From Muddy Waters](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13933635/chapters/32073363) last week and I'd like to second that recommendation. The writing quality is fantastic, the story premise is great and the way it deals with trauma is very well written. 

  Highly recommend. 5/5. 155k. Ongoing.

  - u/Dent7777:

    Does the reader need to be familiar with the "My Hero Academia"?

    Would the Fic suffer if the reader was not?

    - u/Prince_Silk:
      ```
      Yes, but not dramatically. If while you read you keep a tab open to check the wiki when a new character pops up, you should be fine.

      Like I've never seen the show or source material and got through it fine by reading other MHA fanfiction before and checking the wiki while reading this one.
      ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    Could you quickly describe what it's about, what exactly is the premise (aside from Midoria's quirk), and why did it engage you? You can spoiler-tag stuff if necessary, assume that I know BNHA.

    Neither your nor /u/skytroupe's review give me much information, and the summary that is simply an outtake from the fic gives me even less.

    Thanks in advance!
    ```

    - u/Prince_Silk:
      ```
      It's a MHA fic where >!Midoriya is the son of [All for One](https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/All_For_One). The story does a fantastic job of handling such a situation. Midoriya here is motivated to become a hero and be the opposite of his dad. He wants to help people, not hurt people. He and his mom grew up with his dad before they ran away, but there's still a lot of trauma there. The story also does an excellent job of handling that.!<
      ```

      - u/NTaya:

  Still in the middle of reading it, and it doesn't quite rise to the level of Fair Play Whodunnit, but [The Apothecary Diaries](https://mangadex.org/title/21562/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto) is a standout manga for how it involves people thinking (at all).

  I'm still trying to figure out how to put into words what makes the [Companion Chronicles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.787978/) stand out from all the other self-insert or jumpchain stories out there.  There's only one or two elements I can currently put my finger on, like the author's ability to conceive of a similar story as being told from the viewpoint of a completely different person who thinks they're the protagonist (the [Memory Jumper](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.787978/page-45#post-66337619) chapter).  I can very clearly tell the author is *smarter* than average; I'm still trying to pin down the signs in ways that would be describable to other people, so that I could ask for more stories that visibly have smart authors.
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    I don't know if it's "smart"-ness so much as it is a well-developed sense of empathy. It's kinda like Archchancellor Ridcully vs Granny Weatherwax from Discworld (which happened in *Equal Rites* IIRC) - Ridcully is canonically very smart, probably smarter than Weatherwax, but he doesn't understand *people* to the same degree. 

    I feel like it takes quite a bit of mental yoga to be able to distance yourself from yourself to the point where you can write a self-insert story where, in a very real sense, your SI is not the main character.

    Also now that I think of it Companion Chronicles really reminds me of Blade Runner: 2049, another story where the protagonist is not the MC. Especially since "empathy" is one of the thru-line themes of Blade Runner in general.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      > I feel like it takes quite a bit of mental yoga to be able to distance yourself from yourself to the point where you can write a self-insert story where, in a very real sense, your SI is not the main character.

      There was this one ASOIAF SI where the SI takes over the body and memories of Robert Baratheon after he first sits on the throne, and while he could still be considered the main character of the story, what makes ot interesting is that je is never the viewpoint character.
      ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    For me the what makes the story special is that it's a well done metaanalysis of a genre written such that the characters have depth and relatability, and the protagonist is competent and makes believable errors, while retaining the genre's strength (which in the case of jumpchains to me is progression fantasy, seeing settings and people we know, and solving issues of that universe).   


    You mention many other jumpchain stories. Can you recommend any stories in that genre?
    ```

    - u/reaper7876:
      ```
      The author of Companion Chronicles makes a few recommendations [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.787978/page-35#post-65027499). (To avoid sockpuppeting, I should mention that one of the listed stories is my own. It isn't really written with this subreddit in mind, though.)

      There's a complete index of jumpchain stories [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17g1y3hxKkn3WOhS3CqWy1yJJQsJqm1jmSjn49NER-ks/edit?usp=drivesdk). It's not filtered by quality, but it trims down the SB list by removing snippets, so it's an option to search through.

      That's all I can think of, except to second (or third, or fourth) Companion Chronicles for anyone undecided. It's very good.
      ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    Brandon Sanderson is an intelligent author that can actually pull off plot twists, with fair who done it, that intelligent people can't tell from a mile away. His books start slow though.

    &#x200B;

    Book of the Ancestors, trilogy is very good. Very far future universe is dying, very few stars left and of those most are old, humans regressed to a middle ages tech. The author is intelligent similar to Brandon, but his other books are very edgy and your mileage may vary with them. Thankfully he puts it on the table right away, so if it isn't your thing you can drop it without wasting time.

    &#x200B;

    Other than that, they are hard to find, their distribution follows general IQ distribution and you'd have more luck in other genres like non fiction and scifi.

  I read a manga called Battle in 5 seconds after start (I may have made a mistake with the name) and the characters had unusual abilities. The MCs ability was the most unusual though : whatever his opponent thinks his ability is. So the MC had to use his brain alot in order to use his power properly.
  It reminded me of Stands in JoJo and their weird powers. 

  I'm looking for novel, web series, manga etc that has a power system like this with unusual abilities . Where winning a fight isn't just about whose ability is  stronger but rather, how well you can use your ability.

  I started reading [Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends) a while back, and I'm surprised at how competent it is. It's a litrpg/xianxia story with multiple main characters, with proper character development and pretty decent characters overall. The premise is that the system apocalypse happens on Earth, 10 years after which the most powerful 10,000 people are teleported to the Infinite Realms, which is literally an infinite plane (think minecraft). There's much more but it's all explained pretty well in the story. The story starts off with two main characters, Ryun and Zach, who are the two (2) survivors of their Earth (there are multiple). 

  What I liked about this story is that the power system is very consistent, and the worldbuilding has been thoughtful so far. The characters aren't cardboard cutouts and actually have motivations and personalities. I was a big fan of how one antagonist solved his problems in the end of Ryun's arc, which made sense given his motivations. While the main characters start off OP, it's evident once they arrive on the infinite realms that they're still basically ants compared to the truly powerful people. Overall it's pretty competent, and I recommend.

  This is a recommendation + request post. Last week I got an itch to re-read stories where romance is one of the central focuses. I couldn't find any new ones so I ended up rereading some of my favorites. Here are a few of those. If you have any recommendations that are similar to these stories please reply with those. Thanks! 


  ___
  All of these stories have romance as one of the main focuses in the plot. Most are somewhat slice-of-lifey but some do get a more serious and dramatic at times. Please comment if you want more info/have questions about any of these fanfictions/authors/ect.

  * RWBY - Jaune/Yang
  * [Breaking Through the Bottom of the Barrel](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12027237/1/Breaking-Through-the-Bottom-of-the-Bottle) by College Fool. 5/5. 42k words.


  > My favorite Jaune as an MC RWBY fic and one of my favorite romance fanfictions in existence. It doesn't fit the definition of RomCom, but it is a romance story with comedy. It does a great job at providing fun humor while also including well written serious moments. Takes place over a single night and the author does a great job at following beat style romance formula to create an enjoyable flow. No real RWBY knowledge required to enjoy. 

  * Naruto - Naruto/!Fem Sasuke
  * [Written in Reverse](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2661190/JMenace) by JMenace. 4/5. 68k words. 


  > Written by one of my favorite Naruto authors, Written in Reverse is a time travel Naruto fanfic that has a fun twist. It's slice of lifey and a bit unique, but the quality is quite solid and is on the whole fairly entertaining. (The story has a !fem Sasuke if that's a dealbreaker.) 

  * Naruto - Kushina/Minato
  * [A Girl From Whirlpool](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5645686/1/The-Girl-From-Whirlpool) by SilverShine. 5/5. 248k.

  > A very wholesome and happyish rendition of how Minato and Kushina met and became a couple. The author's ability to bring to life Minato and Kushina is commendable. The dynamic and story here is my headcanon about how Konoha and Naruto's parents were like before Naruto was born. 

  * How to Train Your Dragon/Frozen - Hiccup/Elsa
  * [A Chance Encounter](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10171267/1/A-Chance-Encounter) by R-dude. 4/5. 218k words.


  > Another fantastic author. Actually wrote another fiction on this list as well, [Contractual Obligations](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation). This story is a well put together crossover of How to Train Your Dragon and Frozen. It gets somewhat frustrating/slow at parts, but overall worth a read to the end. The dynamic between the heads of state makes this story. Solid writing, well paced plot and great characters. 

  * Harry Potter - Harry/Daphne
  * [Contractual Obligations](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation) by R-dude. 4/5. 90k.


  > This is a great fic. The author keeps the story tight and cuts out any fluff. The only real problem the premise is annoying the actual realism of how premise came to be in story is fairly farfetched, but the rest is is fantastic. The characters are very interesting, the conflict is very well done and the writing very high quality. 

  * Harry Potter - Harry/!Fem young TR
  * [Thunderstorm](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm) by T3t. 4/5. 40k.

  >The Fem TR might be a dealbreaker, but I implore you to give this story a chance. Set in a world where TR was a woman, this story is romance between the diary spirit fem TR and HP where they're both the same age, 16. The story focuses on the relationship between the newly, created/born diary TR and a more callous/older Harry Potter. Short and sweet.

  * OreGairu - Hachiman/Yukino
  * [Even Hikigaya Hachiman can write a Love Letter](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11044041/1/Even-Hikigaya-Hachiman-can-write-a-Love-Letter) by God Emperor Penguin. 4/5. 

  > A fun collection of one-shots that became a story as the author wrote more. Hikigaya's voice is very well written here and the character dynamics that exist in the LN and anime are done well if not better in this fanfiction. If you like OreGairu I highly recommend this fanfiction.

  * OreGairu - Hachiman/Yukino
  * [Snaf U](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11492096/1/SNAF-U) by isko. 3/5. 52k.


  > This is a bit more serious than lighthearted. It does a good job of taking the characters and aging them up. They all resemble the characters from high school, but it's visible how they've changed with age and maturity. Another recommendation for those who like OreGairu. 


  * Amazing Spiderman Universe - Peter Parker/MJ
  * [Perpendicular](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8952765/1/Perpendicular) by nine miles to go. 4/5. 152k words.

  > This is a story for those of us who like tragedy in their romance. It's a bit dramatic and idk if folks here will resonate with this particular story, but if you find the angst-hurt/comfort tags to be interesting, you might enjoy this story. If you don't like the first couple of chapters, I doubt you'll like the rest of this. Would recommend reading at least those. s

  * Star Wars (The Prequels) - Anakin/Padmé 
  * [The Sith and the Senator](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7513976/1/The-Sith-The-Senator) by WrittinInStone. 3/5. 237k.

  > I've never watched all the Star Wars movies. I mention this because I recommend this fanfiction without a super fleshed out headcanon of Star Wars. I only know about the prequels through memes and reading the wikis. I'm not sure how well this story depicts the Star Wars universe/characters. 

  >What I do remember is that is this story was quite enjoyable when I read it two years ago. It makes Anakin's craziness into an interesting, unique plot point. It's not slice of life as the others, but I remember finding the story engaging and well written. (Emphasis on Anakin is crazy, so the resulting romance isn't "normal" by any means.)

  * Harry Potter - Harry/Luna
  * [Contemplating Clouds](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds) by Tehan.au. 5/5. 8k.


  > The only Harry/Luna fanfiction that I've ever found and thought was well written. Luna's a character that's too often written to be a bag of quirks without any real substance. Maybe it's because this story is too short and doesn't have the chance to screw it up, but I always find myself smiling at just how well written Luna is here. 

  * Stein's Gate - Hououin Kyouma/Christina
  * [The Variable](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10683812/1/The-Variable) by meggann. 4/5. 10k.

  > A Stein's Gate oneshot set after the series, but before the movie. It's an interesting well written piece that delves into the relationship between Okabe and Kirisu and the mechanics of how they interact. 

  * Hyouka - Houtarou/Chitanda
  * [The Rain is Trying to Tell me Something](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10529576/1/The-Rain-is-Trying-to-Tell-me-Something) by thundercow. 5/5. 16k. 

  > Hyouka is my second favorite anime of all time so I'm a bit biased here, but I find this story to be beautiful. It does justice to the characters and their personalities. The story is my headcanon of what happens after their high school life comes to a close. Very poignant and just heartwarming.

  Again to reiterate, if you have any recommendations that fit the style of any of these, please lmk! Also if you have any questions, I'm happy to expand on any of these stories/authors.

    Since your list is all fanfiction, off the top here are some of the best when I think of fanfic romance:

    [Birds of a Feather](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936) - Harry Potter - [Original rec thread.](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ax82yl/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ehs0y3x/) Along with the 2nd, probably one of the more fitting romances for this sub.

    [Let Me In 2](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/Let-Me-In-2) - Let Me In / Let the Right One In - [Original rec thread.](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/btahxu/rec_let_me_in_2_a_rational_vampire_fanfic/)

    [Grow Young With Me](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/) - Harry Potter - IMO the best and certainly one of the most realistic fanfic romances anywhere.

    [The Hazards of Amity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7962196/1/The-Hazards-of-Amity) - Naruto - Just all around moving if you're a fan of Itachi. Very fitting for his character.

    [Unmade](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13166639/1/Unmade) - Oregairu - Hardboiled crime/romcom that's also a solid non-canon sequel.

    [Precocious Crush](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6604037/1/Precocious-Crush) - Kick Ass - Long (drags on), but that preteen angst is inspired. Doubles as a kind-of sequel.

    [Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746) - Harry Potter - Pretentious premise, great banter, satisfying fluff.

    Sorry for the barebone recs, bit tired tonight to think up anything snappy, but I wholeheartedly recommend any of them.

      I know everyone has different opinions but Birds of a Feather hasn't had an update (or even edit by the author) in 6 months now from a previous very regular update pattern. It seemed to be nearing conclusion too
      ```

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        You lost me at the different opinion → update segue, but 6 months is a very mild hiatus for fanfiction. If I recall, the author likes finishing his works so let's hope everything's alright and the end will come one day.

        Compared to BoaF, half-expecting the last chapter of The Hazards of Amity was/is way worse. Though the current "ending" is much more potent as is...

          Well that's why I said everyone has a different opinion regarding this stuff. Some people don't care about 3 year gaps between works, others won't read anything that's not finished. 

          If the author had kept up their usual pace the story would have likely concluded.

          >If I recall, the author likes finishing his works so let's hope everything's alright and the end will come one day.

          Yes I hope so too. 

          I'm just letting people know that it's an unfinished work with a sudden and unexplained, and crucially unprecedented, absence by the author.
          ```

          - u/nytelios:
            ```
            Thanks for clarifying - that bit was a real non-sequitur without context.

            That's a lot of adjectives... Most of my recommendations are unfinished. My train of thought is: fanfiction rarely gets finished, good fanfics are a rarity, and cutting the pool to only the intersection means missing out on many great stories.

            - u/RMcD94:

              I agree with that, after all I made a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bs0f7l/birds_of_a_feather_chapter_37_rtwipff_rational/) about Birds of a Feather after your recommendation because I thought it was too good to be left in a thread, but I still think telling people up front the status of a piece of fiction upfront is the way to go.

              Some people don't want to read work that could never be finished, and yes at any point Wildbow could have suddenly stopped pumping out Worm updates but I think there's a difference between: abandoned, consistent regular updates, often has long absences between updates, finished, and potentially abandoned.

    I'd second the JMenace (/u/jwsMenace) recommendation. I wouldn't say their stuff is particularly rational but it's still worth reading. I loved their Nartuo/Lovecraftian crossover The Howling Wind.

    Such a massive shame they're not writing anymore.

    ```
    [Grand Design](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design) is a finished Sci-Fi opus with themes of AI, transhumanism, and ethics of war.  
    A few thousand years after the end of Humanity in a gigantic cataclysm, several races of aliens live among the ruins of human space stations and trade routes. The story follows two Terran Marines on their way to finding a weapon that could let them avenge Humanity.  

    [Should The Sun Not Rise](https://shouldthesun.wordpress.com/) is urban fantasy with a Mesoamerican theme. An ancient Being, adrift since the Spanish conquered her people's kingdoms, is whiling away her days in a sleepy Rhode Island town, waiting for the days where *someone* fucks up and exposes the existence of supernatural beings to the world at large. She's pulled into an investigation of a murder that was done in the style of ancient sacrificial rituals, where she is the prime suspect.
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      I quite liked Grand Design. It does weirdly mix the living-in-ancient-ruins vibe with the more playful one. It's also got some of the most interesting scifi ideas I've encountered, all of which are suuuper spoiler.
      ```

  1 - good rational manga or at least very close to be rational. 

  2 - actual good original rational fic, not cringe worthy fanfic

  3 - litrpg, I curious to read more about, I'm new to this genre so any *really top quality ratinal* litrpg out there? 

  &#x200B;

  I'm new to this whole rational fic stuff, so send some good one.

    For 1, I'd recommend [Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors](https://mangadex.org/title/36067/ultimate-rock-paper-scissors). It's about 8 people with different superpowers competing in a rock paper scissors competition. Surprisingly sensible usage of their different abilities, short (~20 chapters), and highly enjoyable.

    For 2, I really enjoyed [The Dark Wizard of Donkerk](http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html), which is also by Alexander Wales, who also wrote the *epic* Worth the Candle, which another person's already recommended. (I recommend it as well!)
    ```

    - u/tjhance:
      ```
      Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors is the most underrated manga of all time.

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    2 - Have you read any Brandon Sanderson? His characters aren't perfect rationalists, but they act according to their motivations and capabilities, and the magic systems are well-defined and so much fun to explore.
    ```

    - u/Dent7777:
      ```
      I love Sanderson, and 90% of his character viewpoints are great and worthwhile.

      However, there are some lengthy chapters where you have to deal with boring, unreasonable, whiny, or downright annoying perspectives. Sometimes it is a good character in a bad scene, and sometimes it is a bad character. A common flaw between Mistborn, Reckoners, and the Stormlight Archives.

      Any multi-perspective story will have viewpoints that the reader enjoys more, and viewpoints that the reader enjoys less. I would say Sanderson does it better than GRR Martin, for instance.
      ```

  - u/Nivirce:
    ```
    1- My personal Recomendation is Ajin. The last few chapters released are a little less rational, but still better than most stuff you see. The mechanics of how ajin's work are very consistent and are explored pretty throughly. You have a few less-than-rational characters but they still act as you would expect a real person would. the main character is a rationalist and is pretty much always acting in his own self-interest, and when he isn't he is still acting in a way that furthers his values. I think that it's the most rational manga I've read.
    ```

    ```
    for litrpg with varying degrees of ratfic;

    Worth The Candle

    Delve

    He Who Fights With Monsters

    Seaborn
    ```

  - u/RedSheepCole:
    ```
    Standard answer for 3 is [Worth the Candle](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle).  The signal-to-noise ratio seems to be quite low for the genre, but WtC is wonderful.  I just caught up with it a couple of days ago.  Warning, it's quite huge, well over a million words and probably going to be close to 2 mil when it's done, going by in-story hints.
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      I just got so happy thinking about 2 million words of WtC. That's a story I'll carry with me forever, not only in rereads but in all the tropes and settings and magic items and NPCs I steal for my own tabletop games.
      ```

        Bear in mind that's a wild guess based on >!his second convo with the DM, where he says Joon has gotten about halfway through his planned content!<.  I don't know how many words ago that is, etc.
