  Well, I just got finished writing 5000 words of conversation between a fairly intelligent borderline Level 1 rational teenage boy and an AI.

  I'm hoping I didn't botch things too badly :)

  Please throw fruit and point out problems if I've done terrible things.

    This chapter was SOOO GOOOOD. I'll try to give it a more critical look in morning.

  I really enjoyed the chapter. The only thing bugging me is that I kept thinking at the beginning of the chapter that Allen is too smart to not think it's Albert talking. 

  But then again, he is a very emotional person (more so than most I'd say) and tends to only really be smart when he is calmed down.

  I like the whole "AI spending sanity to create stuff" thing. It mirrors some of my thoughts on the subject of axiom drift.

  ```
  That was an excellent chapter. I can't think of any particularly obvious mistakes Albert is making, given his goals
  ```

  I've been following this since it started, and I have to say, this is my favorite chapter so far. I was hoping that this would happen ever since Allen's Ma told him about martial arts. So awesome! Thanks for all the words, and please keep writing!
