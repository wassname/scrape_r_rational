  No RSS feed that I can find, which is a shame.

  (I confess, my primary emotional response at this time is strong dislike of the sole embodied character shown.  I will be amused (and intrigued) if the protagonist turns out to be the psychiatrist, linked together in a network interacting with nearly all of humanity!)

    An interesting thought, but (from the author's note on the first comic):

    > Our protagonist, Lee Caldavera, prefers subs to dubs.
    ```

      Alas!  Thank you for that!  I read the sentence a day or so ago, but failed to retain that crucial detail.

  > As for me, though, I do get annoyed when I see people misusing and appropriating psychological terms. "Depressed" does not mean "sad". "Triggered" does not mean "made upset". "ADD" does not mean "feeling antsy". "OCD" does not mean "I like it when things are tidy". Words have meanings, damn it, brainsciencey words doubly so.

  Me too, and yet I'm also guilty of this, and if _Leftover Soup_ is any guide this is going to be a mighty interesting ride. Thanks for the link, Xam.
