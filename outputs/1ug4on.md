  Seems this is what you get when you cross *Antichamber* with *Madoka Magica*: something wonderfully, awesomely *fucked up*.

    My only issue is that [we already linked to it](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1rzavz/city_of_angles/) IN THIS VERY SUBREDDIT! 

    But yes, the story is brilliant and creative and fabulously written and brilliant.

      Well, see, that's the thing. Because of reddit's so-silly ranking algorithm, if he wanted newcomers to see it, he couldn't bump the old thread or something. So resubmissions are encouraged.

        Well, from now on lets only resubmit stories by their latest chapter, instead of starting from the beginning every time.

          Ookay, well, that sounds good.

  I started reading this the first time it was recommended in /r/HPMOR, and finished the next morning. I recommend it heartily, and particularly Penny's overall arc, which is more or less "increase your luminosity until it reaches critical mass".
