    Shoot, yeah, it could come out at any time.  

    Maybe I should've waited...

      You're kinda evil man. You had me pretty damn excited for a moment.

      I just excitedly whipped out my phone and went to Mother of Learning in the middle of a rehearsal, and my groan of disappointment broke the pianissimo the violins were working on. Whoops

  Drawn by the brilliant [Aslovefromlies](https://aslovefromlies.tumblr.com/), commissioned by me.  This is the scene from chapter 101 after Zorian smashes through the invader's defenses in the Dungeon.

    That is a nice face on Zorian. Definitely a face of an archmage! Imagine the face a mercenary has when he commanded, "Hey, cut my head off!" Hahaha.

    Cool stuff. Though I need to reread whether his golems are top-heavy.

      We never get much detail on them, I went over a few passages on them when talking with the artist, but there's a lot of improvisation.

    So, a question. Do you want me to add this to the list of fanart on my site? 

    Also, I'm not sure what the attribution procedure for commissioned artworks should be. I though about crediting the artist (Aslovefromlies) as the artist, and you as the one who made a commission. I usually ask the artist for permission, too, but I'm not sure how that works in the case of commission - I assume it's now up to you to give such permissions?

    Anyway, tell me your thoughts about this.

  oh damn, that's a sweet golem. I kinda want to see what the artist would do with the huge golem he made for fighting Quatach Itil and friends.

- u/CorneliusPhi:
  ```
  I kinda want to get a print of this for my wall
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    Me too!
