## [RT] Battle in 5 Seconds After Meeting

### Post:

At a glance, it's a standard kidnapped into a psychotic death game manga with some surprisingly rational qualities. 

The main character, along with hundreds others, is thrust into a pointedly irrational situation and given a special ability. These range from the absolutely overpowered to the utterly useless, and MC's ability has the potential to be both. From there, you see how the MC proceeds to adapt and analyze his own abilities in response to the frequently changing circumstances, while also being presented with either no or ambiguous information.

For anyone that has read Hunter x Hunter, the feel is similar, and though the characters/world might not be the most intricate or original, I've found it extremely entertaining and thought you guys might enjoy it too.

  >!Seems to me like the obvious answer is to get someone to believe his ability is "I can manifest whatever ability I want." Which he could hack together by convincing several observers individually of separate powers, then demonstrating those within range of someone who hasn't yet seen him in action.!<

  I am at the reveal of the MCs ability.  


  I will admit, I am suddenly a lot more interested in seeing how this will pan out.

  >!So it seems like you get someone to believe you can give people super powers. Then you actually give someone super powers. Rinse and repeat. Maybe even find a way to get yourself a stable set of powers that doesn’t depend on what other people think.<!

  I haven’t read the story btw, but this is what I’d try to do.

  The writing is very heavy handed, it took me a bit to realize that the text bubbles must be read right-to-left despite being in English and therefore the individual bubbles being left-to-right, and the art is frequently confusing, but I got the gist. I would have stopped reading much earlier except that I wanted to know what his ability is. It turns out to be >!what the other person thinks it is!< which is interesting enough to keep me reading for at least a bit.

    It's a scanlation, judging by the credits at the start of Chapter 1, so you've got the original layout (formatted for Japanese reading order, right to left), just with English in the appropriate text bubbles.  It's pretty common if you read a lot of translated manga.
