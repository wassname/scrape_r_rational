### Post:

Welcome to the inaugural Best of /r/rational!

This is the voting thread. The categories are:

* Best Post  
* Best Comment  
* Best Munchkinry Question
* Best Munchkinry Response
* Best [Weekly Challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge) Entry
* Most Helpful Worldbuilder

Whoever wins will be get reddit gold, as will the person who nominated them. You **can** nominate your own posts and comments, though make sure that they're actually good. You can nominate multiple things, though don't nominate your own stuff twice in the same category. Obviously all your nomination posts should be links to /r/rational, with some additional notes below. Also obviously, the post/comment should be from 2018.

Nominations and voting will close on January 5th, after which we'll have a results thread. This thread will stay stickied until then.
