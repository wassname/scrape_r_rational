## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

    I think this happens quite a lot with popular web related fiction that is very serial and doesn't have a specific endpoint. It even happened with famous old school comics like Cerebus. At some point when the author gets enough attention on their product that they didn't expect they start to use that attention for other purposes.

    It is truly unfortunate.

  Where/how do you listen to audio books/podcast and what would you recommend? I've recently started driving to work (having started from home since this pandemic began) and looking for things to help my drives along 20 minutes or 90 minutes long

    [Behind the Bastards](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/)

    The histories and backgrounds of the worst people in history. It's hilarious and educational. So much more stuff happened in history than we really know lol.

    [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)

    What happens on the darkside of the Internet?

    True stories of cybercrime, darknet markets, and state sponsored cyberwarfare.

    99% Invisible is great if you think the infrastructure that underlies modern life is really fascinating and neat.

    I highly recommend the "Podcast Addict" app on android, I've used it for years and consistently think it's earned the few bucks I paid to remove ads.

    I listen to a ton of podcasts due to work and exercise, any specific genres you like? Telling people your specific fiction, hobbies, and pop/pro-whatever you follow will help a lot. I also enjoy listening to things alongside other media, like commentary/analysis on shows or reading.

    For how to listen, I second the recommendation of Podcast Addict.

    As for the podcasts,
    * 80,000 Hours does really in-depth interviews of experts in different fields.
    * The Arms Control Wonk podcast has some great episodes on how analysts use open-source intelligence to study nuclear weapons research and proliferation
    * Dressed has lots of interesting details about the history of fashion
    * Early and Often looks at the history of elections in the US, starting from the first colonies
    * Listen to an episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me, because if you like it there's at least a thousand hours more McElroy podcast content out there
    * Rationally Writing is by Alexander Wales and Daystar Eld
    * The Film Reroll has a fun conceit: it's an actual-play podcast where the cast stats up and plays through a different film each episode
    * The Tip Off is all about the process of research and fact-checking behind recent big investigative journalism stories, following a different article each episode
    * Throwing Sheyd is about Jewish demonology

    For comedy, I like MbMbam (My brother, my brother, and me) and conan O'brien needs a friend. "Criminal" covers both interesting crime and flaws of the justice system. I'll second 99% Invisible as a great podcast.

    I listen in the car; I subscribe to things with Google Podcasts on Android.

  One description for the theological notion of Heaven is that it's a lie wielded to maintain Hell; that is to say, instead of focusing on improving this world, which is our only world, the notion of Heaven redirects peoples' efforts towards a nonexistent world to come.

  This doesn't seem obviously untrue to me, but I wonder about the causal relationship. Obviously, religion has been used to justify and perpetuate things ranging from the caste system in India to slavery in the Antebellum South to the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few in the United States today. But is that the case because religion is a social structure and social structures are prone to being weaponized by those who have power, or is it the case because the concept of Heaven is inherently toxic, inherently suited to siphoning effort away from creating a heaven on Earth?

  I guess in order to test this I would have to know more about theologies that don't have an afterlife. Ironically, my own faith (Judaism) is one of those, but only kind of, because there are all these really fuzzy afterlife notions in different branches of Judaism even though there's no real canon about it, and also I don't know what the position on the afterlife was of the few sets/types of Jewish theological leaders who had substantial secular influence.

  As an entirely separate thought, I've been likening AGI-boosterism to this concept in my head for a while now. There's this feeling I get from a lot of AGI boosters that there's no point in striving for a better tomorrow, because that's nothing compared to the post-singularity Good AI Overlord future (aka Heaven), so you might as well do nothing. It's extremely disorienting because metaphorically adjacent to those folks you have EAs who are all about "do the most effective thing for a less bad tomorrow".

  [edit] - Similarly to the above phenomenon, I am constantly baffled by the occasional Mars-colonization-as-societal-panacea take I see or hear. Folks, if you think building a utopia on Earth is hard, doing it on Mars is gonna be a thousand times harder.

    Waiting for agi is like waiting for retirement to live your life. Kind of backwards if you ask me. I'm more of a self reliance type of dude, make my own life as good as possible to the extent that I can, rather than relying on government or other people to do it for me at some point.

    &#x200B;

    There are thinking patterns that are arguably OP, like how you think about diet / exercise, or how much control over your life you perceive you have, how proud you're etc. Most people use the generic ones they got from their parents, and those are fine and clearly work, since you know your parents had kids and statistically are living average lives, but imho there's room for optimization in most people's thought patterns. It's hard to get introspective enough to question and if needed optimize them though.

    When I was religious I always took heaven as a goal for us to imitate and not a reward. This I think was a part of me getting disillusioned by the whole thing, when everyone else seemed to use it as an excuse to not do anything. Don't have to worry about the climate or war or poverty because Jesus is going to come and fix it all, dontcha worry. 

    If I were to have the chance to go back and rewrite Christianity, it would be to make it so that God died permanently on the cross after putting all the butterflies in place for heaven to be possible but not guaranteed. Let people have their guidance if they "listen" for the butterflies, but know that if they don't strive and if everyone doesn't strive, nothing will get done.

    But then I bet it wouldn't have survived as long as it did.

  So anyway [there's a person on Twitter offering to buy human souls for $10](https://twitter.com/liminal_warmth/status/1366814447625379841) who's drafted [a full and extremely detailed contract for it](https://liminalwarmth.com/contract-for-sale-of-soul/).

  So far, I think they got 8.
