  ```
  This is probably my least favorite chapter. It's such an asspull; it's a plan that relies on so many different things to work. And the mentalist guy just appears out of nowhere when it's convenient for the plot.

    ```
    I've really tired on this manga because it just seems like ass pull after ass pull to me.
    ```
