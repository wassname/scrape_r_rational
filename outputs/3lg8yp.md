  ```
  Our lack of any efforts to recruit more aids is hurting us, yes. One on one fights are not good.

  Ok, so, this could be one of several things. It could be a supernatural ghost which is vulnerable or invulnerable to our attacks. It could be a metahuman with phasing powers. It could be a hologram created by a metahuman or a super scientist. It could be some sort of monster emulating one of the above.

  Regardless, if it displays human level intellect it would be immoral to kill it for no reason. Who cares about some guns? The ideal would be recruiting it- perhaps by aiding it in the attack on the guns? Or observing their powers before an attack.

  Situation dependent anyway. The priority is not killing it. Magical powers are useful.
