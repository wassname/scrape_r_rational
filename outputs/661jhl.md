  I'm impressed by this story. A huge leap in quality from the author's other one.

  (Just read through the currently-available chapters.)  The writing was pleasantly easy to read.  I liked the semi-subtle hints (especially early on) about the nature of the nation, such as the off-hand comment about there being no modern equivalents of the older books looking at how the government worked.

  The main character's attitude towards libraries has been very comfortable to read about.

  I read the 12th chapter first, then the first 11; from the 12th chapter I was worried that there would be a strong Hogwarts smell from the entire main story, but the earlier chapters (with demonology and the Arcanum) reassured me it would not be to any extents I had feared.

  I find myself wondering where the protagonist's story is going, in the long run.  Seeing him zoom over the heads of his classmates (academically) is plenty fun on its own, granted.

  I can see various plots and grand-phenomena foreshadowing, but I find myself hoping he finds a path that no one else could have guessed at, one that only he could follow...  well, that 'binding a demon by convincing it of your lie' sounds really tempting, too.

  Ooh I just found this and read through to the current chapter. Entertaining stuff! Always in the mood for academic power fantasy/competence porn, and the author's technical writing is solid. I also dare say I see something of myself in Nic. We share the same name (though mine differs by a letter – Nik), we both lost our fathers when we were very young, we both had working mothers (mine worked as cleaner for a time, even, as did I), we both were voracious readers and spent tons of time in libraries (I often read >100 books a year lol, and easily spent hours each day in the school libraries, from middle school through uni, even working in one as an aide), we both attended ritzier schools on scholarship (I had my costs mostly covered at a ~15k/year high school and covered with plenty to spare at a ~$60k/year uni), we both did well at those schools and at exams (e.g. I graduated *summa* from the latter), we both had childhood friends/romantic interests at school who *hated* us. I was even a friendly student to a demonologist in highschool (well, an exorcist, but close enough). There are some differences, though – I’m nowhere near as industrious or smart and was never socially ostracized (for socioeconomic reasons or otherwise) and had plenty of friends and hobbies, including the physically-active sort. Still, it’s uncanny! Though I guess in many ways any old nerd could find plenty of similarities between themselves and an eponymous “good student”.

  I'm liking the subversion of expectation in some cases (Dizzy -- to which I'm always tempted to append *Sma* -- being wholly imperfect) but not others (the OP, still-slightly-mysterious Simole, other classic fantasy tropes). Characterization is great, too (my favorite being Davo, I think). Curious to see where the story's headed!

  I both enjoyed and forgot about this one.
