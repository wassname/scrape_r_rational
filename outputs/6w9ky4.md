  Just popped up on my front page. Is this something like The Methods of Rationality or Oh This Has Not Gone Well?

    It is rational but not to the degree of those two. I'm not going to have anything happen due to the plot. Idiot balls are nonexistent. In this universe magic has been heavily analyzed and researched.

    >Oh This Has Not Gone Well

    I started reading it, and it has gone very well (at least for now). Thanks!

  This confused me a bit, as there is already a published rationalish work with a similar name - [Sufficiently Advanced Magic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34403860-sufficiently-advanced-magic), which has been mentioned on this sub, and quotes HPMOR, MoL, etc. in the afterword.
  ```

  - u/jldew:
    ```
    Huh. I wasn't aware of this work. I named it after the Clarke axiom. It looks interesting.
    ```
