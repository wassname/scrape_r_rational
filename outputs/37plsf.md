## If I ran another rational horror Kickstarter, would you participate?

### Post:

tl;dr  -- If I ran a Kickstarter for "Baby Blues part 2", would you chip in? If so, do you have a sense for how much you'd be willing to go in for?

A few months ago I ran a Kickstarter for a 5k-word rational horror story, "Pay Attention." It heavily overfunded and so I ended up writing three stories which were supposed to total to 27k words but actually ended up being 40k. In my opinion the best of those three was 'Baby Blues'; I think it may have been the fan favorite as well, because multiple people read it and then emailed me saying "oh my god, that was horrifying, and I loved it!" which was intensely flattering.

I'd like to write a 15k-word sequel to Baby Blues, and I'm thinking of running another Kickstarter to support it. It would pick up where Baby Blues left off [when ](#s "Mitchell was being dragged back to Rikers Island to be imprisoned and horrifically tortured.")  Before I spend time putting it together, though, I want to check if there's any interest. 

Setting expectations:  My default plan would be to distribute the story to all backers and then put it up for sale on Amazon.  I am also happy to have a stretch goal of "the story will be Creative Commons at launch."

So, back to question at top: any interest?

  Well... personally, I wouldn't, but that's more because the "horror story" part than that you're writing it. Not the biggest fan of the genre as a whole!

  Heh.  It's a relief to be upvoted, but I have to admit I was hoping for comments as well. :>

  I don't have much, but I would be able to put a couple of dollars forward for a fellow author.

    You are full of awesome, thank you. Don't do it if it's going to stress you, though.

  I contributed last time and would again. Baby Blues was definitely my favorite story – I appreciated that the characters (and even society) acted rationally and still inexorably ended up in a dystopia. Pay Attention had a rational monster, but it was very isolated and felt realistically defeatable with a bit more individual effort: hence, not as "horrific".

  I'm definitely willing to back you again (up to $20) since you delivered in terms of quality plotting and writing with 'Baby Blues'.

  Don't forget to post an update to your past campaign to let your past backers know if they would like to back you again. Don't worry about feeling as if you are pestering them. Most of them backed you the first time because they thought you had potential and it sounds like you more than delivered on that front.

  I recommend reading this [great post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Write2Publish/comments/1pm2c6/some_resources_for_starting_your_own_kickstarter/) which has some handy links for further advice on how to best run a Kickstarter even if you already have experience under your belt.
