  I'm really worried about Puar. Some bad things are going to happen there.
  ```

  - u/crivtox:
    ```
    I would be worried for everyone else, transformation powers seem to be really op .
    ```

    - u/SkyTroupe:
      ```
      I really hope there are some hard limitations to this ability otherwise it's just too strong.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        There are some, but one I can disclose because it's canon: the transformed entity can't be stronger than the original. So basically he can't become, say, a tank and roll through the walls of a house because he wouldn't be able to output that level of power.
        ```

        - u/crivtox:
          ```
          Would transformed entity explode if it turned into a pile of uranium 235?.
          ```

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            I'm going into this more in detail in chapter 15, but as a general rule he has to keep his own integrity. It's not dissimilar from animagus or other transmutations in HPMOR, though with a bit more tolerance re: changes undergone while transmuted. Liquids, gases, explosives are pretty much a no-go. He could go nuclear if he thought of it but it'd be a last-ditch suicidal attack. Also he retains sentience, but his abilities are otherwise connected to the item he transformed into. If it doesn't have locomotion means, it can't move. If it doesn't have any way to produce sound, it can't speak.
            ```

            - u/MilesSand:
              ```
              Why can it speak like a human when transformed into a dog though? Is there some sub-transformation that gives the dog more complex vocal chords and jaw shape to be able to produce speech?
              ```

              - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                ```
                I mean, he certainly *could* do that in theory. I was more thinking of it as being part of the "magic" package, but in that case I guess I should make him able to speak as an inanimate object as well, via the same effect.
                ```

            - u/crivtox:

              Interesting.
              Not sure if you want to reveal all of the details, but if you don't mind  I'm curious.

              What if the device can perform computation(I asume he doesn't know enough of the computer to do other things)can he do stuff like having an integrated calculator and doing complex  math on his head?
              Or at least have a working computer.

              Can he turn into things that don't exist yet if bulma gives him schematics ?

              Can he turn into things that use external power , like for example could he turn into a railgun and shoot if he was connected ?

              Can he turn into things that need electricity plus a generator?
              ```

              - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                ```
                Ok, keeping in mind that this is an *incredibly* munchkin-able ability I would never have thought even including in the story if it wasn't canon, and in fact I have tried nerfing a bit because it's ridiculously OP to begin with - so I really hope what I do with it will feel reasonably satisfying and not too plot-convenient, or that I won't miss any obvious exploits. I'll put this under spoilers:

                [Question 1](#s " In theory, yes. He did turn into a laptop. However I'd say in order to do something complicated he'd need to know and understand how, and he can't really do that unless he studies the old way.")

                [Question 2](#s " Yes, and he can come up with his own ideas. He needs a clear enough mental image, it doesn't matter if the thing actually exists.")

                [Question 3](#s " My take on this is: yes, but it puts a strain on his body. So if he tries to channel too much more power than he could exert on his own he still ends fucked up.")

                [Question 4](#s " Yes, but see above, same argument applies.")
                ```

                - u/crivtox:
                  ```
                  I think you are doing fine.
                  You definitely don't have to consider all the crazy exploits the subredit's combined mental power could think of , only the obvious ones plus some non obvious ones that Puar might think of.
                  Energy limits tends to prevent  a lot of exploits(mostly because its crazy to ignore conservation of energy on the first place, even if most magic systems do).


                  Though just one thing , can puar loose small bits of himself when transformed and be fine?
                  I mean dong it repeatedly might kill him , y and the parts might revert whith him when he untransforms.


                  But maybe he can make self replicating nanotech(well I mean technically turning into a plant whith seeds and then planting them is creating self replicating nanotech, or even turning into something plus a few bioengeniered bacteria)
                  ```

                  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                    ```
                    I'd say there's a rough mapping from transformed to normal body, so if he loses a small bit, he might find himself without a finger. Self replicating nanotech wouldn't be a "single" part in any sense of the word so it's a no go. He could become a single nanomachine able to replicate itself from surrounding matter, but without a design to take inspiration from that probably still exceeds his mental abilities.
                    ```

  - u/Walloping:
    ```
    He's clearly yandere for Yamcha.
    ```

- u/PurposefulZephyr:
  ```
  I like Yamcha.  
  He's awkward but sociable- well visible from his talk with Goku and recognition of the fight that was about to start.  
  Also well aware and concerned with (social) situation around him- like the sleeping quarters and other questions.

  Puar worries me. Power and knowledge will only fuel one another. Possibly one of main villains of this arc?
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Yeah, that's what I was going for with him. He's a bit of a dork and a cheat, but ultimately a loveable rogue! Puar... well...
    ```

- u/SimoneNonvelodico:
  ```
  New chapter! My beta reader made me notice that perhaps this part is a bit slow, which matches quite nicely with my own going a bit slow while writing it. It should pick up in a couple chapters, and hopefully I'll manage to write those fast enough that I can speed up the pace of posting.
  ```

  - u/Slinkinator:
    ```
    Your slow stuff is still fun.  Thanks for writing.
    ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    Are you Aussie btw? Sydney?
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Nah. I live in the UK, but I'm not mothertongue. Some weird English expression I used?
      ```

      - u/ProfessorPhi:
        ```
        Luna Park. it's a famous theme park in Australia. It was closed for many years, brought back and it's been going strong. Has prime real estate which probably helps
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Ouch! My inner Italian slipped there. For some reason, we say "Luna Park" just to say any kind of amusement park. It happens that I inadvertently use English expressions that are common in Italian *even when they don't actually mean the same thing in English*.
          ```

          - u/ProfessorPhi:
            ```
            Additional note after some googling, it looks Luna park was a common term used in the early 20th century. Apparently Coney Island had one too, and Australia had 3, however the Sydney one appears to be the only one still in operation.

            Also, I didn't mind the language slip at all, I'd have never guessed you weren't a non native speaker or Italian from what you've written so far!
            ```

          - u/ProfessorPhi:
            ```
            Huh, I roomed with an Italian while In the US and he never let the phrase slip when we went to six flags. And he could barely speak English. 

            Makes sense, Australia has a strong Italian diaspora and the founding of Luna park could easily have been from an Italian immigrant.
            ```

      - u/xartab:
        ```
        Italian? [My man!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpcmfjFN8OI&ab_channel=JohnSmith)
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Italian indeed :D.
          ```

  Prediction: >!That gym that is completely decoupled from the outside computer network is going to be mighty handy when Puar/Caroline goes berserk.!<
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Something's wrong in that spoiler tag.
    ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      Hmm, it looked like it worked on my end. I was using the old mouseover spoilers because I was on mobile, I changed them to the fancy new click to view spoilers now.

    He was 12, and yeah, same age, though now some time has passed and he's going for 13. He thought he was 14 though at the time (understandably, he didn't have a big grasp of time living as a hermit on the mountains).

        He didn't spend one year looking for the Dragon Balls, that was just a few days. Then a few months before the Tournament. Actually going to retcon that because in canon Toriyama didn't properly account for a whole year before the time Pilaf summons the dragon and when Goku goes chasing after the balls and butts head with Red Ribbon.
