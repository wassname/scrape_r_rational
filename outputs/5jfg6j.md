  My thoughts are that this doesn't belong in a fiction subreddit.

  I'm not sure what point the article is trying to make. Putting ideas in categories is a heuristic; saying that a heuristic can usually help you process reality, but sometimes leads you to make mistakes is a bit of a tautology.

  Also, I'm hyper-super-really wary of "Here's a cognitive bias I found, it explains why these types of opinion are wrong" types of reasoning. It's really easy to see any given cognitive bias everywhere, even when you're not trying to prove someone wrong and legitimately trying to understand people.

  r/rational is a subreddit devoted to the discussion of works of rational and rationalist fiction. This means that nonfiction work like this does not belong here. However, there are other subreddits that some of our users frequent that would be a pretty good place. I know that r/lesswrong exists, and I believe that there is a community at r/slatestarcodex that is into rationality (though make sure to read their rules before you post; it's a subreddit related to someone's blog). I hope this helps!
