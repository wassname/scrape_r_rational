  Phew, this is tough.

  So, after the last thread and a number of PM and discord conversations, I spent over a month trying to figure out the right way to further improve this story and drive reader retention. I did find a lot of superficial problems that absolutely warranted fixing, which I mostly recount at the top of the RR post (although not really how I've been trying to improve my writing style, I am currently at war with my awful impulse to use em dashes every five seconds), but the more I thought about what makes serials compelling and drives interest, the more I realized it was probably fundamentally untenable to capture that in this story without scrapping the entire thing and starting over.

  I think the best way for a new serial to be entertaining to someone coming in with low-investment is to immediately place the protagonist in a situation of distress or tension,and focus the early arcs around the release of that tension. When a story isn't viewed with inherent charity, it needs to rely on being addictive, and the best way to cultivate addiction is to evoke a strong emotional response and drive the reader to seek catharsis for it. Worm, for instance, opens with Taylor being bullied, and the sense of anger that invokes in the reader pushes people to keep reading in pursuit of relief for that anger, and by the time that element is no longer important, they care for other reasons. You see this in most of the big stories, with the variations being giving that catharsis quickly and becoming more of a power fantasy, denying it to pull people forward, or some combination of the two.

  Less important but still significant are having a story that has fast pacing and/or a lot of action, and the use of narrative signalling to invoke associations with things the reader already likes. Fanfic does the latter is an open way, while stuff like litrpgs are a little more subtle, tapping into the associations the reader has with video games and JRPGS specifically. (This is without going into the specifics of the appeal of gamelit, which is a whole thing in of itself.)

  Unfortunately, because of the way I constructed the worldbuilding and mystery of this story, its impossible to really retroactively change it to tap into any of these points of appeal. Without saying too much, the scenario necessitates that the reader go in with their knowledge of the protagonist deliberately curtailed, which means the core "tension" afflicting her isn't revealed right off the bat. In addition, the setting - the 3 day trip to the conclave - is so structured and contained, with clues _needing_ to be dropped at specific  points for the narrative to function dramatically, that it's very difficult to jump around or cut large sections to increase the pacing. 

  The only way to really do it would probably be to kill the whole story in its current incarnation, and then restart it in such a way that the first arc wouldn't attempt to be a solvable mystery, but rather just a set of action and intrigue setpieces, probably starting in media res. I considered that for a bit, but the drafts I did were much less satisfying to me, not to mention it felt shitty considering I've already got readers invested.

  That leaves only fairly minor changes to the plot and structure, for which I got a whole bunch of conflicting feedback on what people liked and what they didn't, which I've tried to wrangle into something coherent. Lemme know what you think on that front, especially regarding changes to the exposition and pacing! I don't really know if it's possible to turn this into something popular, but I'm gonna keep trying anyway.

  Anyway, re: this chapter specifically. This is probably the last exposition-dense chapter, and the point in which the setting, one element aside, will have pretty much finished coming into focus. Hopefully people enjoy it despite it not being very exciting.

  edit: lmao put the thread tags in the wrong place, I'm dumb

    If it helps at all, I see this story as an Umineko of sorts, if you know what that is, by which I mean the beginning is really well-written and interesting in its own right but by nature of the story not what piqued my interest since it's a time loop mystery and needs a lot of time to set up base. I'm kinda floundering on how to explain this but essentially I've been really liking how the start has been going and hope you don't feel too discouraged by low reader retention. We've been given a lot of good insight into the characters and setting, so now it's just a matter of slowly dissecting the bits of mystery to come.

    Aside from that, have you considered posting this to a writing forum like spacebattles or sufficientvelocity? Generally original works don't do as well as fanfiction, but as a mystery story you might find better luck since people will feel more willing to discuss plot and such with other forum members.

      That's an immensely flattering comparison, thank you!

      I didn't know they let you just cross-post stuff from elsewhere as original fiction. It could be a good idea, but I'm not really familiar enough with the culture of those sites to know how it might be received, since it doesn't really open with the mystery right out of the gate. I think the stereotype is that they prefer more action-y, snappier stuff?

  Hi, Outspan Foster here. Glad to see someone actively working on their craft. I highly suggest you read Techniques of the Selling Writer by Dwight V. Swain.

  Also, the most bang-for-your-buck fix would be to cut down your wordcount by at least 20 percent. Simplify the language, and you'll see how much easier it is to read. Clarity comes before entertainment.

    I've cut down the wordcount several times on the earlier chapters since they're the most important, but- 

    a) I'm not sure wordcount is as much of a concern to the web serial market, since most of the biggest hits on royalroad are all absurdly indulgent with it, and,

    b) Cutting it down takes time, and part of what I'm trying to do writing this serial is find a sustainable standard of quality that I can marry with a quick release schedule. A thing I run into a lot is when I want to have some exposition, or portray a complicated emotional response from a character, I can either spend about 5-10 minutes trying to think about how to do it very gracefully and quickly, or do it crudely in about 30 seconds. More often than not, the latter ends up winning just out of mercenary need. It's a bit different to writing a novel.

    I appreciate your advice, though! I'll check that book out.

  Can I push back a little against some of the changes, like I liked the biographies, and..this story feels way more, um..constructed, it's trying to grab the reader, but ultimately I find it much less compelling than the Garden Where only Names Grow. 

  And given how unpopular that was I guess my tastes are in the solid minority, but 6 chapters into that and there were 3 or 4 different plot threads I was desperate to just talk about someone with, and even more curious about what you were doing with the structure of the work. There were mysteries in the sense of things I could really wrestle with. Where with this story I want to read the next chapter, I want to find out what happens next, but there's nothing I ache to know about, its just a good story.  


  Sorry, I am probably being too harsh. I just miss Garden I guess.

    I definitely understand finding the story less engaging from a mystery perspective from the start, which is one of the major flaws I think it has relative to the previous stuff I've tried to do. One of the most consistent pieces of negative feedback about that prior story was that it was too overwhelming or confusing - too much worldbuilding, character building, and meta-elements packed into too dense a space that it made it impossible to get into.

    The structure of this story was definitely in part a reaction to that. I thought people would be more willing to tolerate something complicated if it was more slow and deliberate in constructing the scenario. The response to it has been much more positive broadly, but I do think I probably overcompensated. It would have been much better for the story if it were structured in such a way that gave people clear mysteries to sink their teeth into from the start, just without being as "busy" as Where Only Names Grow.

    I also feel a bit sad about dropping the meta-presentational stuff in both stories, though it's hard to overstate how often people complained about them. 

    Anyway, I'm sorry to hear you're disappointed. I'm still trying to figure out what to do with this project in response to people's feedback, so we'll see what happens, I guess.
