## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I would like a story featuring dueling geniuses where the good character follows best practices for dealing with psychopathic narcissists. These would include not fighting them head on, walking away from battles that can't be won, working with a team, avoiding the temptation to outsmart them at their own game, being patient, pretending to be a boring and featureless grey rock, etc. 

  The model of What Someone Should Do when confronted with a psychopath promoted by stories like Death Note and Sherlock Holmes is very entertaining, but spectacularly incorrect. It often involves heroic martyr plays, manipulating the adversary's attention, betting on the innate goodness of mankind, Columboing the villain into admitting their misdeeds, and other feel-good strategies that sell well to audiences but aren't necessarily well founded. A rational strategy might be something like writing one anonymous email or slipping additional funding to internal affairs agencies and then moving on to more tractable cause areas.

    The protagonist of Lord of the Mysteries does this a lot actually. He frequently directs the various Churches and other governmental agencies at his enemies, works with teams, is patient, and pretends to be a boring and featureless gray person(sorry, he can't do rocks).

    The story is pretty good otherwise as well. It's a chinese webnovel that runs up to like 3 million words, but it was really good and a breath of fresh air for someone who has been reading a bunch of translated webnovels and getting tired of face-slapping, xianxia, and other tropes in the area. I'd even recommend it to people who haven't read translated webnovels before. It's best to read it on the NovelReader app, you can find the APK file online pretty easily.

    This sounds like a very interesting premise to read about.  EmeraldAshes on AO3 has some Twilight one-shots that use logical thinking as a source of humour:

      There's a fun part in *Feet of Clay* with a conspiracy to take control of Ankh-Morpork by installing a king. They've carefully traced lineages, some of which may even have been real, and found that the Rightful Heir is a city guardsman named Mr. Nobbs. He isn't very bright, which initially makes them think that he'd be easy to manipulate.

      > “King?” Nobby coughed, and then they had to slap him on the back until he got his breath again. “King?” he wheezed. “And have Mr. Vimes cut me head off?”

      > “All the brandy you can drink, my lord,” said a wheedling voice.

      > “’S no good if you ain’t got a throat for it to go down!”

      > “What’re you talking about?”

      > “Mr. Vimes’d go spare! He’d go *spare!*”

      > “Good heavens, man—”

      > “My lord,” someone corrected.

      > “My lord, I mean—when you’re *king* you can tell that wretched Sir Samuel what to do. You’ll be, as you would call it, ‘the boss.’ You could—”

      > “Tell ole Stoneface what to do?” said Nobby.

      > “That’s right!”

      > “I’d be a king and tell ole Stoneface what to do?” said Nobby.

      > “Yes!”

      > Nobby stared into the smoky gloom.

      > “He’d *go spare!*”

      > “Listen, you silly little man—”

      > “*My lord—*”

      > “You silly little lord, you’d be able to have him executed if you wished!”

      > “I couldn’t do that!”

      > “Why not?”

      > “He’d go spare!”

      > “The man calls himself an officer of the law, and whose law does he listen to, eh? Where does his law come from?”

      > “I don’t know!” groaned Nobby. “He says it comes up through his boots!” He looked around. The shadows in the smoke seemed to be closing in.

      > “I can’t be king! Ole Vimes’d go spare!”

      > “*Will you stop saying that!*”

      > Nobby pulled at his collar.

      > “’S a bit hot and smoky in here,” he mumbled. “Which way’s the window?”

      > “Over there—”

      > The chair rocked. Nobby hit the glass helmet-first, landed on top of a waiting carriage, bounced off and ran into the night, trying to escape destiny in general and axes in particular.

      >But I'm having trouble remembering any long stories where characters outsmart "geniuses" by doing the inteligent thing and not getting involved

      Well, duh. This something of a "narrative paradox" where the most sensible actions don't make for compelling storytelling, and thus don't get written about. This is probably why you're only able to think of snippets, because there's no story to write beyond the meme moment snippets that are only possible with fandoms (established settings) and a reader base who "get the joke". 

      One recent story I can remember where the protagonist directly running away from the plot *is* the primary plot might be *Paranoid Mage* (this is not a recommendation). In fact, this element is what I believe to be the key weakness of the story, because the author needs to balance an actual story happening with the protagonist wanting (indirectly) as little "story" to happen as possible. 

      The only thing I can think of that is even tangentially similar is one of the subplots in *Project Haul Mary* where, minor spoilers, >!the protagonist gradually regains his memories and learns he was volun-told and forced onto an interstellar suicide mission because he didn't have the balls to actually volunteer for it.!< I think it works though, and it's a great bit of character intrigue and growth. I highly recommend this book.

        I think it would make a great frame for a story about Mycroft Holmes' approach to crime mitigation. The drama can come from Sherlock's antics ruining Mycroft's plans.

    ```
    The Gods are Bastards has... a lot going on, but one of the fairly long-running plot lines is specifically about dealing with a psychopath in a position of power. At least *some* of the things that various characters consider doing about this are reasonable and not particularly fiction-inspired. 

    That being said, it is also a story where many characters are trying to figure out what ways of achieving their goals are reasonable, and often get it badly wrong the first or second or third time. This is reasonably realistic, but far from the dueling-genius fantasy, and also faces the usual problem that it's hard for the characters to be smarter than the author.

  Courtship Rite by Donald Kingsbury is about a postapocalyptic tribe of polyamorous cannibalistic babyeating geneticists who assign political status and breeding rights based on people's ability to make successful preregistered predictions. They can also influence the predictions into coming true. I'm halfway through it so far and it's very good. Probably falls in the climate fiction genre, similar to Dune in some ways.
  ```

  - u/bestgreatestsuper:
    ```
    Done. This is a 10/10 and one of my favorite books now. It takes the creepy breeding stuff in Dune and does it in a much more compelling and detailed way.

    The story is fundamentally about competing models for how society should be organized and which traits Social Darwinists should select for on a viciously hostile planet devoid of almost all edible life and no non-human animals except inedible monster bugs, with different groups having different answers to those questions and different internal factions and individuals having their own personal heresies and goals. All the groups are eugenicists of some sort. Each group has competing religious and historical views to complement their cultures. 

    The author seems familiar with ideas from optimization, economics, and mechanism design, and it's very fun puzzling out the labyrinthian cultural rules on who should eat who and when from passing references to different festivals and rituals and trials across the different tribes.

    My biggest complaint is that I think the author could have investigated more interesting failure modes of Social Darwinism than he did. It's presented as horrifyingly ruthless and sometimes neglectful of the benefits of cooperation for group fitness, but I would have liked to have seen instances where tribes accidentally selected for something that they didn't want, where conditions changed so that qualities that were once adaptive became liabilities, or where the ratio of traits in a population should have been optimized for rather than the individual fitness of each person. There's a bit of an inconsistency in how the author rightly considers complications when evaluating centralized planning in economics but comes across as very confident in the ability of future scientists to execute it in genetic domains. I think that to a large degree the lack of insightful negative commentary is meant to reflect the biases of the characters we're observing, though. They don't come from a culture where making these observations would be easy.

  Does anyone have any recommendations for good, high quality System Apocalypse stories? 

  Here's what I've already read/am reading and would consider relatively higher quality, and recommend myself:


  [The Scourged Earth](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18186/the-scourged-earth), Probably the highest quality SysApoc story I've seen, but it's been on Hiatus for 4 years and is almost certainly dead.


  [Apocalypse Parenting](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47434/apocalypse-parenting) and it's companion story [Engineer's Oddessy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/74261/engineers-odyssey). It's about a mother of 3 whose husband is away for a business trip and having to deal with the fallout of all electronics and combustibles being destroyed on top of the whole Alien System business, while also needing to care for, and also enlist the assistance of her three children. It's great and I would argue relatively rational in that the characters tend to act thoughtfully.


  Lastly, while [The Jungles of Alabama](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/62643/the-jungles-of-alabama) has a lot of smut involved, it's still a very interesting take on the genre, and warrants a read if it ever resumes.


  There's also Alexander Wale's upcoming SysApoc story called Doomsday Pivot, and I'm eager to read that based off of the early draft he showed off for feedback.
  ```

  - u/ReproachfulWombat:
    ```
    I would like to note what while The Jungles of Alabama is a decent (if fetish-heavy) read, the author's politics and stance on social issues are... *very* evident throughout the work. A lot of bashing 'idiot lefties' who are portrayed as soft, weak and unprepared for the 'real world' and justifying why women are happy being controlled by big, strong men. That kind of thing. I still enjoyed it, but it's worth noting.
    ```

    - u/WilyCoyotee:
      ```
      Yeah the politics interjections are certainly something that add little if anything to the reading experience. 
      As far as the women wanting strong men thing, I just mentally bundled that with the mind control fetish subplot(s).

      The zero day prepping and ability exploration were the main draws for me, as well as watching to see how the system would try and adapt to humans having copious amounts of very lethal firearms.
      ```

      - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
        ```
        Guns as a cheat skill in sysapoc is a pet peve of mine. I want to read about the RPG world, not about characters bypassing it.

        There's plenty of RPGs where swords, guns, bows, spells, etc all have competitive balance. Most famously: Final Fantasy 7. I'd be fine if stories went that route.

        I would like to recommend Double Blind, but can't quite do so. It has some good bits, but the pace of it seems like Wildbow's Pact. Way too much happens in such a short period of time that it broke my suspension of disbelief.

    Would you also enjoy manga/manhwa/webtoon recommendations? If so, I highly recommend [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint](https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/omniscient-reader/list?title_no=2154).

    The starting premise is that the main character had just finished reading the final chapter of his favorite system apocalypse webnovel when the events of the story suddenly start to take place in reality around him. He is the only person in the world who has read the novel all the way to its end, so his knowledge of the setting and characters helps him survive the carnage that comes.

    I like Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint because it has great art, well written character development, interesting worldbuilding, and a fast paced story which maintains believable suspense despite the main character's foreknowledge. Compared to many other stories which feature foreknowledge, I thought it was a breath of fresh air that the MC in ORV adapts to the rapidly changing world around him rather than relying on events and people to remain the same as before. I also like that the story gently pokes fun at common tropes in other system apocalypse stories (such as returnees, reincarnators, main character traits, etc.)

  {Not really a standard recommendation post, but I wasn't sure where to put it so I'm sticking it here. Let me know if it should go elsewhere.}

  I've realized recently that a good UI and UX can make reading something much more pleasant and easy for me.

  As a result I'm looking for websites, apps, extensions, whatever that have made your reading/watching/consuming experiences easier and more pleasant. Also just hand over what  you use in general, maybe you've just always been using the best stuff.

  Tools I use below ↓  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  Personally, I mostly read standard webnovels wherever I find them(i.e. [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net), [archiveofourown.org](https://archiveofourown.org), [royalroad.com](https://royalroad.com)), although RoyalRoad has a nice UI and makes tracking and following webnovels easy. 

  Translated webnovels get read on NovelReader now, unless they're not on there, in which case I settle for whatever website I can find them on. NovelReader is a mobile app for reading translated webnovels. It makes the novels much easier to read and there's a bunch of good translations there. I downloaded the APK file onto my android phone from this website: [https://apkaio.com/app/ns.free.light.novel.reader](https://apkaio.com/app/ns.free.light.novel.reader) 

  I read books on Google Play Books on my android phone or just as PDFs on my laptop. (I'm generally ambivalent between them). Sourced through z-library as necessary(check out r/zlibrary for how to access the legit version of the website). Paper books are better but I usually get them from the library and waiting, picking up and returning is a pain. Plus some simply aren't available in paper form.

  I read manga on [mangadex.org](https://mangadex.org), although it's not that great with vertically scrolling manwha and sometimes has loading issues. In those cases I read at [mangabuddy.com](https://mangabuddy.com), which is much better for manwha and has no loading issues, but doesn't have the full screen and nice UI that mangadex gives. Other manga not on both sites is read on whatever site I can find. I definitely prefer to read manga on my laptop than my phone, the better resolution and bigger picture makes reading the sometimes tiny text easier, and reveals some overlooked details. I have yet to try reading manga in paper form, as most of the manga I want to read is not in the library.

  I pretty much use whatever anime site I've recently heard of, [aniwave.to](https://aniwave.to)(previously 9anime) and [zorox.to](https://zorox.to) are ok. MAL is the main aggregator but I don't really use it to track my anime, I just do it by hand in a Google Doc.

  Haven't actually watched much film recently, apart from a couple movies in theatres. 

  I use Steam for games, and a gaming laptop for gaming. I know gaming laptops are bad. I experience it whenever I'm gaming. Steam is good for being pretty much as unobtrusive as possible, while still allowing all the functionality I'd want in a platform like it. Of course its main draw is being a marketplace for PC games and having a lot of them, but I think the UI and UX are nice too.  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

    I actually think a gaming laptop is pretty great! It's something like the cheapest and most convenient way to play the vast majority of games. Consoles seem like they could have much nicer ergonomics, but I haven't used them much and my poor-person mentality balks at the thought.

    If you're on this subreddit, I'd try audiobooks of e.g. progression fantasy. Much different experience for me.

    Apple devices feel much nicer to me as well. FaceTime is very noticeably the best videocall service by far.

    I noticed a thing with manga recently where the translations I'm reading just seem really choppy. Like, sorta incoherent. Maybe I'm noticing it more, or maybe translation quality varies considerably.

    I would try using an external monitor if you haven't yet. A huge screen can be super nice. I wonder if you could use a vertical monitor to read manga?

    For reading books you might also try getting some very lightweight kindle. Could pair with extreme blue-blockers for night time reading.

    I use [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/TachiyomiJ2K/) for manga on mobile, and [Cover](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/cover-comic-reader/9WZDNCRFJ9W7?hl=en-US) on my laptop for big-screen manga. For the latter, [Hakuneko](https://hakuneko.download/docs/install/) is a usable downloading solution.

    All anime is found on `https://<noise a cat makes in japanese>.<spanish for yes>`. I prefer [MPV](https://mpv.io/) to the ubiquitous VLC for playing videos because it's always quicker with weird codecs and using only keyboard shortcuts makes me feel l33t.

    I convert basically all of my webfiction to a .epub one way or another, and read on [Lithium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faultexception.reader) on mobile, Kindle, or Calibre on desktop.

    For games I absolutely adore my steamdeck, which just had a price drop for the base model with the new OLED release, but if you already have a setup you like that's fine. Just get a[ laptop stand](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G84P8ZX) for airflow for the poor thing if you haven't.

      Out of curiosity why? I've never heard anyone being happy about a gaming laptop and my own experience was severe heat issues, resulting in massively reduced performance before it died and I had nothing. Having a tower instead has allowed me to replace parts piecemeal over time when the upgrade makes sense.

      Also cost wise, it's been less than half the price of a gaming laptop, though the GPU costs are stupid nowadays. I'd probably go console over a gaming laptop tbh.
      ```

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        Well, first I'd like to clarify slightly: when I say 'gaming' laptop, I don't mean xXx\_GAMING\_LAPTOP\_xXx that's completely bedazzled with RGB and looks like a spaceship but rather simply a high-performance laptop, where gaming is one of the major use cases. 

        That said, I think there are lots of pros in a gaming laptop that make it competitive with a tower, on the whole, leaving it not better nor worse off. 

        First, you write:

        \>Also cost wise, it's been less than half the price of a gaming laptop

        I don't really think so. Yes, gaming laptops have a more expensive sticker price compared to a desktop or even a console, but unlike these options, a gaming laptop is a complete system. Most desktop build guides only spec out their price list for the desktop itself and leave out peripherals or other critical components such as monitors, keyboards, webcams, microphones, speakers, windows licenses, etc. 

        If someone who has nothing wants a system and is willing to go through the risk of building one themselves, sure, you can spec out a pretty great machine for around $1k, but, until you bring it into an actually usable state, you're probably gonna need to slap another 25% to 50% onto it. This brings it close to gaming laptop prices of reasonably similar performance. 

        Same argument goes for consoles, but to a lesser degree. If someone has nothing, and wants to play games with a console, they're also gonna need to drop some dough for a TV/monitor to play on. Beyond that, games are also much more expensive on console, there are often fees for using multiplayer functionality, and you're locked out of more experimental or indie titles and modding. 

        \>my own experience was severe heat issues, resulting in massively reduced performance 

        This sounds more like just a general quality issue, which, granted the gaming laptop space is rife with. There are lots of companies that cut corners and such, and by the time problems show up, you can't return it or retroactively change your mind.

        That said, I'm on my second gaming laptop after the first one served me faithfully for seven years. It still works too, however the GTX 670 inside simply isn't able to keep up with modern uses anymore, so I upgraded, and my current one is running a RTX 3070 which is plenty powerful enough to let me comfortably run basically everything including PCVR on my Index (although the fan really does move a lot of air when I'm doing this). 

        \>Out of curiosity why?

        Again, this is probably a lifestyle thing, but I'm a very mobile person. I move every three to six months, or I'll spend parts of the week not at home. While my gaming laptop is too thick and the battery too poor to really use it "on the go" beyond checking email or whatever, being able to just take it with me is very practical.

        This is also especially true for VR. Often, I don't want the play area to be in the same place as my desk, and with the laptop, I can just take it there easily. For a while, I had the VR setup in a Barn, and then whenever I wanted to play there, I could just take my laptop, plug it in, and I was ready to go. 

        Then there's the productivity aspect. I do a lot of CAD work and a bit of 3d rendering work, and being able to take this with me is very nice. If I want to show someone a model or take it with me to a machine shop / fab center, I can just do that and it's no problem at all.

      Gaming laptops end up with you paying double the price for half the performance. If you *require* their portability then that's fine if you want to make that tradeoff, but in my experience most people who have gaming laptops almost exclusively use them in one spot anyway, so they'd be better served getting a desktop.

        I don't know about "half the performance". Especially graphics have made great gains in closing the gap ever since the release of the Nvidia 30xx series of graphics cards, with the mobile ones lagging behind, yes, but not to a crazy degree. Also, gaming laptops prices are competitive with towers, especially considering that many PC build guides are not complete as they skip out on monitors, keyboards, webcams, speakers, mics, windows licenses, etc. By the time you end up with a platform you can actually use with all the peripherals, the price discrepancy isn't that extreme. 

        Also for many people, buying prebuilt (laptop or tower) just saves a lot of hassle and while it's true that most gaming laptops don't move around a lot, the flexibility to do so can be very nice. 

        For example, I occasionally want to play PCVR inside a barn so that I can have a massive and unrestricted indoor 5m × 5m play space, and all I need to do is pick up my laptop and the cable (along with the Index + perpherals) and go. It's super easy and possible to move my entire setup in one trip. 

        Another big use case is productivity. CAD or other 3d software is useful when you can take it with you and show people.

          >I don't know about "half the performance". Especially graphics have made great gains in closing the gap ever since the release of the Nvidia 30xx series of graphics cards, with the mobile ones lagging behind, yes, but not to a crazy degree

          That's fair, my statement was hyperbolic. It's not twice the price for half the performance, but it is unarguably paying more for less performance. 

          >By the time you end up with a platform you can actually use with all the peripherals, the price discrepancy isn't that extreme

          Even today, you'd be looking at \~$600 more in the end for a worse setup (limited to only one monitor, you only get the keyboard they provide, worse GPU, difficult or impossible to upgrade, etc). If the convenience of not having to separately buy a monitor is worth $600 to you, then who am I to complain? Spend your money how you want. 

          >Also for many people, buying prebuilt (laptop or tower) just saves a lot of hassle

          Not sure you get to claim the hassle saved from buying prebuilt towers as a benefit that laptops have. Buying prebuilt *does* save hassle, but both sides can claim that so it's not really a point in either side's favor. 

          >Another big use case is productivity. CAD or other 3d software is useful when you can take it with you and show people.  


          Sure. Like I said, if you *require* it, then there's no problem. Purchase what you need, it'd be ridiculous to buy a tool that can't solve the task you require it for. 

          That is a completely separate issue, however, from spending $2000 on some Alienware laptop which has the same performance as a $1200 desktop. Even assuming you have no peripherals and thus must buy everything, you're still saving hundreds in the end. To make the price discrepancy even worse, a few years down the line when you're looking to upgrade, you can just buy a new GPU for $400 if you want, while for most laptops the only feasible option is to buy an entire new laptop. 

          Perhaps the disagreement comes down to the terms used. A "gaming laptop" to me is not simply a laptop that can play video games (I'd be shocked if you could even find a laptop sold today which cannot play Doom), but rather it is a laptop made for and marketed to "gamers" and is generally overpriced but hyped up by a fanbase which is zealously defensive towards their brand of choice. For that reason, "gaming laptops" are not recommended for the same reason as "gaming chairs": there are products out there that charge less for a better experience, those other products just don't have a Doritos promo.

  Kind of a weird request but I figure this is the best thread to ask in. Are there any resources dedicated to helping write plots/narratives? I GM for an RPG group and while I know what I’m doing when it comes to rules, locations, worldbuilding, etc, I struggle with coming up with a cohesive plot/narrative that keeps my players engaged. 

  Even if it’s not related to running a game, I would appreciate some advice on how to really start writing a plot/narrative/adventure.

  Besides that, I’ve been reading some of the Royal Road writathon submissions, and whatever the app recommends, and there’s some good stuff. I’m going to wait until next week to actually give out recommendations, because nothing I’ve read has been particularly rational, but there are some unpolished gems that I’ve enjoyed.

    I like Brennan Lee Mulligan's advice on Youtube. He has a Q&A and various interviews. The most interesting claim he makes is that the worldbuilding you should do is a function of a story's theme. If you want a comedic story, then a key plot point or feature in the setting can be based on a lame pun. If you're setting up a JK Rowling style fantasy with lots of oneoff items and creatures. you don't worry about the soundness of the political structure or establishing coherent dates and times for global events or niche interactions between different systems in the world. If there's one mechanic that explains all magic in your setting, its behavior should be more rules based and predictable. The world and plot's consistency is measured in terms of consistency with the style and morals of the story you're telling, not in strictly logical scientific terms for all settings.

    I remember that he emphasizes the importance of connecting the plot to character backstories and motivations. Something about "wow, you gave me a twenty page document filled with info I can use to get your character to do exactly what I need them to do? Thank you so much!"

    I think the discussion starting at 20:00 in this video is great: https://youtu.be/RKM_7E1H1MA?si=jgLD30ouhutJiXYy

    Good narratives for a TTRPG are a bit different to traditional narratives. I would suggest The Alexandrian's GM advice, especially [Don't Prep Plots](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/4147/roleplaying-games/dont-prep-plots) and [Node Based Design.](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach)
    ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      These are basically the opposite, though. Nothing against The Alexandrian, and I think his opinion is worth reading, but if you want to direct your game towards a narrative, an article that tells you to avoid doing that from someone who runs a very different kind of game is not a big help.
      ```

      - u/grekhaus:
        ```
        Disagree.

        "Don't Prep Plots" isn't telling people "Don't Have a Narrative", it's explaining a set of common pitfalls that come from trying to script the plot an RPG session like a you would a book or a movie. It then shows how you can avoid those pitfalls by structuring your prep in a way that more gracefully accommodates the player characters going 'off script' when they engage with the narrative provided. Doing that is an IMO essential requirement to having an engaging adventure.

        It also gets into what the Alexandrian calls the "Three Clue Rule" which, while it's phrased as a prescription (always include at least three clues pointing to any conclusion the narrative needs the PCs to make), works just as well as a descriptive observation: if you want the narrative to go a certain direction, you need three independent arrows telling the PCs to go that way, so that when the players come into contact with the Plot, they'll end up running into at least one of the arrows and follow it to the correct destination.
        ```

        - u/Revlar:
          ```
          You might be right. I've read these before, but my most recent contact with "Don't prep plots" was a youtuber's video in which they preached a more extreme version (abandon the responsibility of the GM as storyteller entirely) and recommended the post as a source, so that might've colored my memory.
