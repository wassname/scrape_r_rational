  I'm actually really surprised that no one else has recommended this since it's a classic. It's a deconstruction of romantic ideals of medieval society common in novels at the time, as well as a deconstruction of modern society at that time. It also has some rational elements that I think people here would find interesting, though it's been a long time since I read it so I don't recall exactly how rational it was. I included the project Gutenberg link because it has pictures but here's a link without pictures: http://www.literature.org/authors/twain-mark/connecticut/ . Also, this book is in a similar style, though I haven't read it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lest_Darkness_Fall.

  They also made a movie based on this starring Bing Crosby. Less about modernizing medieval England and more about jazzing it up, perhaps.
