  This is a story I have been writing to help keep myself sane during physical distancing. Blurb:

  > An abandoned steampunk arms factory, in the middle of a conflict torn former state of the Empire it served, gains a soul. This transforms it into a Lord, capable of turning land into power. Beset by enemies on all sides it must figure out how to win the war its creators lost a century ago.
  >
  > This is a progressive Dungeon Core novel (which is to say the core will progress and expand in scale, eventually) across multiple dimensions with different characteristics (e.g. steampunk, magic, mythological). It has rationalist leanings (paragraphs of reasoning) and litrpg leanings (there are stat blocks). The core game mechanical idea is something like "what if different flavors of magic power actually did come from controlling land" and then the story is: "what if there was a flavorless ~~artifact deck~~ dungeon core".

  Like I said in my first post if there was a community I had written this story for it would be this one (not that I claim to be any good as a rational fiction writer). Below are my notes which might go a bit too far in making the subtext into text.

  This is the sequence of chapters in which I show how I plan to keep an AI protagonist interesting (the answer will surprise you... but probably not). It's one of the reasons I have written the AI the way I have in these chapters which some may find tedious (but I unfortunately plan to keep doing it).

  I try to practice rationalism and find the sequences to be a useful bit of philosophy with which to improve my life. But I do have some disagreements about how AI will shake out. I plan on making my arguments (which come from my background as someone with a Masters degree in Computer Science) through this story. But for those who disagree with me you simply have to grant me the conceit that in this universe super scaling AI doesn't quite workout for various reasons like not being able to effectively miniaturize or due to the vagrancies of the underlying physics, those will remain reasonable alternative explanations throughout. I don't plan to be preachy about it and I think they will be well intermixed with other ideas.

    I've been really enjoying your story! 

    I like how your AI protagonist is pretty much an early-stage paperclip maximizer (all it really cares about is being the best factory it can). It's not needlessly aggressive towards humans, it just really doesn't care very much for them. 

    It does kinda make me wonder where all the other paperclip maximizers are - you'd imagine that this can't be the first AI Lord, but somehow none of the other ones have managed to bootstrap into absolute power yet. I'm sure that'll be answered eventually.

      Thank you!

      I always worry I will take too long to get to those sorts of points and people will drop it before then. Thank you for the trust! I hope I don't disappoint.

  (I seem to have missed the first post; now starting from the first chapter, putting reactions here as I feel the urge to write them.)

  ">!Besides if I saved their lives they would be indebted to me.!<":  I giggled for a long time after reading this.  Mental image:  ">!Okay.  We were fighting with other knights who were trying to kill us, and then a dragon just appeared and started swatting them like bugs.  Bright side:  those knights aren't a threat to us any more.  Dark side:  A DRAGON JUST APPEARED AND STARTED SWATTING KNIGHTS LIKE BUGS AHHHHH!!<".  Comprehending the concept of >!debt/indebtedness!< yet not predicting a '>!out of the frying pan into the fire!<'/'>!better the devil you know than the devil you don't!<' reaction strikes me as hilariously naïve.

  ">!They had been warned.!<":  when?  If it was the >!danger lines!<, how could they have recognised them?

  Chapter 2, noting a case of 'effecting' used when should be 'affecting', I believe.

  Ee-hee-hee.  I love this paragraph, combining an internal-modelling-failure and a horror-situation in the form that I also love in Super Minion.  '  >!Oh I had some of that! "There is some extra blood on those machines," I  turned on a light to reveal the blood soaked machinery, "I am not  planning on using it. It appears to be a sub-par lubricant." !< '.

  Chapter 8, 'loosing control' -> 'losing control.  I also love the blithely-unaware horror-scenario in this chapter!

  Chapter 9:  'Power I', 'Power II', 'Power X' (rather than 'Power III', and with no elipses or similar indication or held-but-unlisted powers):  deliberate or not?  If deliberate, how can there be absolute numberings for the chosen Powers..?  


  Still in Chapter 9, I'm wondering whether I missed the option of collapsing the tunnel on top of the threat...

    I appreciate your detailed feed back, the editing notes especially.

    Editing notes:

    >Chapter 2, noting a case of 'effecting' used when should be 'affecting', I believe.

    I only use affect in chapter 2 (or at least in my reference copy). And I am like 80% confident it is supposed to be affect in the case I do use it (please do correct me in more detail if I am wrong).

    >Chapter 9:  'Power I', 'Power II', 'Power X' (rather than 'Power III',  and with no elipses or similar indication or held-but-unlisted powers):   deliberate or not?

    >!deliberate, I may screw up words like feet/meters regularly (and the ones you pointed out) but the stat blocks are all relatively carefully written/designed.!<

    Story notes:

    >If it was the >!danger lines!<, how could they have recognised them?

    >!I'm going with hand wave they are a relatively consistent sign in this dimension. It wasn't meant to be a logical argument by the AI. More a flavor of an old grievance (not-cannon, just an example of what I was aiming for): "I *still* have to not kill the humans even when they step on my factory floor? They stepped over the danger lines, they were warned to not get in my way." to which the AI technician responds with "yeeeeaaaaaa, lets adjust some parameters on your morality."!<

    >I'm wondering whether I missed the option of collapsing the tunnel on top

    >!in chapter 10, the AI inspects it's own beliefs like getting blinded by the original human design, which did not include collapsing the tunnels (because it wasn't worth it, that wasn't a concern;)!< (maybe) spoiler from author/unwritten-chapters: >!(bombing and strike teams, not sieges were the original concern)!<

      Ah!  I thought it was Chapter 2, but it was actually Chapter 3, I'm sorry!  "Before I can make any specific long term plans effecting you, >!like when you would be allowed to leave, I would require a significant amount of  information about the state of the world from you.!<"  


      Thank you for your responses!

  My favorite sapient factory is back, and *this* time it gets to do more shenanigans!

  I can't wait till it begins experimenting even more with its abilities.  In particular:

  >**Modular Production Lines II***: Machinery can continue manufacture while being reorganized. Any partially manufactured run that is part of a manufacturing focus may at anytime swap it's progress with that of another manufacturing run of a manufacturing focus (adjusting for materials in the quantities swapped).*

  Bwahahaahaha.  This reminds me of production in the original Master of Orion and such games.  So I have to ask if it works the same way.  Because if so, it is **insanely** min-maxable to the point of silliness.

  Does this mean that one large object that's partially constructed can be turned into **multiple** other items?  (Is a production 'run' a single items or an entire order?  10 20mm cannon shells started at once counts as a single run, or 10 runs?)

  If so, it will always be advisable to have at least one large object (such as a heavy mech or whatever the Factory has focus on) to be under construction at all times.  Should numerous smaller things (like ammo) be needed, he just switches over production and **BLAMMO**, heaps of ammo.

  If it works the same with smaller mechs or the like, then it pays to always be producing something with similar proportions of raw material--like an even larger mech.  Start production on something like a WH40K Titan.  It doesn't matter if he only has space for one of its feet, giant blades can come out like meat slicers and just chop it into personal warmechs or flocks of chickenbots, as needed.

  Now, if this **isn't** possible, he can simply do the reverse.

  Make something smaller he might want in the short term, and if it is not necessary at the time, change it over to another thing right before it gets completed.

  IE:  Start work on Small warmechs, as they get to 99%, change them over to Medium, as THEY get to 99%, change to Large, etc.  If anyone tries to attack or raid him or the like, he can just finish the thing that's currently being worked on, or if it doesn't have enough progress to come out in time, immediately downgrade to the other.

  &#x200B;

  >**Pull**: *Let each manufacturing step pull from the previous one. Demand is the driver of manufacturing, let it pull towards perfection. Every manufacturing run you complete will increase the quality of future runs of similar products (proportional diminishing returns), from time to time you will gain research breakthroughs.*

  And now we come back to constitutes a 'run'.  Is it a single item?  A stack of them?  Is there a % chance to get an upgrade with each, or after certain numerical thresholds?

  He should check by queue'ing up multiple 'runs' of ammo.  Say, a 1,000 round run and then do 1,000 sequential single-print runs.   Keep repeating whichever seems to be more productive.  Should also help determine the quality of change from the runs, as well.  

  If it doesn't work that way, well hey, he should be making as much as he can of designs that will be re-used.  Ammo is certainly on this list.

  >They were also difficult to reload, requiring the removal of the thermal capacitor, then the steam engine, then analytical engine (with it's delicate torsion radio), before finally the drum could be replaced.

  So why not load it from the other direction?

  Or, you know, make the entire weapon cylinder itself modular, so that you 'reload' it by swapping out the entire weapon without going through the other junk?  Then if you design other models of weapon that have the same exterior surface specs, you can easily change their loadout with a single design.  Have some rapid fire models, some slower-fire models, some that launch gyrojet rockets or incendiary rounds, etc.  You could even make 'collier' mechs which do this job out in the field (basically a modified maintenance model with a backpack full of chicken-guns).

  >With their default engagement algorithm that left them out of ammo in a few seconds of steady contact. At which point they would stand there, tracking their target, cycling the drum as they continued trying to fire. 

  Why?  Shouldn't they have a 'regroup' subroutine that haves them move off of the battlefield to a predetermined location (ie: the location they were activated to go into 'attack mode')?

  If nothing else, these things all being the same height with little tracking would quickly provide cover to their enemies when they run out of ammo.  Seems like a bad philosophy even for disposable mechs.  If nothing else they should have a shutdown subroutine so that they fall over or squat or go prone or something when they run out of ammo so their fellow squad-chickens can attack the enemy.

  >It was an unregulated warzone at that. No one was following any conventions, hence I was under no moral obligations to engage in ethical warfare.

  Good factory!

  >**Thought Burst** • Intelligence Core Perk     *Once per day you may think for up to 100 minutes during which time does not advance. (May include all directly connected external computational hardware. No new information may be received nor sent.)*

  This ability is as broken as they come.  Turning a real-time-strategy game into a turn-based game where *only you* get to take a turn is broken.  And I love it.  That 'once per day' is probably the only thing that keeps it from being absolute BS.  Being able to come up with a plan when everything has gone wrong is a nice perk, but the ability to execute it in massive, specific detail (thanks to the Factory being an AI) is what pushes it over the top.

  >On to the more distasteful solution. Admitting I was wrong.

  And that's what truly makes the factory a frightening foe.  It can be humble and admit its mistakes, then work to change them.  That also makes it likeable as a character.

  Thanks for all these updates!

    Thanks for the detailed feedback!

    It helps to know what people are thinking so I can make sure I didn't miss anything. >!if I didn't comment on something it's probably something I already plan to include!<

    > Because if so, it is insanely min-maxable to the point of silliness.

    If it helps, I actually write out all the abilities at different tiers (just rough sketches) and multiple reviewers thought (beware spoilers from the author) >!this was the weakest path of the three (even after I tweaked them a little)!<, I'm glad someone finally agrees with me.

    > So why not load it from the other direction?
    >
    > Or, you know, make the entire weapon cylinder itself modular,

    This was part of chapter 10: >!that maybe I should go back to edit to include the chicken mechs. The factory didn't fancy itself an engineer so it didn't imagine that it should redesign it. It also got caught by the Soul "mechanics" and began thinking it *couldn't* (or at least *shouldn't* try to) do something that was covered by the Soul or the attributes/ranks of the facility, like (it's implied) include design.!<

    Another clarification I should perhaps go back and edit (or maybe that I should add to a coming up section) is that the weapon is built into the "chassis" of the Cylinder, the Turret, and the Legs all being a single construction, with the one loading port at the top.

    > Why? Shouldn't they have a 'regroup' subroutine that haves them move off of the battlefield to a predetermined location (ie: the location they were activated to go into 'attack mode')?

    This is a little bit of the AI being condescending to lesser machine-forms, but it's implied >!part of the heterogeneous flocks are "controller" models that would trigger state changes if needed.!< lore that may never make it in: >!The engagement algorithm being a mode they are in, and acting like they are still in that mode providing the illusion they still have ammo worked best with the controller's planning algorithms (and limited computational capacity) when it came to executing flanks. If they got in the way or whatever then the controller could disable or move them. The AI is being condescending because with out it's planning they would just stand there stupidly.!<

    I'm glad you are enjoying it!
