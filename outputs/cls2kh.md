## How would HJPEV deal with Umbridge?

### Post:

Here's the scenario. At the beginning of canon's 5th year, Harry Potter's mind and talents are switched with that of Harry James Potter Evans Verres'. He's clearly very confused about all this, but he goes through the motions passively collecting information. He knows enough to realize Harry Potter's friends are Hermione and Ron rather than Malfoy, much to his fully-internalized chagrin, and he's happy to see Dumbledore still alive, but he's just as shocked as everyone else when Umbridge interrupts Dumbledore's speech and feels personally insulted that "This obviously fascist bureaucrat has taken the position which should rightly be held by Quirrel."

How does he deal with this?

Resources he has:

* His mind, his science, his skill as a rationalist, and the cold, dark clarity of Tom Riddle, usable at-will.

* His partial transfiguration. It's less impressive in the canon Potterverse, but still good for surprising people, escaping from locked rooms, etc.

* The True Patronus Charm. That was the first thing he (discreetly) checked when he realized he'd hopped to a new universe. It still looks and feels the same, and still feels like it should kill Dementors and block Killing Curses, but he can't be totally sure. (It still does these things, but because he doesn't know he isn't willing to get himself into situations where it would be necessary until he's tested it.)

* The loyalty of a little under half of the non-Slytherins in Hogwarts. He has not yet alienated or driven away any of canon Harry's allies in the staff, students, or Order of the Phoenix.

* The Cloak of Invisibility, from Harry's trunk. It has no efficacy against Dementors here, though, as it didn't in canon either.

* The Maurauder's Map, though he doesn't know the password or what it is. He kept it because, no matter how daft the Harry Potter he replaced appears to have been, he cannot imagine that any version of Harry Potter would keep an ancient piece of blank parchment for no reason.

* Any other important quest items which are either skills of HJPEV or things cannon Harry had which I have forgotten.

What he does not have:

* The loyalty of any Slytherin including Malfoy, or a little over half of the non-Slytherins. This is 5th year, so Fudge's propaganda campaign is in full swing. A ton of people already think he's crazy.

* Anyone who trusts that he really is capable of doing the apparently impossible, at any time.

* The Elder Wand.

* His collection of books.

* His Time-Turner. He still has a 30-hour sleep cycle.

* His parents. Petunia obviously still exists, but she's canon Petunia and therefore useless.

* Any other artifact or relationship which was not shared by both himself and canon Harry Potter.

How does HJPEV play this?

  We've seen how he deals with her.

  > Harry turned his back on the empty void, and looked up at where the toad-woman stood. She was pale beneath the pink makeup, her mouth opening and closing like a fish.

  > "I make you this one offer," said the Boy-Who-Lived. "I never learn that you've been interfering with me or any of mine. And you never find out why the unkillable soul-eating monster is scared of me. Now sit down and shut up."

  > The toad-woman fell back down to her bench without a word.

  Beyond that, he would probably go see Dumbledore about dimensional travel, and whether the local prophecies are as dire as those of his homeworld.

  Does he still have the collapse-Earth-into-a-strangelet button that is free transfiguration? Is he still bound by the Vow?

  Have three offscreen years passed for HJPEV?

  Is a ring on canon-harry-in-HJPEV's-body's body going to transform into Obliviated Voldemort in a few hours? Maybe Moody notices that Harry's acting oddly and intervenes, or something.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    This is Harry as of the end of HPMOR in 5th year canon Harry's body. No additional time has passed for him. The Vow still binds him.

    Moody placed alarms on the ring and will deal with it before Voldemort wakes.

    And that plan only works if Harry can threaten her with a dementor again. He does not currently have access to one.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:

      So... does that mean that canon 5th year Harry suddenly finds himself in his body of 4 years ago, annoyed that he seems to have to repeat the last few school years again, until he finds out that everything is crazy and that for some reason everyone expects him do do shit and have larger than life responsibilities?

  I wonder how he'd react to finding out that Michael Verres either doesn't exist (given that he's a MoR-only character), or has experienced a Petunia-and-Harry-free life, possibly being part of a different family. And that Petunia does exist but is a really horrible person.

  Of course, yes, he's a rationalist, but even so, would he be able to easily tank that kind of emotional double-blow?

  I'm also thinking that he'll find out about canon!Harry's history and personality, and while initially being a little horrified and embarrassed, might eventually come to sympathize with a Harry who spent eleven years without parental or family support and was actively subjected to years of abuse.

  Realizing that Dumbledore and McGonagall *knew* the conditions the local version of Harry had been raised in, and did nothing about it, might make him blow his top.

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    If he does nothing, she will soon have complete control over his immediate surroundings. I doubt the Vow would even let him let that happen, as it definitely makes it harder for him to prevent the world from ending, for all kinds of reasons.

    He has to do *something.* I know he can, but I'm not sure what it is.
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      The Vow doesn't compel him to positive acts.

      He has 5th-year Harry's magical power level, I assume?  (If not, he has some large immediate school issues.) First time Umbridge hurts somebody he cares about in a way that crosses deontological lines, one well-chosen False Memory Charm should be enough to make her self-destruct in a way not traceable to enemy action.  Magic is supersaturated with ways to cheat and Harry is in the middle of a real crisis, he doesn't have time for her.

        I think one of the first hypotheses to cross his mind is that this is somehow Hermione's dreamworld where she is expressing a repressed desire to be the main character - a literal dreamworld that only he and she are experiencing, operated inside her mind.

        (He will then test this hypothesis by looking up additional math in textbooks, and consider it tentatively disconfirmed when he finds valid theorems that neither of them knew.  What, you thought he was going to stay dramatically mistaken for multiple episodes?)

          Any clue how canon 5th year Harry would handle suddenly being in the HPMoR world shortly after the defeat of Voldemort? Among other things:

          * Dumbledore is dead.

          * Petunia is a supermodel that loves him.

          * Draco's dad is dead and expects to find a friend in Harry.

          * Hermione has superpowers and expects him to be some sort of genius.

          * Many of the Wizarding world's movers and shakers seem to expect all kinds of things from him.

          * Ron doesn't like him.

          * He's in Ravenclaw.

          * Magic is slightly less magical and much more sensible.

          * The whole world is subtly different.

            Within the first few days, 5th year Harry will throw an angst fit witch will immediately reveal him as an imposter, if he hasn’t been caught before. Mad-eye and  possibly Amelia Bones will interrogate him to see if his sudden behavior change is due to a piece of Voldemort coming to the surface or something. They will probably get the truth of his origin out of him. 

            I can see Hermione and Neville trying to work with Harry to un-isekai him. Draco may or may not help, depending on how obnoxious the swapped Harry is about it.

            At the end of this scenario, I would love it if the Harry’s are swapped back and 5th year Harry comes back to a home universe utterly changed by HJPEV’s influence!

            I've only read HPmoR once, but I don't remember petunia being part of the plot at all, weren't the majority of his resources from his scientist parents?

            Edit: wait, petunia is his mom, and there's a subplot about his dad being an ass about intellectual stuff with her because she's not a scientist. I think. Carry on.

              One of the main reasons that the HPMOR universe is different to the canon HP universe is that Lily was nice to Petunia. This led to Petunia breaking up with Vernon Dursley and marrying Michael Verres instead, which had a drastic impact on Harry's upbringing.
              ```

- u/boomfarmer:
  ```
  Several things that HJPEV might do:

  - Show up at the new professor's office, before their first class, and have a quick chat to get to know her better. This HJPEV is much more in control of his emotions than canon Harry, and might be expected to try to charm the new professor.
  - Having learned the lesson from Snape, *lose* during a conflict in class.
  - Take time to plot.
  - Check to see if Rita Skeeter is alive in this continuity, and if so, feed her all the juicy tidbits. We're only a few months into Fudge's campaign; it may not be too late to begin a pseudonymous character assassination campaign against Umbridge and Fudge, and when it succeeds, reveal that he was the author.
  - Plot with Gred and Forge.

  But regarding Quest Items, you the author need to decide:

  1. The rules of the method by which Harry got isekai'd. Does he have access to Harry's memories? Since souls exist, does HJPEV's soul replace HP's soul, or does HP's soul cease to exist and HJPEV take its place? Do the prophecies which bound HP bind HJPEV? How does this affect the local prophesiers? Does Harry have the right to the Line of Merlin Unbroken? 
  2. There are three options for what items got transferred with Harry's soul: none, or some. None is easy. Some means that Harry will spend time trying to figure out why certain objects came with him but not others. You should figure out what the rule is beforehand, even if the rule doesn't make it into the story.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    HJPEV's mind state completely overwrites that of HP's. He has none of canon HP's memories, but is good enough at extracting information from context clues to at least stall long enough to explain things to Dumbledore and get correct stories. He's still going to be ignorant of things Dumbledore wouldn't know or tell him until he can bluff his way through conversations with the relevant people. All the prophecies still bind him, as it was his mind, not his soul, which was overwritten. Local prophets notice nothing...for now. This will change as HJPEV starts HJPEV'ing.

    His closest friends are going to notice the changes almost immediately and will demand answers. He'll need to figure something out to tell them, possibly the truth.

    Harry brought over zero magical artifacts. He only has access to whatever HP had at the time, though he could obviously get his hands on some others. He does not have the Stone of Permanency, as that is a universal win condition. I'm allowing him transfiguration and Patronuses because those really aren't ever explained in any depth in canon and may really work that way.
    ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      > Local prophets notice nothing

      This should change the first time HJPEV makes a decision that would affect something outside Hogwarts. If he decides to continue his plan of uplifting humanity to immortality, except in this universe, I expect the moment he acknowledges that plan is the moment that the seers get premonitions.
      ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      > stall long enough to explain things to Dumbledore and get correct stories. 

      Canon HP might go to Dumbledore. Would HJPEV go to Dumbledore for anything other than aphorisms and his father's rock? How different is this Dumbledore from HJPEV's own Dumbledore, of this Dumbledore is not driven by prophecies to channel Harry's growth?
      ```

      - u/Psy-Kosh:
        ```
        End of HPMOR Harry was well aware that Dumbledore had actual good reasons for his odd behaviors, and I seem to recall him flat out said something to the effect of "Dumbledore may have been the only one that was doing the right things for the right reasons."

        So "talk to the local version of Dumbledore" would be a plan of action that'd at least occur to him as worthy of consideration.

    ```

- u/CopperZirconium:
  ```
  I’ve had a similar scenario I’ve been idly puzzling with for a while. End-of-book!HJPEV overwrites canon Voldemort in the exact moment Voldemort first sees baby Harry. Lilly is alive and in combat stance, James is freshly dead.

  Harry has less than three minutes to orient to his surroundings, diffuse Lilly, and attempt to resurrect (or freeze) James before James’s brain starts to take serious damage. 

  Harry has to weigh probability that he is actually in 1981 and James is an actual person who will be perma-dead soon verses the probability that this situation is somehow fake/enemy action that is possibly an attempt to steal the secret of patronus revival. (Harry considers and rejects the idea that this is a years-long time-loop, because he simply refuses to murder his own parents to complete the loop.)

  Harry will attempt to revive James even though he thinks he is in some sort of simulation because:

      p(this is real) * cost of James dies for good > p(this is enemy action to expose my secrets) * cost of patronus revival secret being known

  Holds true even if p(this is real) is very low.

  The next big challenge is developing a “Voldemort Cleanup Plan.” If Harry in Voldemort’s body just nopes off to hide or find personal answers, magical Britton basically turns out the same as it did in canon. Harry is likely to see his remembered history as a control and try to work for a better future.

  Harry’s resources
  * historical knowledge
  * true patronus and partial transfiguration
  * an adult magic capacity
  * any artifacts Voldemort had on his person 
  * a whole, unshattered, Tom Riddle soul (presuming some of canon!Voldemort’s behavior was caused by instability from making horcruxes)

  Harry’s weaknesses
  * limited spell knowledge 
  * no canon!Voldemort memories (maybe some re-awakened MoR!Voldemort memories like the one from his first dementor exposure) 
  * Vow-bound

  Wild card
  * 5 canon horcurxes with unknown behavior

  He sends her a package by owl with a grenade in it.

  In all seriousness I think he'd gather information, finding out how much authority she actually has in the school. Figuring out what her objectives are by speaking with the student body, teachers, possibly the woman herself and maybe a bit of snooping in her office with the Invisibility cloak. Also finding out what in the world the Ministry is doing by sending someone so antagonistic to the school.

  Then with what he's able to piece together either as Nimelennar says he "retracts the story of Voldemort's return" to get her to lower her guard and to stop grinding everyone gears. Possibly undermine her credibility and sanity with Fred and George plus more invisibility cloak.

  Or

  If the situation truly seems untenable he could always just leave lol. Go to another school outside of Britain. He has no real stake in this battle to be honest other than familiar faces who aren't the people he knows and a personal slight.

  If leaving the school is too dangerous or is somehow unachievable he can I guess utterly destroy Umbridge with his dark side. As for what that intails errrrrr grenade.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    The fact that nobody does the grenade thing in canon probably means there's a safeguard against it. Letterbombs started appearing in the Muggle world as early as 1712, and at the very least muggleborns would have talked about it and the idea would have made its way around. There's enough cultural contamination for trains to have made it, so something far simpler probably did as well.
    ```

    - u/tantalum73:
      ```
      That arguement can be made about FAR too many muggle advances for it to stand up. If the wizarding world were at ALL consistent about integrating even decades old muggle ideas, it would be unrecognizable from cannon or the rationality verse. And don't forget the Hogwarts Express is based off a near 200 year old steam engine, and it appears to be the most modern and sophisticated tech in use.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Letterbombs are older than that. It only takes exactly one muggleborn in the ministry to read a muggle paper and make the connection telling their competent Slytherin or Hufflepuff superior that they should probably, like, disable all magical and nonmagical explosives in flight, or something, to make it a non-issue. Or maybe they enchant owls to not take lethal items at all and to get lost in uninhabited woodlands if confunded in any way. Or maybe there's a Return to Sender feature, or the magical post office delivers an irresistable homing tracker to whoever sent the bomb. You could stay in an unplottable and Fidelius'd area to avoid that, but you'd never be able to leave.

        Or maybe they did all of that. I took less than 5 minutes coming up with those, and despite the canon HPverse being a worldbuilding disaster, there are still usually reasons for things to happen besides author fiat, even if those reasons are bad if actually examined. The reason letterbombs don't really happen anymore is because the Unabomber made IRL authorities think about how to prevent such a person from being successful again, and we now have some simple safeguards against it. One ambitious, but stupid, would-be dark lord doing the same would be enough to make even a society of mostly daft wizards do the same.

          We never see, in canon or in HPMOR, a wizard checking an unfamiliar owl to be registered mail owl and not an Animagus or Imperiused regular owl. And even if they would start, would the Ministry really put as much effort into making every mail owl distinct and unfakeable and unhackable as Gringotts put in it's Grand Manager's seal?

              Unlikely even for regular explosions. The envelope can be enchanted the same way as mokeskin pouch to hold at least a couple of kilos of whatever explosive a mage can acquire. And even that is unnecessary: although it might be possible for a wizard to survive explosion of a hundred grams of Erumpet Fluid or something, it would definitely be very handy for the Death Eaters if on their next mission every member of the Order of the Phoenix had all fingers on their wand hands missing.

If leaving Britain gets him even *slightly* more freedom to work on the most serious problems, it's the obviously correct choice.

  In Harry's shoes, I *wouldn't* defeat Umbridge.  She's way too useful.

  Umbridge's thing is getting political power by abusing bureaucracy and blackmailing people.  She's openly hates Harry and isn't Voldemort aligned.  Plus, she has strong and easy to understand motivations. 

  All that makes her a perfect cats paw. 

  Step 1 is to toss a confundus at her:  "Harry served his detention" / "you transferred Harry's detention to Filch after Filch promised to do something torturous."

  That gets Harry ~4 hours of free movement / night and establishes the enmity between him and Umbridge. Plus it starts to win him public sympathy; people don't like it when authorities go too far.

  Then I'd start running through her blackmail files.  General goals are (1) learn the network of power / alliances in the ministry as seen by people outside of team Dumbledore, (2) copy damaging stuff on team dark, and (3) fill the files on team Dumbledore with useless misinfo.

  Once the files are edited, the next step is to burn through Umbridge's accumulated power.  Have her pick fights with people on Team Dark and then use the blackmail against them.

  When Umbridge's influence is mostly gone, and her allies are angry, then maneuver her into a scandal where she's colluding with Malfoy to do something appropriately taboo.

  The maneuvering wouldn't be that hard to set up. Just a liberal mix of confundous + the inventing of a society of purebloods who recognized Umbridge's brilliance
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    That's pretty good actually. She's definitely vile, but you're right that she was never explicitly with Voldemort.

    I'm not sure you could build much public support with the detentions, though, at least not until you've toppled Fudge. Over half of Harry's class either didn't care about his detentions or thought the nutter was getting what he deserved. I did overlook that it may have been possible to get Umbridge nominally on-side long enough to both use and destroy her though.
    ```

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    This assumes he knows she isn't Voldemort aligned. Consider what canon Harry has had to deal with up to this point: (DADA = Defense Against the Dark Arts)

    1. Literally Voldemort. (Technically possessed by.) The DADA Teacher. (He might count this one twice.)
    2. One of Voldemort's Horcruxes possessing Ron's little sister. Ron is his friend.
    3. Someone who's escaped from Azkaban...
    4. A death eater who sent him straight to Voldemort/bringing him back/removing magical protection. The DADA Teacher, who everyone thought was a super trustworthy auror.

    If there's a 50% chance someone is Voldemort, 25% chance they're a Death Eater, killing them or getting them fired ASAP seems like a solid move. (The remaining 25% - that they're a member of the order of the phoenix/good defense teacher, can be easily eliminated.)

  Maybe the DA still gets formed, but with Harry no longer so closely associated with Dumbledore and the Voldemort-returned story, I think Umbridge would be less paranoid about the whole "Dumbledore wants to seize power" idea, and might actually let them learn.

    He's personally offended by her existence and sees that she is a bully worse than Snape ever was. Furthermore, she starts the fight with the canon needling she does in their first class. He obviously pretends to lose in the immediate term, but he now knows the Ministry here is even worse than the one in his own world.

    He might retract the claim in public, but he's obvioisly going to talk with Dumbledore, who will tell him of all the evidence for Voldemort's return. He will know the Ministry in its current form is going to doom the country to war, so not dealing with it is not an option. The Vow wouldn't force him into acting, but it would recommend toppling the government as soon as possible to shorten the upcoming war he doesn't have the means to stop.

    Retracting the Voldemort's Return story would be a political disaster that would oust Dumbledore and vindicate Fudge. The fact that he doesn't have memory of it (when he's aware he's literally missing *all the memories* of canon HP) doesn't prove LV isn't resurrected, and if he's remotely intelligent he'd defer action until he knows WTF is going on.

  Some questions that came to mind on reread:

  * Does HJPEV get CANON!Harry's connection to Voldemort? I'd doubt it, but then I have to wonder if Voldemort would notice, or if he didn't realize it was a thing until after a few of the visions in canon.
  * Doesn't HJPEV have a different accent from CANON!Harry? Oxford vs Surry? I think people would immediately notice that he walks, talks, and reacts completely differently from CANON!Harry, and respond accordingly.
  * A few people have questioned whether or not HJPEV would approach CANON!Dumbledore, but in keeping with the above, wouldn't Dumbledore immediately take action to figure out what's happening? In canon, Dumbledore avoided Harry during this book, due to the Voldemort connection. Would HJPEV's obvious weirdness change this, or make it seem like an even better idea? Given the latter, he'd probably put Snape on it, and that would probably result in Snape discovering HJPEV's oclumensy, and this just gets harder and harder until HJPEV suggests something like veritaserum or testifying under magical compulsion of some kind. (Pensive could help, but getting to that point seems like it'd take longer.)
