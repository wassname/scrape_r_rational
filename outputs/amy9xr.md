  What could the well be for? Scrying has been done with bowls in the past. Is there some sort of Lassie meme or Truth Coming Out Of The Well To Shame Mankind Gambit she can pull?

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    In norse mythology Mimir demanded Odin to sacrifice something if he wanted to drink from his well, and Odin proceeded to take his own eye and throw it into the well, so Mimir let him drink from it and obtain its wisdom.

    This does fit with Cat keeping mutilating herself for power, but I *really* hoped it would be Larat that ended up as Odin stand-in, if only so he could go hang already.
