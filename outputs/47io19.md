## Self inserts: Is inaction the logical option?

### Post:

In most works of fiction, the hero ultimately wins. The day is saved, evil is vanquished. Often, though, this depends on a very specific series of events to play out, often times very unlikely ones.

It's easy to picture, in many given works, that the number of possible universes in which the hero doesn't succeed are much more numerous.

It stands to reason then that if you suddenly found yourself in the body of someone that doesn't matter to the "plot", the most rational option is to stay the hell out of the way.

Inserts into important characters are, of course, another matter wntirely. Even inserts into characters minor to "plot".

Just something that's crossed my mind on reading a few of these kinds of stories, and stumbling onto the alt history forums. The real world doesn't really have a plot, persay, but if I was, say, suddenly dropped pre-ww2 I'd be terrified as hell to do anything.

  If I was dropped pre-WW2?  Nevermind the war's "plot", I'd be terrified as hell just figuring out how to stay healthy, not to mention stay out of what passed for prisons and/or mental institutions back then.

    Geneva in Switzerland seems to be the best bet. While some Swiss cities were bombed by both sides, Geneva apparently wasn't (according to a quick search), although it was something of a hotbed of spies and diplomatic wrangling.

    I'd also recommend traveling to / staying in the US pre-1941, but that only really gives you two years before you have to move elsewhere. Although if you had an excuse (medical or otherwise) to avoid the draft, you could probably remain on the mainland for the duration.

      Actually I wasn't talking about political or military threats to my health. At all. Those wouldn't even be on my radar. I was talking about basic healthcare, and social reactions to a displaced 21th century resident (whether or not they would declare themselves to be such). Basic day-to-day-life stuff.

      Pre-WW2 wasn't _quite_ the Middle-Age, but c'mon, let's be honest here. No-one born post-40's, to say nothing of post-70's, is equipped to live pre-40's, and the war has nothing to do with that.

        Point. I guess if you were in a good health, you could try and do things like eat well, exercise, avoid chemicals you knew were poisonous, and you'd probably be educated enough to handle bookkeeping or white-collar management.

        Not to mention that if you really wanted to raise cash to a level where you could live in 1930s-ish luxury, there are a lot of scams which didn't become specifically illegal until later, or were incredibly difficult to track until the advent of computers. Particularly with communication in some of the more rural areas taking a long time and phone systems only being installed later. And of course you could invest in war bonds or buy stock in companies supplying war materials. ID was probably far more easily forged, too.

          Indeed. Although how I, as a 38yo 21th-century product, with little to no knowledge of even the basic facts of life-at-that-time, would be able to do any of that without being sent to the loony bin, well that's what's stumping me.

          Eating well. Sounds promising. Except that, in that time, I have absolutely no indicators of what "good food" looks like, or even what effect certified "good food" can have on my modern guts.

          Exercise.  Well okay, that's a pretty much atemporal thing.

          Scams. I have, literally, no idea which scams are known at that time, or of the punishment if I'm caught. By either lawful or lawless powers, might I add. The state of long-range communication networks mean nothing when the scammed can track you down with a little neighbourly inquiry and twenty buddies. (That's if by some miracle I manage to convince myself to try it, _and_ I manage to actually _succeed_.  I don't have any particular delinquent tendencies, and frankly I don't know any scam tricks).

          Investing.  Right.  A nobody with no contacts, no referents, no funds and no knowledge of current financial principles.  Easy.

          ID forging?  Again, you'd need intimate local (time and space) knowledge to forge something passable for anything worthy of the time and materials (that you'd have to procure) you'd have to spend for those.

          In other words, the only realistic way for any 21thC person to adapt comfortably in the 20's or 30's is, well, to be a native to that period.

          Or have magic. A spell to not let people be aware of any suspicious lack of local knowledge.  Another to turn local food ready for consumption.  Yet another for any of the then-common illnesses we're no longer vaccinated against because they've been eradicated for decades.  Etc.

          Or have a support network of in-the-know locals.  That would be a big help.

            Why do you act like the food back then was poisonous? Any food from farms that you can visit to make sure they aren't using tonnes of pesticides should be just as good as that of today, maybe even better.

            Vaccination was probably more limited then than now and only few vaccinatable diseases have actually been completely eradicated. The rest should be available by asking a local doctor of any repute.

            If you manage to succeed with some scam (probably by first establishing yourself for a year or so and then contacting actual criminals, which aren't that hard to find in any age if you actually go out looking for them) you'll just have to follow the age-old wisdom of scam artists and not stay in whatever region your former victims live. Just hitchhike if you don't have your own vehicle.

              I don't mean poisonous, of course.  Carrots are carrots basically anywhen (as long as you don't get too far back in time, of course). When you get to meat, eggs and milks, things can get more, shall we say, runny.  Processing techniques and quality controls are _not_ the same nowadays for processed foods.  You (probably) won't die, but I suspect that the first few months will get _very_ uncomfortable, and you might get a few 'visitors' to entertain.  So to speak.

              (Disclaimer: I am not a biologist.  Actual effects during your time travel may vary.)

              For vaccinations, I actually don't know the type and probable stocks of vaccines available by a random doctor at that time, nor how easy it would be to convince him to give them to me.  Do you?

              I don't believe I'd be able to enter a crime mob the way I enter a supermarket; and I don't believe I'd be able to _quit_ a crime mob the way I do a supermarket.

              I'm not being clear in my reasoning, I think. I took the premise, which I understand as: "One day, I get transported in the 1920's or 1930's. I have no local resources.  I am myself with my present knowledge, which does not include any specifics about my new environment.  What happens?".  From that premise, I imagine how I would react.

              I am not actually plotting a time-travel self-insert, where I wouldn't have to worry about my internal plumbing and not much more about sheltering; and concentrating about what's really interesting in a story (how to get money and construct an empire from my knowledge of the future).

              I was actually trying to be realistic, and when I get realistic, I don't see myself becoming a scam artist as easily as I can build a VM to add to my RDS farm. I don't see myself easily adapting to a low-tech and low-services time period.  I don't see myself easily adapting to a society whose social mores and politics are, to say the least, _not mine AT ALL_.

              I'm a product of the 21th century.  I depend on structures (moral, social, societal, technological, and more) that simply *do not exist* prior to the 60's. Suddenly living in the beginning of the 20th  century would _not_ be a challenge fit for a epic story, it would be a bloody nightmare which I would not survive intact, if at all.

              It goes without saying that any period prior to the 20th would mean death in a week, I think.

                I assume you're someone who has lived in a city their whole life and only eats supermarket products? Because I can assure you that if you ask any small scale farmer they will tell you that what they themselves eat is essentially the same, give or take a bit of selective breeding. No one does rigorous technical quality controlling on the meat the local butcher gets from the local farmer. Everyone simply checks for themselves if the meat is good and trusts that no one is trying to poison them, for sake of reputation if nothing else. And the sheep still eat the same grass they did then, minus maybe all the pollution that we've put into the earth mostly in the last ~50 years.

                For free? Probably not all that easy. But if you have any way whatsoever to make money (as in, any skill not dependent on electronics) then you'll do it like anyone else would and pay for it.

                >I don't believe I'd be able to enter a crime mob the way I enter a supermarket; and I don't believe I'd be able to quit a crime mob the way I do a supermarket.

                Again, it's mostly a question of money. If you pay then criminal services work a lot like non-criminal ones, except that there is a lot more secrecy involved. I'm not talking about you becoming a gang member here.

                >I don't see myself easily adapting to a low-tech and low-services time period.

                All these things are things that normal humans do on a daily basis all the time though. All it requires for someone to have this experience is to travel to a third world country for a duration longer than your typical two weeks holiday and not stay at an all inclusive resort. Sure, the lack of internet, sanitation, transportation and education is sorely felt after a while, but if you're not completely neurotic and panicky you just deal with it, like anyone else would. The way you describe it it sounds like you'd be someone who'd be horrified by something like a full day power outage.

                >I don't see myself easily adapting to a society whose social mores and politics are, to say the least, not mine AT ALL.

                This makes me think that you haven't ever experienced culture shock *at all*. Because I can tell you from experience that even traveling to another western nation will have you face relatively different social mores, politics and customs. Hell, even just traveling within the US (from major city to small inland town) will have you experience political opinions that seem to directly oppose yours on purpose.

                If people can hitchhike through Africa without screaming at everyone who seems to have more than one wife and thinks that cows were created specifically for their tribe only then re-experiencing Jim Crow laws as a time-traveling white male shouldn't be all that impossible.

                > I depend on structures (moral, social, societal, technological, and more) that simply do not exist prior to the 60's.

                I'd like you to actually list the structures you think you need for basic survival. Barring medical dependencies I am sure that if you decided to go on a prolonged trip (or even just camping) you'd notice that it turns out they are less important than you think.

                Bottom line, every moment many immigrants and backpackers all over the world face social upheaval much greater than that you'd face from switching between a 2000s western country and a 1920s western country that even speaks the same language. If an analphabet Pakistani can travel alone to a Greek island and make a life for himself than an educated (American?) can do it too.

                P.S.: I assume you're a white male because despite your boundless pessimism you never once mentioned the hardships you would face due to suddenly being a second class citizen due to gender or race.

                  Actually I've been living in a small village (pop. ~600) all my life. We're literally surrounded by fields. I may indeed (like most of the population) eat from supermarket foods of varying quality, but I do know the difference between raw and processed foods.

                  > Because I can assure you that if you ask any small scale farmer they will tell you that what they themselves eat is essentially the same, give or take a bit of selective breeding.

And the sheep still eat the same grass they did then, minus maybe all the pollution that we've put into the earth mostly in the last ~50 years.

                  ...Right. Well, maybe our respective localities don't have the same standards regarding food production and distribution. I know for a fact that the vast majority of the population of my country (France, as a point of fact) does have to adhere to strict laws and procedures regarding food. Among other things.  But yeah, if, for example, my workplace (an hospital) kitchen's chef decided one day to prepare meat received "on faith" from a local farmer YOLO-mode, there'd be Hell to pay, along with some impressive fines.

                  > For free? 

                  Of course not for free.  We didn't have national-wide social security until '45.

                  > Probably not all that easy. But if you have any way whatsoever to make money (as in, any skill not dependent on electronics) then you'll do it like anyone else would and pay for it.

                  The problem being actually earning that money quickly enough.  I'm a  sysadmin.

Hell, even just travelling within the US (from major city to small inland town) will have you experience political opinions that seem to directly oppose yours on purpose.

                  I haven't. I've travelled to Germany, Italy, Portugal, the UK and Japan for vacations, but I never *lived* in a country with no modern child labor laws, no vote for women (nor right for them to hold a job or a bank account), no decent (to my standards) healthcare, and where customs seems to hold more sway than law.

                  (As for travelling within the US...  Again, I'm French. To me, your politics are bewildering whether I look at your federal or state levels.  All your states. )

                  > If people can hitchhike through Africa without screaming at everyone who seems to have more than one wife and thinks that cows were created specifically for their tribe only then re-experiencing Jim Crow laws as a time-traveling white male shouldn't be all that impossible.

                  Yeah, well those people who hitchhike through Africa probably already prepared themselves to do it, and probably don't expect to never see civilisation again. I'm not even prepared to hitchhike through my own country, and as a white male myself I don't even have to worry about random rape, just random muggings.

                  > I'd like you to actually list the structures you think you need for basic survival. Barring medical dependencies I am sure that if you decided to go on a prolonged trip (or even just camping) you'd notice that it turns out they are less important than you think.

                  I work in a hospital. It's middle-sized (we only have about 200 beds and 600 agents), but we're pretty multi-purpose. We have a psychiatric ward, different levels of retirement homes (is that the term?), social services, an ER floor of course, etc. I can see, every day, the kind of problems normal people who _have_ access to our services can have.  I'm sure I can survive a little while (a few months? Maybe?) without this kind of services.  I'd look like Robinson Crusoe, I wouldn't call that _living_.

                  > Bottom line, every moment many immigrants and backpackers all over the world face social upheaval much greater than that you'd face from switching between a 2000s western country and a 1920s western country that even speaks the same language.

                  > If an analphabet Pakistani can travel alone to a Greek island and make a life for himself than an educated (American?) can do it too.

                  Actually, as a French, I see those immigrants you talk about. I don't know if your news networks talk about the Calais camp ("The Jungle")?  It's about 160km from my home.  1h30 by car, more or less.  They needed modern support networks to get there, and to survive there. Those who didn't, died on the way.  Well they also died from treachery, sea, cold, hunger, fatigue and other things not necessarily directly related to a lack of modern necessities, but... Yeah.  They died.  Lots and lots of them. Mostly because the West (we) consider that it's not really their problem, and they should be thanked that they're already 'helping' as much as they do, but that's another debate entirely.

                  > P.S.: I assume you're a white male because despite your boundless pessimism you never once mentioned the hardships you would face due to suddenly being a second class citizen due to gender or race.

                  I'm a white male, yes. I'm pessimistic because I know what I can and can't do. This time-travel scenario is well beyond where I evaluate my personal abilities.

                  Not being Black, I can only know of their hardships by listening to my uncle. Not being a woman, or any other "minority" (because women are only a "minority" when talking about the power they're allowed to have), I can only know of theirs by listening to my mother, and the other women of my family, and another uncle I only understood in my teens why he wasn't married to his friend (he is, now!), and of course the occasional encounters with social workers and medical staff at work.

                  Yeah, "second-class citizen" is kind of a thing for me.  Sorry.

                  I don't know how anyone else, of any sex, gender, nationality or ethnicity, would react to being transported with no preparation nor knowledge to the 20's, in France or anywhere else.  The scenario was "how would you", not "how would a random citizen". I know *I* would freak out and probably wouldn't manage in the long term.

  Just thought I'd mention that one of your insights is the main plot hook of John Scalzi's novel [Redshirts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079XPUOW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1). 

  (The following is not much of a spoiler -- most of it can be found on the book's blurb)

  The protagonist has just obtained the post of an ensign on the UUCS Intrepid. Along with other ensigns, he quickly figures out that they are living in the universe of a sci-fi show (which we, the readers, recognize to be Star Trek with a few letters changed to avoid copyright issues) and the way to survive in this universe is *never to go on an away mission* -- only the senior staff of the ship seem to come back from those in one piece...



  Its a fun novel though I think the author didn't have a good idea of where to go with this premise.

  Personally, I'm of the opinion that people really, really love hyping up the butterfly effect, especially considering there's no meaningful way to test or check their predictions that "one exhaled breath will completely change everything forever." Convenient.

  From my perspective, there's already so much random events and arbitrary noise in reality that anything which actually happened was probably pretty likely to happen. As such, small changes are likely to just get lost in the noise of randomness when compared to the much larger forces pushing events forward.

  But, as other people have pointed out, if you *actually* find yourself inserted into a fictional universe, then everything you thought you knew about physics needs to be seriously reevaluated, if not thrown right out.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  One problem is the butterfly effect. If taking the last seat on a bus you delay the cousin of someone the main character talks on the phone with a year later, you can fuck up the timeline.

  Another is that since you are there, something/someone is changing things in ways you can't predict. Assuming that they won't drop anyone else in, or make other changes is risky.

  If you are committed to making no changes, it's best to kill yourself early, taking care that no one ever knows about it. That is a huge risk if things do leave the rails. 

  Perhaps you could leave some insurance, eg. leave a plot-spoiler somewhere they wouldn't find it in the normal plot, so if they do find it the timeline is already fucked.

      I mean, unless you're in a world that runs on [narrativium](http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Narrativium) and not normal physics. 

      Fate, especially in magic worlds, isn't just random chance splitting Everett branches. It's an actual cosmic force, sometimes even a reified or personified and intelligently guided one. 

      The mere fact that you are there is an event bordering on magic, there is basically no way that could have happened by chance, so someone or something conscious must have chosen to put you there, for one reason or another.

        Well if you're in one of those worlds, and you know the plot, then:

        1: It should be fairly easy to check, just find out if plot-relevant characters born after your arrival showed up with the same gender, hair and eye colour. 

        2: Keep an eye out for a plot that's welded to the rails. If it stays on course despite changes, then that's a solid sign.

        3: Might as well learn to bend reality into a pretzel while you're in a magic world in the mean time, as backup. Just in case things turn out not to be narrative-based and the world actually is doomed without your intervention. Hey, if you're wrong then you only wasted some time and gained superpowers. Not too shabby, unless you're in one of those worlds where having magic is just terrible for your lifespan.

        4: Hope that when you arrived the narrative didn't change into a cautionary tale about thinking you know better than fate, being wrong, and dying because of it.

            In the case of my own SI for example, Hinata has a younger brother instead of a sister. Konohamaru is... similar, but not identical. Therefore fate is not absolute, although it could theoretically be a weaker force that cares only about a few specific events (it isn't in my story, but the SI can't know that for certain).

      I think you're underestimating the strength of the butterfly effect yourself. It doesn't take an external cause. The period simply playing back again is enough to change absolutely everything, because quantum physics changes everything on its own. It's already random, you don't need any extra instigation besides the physics happening as they did. The Everett tree is vast and many-limbed, and you will never find the branch you were looking for.

      Narratively, though, that's total crap, because people rarely write about worlds with real physics.

            It's not that the people are unimportant, so much as the scale of change you're actually able to create being so much smaller - if every possible branch is equally real then every possible turn of events has already going to have happened (yes the tenses get a bit confusing)

            You can't disrupt the multiverse - the branch where you "change the course of events" is just one thread among many and those changes already/always existed on that branch.

In order to be more likely to be in a branch in the future where things went well, I have to be the kind of person who would change the course of events now.

      forget nonlocal effects. The very air you displaced is likely to eventually cause enough of a difference that somewhere, someone's schedule is off by a millisecond. Human plans may keep things on track for a while in spite of that, but if a person is off by a millisecond, they'll have different children. Human reproduction is very vulnerable to the butterfly effect. And then those children are all carriers of your contagious butterflies, and they sure as hell aren't going to bother killing themselves. Long story short, the absolute maximum time you can delay the butterfly effect is one generation.

      Nothing less that a destiny based universe could really stop it.

    Any story with time-travel  or alternate timelines will probably have a standing position on how much the butterfly effect ... affects, for what it's worth. You'd be doomed in Worm, for example, but *probably* safe if you run into Ma and Pa Kent.

    > One problem is the butterfly effect. If taking the last seat on a bus you delay the cousin of someone the main character talks on the phone with a year later, you can fuck up the timeline.

    I agree, unless you're pretty far from the action and pretty close time-wise to the climax, you're going to mess up the story anyway. Since you're going to change things anyway, the best way to do it is to be "deep throat" and feed critical info to the protagonist.

    > If you are committed to making no changes, it's best to kill yourself early...

    Unless you're basically a homeless friendless bum, that's likely to trigger the butterfly effect worse than if you just try and continue your body's life.

  Nope. Butterfly effect means the second you insert, the canon outcome is completely *dead*. Everything that happens relies on everything else. If something new happens, then information from that event will propagate outwards at the speed of causality. The only rational option if you care about the outcome at all is to attempt to help as your abilities permit. It's fine to do nothing if you're indifferent, though.

  Remember that our choices are ultimately the products of physical law, not our will. Changing anything physical will influence those choices, and over time, such effects snowball.

    That second point is, I feel, far more critical than its length indicates.

    Once you remove will and look at it from a deterministic point of view, the OP's question gets both simpler and more interesting.

  ..If insert into.. the vast majority of fictional or historical settings, I would be dead within the year. Because however much "Be a fucking tourist and keep a low profile" is the surviving strategy, I'd loose my cool and start trying to fix the world.
  Mostly, by reproducing books from memory as best I can, because, well, frankly, inserting new ideas into a world is the most disruptive move possible, and it should keep working after I get murdered.

  Something similar  was jokingly suggested on Russian military history forum for some of the Stalin's illogical decisions in WWII.
  That is that Stalin had access to the complete history of WW2 and was afraid to disrupt path to victory (hi Worm).
   To make one wonder some of the Stalin's decisions were highly competent. The realistic explanation is of cause that Stalin was affected by psychotic bouts and while he was very good in logistics he had poor grasp military tactics, at least at the beginning of the war.
  However it's not inconceivable, that if not for Stalin's self-destructive decisions/policies like failure to detect (or refusal to see) preparations for Nazi offense, purging officer corps, disarming western border, disastrous performance in the Winter War (with Finland), untimely army reform and more,  Hitler may have taken Soviet Union seriously, put German industry on war footing in 1941 (and not in 1943 like in real history) and would prepare for the long campaign, not blitzkrieg. With disastrous consequences for the Soviet Union.

  It honestly depends, I think, on whether the plot is a risky gamble driven on coincidence, or the enaction of a well-planned manuever with lots of redundancies. As soon as you appear, chances of victory go from 1 to some fractional value, but that's true of real life, anyway.
