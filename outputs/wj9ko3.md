  I recently read *Ref: Incident at Hogwarts Concerning Gilderoy Lockhart, EQ-1993-16*, a fic by kitsunerei88 [(AO3 link)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27677980)

  It's an interesting fic about how the magical government might actually react to Gilderoy Lockhart being memory charmed as he was in canon. 11k words, complete. Summary:

  > Gilderoy Lockhart was a public figure—until he, under rather mysterious circumstances, lost his memories and was permanently locked up in St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. No further mention is made of him, and he fades into obscurity, and such is the fickle nature of fame.
  > 
  > But does that make sense? Let’s say, instead, that he doesn’t. Let’s say that his tragedy draws attention—and let’s say the public furor gets him the public enquiry that he deserves.

  Overall, I found it fun in the way a lot of fics that poke at the worldbuilding or plot holes of Harry Potter are fun, and it was written by an actual lawyer which makes it much better in this regard. I recommend it!

    Thanks, I've been on a bit of a Harry Potter fic kick/binge recently. 

    The most interesting/best that I've read is [Hermione Granger, Demonologist by BrilliantLady](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11800899/chapters/26618625). It is unfortunately quite short only covering year 1 plus epilogue/outline. Summary:

    >Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn’t going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    This was a nice story, thanks for the rec.

    Although my headcanon has always been that Dumbledore reported Lockhart for his crimes after Harry told him about it and the ministry believed him. So there would have been a media circus, but with the info that Lockhart was a fraud from the beginning, just about uncovering his crimes.
    ```

  For reasons I don't quite understand, I don't read much in the way of challenging works or what I'd consider "great literature" recently.  Mostly pulpy stuff.

  Just a quick list of what I'm still currently reading.

  * On the 3rd book of Dungeon Crawler Carl
  * Memoirs of You Local Small Time Villianess
  * Beware of Chicken
  * This Used to be about Dungeons (of course)
  * Journey of Black and Red, Calamitous Bob by Mechanimus
  * RE: Trailer Trash (recently saw an update)
  * Skybound (also recently saw some updates)
  * He Who Fights with Monsters (but few updates recently)
  * Whispering Crystals (I Am Going to Die in this Game Like Dimension)
  * Book of the Dead by RinoZ (I'm really enjoying this one)

  Some others I'll catch up on at some point:

  * Only Villians Do That
  * Jackal Among Snakes
  * Double Blind
  * Tori Transmigrated
  * A (No So) Simple Fetch Quest
  * Surviving the Succession
  * Frameshift (it is complete, but I haven't finished it) (see below)
  * Stray Cat Strut

  May pick up these:

  * To the Stars
  * ... actually, this tab group has 20+ tabs, I'm not going to list them...

  --------------------

  Frameshift is ... a really odd duck. The MC is thrown into a "dungeon" in a typical LitRPG fashion, in the genre of Dungeon Crawler Carl and such. But he's actually in a "temple", which is basically a magically-powered holodeck, sort of. And he doesn't have access to his interface, which is annoying to him and to the members of his party. I assume this gets fixed at some point. Though the outer world does have dungeons that fit the more conventional definition.

  The outer world (which the MC hasn't even seen yet) is the typical fantasy setting, and the temple (why is it called a "temple"? that seems a misappropriated word, not a lot of worshiping going on) can apparently create living beings from scratch and retro-actively alter the outer world so that they had always existed, and yet know that they've just been created? Very strange, never seen that before.

  I kind of get that the author wanted to jump into the middle, rather than doing the standard introductory stuff (waking up in a new world, learning the basics, etc.) but it has been rather confusing.  The very first chapter MC walks up to a pylon, and something amazing happens. But it takes a while to learn some of the basic info like: what is a pylon, why did the MC want to activate it, what the MC expected to happen upon activation, and so on. (BTW, "pylon" to me implies just something supporting something else, I'd have preferred to use... actually, I don't know, "altar" maybe? It is really more of a control panel on a pedestal.)

  At any rate, I'm interested in seeing where this goes, so I'll keep reading it.

  I stumbled across Memoirs of a Smalltime Villainess and A Jackal Among Serpents. Both on RR. They're both framed as people knowledgeable about a video game being dumped into it and trying to avert disaster. Light litrpg elements, with Memoirs having the heavier version. I don't generally like litrpg and won't read it, but these managed to sway me. The rational aspect is primarily from the MC, but in story characters still act as though they're people, not puppets.

  After a while Jackal becomes a little samey. Memoirs so far hasn't fallen into the trap. Probably because the MC is fabulously vulnerable. I almost wish there were more stories like that, of similar quality (Player enters game). It's about the only way I can tolerate litrpg elements and they're usually restricted to the MC, mostly, removing a lot of the worldbuilding issues. 

  Paranoid Mage shits me. It very swiftly moves out of the paranoia phase and turns the actual paranoia into Chekhov's guns to resolve an issue often found in the next chapter. At least the MC feels normal and sensible. Mostly. The edits (I don't know if they're patreon only) have done the story a world of good, removing a lot of the more boneheaded choices he's made. I don't mind the world building, but the story always feels like it's missing something. Wells, too - for all we've gotten some revelations since I last had a complain about him.

    > I almost wish there were more stories like that, of similar quality (Player enters game).

    Probably the best example off the top of my head is [Dungeon Defense](https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/dungeon-defense-toc/), even if it is... problematic in some ways. The MC is the top player of a brutally difficult RPG, and gets put into the body of the lowest villain - luckily, he arrives 10 years before the start of the game, and is also a total sociopath who is fully willing to do whatever it takes. I don't even know if I'd recommend either of the LN or WN - they have some major differences, and the LN is obviously higher quality, but got cancelled after 5 books, halfway through the action. Also, not really a LitRPG. The LN has some game elements, but they're so minor they might as well not exist.

    Of an entirely different tone, you may enjoy [Prophecy Approved Companion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion), where one character is a beta tester for a very simplistic full-dive RPG, where his only job is to break the game... and the MC is his AI companion.

  I'm reading *Stealer of Souls*, a collection of early Elric of Melnibone stories.

  Michael Moorcock wrote these angst-fests back in the 60s and published them in pulp magazines.
  The age kind of shows, but it's foundational to the genre, and I'm really enjoying the historical side.
  Both in terms of his sword-and-sorcery influences and in seeing themes and symbols which will turn up in fantasy for the next 50 years.

  For example, Warhammer's eight-pointed star of Chaos originates here.

    Nice! I've been reading Vance's Dying Earth series recently myself, and that's been a similar experience. The wistful fantastical tone is like the Dreamlands, the feuding wizards like Conan or Lankhmar, and the dying star and cloning projects like John Carter. 

    Vancian spellcasting is also interesting, because in these stories it feels like a natural progression from the three wishes of fairytales, rather than just a predecessor of D&D: instead of having open-ended wishes where the only question is how each wish will be worded to resolve the next problem, the wizards prepare their wonderfully-named spells and are faced with similar challenges but must select the right spell to resolve them. It reminds me of Sanderson's laws.

  There's a really excellent anime from 2002 called [12 Kingdoms](https://myanimelist.net/anime/153/Juuni_Kokuki), about a woman trying to take her rightful role as queen of one of the kingdoms to restore prosperity to the land. I also liked [Izetta](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33433/Shuumatsu_no_Izetta), where the "last witch" tries to protect an anonymous tiny European monarchy (and its adorable queen). I liked both shows because they featured rulers and powerful people truly caring about the people "under them".

  What are some works of fiction featuring privileged/powerful characters really caring about unprivileged or powerless characters?

      Virtuous people (like our protagonist) improve agricultural productivity and health outcomes by pure osmosis (not even joking).

      The guy she took over from was a total scumbag, so I don't even know if she's unusually good at her job.
      ```

    - u/GrizzlyTrees:
      ```
      It's a kind of theocracy where the divine messengers (Kirin) can sense the rightful ruler who gets the mandate of heaven, and so long as the ruler is good, the country prospers. A divinely enforced fisher king situation, basically. 

      They are given some magical powers that allow them to prevent corruption in their underlings (the Kirin stays with them, and they also can give their underlings immortality), so they mostly just need to not get seduced to corruption themselves, and everyone prospers forever. We get to see some good monarchs and some really crappy ones over the series, and the difference seems to be entirely a case of strength of character and morality, not talent or intelligence.
      Also, there seems to be some kind of medieval status quo in the fantasy world, probably justified by having a feudal system where the powerful are really long lived, and therefore tend towards traditionalism.

    The second-era Mistborn books (Alloy of Law, etc.) has the main character coming to terms with his public responsibilities as a B-plot. It's not a big focus of the books, but it's notable enough that it stuck with me.

    In fact, Brandon Sanderson follows that theme in general: Good people care for their peers and subordinates, all the way down to kings caring for peasants.  They don't always *demonstrate* that virtue because they aren't perfect, but it's clearly "good" in his worlds.

  If I may ask, are there any stories that spring to mind of small scale reality warpers?  Something where the power is relatively unlimited in scope but takes time to change much?  Essentially where the author put limits on it.

  The best/most consistent examples I have seen of this are stories where the character has narrative based powers (so the author at least has to think about what they can and can't do).  In particular, there was a worm fanfiction which featured a Taylor with blue/green morality that just cared about how good of a story she was in and constantly changed small details around her.

  I'm not saying the narrative based ones are intrinsically better but reality warpers tend to have poorly defined limits and their limits are often at least somewhat better defined.

    MC has unlimited power to reality warp locally. Has to deal with a cult of followers bent on starting a new religion and the regular DC villains. 

    The main complaints about this fic are that the MC comes off as whiny, but his mental fortitude and ethics are pretty much his only limits. (Other than a hard cap on range) Gets better with time, but unfortunately the fic looks to have been abandoned.

    This is not something that makes for good storytelling, at least in most usual senses. You could have it as a worldbuilding thing, like a city where this happened or a tree / forest. 

    &#x200B;

    But to write a story around this concept and keep it interesting and engaging would be challenging, most concepts that have things 'take time' are interesting but difficult to do in a story other than having it as part of the worldbuilding. 

    &#x200B;

    Try thinking like an author, how you write a story like that? How would you keep it engaging and good? Wouldn't it be more interesting to explore the concept from the some other perspective, like a person living in that area or as an archeologist studying it after the city fell?

  I've been reading through [The Rivers of London](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9317452-rivers-of-london) series, currently just finished the third book. The premise is sort of generic, young police officer gets inducted to the world of magic and supernatural beings, and slowly learns more about it while solving magic crimes in the city of London. The execution is where it delivers highly though. The writing is full of dry British wit, which I surprisingly did not get too tired of even in the third book. Magic is coming back (instead of fading away), and the protagonist is one of the pioneers of the field in the modern day. What I *really liked*, though, and it's something I've seen very rarely in most fiction let alone rational fiction, is the undertone of culture and lived-in-ness of the setting. 

  The Rivers of London is written such that the cultural history of London is turned magical, instead of just adding werewolves and vampires to the whole setting. Mama Thames is a powerful black woman who lives in a large luxury apartment with her daughters. Father Thames is the leader of a circus tribe and has been for hundreds of years. The books follow cases that reference London History, like Punch and Judy, or the Jazz bars of Soho, or the railway underground of London. The protagonist himself is a mixed race man who grew up in sort of high crime neighborhoods, and that is apparent in the way he describes people and places. It all feels authentic, like growing up in a city and picking up on its culture and slang and the best places to visit. The magic also reflects that. The way people sense magic is through impressions, which could be things like the sound of a dog barking, the feel of a bar right as violence is about to blow over, acrid smoke and the taste of rust, and so on. It's all very sensory, which enhanced the feel of the books in my opinion. 

  Now, it's not all perfect. The characters aren't really rational and it's pretty pulpy, so you can sort of predict the narrative arcs. Peter himself is a bit of a horndog in the first book, although he does mellow out a bit over the next books on account of some stuff that happens to him. The dry wit can get a bit much at times, and the stakes are pretty small. No saving the world plot here, only small Londonish cases with low bodycount. The magic itself is not very flashy, and even though the protagonist gets better at magic it's nowhere near enough to satisfy the instant gratification monkey inside me. But those are pretty small nitpicks. I'd recommend it if you're looking for some fun, low-ish stakes urban fantasy novels steeped and deep-fried in culture. 

  ___

  As for requests. I just finished Disco Elysium. Got the good ending with >!Kim alive!< and the protagonist being a sad cop with contradictory ultraliberal and communistic beliefs, which was pretty fun. I absolutely loved the game, one of the best experiences I've had with media in general. This game, too, feels steeped in culture and history, although this time in a more sad bent. Other people have done a better job shilling this game in this subreddit before, so I'll just say do yourself a favor and play this game if you enjoy reading. Not only is it written very well, it manages to be deeper than a puddle with its political discourse. 10/10. 

  Is there anything else like it? I've heard that [Loopkeeper](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/45782/loopkeeper-mind-bending-time-looping-litrpg) is a time travel litrpg that sorta plays with the "your thoughts and abilities are sentient characters playing theater in your mind" angle, but I haven't gotten too far into the book, especially since it went on KU.

    Have you played Planescape: Torment? I'd say it's the only other game in that genre (i.e., stat based talking simulator that actually lets you roleplay). It's an older game, if you decide to play it I recommend pushing on past the first few hours in the city, where you'll feel overwhelmed, especally as a modern gamer (you're given a lot less guidance than in a modern game). Consider spreading your points a bit during character creation (don't overpay for one high stat) and consider putting points into wisdom as you level up, as it tends to do a lot and be especially cool, though the other mental stats are also fun.

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      I second the recommendation for *[Planescape: Torment](https://www.gog.com/en/game/planescape_torment_enhanced_edition)*. Its spiritual successor, *[Torment: Tides of Numenera](https://www.gog.com/en/game/torment_tides_of_numenera)*, is also a very good story-focused game that rewards you for putting points into dialogue, investigation and/or exploration focused skills.

      Both games are great at giving you choices that affect who you are and how you interact with the world around you. I think that both game worlds also qualify as "steeped in culture and history" - both take place in non-standard fantasy settings that are often mysterious and unpredictable, enticing you to explore to find out what made them the way they are.

      Edit: *Planescape: Torment* is currently on sale for $6 on GOG or $4 on Steam, so now would be a great time to buy it and give it a try.

  I'm rereading Cradle's 11th book Dreadgod (by Will Wight), after finishing it a month ago and immediately dealing with withdrawal symptoms. Cradle is progression fantasy inspired by the chinese genre Xianxia (eastern fantasy with cultivation). It's well written, with cool world-building, solid character arcs, and enough plot twists to keep it interesting. It reminds me most of a well written shonen anime (like a better written Naruto or Bleach). The last book is particularly funny, though they are all somewhat humourous (except for the relatively dour first book). The books aren't really rational adjacent, since the plot seems to partly rely on shonen tropes, but the MC is pretty rational in his outlook and problem-solving methods - he commonly looks for the loophole or cheat when facing an "impossible" problem. The last book in the series is expected to come out next year, as the author publishes about two books a year.

  One of my favourite aspects of the series is that the MCs are relatively nice people, but tend towards "evil"-looking powers, so that they tend to have PR problems. Also, while they are quite clearly good guys, they are realistically selfish in a way that many characters in Cultivation stories aren't (they tend to be paragons of purity or psychopaths, with little in between).
  ```

  - u/Nick_named_Nick:
    ```
    Cradle is the pinnacle of what I have internally dubbed “if you’re reading this it’s too late” after the drake album, but the actual meaning is basically if you’re like me, looking in these threads for recommendations, then you should probably give it a go.

      I keep seeing this style of work being recommended and keep overlooking it as I have no idea what it is about.

      I'm going to take this as a sign to finally try one out.
      ```

      - u/GrizzlyTrees:
        ```
        Progression fantasy means its fantasy with core elements of growth and improvement over the story. Cultivation is a particular flavour that comes from eastern stories, and refers to some core ideas of each practitioner having a spiritual core that their magic runs on, and which can be improved, usually growing in discrete steps, through meditation, practice, combat, and using natural sources of spiritual energy (usually coming from plants, animals, and minerals) to add to the core. 

        So far, what I described can be considered only a very general guideline for world-building in the genre. Additionally, there are quite a lot of tropes associated with the genre. Cultivators are often grouped in sects, which are usually something between family, gang, and school. There is a common trope of young masters, privileged and not disciplined cultivators which the usually underdog MC can challenge. There is usually a lot of competition over cultivation resources, which tend to lead to might makes right philosophy, often coded into the culture and laws. Animals and plants growing their spiritual energy over time is also common, sometimes up to reaching sapience.

        Cradle is relatively unique in that it's written by an american rather than translated from chinese, which means the quality of the writing is high, and also the world-building and plot are also influenced by western fantasy. The result feels different to anything else I ever read, while still clearly constructed from familiar building blocks. It's also one of the most recommended series in r/progressionfantasy, along with Mother of Learning.

          Dragonball Z is already a Japanese take on a Chinese work, specifically Journey to the West, a 16th century novel.

  (Repost from Worth the Candle reflections thread:)  
  Pitch for *The Unwritten* comicbook series, my all-time favorite of the medium, though not necessarily "rational" as much as "metafictional and insightful, trying to form a deep take on the medium of storytelling itself":   
  What if belief in stories made them real, and brought power to those who most closely reflect them? Now what if (essentially) Daniel Radcliffe started realizing this as he began to tap into his Harry Potter archetype (and >!Jesus archetype!<, for that matter)?  Goes deep into what storytelling is and what it means, while traversing all the classics and the most meaningful archetypes and historical tropes.  Great artwork too

    Copying one of my older comments from/r/litrpg (Only a few of these are actually LitRPGs)


    Kano's Necromantic Comedy takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting, with the difference this time being that the apocalypse was almost definitely caused by necromancers. Consequently, humanity is dead and all that remains are various flesh constructs and ghouls. While some of these may look human, they very much aren't. Kano is one such flesh construct. The best, in fact - at least according to herself. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18423/kanos-necromantic-comedy

    The Iron Teeth follows a goblin who ends up being taken captive by a group of bandits, eventually joining them as a minion/pet/feral animal. It follows the goblins impressive rise from there, and while the series itself doesn't seem complete all of the individual books in it are. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale

    The Long and Exciting Life of Kreet the Kobold is a criminally under-read series of books because the author insists on writing a complete book at a time and releasing the whole thing onto Royal Road all at once, which is tantamount to suicide on that site. It's a coming of age story following a Kobold whose entire family was killed by adventurers. There are three complete books. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34005/the-long-and-exciting-life-of-kreet-the-kobold

    Undermind follows Saskia, a wannabee concept artist for a small independent videogame studio who has a seizure and wakes up surrounded by elves and in the body of a troll. This one has a lot more hidden depth to it than might be immediately apparent. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22019/undermind

    Onward to Providence follows Pylo, proud captain and sole crew member of an interstellar cargo ship. She's also a tentacle monster straight out of H.R. Giger's imagination. Even the humans are non-human in this, and it's beautifully illustrated. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34353/onward-to-providence

    Shade Touched is absolutely amazing. I completely, wholeheartedly recommend it. It follows an abnormally intelligent shadow monster as she tries to find out where she fits in the world. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched

    Super Minion is great. You've probably heard about it already, but it's great. The main character is an escaped lab experiment. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion

    The Last Human follows an avian thief in a city built on the ruins of a long-dead human civilisation. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38974/the-last-human/chapter/607643/part-1-the-very-last-one

    Soulless (Apparently) follows a murder mystery in a world of machines. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29493/soulless-apparently

    Fleabag follows a hound in a steampunk megacity. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46620/fleabag

    What Lies Within follows a refugee. To say more would be spoilers. (She's secretly a dragon) https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41093/what-lurks-within/chapter/643476/1-barmaid

      I’ve read both Shade touched and Fleabag, thankyou for all the recommendations.

    Ted Chiang's [*Exhalation*](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/) is maybe the best example of this. 

    Also, [OCTO](https://zalbert.net/octo/).

    Try [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) (☣️+🤖), currently on indefinite hiatus but pretty high quality.

    Also check out [The Iron Teeth](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale) (🦎), which is completed but I never got around to finishing. What I read of it was great though!

    YMMV: Tree of Aeons: https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20568/tree-of-aeons-an-isekai-story

    I recently caught up on this story (he’s a tree). It combines lots of different aspects of various genres (Litrpg, Isekai, Heroes vs Demons, magic, kingdom building) in a natural self-aware way. The writing itself isn’t superb (non native writer I think) and the characters aren’t super deep (most have their own gimmick which comes up every time they’re mentioned. Like one guy likes eating potato chips), but the world building isn’t horrible, and it’s overall an enjoyable read. Also, there are bad tree puns literally everywhere - you just ignore them after awhile.

    Onward to Provenance involves non-human protagonists who are considerably more non-human than the main characters of any of those stories. You may or may not enjoy them. For something closer, you may enjoy Patchwork Realms.

    ```
    *Children of Time* by Adrian Tchaikovsky alternates between following a human main character and successive generations of intelligent spiders, who *very much* do not think or act like humans.
