## [HF] Pyrebound 13.5

### Post:

Please do let me know what is and isn't working, as always.  I eventually want to edit this thing for publication, and reader feedback has been very helpful so far.

If you want to start at the beginning, click [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  A friend of mine described PB as "high-concept hard fantasy."  A malignant star rises in the sky instead of the sun every four days, and the devastation it causes reshapes human society into something horrible.  Rammash im-Belemel is chosen by the sun god--or somebody--to pay the price and keep it all running.  He's not enthusiastic about it.

  Woah.

  From the moment I started reading this chapter, I knew it would be an inflection point.

  Thank you for writing this story.

    You're quite welcome!  We're approaching endgame, certainly.

  I'm happy the story is back on track in terms of direction. The stretch from when they left the pyre to track down the Ensi till now felt a bit... directionless. I imagine that was part of the point -- certainly it mirrored the mind-set of the characters -- but it made it hard to really keep the thread of where the story was going. It also felt a little disjointed with many sudden changes in plans. Previously, I really liked how the story slowly built, with changes either being well foreshadowed, or clear turning points in the story. Here, it felt hard know what to expect and it seemed to go on for quite a while. The recent arc could have been either expanded, to allow full exploration of the changes in our hero's circumstances, or trimmed, to keep the plot moving crisply. 

  That said, I always hesitate to critique a story till it's finished. Reading the full story in a single go, this might come across as an good length nadir of the plot, or simply a period of uncertainty to offest the following clarity of focus.
