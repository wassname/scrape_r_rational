## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Recently a magic system has been rolling around my head and the ideas for it have kinda dried up.

  The general idea is that as you train whatever part of yourself it grows. I think I have a good idea of how the body grows in the magic system but I wanted to apply that to the mind.

  So far I have a couple rankings as this would be a xianxia. The general theme is acceptance/denial of certain traits as they grow. Managing yourself so you don't grow crazy.

  Fearless/fearful-whether or not you can accept your fear as it grows. Basically because all things in your mind grow you have to either remove all fear from yourself, accept all your fears, or cultivate specific fears that you can handle. This would be the cultural first step but you can do them in any order.

  Emotional/emotionless-pretty much a rewrite of fear. As emotions grow you either need control, removal, or acceptance. Also pretty excited to write characters with built in flaws because either way is pretty messed up.

  Truthless/truthful-acceptance or denial of your personality traits. Attempting to mold yourself into an ideal or just be. Probably the weakest of the three I have so far. Not very well defined in how or what to do to achieve either. I think it's probably okay to be very undefined just because it's so wishy-washy in real life as well.

  Faithless/faithful-a self consistent belief system or pure nihilism. It's pretty extreme just because if you have two conflicting beliefs that grow powerful then it will inevitably lead to a mental break. Probably the one I'm most comfortable with. Very excited about writing it. So many diverse ways of thinking that are explicitly a part of every single character.

  That's all I got and I think I want 5 total ranks. Also any world building thoughts related to this stuff would be really cool.

  Thanks in advance!!

    I have a setting with a similar magic system. 

    It has certain similarities to xianxia. Many spiritual approaches to magic share concepts with Daoism and Buddhism. There's also focus on internal and other types of martial arts. However, there are plenty of practitioners whose perspective and practices more closely resembles the athleticism/martialism of the ancient Greeks, Persians, Vikings, Meso-Americans, etc. 

    The general idea is that the abilities of organisms, particularly humans, are limited more by time, effort, attitude, and creativity rather than more built-in biological factors. Magic permeates the entirety of existence, but most of its potential remains untapped. This has factored into how life has evolved from the start, creating many unique environmental resources and dangers. 

    Humans by far are the best species at consciously working with magic. In theory, magic can be used to enhance any physiological trait. In practice, it's not easy to do so. There are individuals who can toss around and rip grown men apart like they're made of straw, but that takes years of careful, rigorous study and excruciating, dangerous practice. The drawbacks you listed are similar.

    Superhuman practitioners like that always suffer from symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Their religion is usually their main source of psychological reinforcement in the best of cases. In others, they may basically be living the life of an intelligent, anhedonic shrew, living for their own survival and the fleeting experience of consumption, often of drugs or darker fixations. Most practitioners engage with magic in moderation for these reasons. 

    Users will be confronted with their own physical and mental shortcomings constantly and they can choose to react in a variety of ways like what you laid out.

      I honestly didn't even consider how genetics would interact with magical body improvement. Bloodline abilities and the rabbit hole of world building that entails. Don't even know if I want to go down that road honestly. The main theme of the book would be the common pitfalls in the path of every human and contrasting the different paths that arise. Faith vs nihilism. How all humans deal with the same problems and the different people that come out of the crucible. 

      It would fuck up the theme if they were all different from the start.

      Weird idea inspired from that topic in the context of xianxia, but a cultivation path in a xianxia story based on parthenogenesis, where all the cultivation you do is stored until you give birth to an improved clone of yourself, would be bizarre and interesting. It'd focus on a character who wants to see a vessel for their values grow, rather than their own individual strength grow, which is kind of the core perspective typical xianxia takes. So you could switch the protagonist after every (re)birth to the new one after a short period of parenthood of the clone that leaves the protagonist consistently vulnerable. The massive subversion of xianxia tropes, when the story is about "cultivating your offspring" rather than "yourself," as well as the typical "protag has a harem strung out across centuries" deal being bizarrely applied and ignored with asexual reproduction.

      I'd have to read the supplementary links on identity the bloke who's doing "There Is Nothing To Fear" bought up the other day in his discussion thread on this subreddit, since the main character of that sees his identity in such a manner anyway.

    Hmmm... your *culture* would have a big influence on your choices there. For example; consider the stereotypical British minor nobility. Come what may, he keeps a stiff upper lip, and refrains from falling into emotion. So, people from that culture would - more often than not - fall on the 'emotionless' side of things. (One who fell into the "accept-my-emotions" side would be a bit of a rebel).

    But that implies that there may be some known psychological weaknesses of entire *cultures*. And cultures can be recognised in all sorts of ways. So, it may (for example) be very well-known to the people of Valley X that, if you spot a wizard in a top hat and a monocle, you can kill him by quickly yelling "People need emotions to feel human!" (or something).

      >People need emotions to feel human

      But what is humanity tho? 

      I've haven't put a lot of thought into an old culture just because it would mostly be for the purpose of having a familiar setting. The aesthetic would be earth like but the bones of any culture in the world would be constructed by the magics effect on the people.

      Bigger stratification between levels of power. More isolated because exposure to different ideas can be legit harmful. Disdaining of any outward emotional display because it's evidence of a lack of control. Some lack of fear so a wildly eclectic society without fear of social ostracizing.

      The biggest one would be the incredibly sectarian (arising from the need to form a self consistent ideology and how that essentially works like a cult if you spread it) and internally hierarchical nation states. 1000s instead of 100s of countries. Leading to constant power struggles.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Eh, that's fair. I was only using a caricature of an old culture to have a familiar setting to hang my points on, anyhow.

        But the basic idea is valid for all cultures. A Wizard from culture A will probably have certain culture-specific biases in his thoughts and ideas - ideas which are safe in *his* culture. But the people from Culture B, in that other valley over there... well, they probably know *exactly* which ideas would be most harmful to the Culture A wizards, and how to compress them down into a sentence or two. (Similarly, Culture A knows how to take down Culture B's wizards).

        Depending on the relations between the cultures, this can lead to interesting practices. For example, let's say that Culture A and Culture B are trying to set up peace talks (they both agree that the war's gone on way too long). Of course, at some point they must meet in person. Being sensible folks, they agree to meet without wizards (it's amazing what a hostile wizard can do when he has all the enemy rulers in front of him...). And to enforce this, they start the meeting by yelling wizard-killing insights at each other before they even get close...

        Of course, there's one type of wizard that these insights *don't* work on, and that's the Rebel Wizard. Rebel Wizards make at least one choice in their basic setup that runs *contrary* to their cultural norms. Now, that doesn't imply that they're *antagonistic* towards their culture - often quite the contrary. And if they've flipped on the *correct* choice, then they're immune to the Wizard-killing phrase from the other culture over there. (But they might not be immune to Culture C's phrase, because they might not have flipped on that part of their culture). Unfortunately, the Rebel Wizard might very well be vulnerable to their own side's wizard-killing insight...

          I don't envision the logic bomb/killing phrase working like this at all. Makes more sense that this would be a highly individual thing. In the sense that any culture would have to find a belief system without a logic bomb. A particular way of thinking without obvious flaws. Or they wouldn't exist. 

          Seems more likely that it would be a mind game played long term between wizards. I.e. make wizard A believe x through extremely precise gaslighting. Then wait for that idea to have power/taken root in his head. Then disprove it for a stunning blow in combat. 99% of these things wouldn't be lethal simply because every wizard knows how to deal with these exact logic bombs. It would be big character defining defects that get shoved in his face that would kill him.

          The cultural aspect is necessarily somewhat stable and not self destructive imo. At least in the long term.

          Setting up the talks in the first place would be terrifying. Imagine receiving a letter from an enemy nation, it could contain a request for peace or it could be an assassination plot where the contents of the letter highlight contradictions in the reader’s beliefs. This turns letters into bombs which must be carefully disarmed, perhaps by preparing counter arguments to defuse predicted contradictions (which can only be discovered by trying to contradict your beliefs which is akin to suicide) and you might have “poison testers” which instead of eating food to see if it’s poisoned before their employer tries it, read their letters to see if it’s an attack or not, courtiers become powerful military units and a dangerous job to do. Also, considering this is about ideas as opposed to specifically words you could use paintings, poems, songs, etc. To equally as lethal effect, it also would have an affect on the opinions surrounding censorship and the way information is consumed. Certain pieces of artwork could be used like Trojan horses, you create something which seems normal or conformative and then you wait for it to spread amongst the populace and then “activate” it by revealing its true meaning and weaponising the idea which has been reinforced since they first saw it, like a virus it hijacks their belief system and makes it no longer self-consistent e.g. imagine if someone’s entire belief was based around love and they believed the love preached by the song “you’re beautiful” by James blunt to be something that reinforced their belief/was the same as their belief and so it becomes part of what grows that belief, then the artist reveals it is a song about stalking and is not true love, that would poison that belief, like a disease which causes the immune system of the body to attack itself, the belief would attack itself?

          - u/CCC_037:
            ```
            I thought it was only the Wizards which were vulnerable to Idea-based assassination. So, as long as the King is not a Wizard, he can safely read any letter he likes. (Well. Once the letter has been checked for contact poisons. ...you know, maybe having some clerk read the letter to the King would be safer. When there are no Wizards within earshot).

            > Certain pieces of artwork could be used like Trojan horses, you create something which seems normal or conformative and then you wait for it to spread amongst the populace and then “activate” it by revealing its true meaning and weaponising the idea which has been reinforced since they first saw it

            This reminds me of the *Spine of the Cosmos* from Starslip Crisis. An artwork that causes anyone who sees it to become the slave of the owner...

            ...*but* only if the viewer properly understands the context of the artwork. So the villain who owns it then also has to spend several minutes explaining the context...

              I love the idea of people being engaged in a fight and the villain saying STOP! and the heroes are polite enough to stop and listen to him explain the context of his painting haha :) I was more thinking when it comes to the art and stuff being used as a weapon you could inform them about its context through its use e.g, if there was a murderer who killed someone and leaves a symbol of an animal e.g. a goat, a crab, etc. Then you can inform people of the context/meaning with how you use it, you could kill one person during a certain zodiac period and leave your calling card as the animal associated with that season. Or perhaps it’s based off of a famous legend from their homeland and by painting an abstract version of that legend it remains a mystery until someone learns of the legend in which case the meaning of the painting becomes obvious, perhaps it’s one of the famous exploits of the character who painted it, whilst this example isn’t about a painting I think the tridam ultimatium used by renfi on Geralt is a good example from the Witcher books, I think it was in “The Last Wish”.

                Ha. Why would the heroes stop and listen? No, the villain had to go out of his way to create technology that allowed him to project his voice directly into the hero's spaceships even after the heroes have turned off their radios (it was a sci-fi story)... there was a hilarious back-and-forth between the villain trying to use the Spine of the Cosmos on the heroes while the heroes desperately try to prevent him from using the Spine on them.

  Take a D&D setting, roughly working on RAI core rules but with house rules that unfetter fighters, rogues and similar characters from having to seem plausibly non-magical even at 20th level. (For fighters this looks like the Tome of Battle and/or fighters who have acquired 30 fighter bonus feats by 10th level. For skill-focused characters it's a more complex system of making skill DCs scale more shallowly so that superhuman feats like "hide from someone you are currently grappling" is possible for a stealth specialist around level 15.) Stipulate that while 'level' is a heavily-simplified abstraction, XP is real, not as discrete points but in the sense that *experience* is a metaphysical fluid gained by roughly the things that D&D grants XP for, and gaining more of it makes you more powerful in a curve resembling the level progression. 

  Then, apply an extra constraint: [the universe is split into level bands](https://plain-dealing-villain.tumblr.com/post/178204587282/the-divine-shells). Anyone who reaches 6th level disappears from the level 1-5 world and appears in the 6-10 world. The same with someone who reaches 11th, 16th, and epic. Conversely, if you are born in the level 6-10 world you will be a 6th level character by the time you reach adulthood.

  Given that preamble: what does life look like in the higher-band worlds? Trying to crowdsource this to get more perspectives and nudge the DM into making the setting more complete.

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    Here's a wholesome hot take for you: the highest level bands are all post-scarcity utopias. Everyone's basic necessities are trivial to supply, you barely even notice the spell slots! People showing up from the lower bands are carefully integrated into society with lots of therapy (Psionics!) and assistance in finding either prosocial civilian uses for their abilities and habits or in joining the task forces that contain the various monster/antisocial polities/outbreaks.
    ```

    - u/Auroch-:
      ```
      I have doubts they'd be more post-scarcity than us; they have easier access to basics, but also far more danger. For example, one of the other setting features is that the banding effects don't apply to dragons; dragons go wherever they like. So even in the 16-20 band, you see wandering dragons of CR 30 (maybe higher), which takes a hell of a task force to put down. And it's still pretty hard to get from level 16 to 20, about as hard as from 1 to 5 in the lowest band. (So, 1 per 10,000 or less, IIRC).
      ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:
        ```
        A single CR30 dragon against a level 16 adventuring party is a fun fight, not a hell of a challenge. Level 8 spells are a helluva drug. And *the median adult* is level 16! 

        You don't have *guards* at that point so much as you have paragons of the expression of power casually playing at being guards because the only thing more fun than taking the Band back out to go prune the Nidhogg-spawn is going one on one with a Dire Troll while your kids heckle your form.

        (It's possibly I'm extremely silly.)

        - u/Auroch-:
          ```
          A single CR 30 dragon with prep time can curbstomp a standard four-man party of 16th level. And a dragon has centuries of prep time.
          ```

          - u/PastafarianGames:
            ```
            Sure, but the same goes for the standard four-man party of 16th level, and while the dragon has centuries of prep time, there are minimum a half-dozen late-teens/early-twenties standard four-man parties of 16th level adventurers in every village. And every one of those parties grew up having pretend-fights where their big brothers played the dragon while they ran around going "NUH-UH, you're a FIRE dragon and I cast FIRE IMMUNITY" while pretending their sticks were Infinity-Plus-One Swords.

            I'm way sillier than you are, I think is my take here.

            ```
            This is sorta an area where mechanics run afoul of world building. 5e is dominated by the action economy. I'm sure a CR 30 dragon could stomp a standard party of 16th level adventurers (Klauth nearly killed my party of 5 and we were all level 15), but in a world where everyone is a 16th level adventurer, the idea of a four-person party is obsolete. 

            Any time the dragon attempts anything overtly dragon-y (barring the occasional exception), every character present will have viable combat options on their initiative count. If the dragon were to attack a village, they'll get swarmed.

            That said, there are also evil characters or characters who will willingly align themselves to the dragon and rounding out combat in interesting ways is part of the DMs job. Whether these villainous high-level characters are also common enough to disrupt society or not is another conversation, but I think by and large, post-scarcity societies are within the realm of possibility.

            Edit: I just sorta cleaned up my phrasing and sentence structure a little bit.

              This is for 3.5. Or, something around as similar to 3.5 as Pathfinder is. There's going to be a lot of house rules, trying to solve various problems (and probably replace them with other problems but at least they'll be novel). The house ruleset is called 3.Q, mostly because I think it's funny.

              It's probably still true that the action economy means a village has a leg up on a dragon, but CR 30 dragons...well, actually there isn't any RAW CR 30 dragon, reds go up to 26 and gold to 27. But 
              extrapolating, they'd have a low-epic caster level. So they could pull "Quickened Greater Invisibility, Extended Time Stop" and go from the edge of town to the mayor's bedroom before anyone knew they were attacking. And then Time Stop again on their way out. 9th-level spells are terrifying.

    There would probably be people who carefully try to cap their level to stay in a particular world, trying to be a big fish in a small pond. These people could be tricked into accidentally levelling up at inopportune moments. Friends and family would have to coordinate levelling up to jump worlds at the same time, and willingness to level up would be a major factor in social relationships.

    In higher-level worlds, there would likely be factions that want to limit the number of newcomers or even get rid of them entirely; they would have security forces devoted to hunting down people who reached their world by levelling up, and shibboleths to identify people who were born there. People who actively try to level up would likely be people who are highly motivated and without considerable social or economic attachments; such types might be stereotyped as unscrupulous, dangerous, amoral in their pursuit of power, etc. In other words, they would be the kind of people who are willing to uproot themselves in search of better opportunities, like immigrants, and they would be treated poorly as immigrants often are.

      Leveling enough to switch bands is a rare occurrence, even for the ambitious. In line with the standard demographics given in 3.5 DMG which apparently weren't SRD'ed, but hitting level 6 from level 1 is something like a 1:100,000 thing.

    Is it possible to decline an ascension? Is there contact between the different realms? 

    If one can't decline to ascend, and there is no contact between the realms, then the whole thing is kind of doomed, and very few people will be motivated to ascend. When you boil it down, what people will work and fight for is a **comparative advantage** over their **peers**, not for an arbitrary measure of rank. If being level 5 or 10 makes you a lord of your world, but being level 6 and 11 makes you a peon again, why the hell would the average person want that?

    So that leaves you with only the people who are unusually ambitious, aggressive and/or otherwise emotionally/motivationally privileged to ascend to the next world. Now, imagine a world where this subset of people continuously remove themselves from society. Whether they possess a quality that is socially cultivated or genetic, it seems inevitable that the supply in the first would will decrease. This is especially true if reaching level 6 is relatively trivial for motivated individuals, and thus they don't really have time to procreate by the time they leave. 

    If your worldbuilding reflects that it would be interesting.  An idea is that the first world experiences an accelerating decline due to "brain drain". Another is that people are socially incentivized to have children with level 5 people. 

    Maybe I missed it, but what happens if you have a child in bands ≥2? Is it born at level 0, and stay in whatever band it's in, or is it born at the minimum of whatever band it's in? If it's the former, the child will be at a severe disadvantage, like a noob starting in a high level zone, and the latter, then I can see a wide appeal to ascending, as you now can have demigod children and actually build a sustainable society in higher worlds.
    ```

    - u/Auroch-:
      ```
      > Is it possible to decline an ascension? Is there contact between the different realms?

      You can try. This will in most cases be highly hazardous to the health and sanity of everyone around you, however, so they will probably insist. At swordpoint. And in the cases where you *can* refuse indefinitely without risk to your surroundings, you can only do it by not *using* your power. (This is easiest for a wizard, who just has to stop casting their highest couple levels of spells; this creates the 'absent-minded ancient wizard' archetype for free, since they'll be *capable* of casting powerful magic but mostly forget the details due to lack of practice. Contrast with a legendary soldier, who can't really stop being preternaturally buff and skilled and so doesn't get a choice. IIRC they have a tradition of sending knights off to fight dragons, which will generally either get them killed or send/ascend them on their way.)

      Contact is limited but I'm not sure how much; previous iterations said that no matter could travel backwards except dragons and fey, but that got walked back and I'm not sure where the boundaries are as it stands.

    Higher band worlds become pretty insane and terrifying, especially the 20+ world.

    Empires clash with scry-and-die tactics. Evil wizards and liches rampage across the world raiding magic shops and ambushing anyone carrying useful magic items. Powerful people are turned into pawns of even more powerful wizards with dominate person and cursed items.

    Divination allows countries to see that a war will happen soon, and the stronger country goes to war immediately to prevent the weaker one from building up. Most wars end up happening for unknown reasons, armies are just suddenly teleported into city centers to butcher the population because diviners divined diveners in the future divining the war happening in the future.

    If killed in combat, few people go to the afterlife anymore, and just as few get resurrected. Standard combat tactics now involve destroying or imprisoning the enemy's soul to prevent them from coming back. A defensive countermeasure is to kill oneself and liberate your own soul from your body before the enemy can take it. As a result, battles rarely take longer than about six seconds for one side to launch the surprise attack and the survivors of the other side to escape into the afterlife or teleport away if able.

      Separately, this doesn't seem plausible to me. If that was likely, there wouldn't *be* magic shops. All magic items would be commissioned, or possibly fashioned in secret (under magical and nonmagical concealment) and sold at auction without the item being physically present until the winning bid was verified.

  Oneshot crack idea in a similar vein to 17776 (which I need to actually read, I started it briefly the other week on mobile and stopped once I got to a video because I didn't have headphones on me) of car racing with unrestrained use of technology. Since an augmented DeLorean would "make it to the finish line" faster than any other traditional form of locomotion, a race where timetravel becomes the core tool utilized to end up on the finish line immediately after the race "starts" could be a unique story.

  The fact it'd devolve into an absurd "Wacky Races but make it sci-fi" scenario is probably a selling point. And the idea that any way to tell the story in-universe would have to be by someone observing the actions "sequentially" rather than "chronologically", and temporarily handing godlike powers/comprehension to a pair of race commentators who do the storytelling aspect fits the race theme, and I also find "unimaginable power turned to minor entertainment" (like a less horrific version of "entity grants someone a monkey's paw wish") to be a fun trope.

  No idea how it'd be rational, it'd probably read like a series of ass-pulls or require half the writing dedicated to set-up before the race starts. But time-travel and racing munchkinry as the focus of the story is rational-adjacent at least.

  A person keeps getting Isekai'd.

  It's happened to him 15 times before. Each time, he finds a way back to Earth; back to his family, back to his life. There's a time compression effect, so every month he spends in the other world is a day on Earth.

  He gets a boon every time, a boon which is at full power in another world but still gives a little bit of a boost on Earth. 

  His first boons were all language-related; a boon each to hear, speak, read, write, and think in other languages. (The reading and writing one also happen to give him sign language fluency.) That's five boons.

  What other boons should he take? They should all be... basic. Tutorial-level boons, if you will. I'm thinking poison resistance, disease resistance, mana-sight, and being able to eat basically anything, that's four. Maybe an Analyze/Identify active ability?

  The idea of the broader story is that on his sixteenth trip, his family gets pulled in with him into basically-Carcosa, and the tutorial is over.

    What's basically-Carcosa like? If these boons are tutorial boons, basically, then they should be prepping the protagonist for that specific environment (e.g. poison resistance is only useful if poison is common on Carcosa, and otherwise something else might be a better boon).

    You know you'll be exploring a new world. So, take exploration boons.

    Analyze/identify/appraisal, since you'll see so many new things. Eidetic memory, since you'll be learning so many things for the first time.

    If wilderness is possible, then toxin resistance, endurance, tracking, hunting.

    If civilization seems likely, then rapid language learning, "good first impression", etiquette bonus, negotiation bonus.

    Almanac: stare at something and you start hearing the voice of a bored expert, describing the object/place/person encyclopedia-style to a class of young kids. It appears to be somehow an actual recording of an alien classroom. Not advised to stare at yourself in the mirror once you have this boon.

    You Are Here: whenever you say or think "I'm lost," a map appears in your head. The map is filled in wherever you've been, and anywhere that's "common knowledge" for your current social group. This has weird effects when you get promoted, or adopted...

    Cooking for Dummies: stare at potential food while holding a cooking tool, and a recipe pops up. If you're holding a skewer while looking at a live crocodile, you get a recipe for crocodile meat on a stick. With helpful advice on skinning the crocodile, but no advice on how to kill it...

    Just Needed Tuning Up: any object you use behaves as if it's been recently cleaned and serviced, as long as the maintenance is something ordinary rather than supernatural or exotic. Doesn't fix a broken knife, but you can cut with a rusty knife like it's sharp, open a stuck door like it's been oiled, or read an ancient book like it's been cleaned of mold and dirt.

      Rapid language learning and etiquette (pretty much the whole mundane communications suite) is definitely in the set of his first five boons.

      I love the "Just Needed Tuning Up" boon. It's especially funny since he's an engineer and his wife is a computer scientist, so there's a lot of room for "it works as soon as you call tech support" style jokes in the real world.

      I could not possibly do Almanac any way other than Steve Irwin. Now that I think of that, I cannot possibly *avoid* doing Almanac, can I? Which feels exclusive with Analyze/Identify/Appraisal.

    Since cognitive boons are demonstrably an option: 

    Math. Being supernaturally good at math should help in nearly any world. 
    Memory. Again, better memory will help always.
    Kinesthesia. 
    Theory Of Mind. 
    Disease resistance goes way, way before poison resistance. Poisons are rare, diseases are ubiquitous in many, many settings.

  I'm doing some creative writing on an alternate universe of 1920s NYC. The police carry enchanted weapons, and like to name them. The names are usually some variation of 1910s and '20s jargon. Examples are Shincracker, Bash, and Suffrage. I'd be happy to take any names you might offer up. Thanks!

    I don't have any suggestions but /r/namenerds is a great place to go for all things naming related. It mostly focuses on baby names but they definitely help with this sort of thing, too!

  I have an idea for an rpg, it is where you play a bunch of mary sues. the idea is that you have to play out a chapter of a book, an episode of television, or a scene in a movie, without devouring it and making it such garbage that the reader stops reading and destroys the universe.
