## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I know a lot of people here are into AI, and the vast majority of AI learning (of e.g. weights in neural nets) is done in an optimization framework, so I was wondering if anyone could advise on an (ostensibly simple) optimization question I had earlier this week? https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/nlvbgz/what_optimization_algorithms_eg_as_implemeted_in/

  I am currently looking for useful productivity tools as I am gearing up for some major resource/time investment into politics/policymaking/campaigning.  
  I have a new android phone and a laptop with dual boot win10/ubuntu for this purpose, and am looking for good tools that will let me save time working with a small team. Security and data protection is important, open-source software preferred.  
  I am not looking for anything specific, rather recommendations or hacks for all sorts of purposes from multi-platform calendar synchronization to good news roundups and any useful thing I haven't thought of yet. I am tech-savvy and don't mind investing a few hours to make something work if the end result pays off over a timespan of a few months.  


  thanks for any tips!

  I was curious about alternative punishments beyond fines and prison time for crimes. As I recently read in the news about the rise of incidents with people fighting, making a big scene, and calling the cops over masks, politics, and people unsatisfied with their service. You know people hitting flight attendants, throwing food at a waiter, things like that. Fines don't really seem to deter anyone especially the wealthy unless its a percentage of income which I believe is rare in the world and jails have their own issues. Though admittedly this is more of an issue for only certain countries. A buddy of mine suggested bringing back old time corporal punishment or public humiliation. I'm against corporal punishment as it seems way to open to abuse. But I think I could support bringing people known for dangerous behavior like drunk driving, constant assaults, or harassment to be punished by being put in the stocks in a public place or a walk of shame if constant jail time and fines don't seem to work. I also know several people who would accept a public whipping for reduced jail or prison time.

    How about more guidance and help for criminals instead of more punishment?

    Especially for those cases about people who call cops over masks or politics: More punishment is likely to only further divide the society, in my opinion.

    Maybe for people who break the law out of sheer boredom or something like that public humiliation would help. But there's already something like that, without being explicit about wanting to humiliate: community service.

    The problem with making the punishments worse to get back at rich people is that it's also affecting the other people. How would the law differentiate between the two?

    Judicial corporal punishment evolved independently among many different cultures and is/was a feature of every pre-modern and early modern culture that is considered highly successful. This is despite the fact that corporal punishment isn't very rehabilitating. There is other merit to the practice besides reforming criminals.

    It's deeply cathartic, both for the victims of crime and for society as a whole to see evil punished. When done publicly, it's somewhat of a deterrent against potential criminals, although arguably not very much since criminals assume they won't get caught. It also provides a constructive lifestyle/pastime for people with sadistic tendencies. 

    It's extremely cheap to implement to. The first city-states several millennia ago could do it easily, and today we could do it even better, safer as well.

    We're talking strictly about punishment, but corporal methods could easily be combined with attacking crime at its roots (poverty/alienation/illness/etc.) as well as a penal system which also rehabilitates.

  It occurred to me this week that the music video for, "[Once in a lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IsSpAOD6K8)" would make for a very elegant, "bottle in the cosmic ocean" like the Voyager Golden Record, a representation of humanity as a whole:

  - It's a New Wave song, which is itself a broadly influenced genre, but also has a lot of emphasis on artfulness, humor, eccentricity, and innovation. It'd minimize a single style being overrepresented and what style it does have is descriptive of human culture.

  - The lyrical themes are universal to humans, even if they were intended for a particular generation's concerns. The meaning of life, authenticity, the inevitability of time passing, pursuing a stereotypically prosperous life, and the unconscious mind. 

  - Lyrics are in English, the most common second-language, third most common native tongue, the most widely spoken human language and the most common *lingua franca*. The vocabulary isn't overly complex, doesn't have many niche references, and has minimal slang.

  - It features several dances and rituals from a wide variety of cultures ranging from Africa to East Asia as well as clips of the people in question. Byrne is wearing relatively widespread and timeless formal attire. 

  - As far as music videos go, the visuals and special effects are minimal. Most of the focus is placed on the people. It still showcases a few of the particularly interesting ones. The sounds aren't cluttered either, and it has both samples of singing and talking. 

  - On top of displaying the range of human motion, there are several closeups of the human face, the part of the body that plays the largest role in communication. 

  Admittedly I don't watch a ton of music videos. Feel free to suggest equal or better examples.

    I personally can't think of a music video that I'd be comfortable showing to aliens without having to explain a lot of context.

    On a almost completely tangential note, if you have Amazon Prime, the 1984 concert film of the Talking Heads is available:

    Utterly fantastic, fantastic concert film, making me wish I could travel back it time to see it live.

      Is "the entire history of the world I guess" a music video?

        That's probably going too far in the other direction. :-)

        But getting back to /u/Camaraagati's idea about "Once in a Lifetime"... I mean, I don't think I can explain David Byrne to other *people*, let alone aliens. If that Talking Heads video is their only exposure to humanity I don't know what they're going to take away from that. They might not understand that legs are used for walking, for example.

        And then I started thinking about other *good* music videos (rather than the ones where the band is basically just standing around and pretending to play their instruments), and I couldn't think of any that would make much sense without explaining the context and metaphor used.

        The closest would likely be one of those country music videos where the couple breaks up in the beginning, but gets back together at the end (I don't have a specific example). But that might give the wrong impression about relationships.
