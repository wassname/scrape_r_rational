## Pyrebound 16.4

### Post:

Six installments left now, I hope.

[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/chapter-16-4/](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/chapter-16-4/)

Pyrebound is an original-world story, a bit shy of 250K words now, featuring deep worldbuilding, political intrigue, and what the ancient Near East might be like if the priests had immensely powerful fire magic and an evil star replaced the sun every four days.  [https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/) is the first installment, for those of you who want to start there.

As ever, I welcome any comments, questions, concerns, critiques, or original yo' mama jokes, whichever you happen to have handy.  Thanks for reading.

    Yeah, I couldn't think of any way to foreshadow this beyond the revelation in the rain itself to tell readers "something about a rainstorm around a pyre gives Ram the idea that Mannagiri's not invincible after all."  Wellsprings were introduced waaaaaaaaay back when (Ram visits a wellspring in 1.4 IIRC, and they're mentioned maybe three or four more times in-text), but there's no particular reason the reader would hang onto them as relevant.  So it was a storytelling problem with no clear solution.  TYVM for giving feedback, I depend on it to know when the story's going off the rails.

    (I thought of the armor as just a fun bonus to show that Ram wasn't sitting around with his thumb up his butt the whole time; the real killer app is the heatsink shield IMO)
