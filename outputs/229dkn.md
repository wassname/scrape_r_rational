  New job + new board game to work on = little time to write, but it's finally done. I'll get around to fine-toothed editing tomorrow at some point: in the meantime enjoy, and as always, feedback of all kind is appreciated!

  I like it!

  Also, that is not how sleep deprivation works for me at all. I might be tired, but if something important happened, like the phone ringing, or some dick _stealing my hat_ I'd be halfway across the room in seconds before even noticing I was up. Five hours of sleep should allow you to at least function enough for breakfast, no? Do people seriously get like this when they don't have enough sleep?

    Sleep deprivation is like any other brain-altering substance: effects may vary.

    Red is 11. Kids have different sleep requirements than adults.

    Thanks!

    For me it depends on what I did the day before :)  If I was mostly sedentary, getting up when I didn't get enough sleep can be brute-forced.  If I spent it physically active, it's much harder.

    Anecdotal Evidence Alert: For me, five hours is the absolute minimum. I'm not a morning person in general, but I can't properly follow any conversation with only five hours of sleep. At least, not without caffeine.

  > It takes Red a full two seconds to subtract eight from three to calculate how long he slept.

  Don't you mean three from eight?

    I did in fact mean that :) Fixed!
