  Does the party size cap apply outside of dungeons? I know that the percentage contribution system is different.

    Chapter 101:

    >Blues were much more common in lairs than they were outside, but the party cap of eight meant that killing one was difficult. Outside of a lair, the limit on party size still applied, but nothing stopped you from just bringing more parties. That made it slightly easier; however, only one party—the one that delivered the killing blow—could receive credit.

    I'd been holding off for two months, came back to it today, it really does flow a lot better when you read it in batches instead of once per week.

    It reminds me of what Will Wight said about his writing process for Cradle, where he cuts as much fat and chaff off as possible and only leaves the essential information. And with all the worldbuilding you see him provide in his comments(as seen on AbidanArchive), he could add so much more to each volume.

    On the other hand, I feel Delve has way too much unnecessary and frankly boring information in. The pace is dragged down because every single detail is expounded upon. Was that chapter on Kettel necessary? We already knew he was a weak ordinary fire mage and an idiot and that his party was irrelevant to the story. For this chapter, half of it focused on the tank-thing, but I don’t think it needed that much detail. Same when covering every single aspect of preparing to travel, or the 4+ chapters of him training in a cave, or every other time a long chapter only covers one semi-important event.

    I think if Delve cut down on all these unnecessary details and insignificant conversations with insignificant and boring characters, we’d be a lot further along and have something of substance. I’ll be frank, every chapter it feels like nothing important happens. In Cradle only the necessary details are included to continue the story, while I feel like Delve constantly retreads the same topics every chapter. I don’t want to be mean, but I was initially excited to read this new chapter and almost fell asleep at the end.

    As someone who just binged it from the start, the pacing is actually excellent when reading it as a "finished" work.

    A lot of web serials, especially comics, try to pace it so the weekly updates are each impactful. There's upside to thar approach but it definitely results in a lesser work when read all at once.

    Eh. There are virtually no stories that get posted in this sub that wouldn't benefit from an editor, or could be cut down in length quite a bit without losing much.  I find this one fairly charming in a kind of quirky way.  The author just feels genuinely excited about his world building, set pieces and occasional navel gazing, and the system is genuinely well done litRPG bait. 

    Is Rain cringey? Oh yeah, he sure is.  But I read this in the same way I'd play a walking simulator...  I don't think it's meant to be exciting, it's just engaging, laid back isekae comfort food.

    Seconded.

    The entire first half about the wagon was so fucking boring and useless. 

    At least the second half dipped a toe back into the System. We haven't interacted with the System in dozens of chapters. Everything else about the story (characters, dialogue, prose, plot) is so dull and flat and uninspired. Or filled with cringey memes. 

    But I really enjoy the System the author created so I'll stick with the story
    ```

      Disagree. Occasionally (rarely thank goodness) parts of this story feel boring, useless and filler. Steampunk tank wagon wasn't one of them.




      If the reality of the tank wasn't enough awesome for you, Tallheart's obvious delight matched with Rain's gushing fanboy squee was such a nice bookend to a long arc of tension, anxiety and responsibility. These guys have a relationship that goes a long way to keep the story out of boring litrpg meme territory and seeing them relax enough to express delight to each other is plenty rewarding.

        Steampunk is overpraising the wagon. It's an oversized bicycle. And I too agree with the others about how some chapters get bogged down with unnecessary filler.

      >We haven't interacted with the System in dozens of chapters.

      This isn't *technically* true. We got paling stuff / soul damage, synchronization (IIRC), pets, a few new monsters including crystal slimes, glimpses at various high-tier skills including metamagic, rank shift, linksight, the Majistraal artifact, and various soul-program thingies. Though yeah, it was all qualitative and we couldn't do e.g. build analysis and hypotheticals.
      ```

      - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
        ```
        You're right. It was an exaggeration,  but only slightly.

        For dozens of chapters, Rain's character sheet has been exactly the same with slightly higher numbers. It's been 80-90% character interaction and dialogue with characters that are, frankly, not interesting and mostly forgettable,  and dialogue that is cringey and full of awful memes.

        The System is awesome though. Hopefully we eventually get back to it.

      Disagree on the wagon bit. Having Tallheart and his forge available is a huge asset, and digging into mechanical engineering is part of the Tallheart added value.

      A few chapters ago when the author went on holiday, I finally broke and checked what was on yiff party. Not much, it turns out. I still decided that's how I'll consume Delve from now on, in blocks every two or three months. Otherwise the pace is... trying.

      Which, to be fair, isn't much different from the other two dozen stories I'm keeping tabs open for. It'll be fine once it's complete, but it gives Palus Somni a run for it's money in terms of plot pace per month.

        Not sure what your porn habits have to do with Delve.

    I'd be super siked if the next chapter were the company getting its first blue and raising Rain's cap to 25 or something.
    ```

    - u/Kanzid:
      ```
      There is no way that is going to happen. Rain is the third highest levelled member of Ascension and with Tallheart being a crafter that would be expecting Amelia to Deus ex machina power boost Rain.
      No the only blue we can expect to see for the next two arcs, (Getting the team to work together while crossing the zone, saving the town) will be a low level one maybe up to level 10 that will probably be used to awaken some of the new people and maybe allow one or two of the awakened to increase their cap.

      Even after that when they start hunting lairs there is no way they will go straight for a 25. First they will need to try for a blue in the mid teens to get a party together that is about the same level as Rain. I suppose in theory this could end up being 19 to 20 if they get a much harder blue than they expect though if it is I would hope for some consequences.

      After they get a team of mid teens then they can go for something 20 - 24 which will give Rain a chance to level. Only then when they have a party of 20+ characters would I expect any reasonable chance of them hunting a blue that will let Rain reach Silver.
      ```

        ```
        I meant a timeskip of a few months.

        They bag a level ~15 blue, Kettel and co. get some nice builds, Tallheart supplies equipment and even gets an apprentice, yadda yadda next phase. I know it's not gonna happen but it is going very slowly.

          The pacing is glacial. This story could afford to lose 60 to 70 percent of the written word count and be better off for it.

  Does anyone have any suggestions for similar web serials? I do like this, but the chapters are so short.

    Check out the recommendations thread, it'll probably be more helpful.

  You can tell from the wagon description that the author really knows their stuff
  ```

  - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
    ```
    Yeah he says it right in the story that he watched a couple YouTube videos on the subjects. 

    What he doesn't know how to do is write compelling story elements with any sort of pacing. Or non cringey dialogue that's not full of lame cringey memes

      kinda feels like ur hate reading this story, every comment I've ever seen from you is shitting on the writing or author man I think maybe u should just drop
