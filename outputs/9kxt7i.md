  I always love it when regular Callowan people's perspectives are shown. It's so fun to see how they see things and how they live their lives.
  ```

    To quote TFS!cell: I have so many questions!

    Does this person know who hakram is, and is lying to Hakram? That seems pretty ballsy, but that’s the only thing that really makes sense here. Like, if they’re a poor refugee in a medieval world, in a city with crushing housing prices, as a single parent, how the hell can they afford to give away meat to a random org? Like, poor people in modern countries have difficulty supporting kids as a single parent; add in all the above and it boggles the mind. That despite losing their home and livelihood they have 0 complaints whatsoever and are super stoked despite, in there eyes, and orc being in charge only seems to work if they recognize hakram and don’t want to be seen as diesloyal, but that just raises further issues.

      He did say that he was almost sold out for the day, Hakram made a note of this too. I think he just wanted to be on the good side of the Legionnaries.
      ```

        ```
        Could be respect, could be fear.
        ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      They're not a single parent, their husband is just in the Army of Callow, which *does* pay their soldiers.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Callow can’t pay its soldiers, though, Malicia destroyed their currency and they were floundering before that.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          Callow can't pay it's soldiers in the long term (well, before the Dwarven deal they couldn't) but it wasn't an immediate problem.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Citation needed? I was pretty sure juniper complained about that multiple times. of course, considering the fact that I have no idea where callow gets the soldiers it needs to pay either...
            ```

            - u/Ardvarkeating101:
              ```
              Several suborned legions and recruitment camps Juniper set up
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                No, I mean where it gets the people for those camps. I'm still looking for the faceless mook generators
                ```

                - u/Ardvarkeating101:
                  ```
                  You mean the famous Callowan “down here in the mud it’s us who hold the line”?
                  ```

                  - u/None:
                    ```
                    I do mean them. Callow is a preindustrial farming nation, with massive chunks of their farmland burnt down, their biggest trading city in ruins, their economy in tatters, and their military has horrific casualty rates, but instead of the citizens having to be forced into the military and the kingdom of callow starving, they're... just fine, apparently, and everyone is totally behind the black queen who caused literally all of this. If this were to happen in a comparable country multiple hundreds of years more advanced in tech, you would have widespread food shortages and mass starvation, even without having to feed a massive training army being taken from the population of farmers at a critical time; most states from comparable tech levels would have collapsed completely.
                    ```

                    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
                      ```
                      The Black Queen, from their perspective, *solved* all of this, their farmland is *not* burnt, just a bit of it near the blessed isle is abandoned, and when you're a refugee with a cultural boner for resisting invasion, well, what job are you looking for when you don't have anything left?
                      ```

                      - u/None:
                        ```
                        Uh. Summer invasion? Liesse? Some parts during will's rebellion? Their farmland is definitely burnt, and large chunks of it to boot.
                        ```

        - u/Jarwain:
          ```
          I didn't think Malicia destroyed the currency yet, however she has the ability to
          ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      I don't think it's too implausible that a random commoner would be feeling some good will towards Legionaries.

      It *is* a little strange that every time the story shows a civilian, they're almost always sensible, cool-headed, and sympathetic to the crown.
      ```

    - u/Schuano:
      ```
      Do you think poor beggars in India refuse to pay when corrupt cops shake them down?   

      &#x200B;

      Seriously, watch responses from people in authoritarian countries to members of the secret police and such.  They can be dirt poor and starving but they will make sure that cop does not feel disrespected.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I... didn't think that was what was happening here, but yeah, that would explain it if so.
        ```

- u/cabforpitt:
  ```
  So Hakram's into game theory. Doesn't seem like a traditional Orcish pursuit.
  ```

  - u/magna-terra:
    ```
    indeed, and this isnt even just game theory, this is also political theory given the nature of the game.
    ```

  >It could not be put off any longer. He needed to be sure they were raising the same tower, for decisions had to be made.

  >In the game, as in all things, it was always better to be the betrayer than the betrayed.

  Wait, is he saying he's trying to confirm her allegiances and that he'll betray her if they aren't raising the same tower, or that because she doesn't trust him he's going to stick the knife in before she gets a chance?
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    Yes.
    ```

- u/CeruleanTresses:
  ```
  God, I love Hakram chapters.
