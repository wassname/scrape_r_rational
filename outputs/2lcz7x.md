  You could literally do an intelligence explosion in Morrowind. It went like this:

  1. Buy up the ingredients for a bunch of Fortify Intelligence potions.
  2. Make lots of crappy intelligence potions.
  3. Drink the best one, sell the rest, buy more ingredients.
  4. Enhanced intelligence lets you make better potions (stronger, longer lasting, worth more).
  5. Better potions further enhance your intelligence.
  6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you are the smartest creature on the planet.

  The game wasn't really designed with that in mind, since it broke pretty much everything. Once your intelligence was orders of magnitude higher than the game anticipated (in the millions instead of the double digits), your potion-making was also so good that any potion you made would last essentially indefinitely, so you could make a potion of Strength which would let you kill a god with a rusty spoon, or a potion of camouflage that would make you invisible, and these enhancements would be so good that they'd never run out. Permanent flight, the ability to leap across continents - basically do everything to the integer limits of the engine.

  This could all be accomplished within the first half hour in the game - I discovered it on accident, and then had to reload from a save because stomping around in god-mode wasn't terribly fun.

    If you're looking for stuff that should be possible in-game if it was a narrative about a rational protagonist instead of a videogame:

    * Undead and summons can do useful work beyond simply attacking your enemies. There's no reason that anyone should be doing farmwork (or factory work) when that can be delegated to minions. That frees up more people to study magic, who can then use it for labor.
    * Almost all of the forms of magic have practical applications. Flame magic can power a steam engine. Frost magic can preserve perishables (and on a large enough scale, probably make ice ships). Shock magic essentially produces free energy.
    * There should be soul trapping farms, and dangerous creatures raised in captivity for their souls. Enchanting is ridiculously powerful.
    * Very few people seem to have defenses against invisibility or 100% camouflage, which indicates that they're not really prepared against intelligent foes.
    * Given magic, there's no real reason that there should be torches, since magic gives you permanent light for much cheaper (going by in-game prices, anyway).
    * The ability to transmute mineral ores makes metals worth only marginally different prices (though this doesn't seem to be reflected by in-game prices).

    In Skyrim, they got smart and integrated recursive self-improvement into their design - you can still do it ([potions-enchant loop](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Skyrim:Alchemy/Enchanting_Loop)), but you cap out relatively quickly. Of course, people figured out how to break it anyways - afaik the Fortify Restoration part of the loop was _not_ planned for, so it's rather imbalanced.

      Not just imbalanced - actually completely broken. I very quickly ended up with equipment that was no longer worked properly because it was overenchanted.

  TES magic is already exploited to hell and back in-universe. Let me warn you first off by saying that this is a rambling post that lists off every way of munchkinry I can get to that's related to the first topic, Numidium.

  So, Numidium. The Dwemer found a way to change reality through sounds and called it Tonal Architecture. They used this to make a giant robot and a trio of tools used to manipulate the Heart of Lorkhan, the literal heart of a dead God. When Kagrenac used his Tools on the Heart, the entire Dwemer race disappeared and became the golden skin of the Numidium.

   The Numidium's very nature makes its word fact; unfortunately for reality, much of what it says is **NO**. The Numidium is also used for other purposes; it was held by the Tribunal, a set of 3 gods, all of whom reached godhood through exploiting the Heart of Lorkhan and one of whom reached further godhood elsewhere (more munchkinry...). Tiber Septim used the threat of unleashing it to force the Second Aldmeri Dominion to surrender to him and join his Empire.

  A warning about the following paragraph: I'm reciting this from memory and have no idea where a few chunks of it came from; however, AFAIK the end result is about the same.

  Tiber Septim's munchkin as hell, too. Born a Breton in High Rock/Born a Nord in High Rock named Hjalti Early-Beard/Born a Nord in Atmora named Talos, he rose to power in the ranks of Cuhlecain with the help of Ysmir Wulfharth, who earlier had been shouted to pieces by the Greybeards but still lives on as a shade/storm of sorts. Wulfharth was a Shezzarine, an incarnation of Lorkhan/Shezzar/Shor; he could also shout like nobody else, once having his shout turn everyone in Skyrim into babies. Wulfharth and Tiber's power combined were great, and he became known as the Stormcrown due to the way Wulfharth appeared in. Cuhlecain was eventually murdered by a High Rock nightblade... which fits Hjalti/Talos/Ysmir/Tiber well.

  After Cuhlecain's death, Tiber began taking places over himself. His supreme shouting ability from being Dovahkiin combined with Wulfharth's supreme shouting ability and the fact that *both* are incarnations of Shezzar/Shor/Lorkhan makes the invasion quite a force, even beating out such people as Vivec (the deal they made is not known exactly, but Tiber somehow manages to get the Numidium out of it; Vivec is later known to claim that he killed Talos). He eventually achieved CHIM, a state of something resembling, but greater than godhood attained through deep understanding of the universe (and its nature as the dream of Anu the Amaranth); he also underwent an Enantiomorph, a mythologically significant story involving 3 people, where they are all difficult to tell apart (thus why you get the Underking claiming he's Zurin Arctus in person but claiming he's Wulfharth in the book he wrote, which is named after Arctus) and which creates a God. This made him a God 4 times over. Munchkiny as hell. The only person who was ever even remotely able to stand up to him was Cyrus, who insists that he is not the HoonDing.

  Speaking of which, sound-magic in general. Cyrus learned Sword-Singing and claimed to know the Pankratosword, a technique in which the sword is made so sharp and swung so precisely that it cuts *atomos*, creating devastating power. Yokuda was sunk through this. The Thu'um is something most TES players will know well, but its true power isn't even remotely shown in-game. At one point, Orkey (a weird amalgam of Trinimac, Malacath and Arkay, it seems) took the lifespan of the Nord people and gave it to the Orsimer, the Orcs. Wulfharth got it back with the shout "What Happens When You Shake the Dragon Just So", which gave all of the Nords... a bit *too much* youth. Tonal Architecture is somewhat self-explanatory. Akatosh was created by the Marukhati Selective by standing atop Adamantine tower and singing the song that is the Aurbis... then switching the tune to one with a Man-loving time-god (the primary time-god "before" Akatosh was Auri-El, who is very, very Mer).

  And that's all the windbag I have for today.

  EDIT: *Atomos* is not a typo, it's how it's spelled in-universe. Physics work differently in TES.

  Is it always cold?  The simplest exploit would be an infinite source of temperature gradient for power generation.

    That's a nice idea, but I think we should assume that it's simply solid at room temperature rather than that it can never get warm. I remember some stalhrim armor, and the armor that sucks out all the warmth sounds like a way to freeze yourself to death. I don't know exactly the lore says about it, though.

      Maybe the process of forging causes it to stop drawing heat? the raw ore veins have vapor I believe. It could be the Nordic pickaxes with proprietary magicness that makes it safe to wear.

  well if you want munchkin'd stahlrim there is this mass effect/skyrim fanfic: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10288115/1/The-Effect-of-the-Dragon
  where clever modified use of the breathe under water enchantment plus stahlrim hulls enables the people of tamriel to create spaceships with destruction magic drives/weapons.

    There is the point that any mage in nirn outputs a lot more energy than their caloric intake allows. One master in destruction magic with perks on enhanced flames could outperform any other fuel for a generator, and the flame or storm thrall spell would do the same without the need to be there yourself all day long. The transmute spell shows the magic can easily create or destroy mass (lump of gold with same volume as iron lump) with a simple adept level spell! There is no spell crafting in skyrim but in other TES there was, so it is not beyond imagination a modified  transmute lead to uranium-235 or whatever. stalhrim is consistently about 15% stronger than skyforge steel (the strongest steel in the realm which I will take as average modern steel) so you have a plentiful building material that is about 9 times less dense than steel, I'm thinking boats, skyscrapers, heck maybe even space elevators (the stalhrim bow demonstrates it can be ductile).

    To be fair, there are *already* spaceships in TES lore. Battlespires are one, and there are moon colonies mentioned in the Pocket Guide to the Empire3rd edition.

  CHIM is a state of being reachable by mortals allowing them to become akin to gods.

  Potion of intelligence enhancing loop. From the enhancement potions you can go from a normal human to a paragon to a god in under a hour. You don't have to limit yourself to just intelligence either. Even without the potions there are ways to make scrolls that enhance mortals to near impossible levels of skill and ability as demonstrated by the scrolls of Icarian Flight. Magical suits of predator level camo. The whole system is rife with ways to cheat built in.
