## Utilitarian Death Note?

### Post:

Does anyone know of a Death Note fanfiction that explores what would have happened if the DN had fallen in the hands of a more rational/ethical person than Light Yagami? Clearly, the DN itself doesn't really allow much room for "ethical" use at all - the only truly ethical thing to do with it would be burning it on the spot and burying the ashes. But Light's use of it was exceedingly psychopathic, he focused a lot on petty crimes without ever looking at the bigger picture, and purposefully made himself known, thus drawing the attention of the investigators, in order to pursue his idea of making himself into a God figure. Not to mention how quick he was to begin killing innocent people as soon as they opposed him. Did anyone ever write a fic about a DN user who instead lays low and uses it only occasionally, to kill off people making it seem like accidents or natural deaths in order to not disclose their own existence, trying to influence the arc of history in a positive way whenever they think it'll make a big enough change that even killing is justified (e.g. killing off a dictator)? And potentially, of course, the ways this could *still* backfire on them...

  I would really like to read anything in Death Note fandom which isn't either gay porn fantasy or "OMG I SO LOVE L!!1" fangirling. I'm sick and tired of trying to find something decent. Can you recomend anything which doesn't call for bleach in the eyes just after reading description?

    Not really, I haven't touched fanfiction in a long time and am just now getting back into it. I wrote some Death Note fanfic myself years ago, but it's all in Italian and now I can't go back to translate it without it feeling a bit cringey to me. One story was about what Naomi Misora did in the time she had to decide how to kill herself, and how she struggled with her Death Note-mandated suicidal impulse. Another was basically a parody ([that ended with](#s " Light carrying out his mission to its logical conclusion and extinguishing the whole of mankind once he started punishing downloading pirate movies and music from the internet") ).

  Is death note even interesting without the mythical tropes? Kira is kira, because he's eating forbidden fruit, if he doesn't get kicked out of eden I'm not sure what the story is about.

  "Today I found a magical notebook that kills anyone; I start studying cryptography and world class operational security because the idiots who almost destroyed the world in the cold war should not hold this; during this time I hear about assassination markets and figure 'what the hell' and release a ounce of proof that I can do what I claim, get a bit of passive income, and start a small cult that highly values secrecy"

    I mean, it's a completely different story, doesn't mean it's not potentially good. I don't take it as "fixing" Death Note, which is mighty good as is (nor do I take HPMOR as "fixing" Harry Potter, for that matter, for all the poking fun it does at its worst plot holes here and there). It's just using the same plot device to tell a story that goes into a different direction.

    In fact, here's an interesting thought - Ryuk is in a way a proxy for the audience, as he's in it for the fun, basically. So whoever the user is might be fought between not wanting to do anything too evil and keeping Ryuk entertained - knowing full well that he'd just kill him and give the Note to a potentially much less restrained human if he left him bored.

    Personally I think it's at least an interesting thought. And it's not like anyone acting like I described would *not* have a lot of moral conflicts ahead of them. Even without acting as recklessly as Kira did, using the Death Note still isn't a morally clean affair. It would be much more interesting to see what a person with genuine moral concerns would do with it (and what it would do to them) than the kind of hyper-efficient but somehow sociopathic type you're portraying.

      It bears repeating - characters in rational fiction are not perfectly rational. They're better at some things and more resistant to certain failure modes, they can be just as flawed as anyone else.

  >he focused a lot on petty crimes without ever looking at the bigger picture, and purposefully made himself known

  that was the point of his usage, he wanted people to know that certain crimes are going to be punished, so they stop committing them. He literally lowers the crime rate by 70% for 6 years and stops all wars.

  Light saved millions of people with his usage of the death note and only killed a few hundred thousands to do it(with around 10.000 innocents) You cant really get a much better result if you are utilitarian. Light also had long time goals to influence human behavior and encourage Humans to use their full potential(when one of his followers trys to do this, Light mentions that its to early)

  In the end Lights mistake was his arrogance and god complex, but his actual goal of creating a better world was happening.

  >Not to mention how quick he was to begin killing innocent people as soon as they opposed him

  Its also debatable if those he killed  who tried to stop him count as innocent victims, considering their goals would have caused millions of truly innocent people to die.

  Most of the really innocents he killed, were those he thought were guilty of a crime, but were wrongly convicted or entered plea deals.

    There's a lot to say there. First, while it was mentioned that wars did stop, it was never really clarified how did it happen, since it looked mostly like Light focused on killing random muggers and rapists, not war criminals and tyrants (that might have been because the manga author didn't want to get too political, though; albeit someone might say that the act of painting street or organised crime as the biggest threat to society's welfare *is*, in itself, political).

    Second, Light's stated objective might have been that, but by making his presence obvious he also opened up the floodgates to what happened: investigations, and his own defeat. It would not have taken much to assume any investigation would have required him to either fight with both arms tied behind his back or start killing innocent, justice-loving people just because of his own utilitarian calculations (which always involved his *own* view of justice and ethics being front and centre, and fuck the rest of mankind and their opinions). He could know so, and did it nevertheless.

    Third, his approach leaves a lot to be desired in other respects. Only if you count good in raw numbers of lives saved, and you count the value of individual freedom as literally zero, you can argue he caused a net good. Yes, he may have reduced crime. He also plunged the world in an era of superstitious dread, by making everyone as scared as they'd ever been in the Dark Ages of drawing on themselves punishment from above, except this time the punishing wrathful God was really there. How many people were killed for judicial mistakes, or because someone slandered them and Kira fell for it? With hundreds of kills a day he couldn't certainly check his sources too well (not to mention all the time he left the killings to the less-than-bright and possibly mentally unstable Misa Amane). How may suicides, how much paranoia and depression in people who committed minor offences and dreaded for their own life? How much creativity and free speech repressed by fear of supernatural punishment? Will nothing of this truly affect society in the long run? Here's another fanfiction idea: Light wins, and then the world ends up in a state of stagnation as it regresses to a mindset of fear, self-imposed censorship, and superstition.

    Fourth, and possibly worst of all: Light never made any real succession plans. He never gave a fuck about what would happen when he died. All he wanted to do was see his ideal world become real, and live to rule it. The end. Like Alexander the Great, once his empire had fallen, and the more entrenched had it become, it would have been torn to shreds by the need to readjust itself to the new status quo. He died without having won entirely yet, and all that happened was that the world went back to square 1 in a couple years. Imagine if he had died 75, after 50 years of absolute rule. Entire new generations born and grown under the rule of Kira suddenly would find themselves alone to fend for themselves. That is basically a surefire way to get the most devastating religious wars the planet has ever seen to break out. When a God dies, that's a *big* power vacuum to fill.

      Light is in an unique position in that he can basically have prophets everywhere. Starting a single global religion is the best way to maximise utility.

      Have a few high profile people write out your (gods) code of ethics.

      It wouldn't be that hard to not be caught, see that article on information bits. Especially if most of the world agrees with you. (and if anyone even bothers looking cause why would someone assume that its a human as opposed to aliens or gods or state sponsored superweapon)

        A religion sounds like the kind of social engineering tool that's highly likely to end up backfiring or producing weird unintended consequences...

        That's... uhhh. Suppose something seemingly supernatural begins happening, what's your prior for it being aliens or gods rather than a human with ESP powers? Especially considering that the *target* seems an oddly human thing on which to take out your wrath on. Why would aliens care about killing our criminals?

          Because of magic and advanced technology one is actually reasonable. "Something acting in a way that doesn't make sense versus something that is physically impossible". For all we know aliens or our simulation operators do this on every world. 

          I can imagine nanotechnology being capable of doing what Kira does. I can also imagine magic doing it. One of those things fits with my model of the universe.

            Depression works in weird ways. Depression affects a sizeable percentage of the population, even in normal times.

            > I can imagine nanotechnology being capable of doing what Kira does. I can also imagine magic doing it. One of those things fits with my model of the universe.

            At the beginning of DN, no one thinks Kira is magic. They think they're some kind of organisation carrying out homicides normally. When L pulls off the Lind L. Taylor stunt they see that he can kill at will and at a distance, instantaneously. That's still not proof enough to claim magic. But if it's sufficiently advanced technology, well, could be aliens, or could be some human individual/organisation who managed to invent it. Equally unlikely. But the choice of targets is remarkably *human*. Aliens wouldn't feel strongly about Earth crime. Which would make me more inclined to believe it's one or more humans who are responsible.

      Imo he should've killed only a few major criminals every day/every week. Make it impossible to identify where the killer(himself) is.

      And only major criminals as well.

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        If Light only targeted major criminals, then the minor criminals would think "I'm safe to do whatever I want as long as I don't become notorious." Rather than decrease the rate of crime, Light's actions would just cause a shift in criminal behavior to compensate. That kills the deterrent aspect of Light's plan.

        [Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) (rationalist superman fic) is a good example which explores how well intended policies can have unintended consequences. Humans will always try to game the system.

      my assumption was that he was using the same channels over which he has contacts with the public. Its just a theory, but it seems likely that at that point he would start use his reputation like in season 2.(though we have no proof either way)

      >Second, Light's stated objective might have been that, but by making his presence obvious he also opened up the floodgates to what happened: investigations, and his own defeat

      his defeat happened because Light was too arrogant and decided to kill the FBI agents that were investigating Kira as a warning to others. Until that point all that was known about Kira was that he was that he was operating in the Kantō region and had acces to the data of the Kira investigation. By killing the FBI Agents he basically narrowed it down to a few dozen suspects, including himself a known genius. By killing Rey Penbers wife he also gave away his triumph card of people not knowing that Kira can kill through other methods.

      If he had been able to ignore People opposing him, he would never really have been suspected.

      >Third, his approach leaves a lot to be desired in other respects. Only if you count good in raw numbers of lives saved, and you count the value of individual freedom as literally zero, you can argue he caused a net good. 

      Those are usually him taking the lives of people who are mostly either unrepentant  people convicted of murder or wanted for murder. Both kinds generally dont benefit Humanity outside of special circumstances. And him saving the lives of would be murder victims and people who would have died in wars. 
      He didn't really take away Individual freedom, he mostly imposed two laws, dont murder and dont oppose me and he carried out the punishment himself. Any government does the same(he doesn't take away freedom if it doesn't really exist).

      >He also plunged the world in an era of superstitious dread, by making everyone as scared as they'd ever been in the Dark Ages of drawing on themselves punishment from above, except this time the punishing wrathful God was really there.

      Its mentioned that the general population actually feels better, by knowing that they have a god looking out for them and handing out just punishments.

      >How many people were killed for judicial mistakes, or because someone slandered them and Kira fell for it? With hundreds of kills a day he couldn't certainly check his sources too well 

      Fans estimated it around 10.000 after calculating how many names are written down per day and how people are generally falsely convicted.

      >(not to mention all the time he left the killings to the less-than-bright and possibly mentally unstable Misa Amane)

      he actually calls Misa out for committing unjust muders, but it can be assumed that afterwards she was using the same restriction he placed on himself(she really wanted to please him)

      >How may suicides, how much paranoia and depression in people who committed minor offences and dreaded for their own life? How much creativity and free speech repressed by fear of supernatural punishment?

      thats really on them. we dont see Light killing people for minor offenses(the closest thing was the suspected rapist he used to scare Rey Penber) He also doesn't stop people from speaking against him, he only took actions against those who actually tried to stop him. we know his followers participate in public discussions and argue with others about him.

      >Here's another fanfiction idea: Light wins, and then the world ends up in a state of stagnation as it regresses to a mindset of fear, self-imposed censorship, and superstition.

      thats probably why Lights long term plans involve punishing people for not using their full potential. there cant really be stagnation if people would be forced to advance.

      >Fourth, and possibly worst of all: Light never made any real succession plans. He never gave a fuck about what would happen when he died. 

      thats not really true, Light had a cult Following him, he even had people like Teru Mikami and Kiyomi Takada who were competent and actually believed in his cause. They also both had access to pages of the death note. He even notes that Mikami was able to act like he wanted to without any actual orders. If Light had died devoted followers of his like Mikami would have continued his work in his name, Its not like Light didn't entrust very loyal people his secret.

        Which was already a great deal more than what would have been known if he just kept a low profile and didn't try killing L when he was first challenged, aka "fuck all". In fact, just fighting opposition at all basically gave away that he was a human, fearful of punishment, and not a God. A justice-loving God would not have cared, and would have waited for these well-intentioned but misguided humans to come around to see things from his point of view.

        > Those are usually him taking the lives of people who are mostly either unrepentant people convicted of murder or wanted for murder. Both kinds generally dont benefit Humanity outside of special circumstances.

        Still doesn't give a single individual the right to be jury, judge and executioner.

        > He didn't really take away Individual freedom, he mostly imposed two laws, dont murder and dont oppose me and he carried out the punishment himself. Any government does the same(he doesn't take away freedom if it doesn't really exist).

        Absolutely false, he punished for far more than that. Plus "don't oppose me" is already not a fair law, but a tyrant's whim. And you already said it afterwards, he planned to even punish people whom he felt were lazy or not contributing enough to society. That seems quite a far cry from fairness or justice to me, especially since the *only* punishment he's able to dole out is death. It would definitely restrict society! Think living in there. You'll be super-careful to not only steer clear from any kind of criminal activity, but from any situation where you could be suspected, or wrongly accused, of said activity. One false accusation and you risk your life. Now let's say Kira has already started his "punish people who slack off" campaign. He said he'd do that with means other than heart attacks, but someone could catch on anyway (plus, if he didn't make it obvious, it wouldn't serve much purpose, he can't kill off all slackers, it only works if he can deter the behaviour, so he needs it to be known). First, that's already a horribly trivial reason to kill someone. Second, people will be immediately pressed into doing whatever they realise or imagine Kira thinks is a worthy contribution. Kira thinks being an amateur artist or a musician is a pointless waste of talent? Entire sectors of popular culture shrivel. Death is such a huge threat, people would stay completely the fuck away from a lot of activities or lifestyles, even if they would not have much to fear. Society altogether would be influenced. If to you having to change the way one lives for fear that some unknown person will judge you and kill you isn't losing freedom, I don't know what is.

        > Fans estimated it around 10.000 after calculating how many names are written down per day and how people are generally falsely convicted.

        Oh, well, just 10,000 innocents killed, that's nothing /sarcasm.

        > he actually calls Misa out for committing unjust muders, but it can be assumed that afterwards she was using the same restriction he placed on himself(she really wanted to please him)

        By his logic, if he had any integrity, he should have killed Misa as soon as Rem was dead, as punishment for her murder. Except suddenly he was very forgiving with the one woman who could be of use to him (and that arguably he *may* have developed some kind of distorted sense of attachment to).

        > thats really on them. we dont see Light killing people for minor offenses(the closest thing was the suspected rapist he used to scare Rey Penber) He also doesn't stop people from speaking against him, he only took actions against those who actually tried to stop him. we know his followers participate in public discussions and argue with others about him.

        Misa killed TV anchormen. She killed cops. Kira killed the FBI agents. Mikami killed Demegawa and his "dirigents". Who knows what the fuck Higuchi did. People don't know what the fuck is going on behind the scenes, they see people dropping dead on live TV, they're scared, they're paranoid, they make assumptions. You can't really say "that's on them". Without knowing who Light is, it's perfectly legitimate to fear him acting irrationally. This isn't even a thing like Lex Luthor fearing Superman will one day become dangerous just because he's so powerful, even though Superman is basically a saint. Light has absolute power but he's also clearly pretty unhinged. "Kira", as a composite character, as seen from the public who only gets a glimpse of the real picture, is a schizophrenic, inconsistent madman.

        > thats probably why Lights long term plans involve punishing people for not using their full potential. there cant really be stagnation if people would be forced to advance.

        You know what would really make research labs work faster? Someone with a gun pointed to the head of scientists at all times! That'll make 'em churn out those results.

        Yeah, no. I really hope you get no leadership roles ever if this is your way of thinking because this theory of leadership was debunked at some point after the time when whip masters would work slaves to death. In fact, extreme competition is often detrimental to productivity already; if people feel like it's not just their success or pride to be on the line, but their very livelihood, they become more likely to cheat and do whatever it takes to come out on top. Which is obviously not desired.

        > thats not really true, Light had a cult Following him, he even had people like Teru Mikami and Kiyomi Takada who were competent and actually believed in his cause.

If Light had died devoted followers of his like Mikami would have continued his work in his name, Its not like Light didn't entrust very loyal people his secret.

        The manga is already pretty unrealistic on that point because it needs those people mostly as plot devices, tools in Light's master plan. Even so, let's stick to canon.

        Light loses because he trusted Mikami. He loses because Mikami takes a personal initiative and ruins his plan. But granted, that was just a personal initiative in terms of what to do, Mikami's ideals matched pretty much Lights. However earlier on Light remarks that he needs to get in touch with Mikami because he's already starting to drift away from him. And that's *Mikami*: a fanatic who sees Light as a God. When Light loses, that's all it takes for Mikami to cry that he's no God, that he's a fraud. His faith is shattered. How much do you think it would have taken to the zealot Mikami to decide that Light was after all disappointing, and that he could be a better God than him? How would he have reacted had he learned some of Light's less known exploits (including that he let Misa live at all)? 

        People have different ideals. They fight over those views of justice all the time. Imagine what would happen if they fought using Death Notes as their weapons. And Light only involved Mikami in the first place because he was under surveillance. What if he died in an accident, without properly planning or laying out a succession plan? What if his successor went off the rails? What if he entrusted multiple successors and they ended up disagreeing? What, what what. The entire affair relies on an incredibly concentrated and poorly resilient power structure. A modern government doesn't crumble if a leader dies because there's a chain of command, it'd take a cataclysm to obliterate enough people to throw it into chaos. Old monarchies could fall into civil war if enough successors were taken out of the picture. Kira's god-king position would be even more unstable than that, relying on secrecy, informal pacts, and the fear of mutual annihilation to stay afloat.

            Never said *I* am an utilitarian. The only thing that would keep me from burning the Death Note immediately is the off chance that it could one day be the only way I have to try averting an existential risk like nuclear war or such, when it's literally do or die anyway. I wouldn't want to use it even to meddle with, say, the Syrian war, not because I don't think ending it wouldn't be worth the lives of a few despicable men, but because I'm smarter than presuming I can just predict all the outcomes of throwing a spanner in the works of a highly complex socio-political situation spanning from a culture I don't know or understand.

                I enjoyed Death Note a great deal. But I didn't *root for Light*. You can enjoy without agreeing with its protagonist (which in this case is also very much a villain protagonist).

                I'm actually saying I think it's interesting to argue with this proposition in a narrative, I can see a lot of situations in which one could actually make a point against me that it'd be better to use the DN than not. But certainly not the way Light used it.

                About Hitler: possibly, though it's not like he was the only force behind it. Mussolini was pretty much a joke but Japan kept fighting fiercely even after Germany's defeat. Doing in Hitler would have worked only after the tide of war turned enough that anyone who was half sane in the Nazi leadership could have seen that they would lose, and then again, they would need some guarantee that they would not be executed afterwards for war crimes.

                Also, after the war, Churchill wanted to continue the war, against the Soviet Union. Who knows what would have happened if the war had ended in 1943, with the Allies still not quite as worn out.

                Also, if nuclear weapons had not been used in 1945, they could have been used later on, when the other side already had them too. Leading potentially to a nuclear war instead of the stall we got in the cold war.

  The one fic I've seen that comes the closest to being what you're describing is [If it's not me, it's you](https://fanfiction.net/s/12431989/1/If-It-s-Not-Me-It-s-You). During the arc where Light volunteers to be imprisoned, he comes to the conclusion that the only two people who could possibly be Kira are himself or L, and the author goes to great lengths to both show his entire chain of logic as well as expand the characterization of everyone else on the investigation team.

  I kicked an idea like this around a while back (I like thinking up stories that I'm never going to write).

  It's tricky because, as you say, a good version of Light would probably just burn the death note or only keep it around for emergencies. I settled on giving the death note to someone who used it to become a highly effective eco-terrorist because he believed it was the only way to keep the earth habitable for the future. Not a good guy by any stretch of the imagination, but at least someone who had a noble goal and a reasonable plan to achieve it (while at the same time taking better care to hide his identity). There is an interesting puzzle in how to use a death note in a optimal manner given that you don't mind murdering a whole bunch of people, but do care about keeping your identity a secret.

  I think the interesting character to make a rationalist in Death Note is L.  Like, Kira has the cheat codes.  A rationalist version of him rejects his street level terrorism, takes over the world via holding its leaders hostage, and implements whatever he wants.

  A rationalist playing L's hand (you are anonymous, trusted by some law enforcement personnel, your opponent is magic bullshit) is much more interesting.

    But, well, isn't L basically already a rationalist? Yeah, he occasionally follows his gut instinct more, but if anything, those lead him to Kira *faster* in the story.

    As for this:

    > A rationalist version of him rejects his street level terrorism, takes over the world via holding its leaders hostage, and implements whatever he wants.

    Not sure why "rationalist" in this case seems to imply also "even more psychopathic than he already is". Light doesn't do that not because he doesn't realise he could, but because he *does* have a moral code. It's shitty and he cares less and less about it as time goes on, but it's there. He believes in law and order. My idea here was more about "what would someone who's both more ethical and has less delusions of godhood than Light do". Of course, if the DN went to someone as smart as Light but with even *less* moral quandaries, well, the world would be fucked.
    ```

      RatLight would also believe in law & order, but lack the fetishism of their existing configuration.  Punishing those who defy dumb laws instead of fixing them is something he'd get over.
      ```

  I would expect that you’d get better results not from looking for Death Note fan fiction *per se*, but rather looking for speculative fiction surrounding the uses of assassination markets.
