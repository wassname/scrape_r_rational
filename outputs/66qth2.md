  As a participant in this thread, I'd argue that it isn't [HF] since the general thread consensus is that magic most likely doesn't exist.

  Also not really sure that this is considered rational considering the characters don't last long enough to get a real grasp of their psychology and the civs as a whole are clearly not playing rationally.
