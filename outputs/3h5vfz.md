  At this point, it seems like Allen has played his cards and is along for the ride. He's almost certainly revealed everything he'll tell about Albert's deal and the attack afterwards. Any moves he makes towards his attacker will almost certainly put Allen in a worse position. 

  I'm not entirely sure why we had such a long conversation with Doctor Sven. Probably Captain Marko or Stateman Urda will figure out a way to weaponize Allen's position.

    I was trying to use the conversation with Doctor Sven to show growth under stress.  In that conversation, there was no real winner or loser, but Allen did make Doctor Sven realize he was assuming too much.  Unfortunately, in Doctor Sven's eyes, that realization was of dubious value, and Allen made those points accompanied by physical displays of anger which seemed to support the doctor's overall assessment of the situation.

    No spoilers, but Allen's not done yet!

  I love this story, and by extension /u/Farmerbob1.
