## Modern Medicine—“You see, there’s a plague sweeping Equestria ... It targets the elderly. It draws away their strength, until they suffer some other accident ... It’s a monster, and if we don’t kill it, it will kill mom, and kill dad, and Shining and Spike and everypony else we care about."

  Somehow I find the pony warning flair extremely amusing; as if cartoon ponies were lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce on unsuspecting minds.

      A lot of people (myself included) simply can't enjoy pony fanfic. As far as an actual trigger warning? It probably isn't necessary, but it does save me time.

  Summary:

  >A strange mare arrives in Twilight’s library, claiming to be her future self—here to stop a terrible plague. But Twilight worries that this stranger’s bold claims may hide something more sinister.

  The plague is, of course, >!death itself!<.

    Judging from the title, it would more strictly be >!senescence!<.

      ```
      Eh, I guessed what it was just from the title and the subreddit.
      ```

    ```
    And here I was hoping for our first real Coronavirus fanfic.
