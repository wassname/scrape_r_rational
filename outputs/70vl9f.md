## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

    Audiobooks:

    * Yuval Noah Harari's *Sapiens* and *Homo Deus*: An excellent pair of books on the history of humanity and its potential future.
    * Parag Khana's *Connectography*: Viewing the interactions of states based on borders is is obsolete; instead, look at their economic and social connections.
    * Peter Frankopan's *The Silk Roads*: To go a step further, viewing state interactions through the lens of borders has always been limiting. History is more fun when you introduce economics.
    * James SA Corey's *The Expanse*: Space opera meets detective novel on the edge of armageddon. 

    Podcasts:

    * Revolutions: A historian covers several of the world's major revolutions in roughly chronological order, starting with the English Revolution in the 1600s and most recently taking on the Revolutions of 1848. Witty and intriguing throughout.
    * The Methods of Rationality Podcast: You probably already know about this one; it started as a fan reading of HPMOR and has since turned into a bi-weekly podcast recording rationalist fiction. Their most recent large project was a rendition of Alexander Wales' *The Metropolitan Man*. Currently on hiatus, but there's a lot of content to delve into.

    Lectures:

    * The *Democracy at Work* YouTube Channel: Not likely to be as popular here, but still interesting; Richard Wolff explains the economic theory of socialism and the failures of capitalism. The [Online Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wkO3qsZY_U&list=PLPJpiw1WYdTNMCC0ypXHZ-kW7yCz4T0Zg) playlist is quite extensive.

    If you're using an iOS device, the Overcast app is essential for listening. My favorite podcast is The Mixed Six for its humorous intellectualism. I recommend My Brother, My Brother, and Me for straight up comedy and Welcome to Night Vale for horror comedy. If you just want to fill time, I've kept myself entertained for long stretches with RPG actual play podcasts like One Shot, The Adventure Zone, and Role Playing Public Radio (God's Teeth is their best horror campaign, Know Evil is fantastic sci-fi after a slow start, and both of their Red Markets campaigns are amazing post-apocalyptic adventures).

  In the US, I want the Democratic Party to take control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections next year, but am unsure which strategy is more likely to work. They can either pander to the Bernie supporters with promises to do things the GOP will never accept compromise on, or pander to moderates in an effort to steal voters away from the Republican Party. I don't have any hard evidence as to which is more likely to work.
  ```

  - u/waylandertheslayer:
    ```
    Can't they determine state-by-state which seems more likely to work on the voter base, then fine-tune their message that way? I was under the impression that each state gets their own representative(s) and so it's even easier than during a Presidential election to be all things to all people. Disclaimer: I don't know that much about the US political system as I don't live there.

    The "strategy" for the Democratic Party is going to vary by congressional district. It will be set by candidates, not the party. People tend to misjudge what House of Representative races are like. It's not a top down party strat, it's bottom up from these small districts. Congressional districts tend to have about 700,000 people in them. Most of them don't have issues that cleave along Sanders vs Centrist lines. They are highly heterogenous. What might work in say, a more urban Colorado district wouldn't apply in, say...

    [Missouri's 4th.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri%27s_4th_congressional_district) Missouri's 4th congressional district had been held by the Democratic party since 1955. We held that seat for half of a century. Ike Skelton served as the congressman for that district for 17 terms, from 1977 to 2011. This guy voted with the Democrats on most issues, but on gun control, abortion, and DADT, he was conservative. He had a lot of support from the rural areas of his congressional district and was well liked by everyone.

    > The district's population was 91 percent white (see Race and ethnicity in the United States Census); 85 percent were high school graduates and 17 percent had received a bachelor's degree or higher. Its median income was $42,317. In the 2008 presidential election the district gave 61 percent of its vote to Republican nominee John McCain and 38 percent to Democratic nominee Barack Obama. In 2010 the district had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+14.
    > 
    > ...Skelton was re-elected in 2008 with 66 percent of the vote.

    This was a blue dog Democrat, the kind the Dems need a lot of to hold a majority in the House. But then, in 2010, The Tea Party came for him, and he was defeated. Now the seat is held by Vicky Hartzler, who is a birther, a climate skeptic, and against welfare programs like food stamps. Her constituents are okay with this somehow. She's popular and will be hard to unseat by any Democrat, unless things seriously go south and the district agitates for change.

    It's tough to see where we go from here in Missouri's 4th. And there are a lot of districts like this. Not saying it's impossible, but it's gonna be hard. The local/state Democratic parties have their work cut out for them, both for winning state legislature and contesting house seats that the Republicans now have held for nearly a decade. However, the situation in California's 10th (which is generally a toss-up in most polls but Republicans have held for 4-6 years) is completely different. 

    Every race deals with a different constituency and a different set of candidates and issues. The California 10th cares a lot about water and certain social issues that just aren't important in Missouri's 4th. Race issues are completely different. Both are dealing with different levels of gov't money from the feds and from their own states, and have different levels of poverty, types of industry, etc. Both benefit differently from Obamacare, and have different exposure to illegal immigration, etc.

    The idea that there should be a singular national policy that is more Bernie-like or more centrist is not entirely wrong, but is also basically wrong. There will be some national-level party guidance in the midterms, but congressional races are a lot more local than people think. There will be many Democrats running on many platforms, and not all of them will be taking their marching orders from Sanders or from the party.
    ```

    Pander to the Bernie supporters on economics, moderate on social issues.  Bernie polled best not with registered Democrats, but with *independents*, who liked him best out of basically everyone.  Their job is *not* to get dedicated Democratic voters out, nor to get self-identified "centrists" to come out (those assholes came out in 2016 and it didn't fucking help), but to increase turnout among low-income people in general, especially independents and consistent nonvoters.

    Why?  Because honestly, that's the largest population who're actually up for grabs, and there's enough of them to swing things.  If everything's been polled and predicted to hell and back, go find a variable the enemy hasn't accounted for.

      How does immigration fit into that strategy? It's easily the most divisive issue with the starkest contrast between either side's values. Most liberals I know see it as a economic issue and point to studies that say letting more immigrants in is better for everyone in America, but all the conservatives I've spoken to see it as a social issue and many are openly nativist. I'm not sure if you can pander to both at the same time.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Naturalize people who are already in the country, then enforce the borders, then implement a points-based system that allows legible public scrutiny of exactly how many people can come in, how, and why.  Conservatives are already openly asking for a points-based system, and when liberals hear that it's "like Canada" and won't discriminate by nationality, they'll get on board too.

        Liberals might claim that being from a Third World country makes it harder to get enough points, but just yell back at them that surely they don't think Third Worlders are *inferior*.
        ```

        - u/trekie140:
          ```
          That's a good idea that I'd be happy to see put into practice, but naturalization remains a deal breaker. Conservative voters absolutely oppose allowing undocumented immigrants to remain in this country regardless of the cost it would take to remove them. 

          Trump voters held rallies where they burned their MAGA hats after he announced he would sign a Dream Act into law. Studies have shown the rising popularity of fascist organizations in Europe correlates directly with the number of immigrants and refugees allowed into the country.

          How do you pander to a voting bloc that specifically identifies as nativist and responds to suggestions that voting for such polices  is against their self interest by voting for someone else? If there is a way to attract moderates on this issue, I'd like to hear it because I'm not even sure moderates exist.

            My faith is in framing effects: if you manage to frame things in a way that appeals to the right intuitions and makes people feel "ok", like the world is running in an orderly and valuable way, you should be able to convince them of just about any object-level policy position.

              I agree, but after trying over and over again to persuade these people I've concluded that the vast majority of them have the intuition "foreigners are bad". I do not believe there is an argument you can make that will convince them to have empathy for people that they are firmly prejudiced against. Post your argument at r/AskTrumpSupporters and test how they respond.

          - u/hh26:
            ```
            I don't think naturalization is a deal-breaker, it's just highly distasteful.  If there's an opportunity to implement effective border control and a merit-based immigration system AND deport all of the illegals currently here, that's the best case scenario.  But if the only way to convince everyone to agree to the border control and merit system is to also allow the illegals to stay, then I, and I think most Trump supporters, would reluctantly accept that deal.

            The fact that a nonzero amount of Trump supporters are completely unwilling to compromise does not logically imply that all, or even most are.

            I'm not sure why you bring up Europe, given that they have immigrants forming literal rape gangs, but it's certainly a good argument in favor of increased border control.

            I think there are plenty of moderates, we just tend not to join protests or yell loudly, especially on Reddit where everywhere is highly biased to the left except a few subs which are highly biased to the right.

                Just because the overall trend is that refugees don't commit more crimes, doesn't mean there are no isolated groups of refugees who *do*.  In the case of Rotherdam, UK *specifically*, it even came out that the police were actively *refusing* to look into what they *knew* was a sexual violence problem in their area, because it would make them look racist.

                Yes, that actually happened.  Seriously.  I know that covering that up actually gives political ammo for the far-right to claim that *overall* refugee crime numbers are vastly higher than they really are.  Unfortunately, uh, Bayes' Rule or fucking something, so we really do now have to assign some higher probability to, "Actual crime rates are higher than reported crime rates because the police are too PC."  At least in the UK.

                Because they've been fucking *caught at it*.

                  That was the excuse they gave, but evidence that's come up since the Rotherham scandal blew up suggests that it was a lie the police and council used to cover their own incompetence and disgusting attitudes towards the victims (e.g. calling 12-year old girls "slags" for being molested).

                  See the book Broken and Betrayed by Jayne Senior, a would-be whistleblower who was ignored by the Rotherham authorities (summary [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/rotherham-whistleblower-explains-why-sex-abuse-ring-was-covered/)). I'd also recommend watching The Betrayed Girls, the BBC documentary on Rotherham and similar scandals, and looking into the testimony of non-police investigators as well as that of victims of the gangs.

                    I am so glad this came out. Sure, some because of the vindication (I'll refrain from going up to anyone and saying "I told you so") but mostly because I get to further update in the direction of "trust your instincts and skepticism of things others seem to accept without question," which has served me very well recently and I think I've finally developed since I started paying attention to it.

                    I don't know how anyone actually convinced themselves that  police worry too much about being seen as racist or insensitive to the point of allowing children to get raped, and I feel like the idea that PC-culture-run-mad has progressed to that level requires pretty heavy reinforcement from biased media.

                  [According to Wikipedia, there were more causes of that tragedy than just that.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal)

                  > The failure to address the abuse was attributed to a combination of factors revolving around race, class and gender—contemptuous and sexist attitudes toward the mostly working-class victims; fear that the perpetrators' ethnicity would trigger allegations of racism and damage community relations; the Labour council's reluctance to challenge a Labour-voting ethnic minority; lack of a child-centred focus; a desire to protect the town's reputation; and lack of training and resources.

                  > The government appointed Louise Casey to conduct an inspection of Rotherham Council. Published in January 2015, the Casey report concluded that the council had a bullying, sexist culture of covering up information and silencing whistleblowers, and was "not fit for purpose".

                  [This NY Times editorial by a British-Pakistani still places the blame squarely on liberals for not taking steps to integrate the immigrant community and encourage assimilation, but characterizes it as another form of racism.](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/opinion/multiculturalism-and-rape-in-rotherham.html)

                  > The Pakistani community in Rotherham, and elsewhere in Britain, has not followed the usual immigrant narrative arc of intermarriage and integration. The custom of first-cousin marriages to spouses from back home in Pakistan meant that the patriarchal village mentality was continually refreshed.

                  > Britain’s Pakistani community often seems frozen in time; it has progressed little and remains strikingly impoverished. The unemployment rate for the least educated young Muslims is close to 40 percent, and more than two-thirds of Pakistani households are below the poverty line.

                  > My early years in Luton were lived inside a Pakistani bubble. Everyone my family knew was Pakistani, and most of my fellow students at school were Pakistani. I can’t recall a white person ever visiting our home.

                  > Rotherham has the third-most-segregated Muslim population in England: The majority of the Pakistani community, 82 percent, lives in just three of the town’s council electoral wards. Voter turnout can be as low as 30 percent, so seats can be won or lost by a handful of votes — a situation that easily leads to patronage and clientelism.

                  > If working-class British Pakistanis had been better represented in the groups that failed them — the political class, the police, the media and the child protection agencies — it is arguable that there would have been a less squeamish attitude toward the shibboleths of multiculturalism. British Pakistanis may be held back by racism and poverty, but by cleaving so firmly to outmoded prejudices and fearing so much of the mainstream culture that swirls around them, they segregate themselves.

                  It sounds like a situation analogous to how American city planners specifically planned where impoverished ghettos of minorities would live and designed public transportation infrastructure with racial discrimination in mind. The criminals are still at fault for their crimes and the police should be held responsible for their failures, but prejudices engrained into mainstream culture and public institutions is what allowed such a horrible tragedy to occur in the first place.

                  I think this situation is an example of how white liberals can *horrifically* fail at combating prejudice and discrimination, but more due to ignorance about the minorities they seek to represent and the problems that plague them. I don't blame political correctness for the damage done here, I blame the *failed implementation of it*. I still think public institutions need to be proactive in their defense of minority and immigrant communities from irrational ideas and people, without falling victim to irrationality themselves.

    > I want the Democratic Party to take control

    Try again. That's a means, not an end. Unless you're one of the party bosses, it's utterly ludicrous to state the ends of your desire to be one party or the other in control. You're much better off stating your preferred policy or political outcomes, and work backwards from there.

    Consider how *Republicans* feel right now: they have one of theirs in the Oval Office, and majorities in both chambers. Still, they can't repeal Obamacare, build a wall, or lower taxes. Cronyism and nepotism still reign in DC, the revolving door is alive and well, and the people writing the laws are still those with the most the gain. None of the stated policy objectives of the American right are coming to be. The strategy of "Let's put our people in power" doesn't actually achieve desirable outcomes unless done so with particular goals in mind.

  tl;dr: Thoughts on a worldview subsystem that replaces morality and ethics, invitation for discussion.

  ---

  The idea is that when one has to make a decision or a moral judgement, they disregard the morality and decide what to do based on the predictions of likely rewards and punishments for their person, their goals, their values, etc. In this system, there are no objectively valid laws or moral truths that need to be followed just because, as axioms. There are only various fractions (e.g. governments, subcultures, etc) and phenomena (e.g. forces of nature, one’s own human psychology, etc) that need to be accounted for because they will punish or reward the decision maker based on the latter’s decisions.

  So, for instance:

  * one doesn’t steal 1) because of the likely punishments from the fractions “government\law enforcement”, “previous owner”, “public”, etc; 2) because stealing will gradually lead to developing a bad personality — with “bad” being defined as ineffective and unsustainable in long-term; 3) (optional, would depend on one’s goals and values) because stealing would harm others (empathy), harm the society in general (game theory, society-without-theft being seen as a value, etc); 4) etc;
  * one doesn’t flash all the money they have on their person while outside because of the likely punishment from the fractions “thieves\pickpockets\etc”;
  * one doesn’t walk home alone while wearing a revealing dress because of the likely punishment from the fraction “rapists”.

  Also note that some terms that would be heavily relied upon in a morality system become obsolete, meaningless, or blurry enough to be unusable in this one. Among such terms possibly are: right\wrong, fault, blame, crime, sin, revenge, right, privilege, etc. 

  * So, for instance, when the possible decision of walking home alone at night is being discussed, it should be irrelevant whether or not the person has a *right* to walk home or not. What should be considered instead is the possible consequences. They base their decision on whether or not they are willing to take the risk of potentially being assaulted. They can also take further actions (e.g. through political activism, which would essentially be siccing the fraction “law enforcement” on the fractions “thieves” and “rapists”) to lower the risks involved with walking home.
  * When being wronged by someone, it should be meaningless to regard possible *revenge* as something related to morality. Instead, one can 1) think how to prevent such punishments happening against their person in the future (in which case the demonstration of revenge itself could possibly be one of the solutions, as a future repellent) 2) (based on values) try to get their revenge anyway but only seeing it as the final reward itself, 3) (based on values) try preventing them from acting in the similar manner against others in the future.
  * When a corporation is lobbying to deny climate change or is dumping toxic waste into the environment, it’s irrelevant whether or not the worsening ecology is the *fault* of such corporations. Instead, what should be considered is how to change the country’s\world’s economical\political systems in such a way that it will no longer be profitable for corporations to harm the ecosystem. Similar examples with privacy laws, internet laws, politicians, etc.

  I’m still tinkering with this idea, so inputs, criticism, and discussion are welcome.

    Isn't that basically consequentialism?
    ```

    - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
      ```
      It seems to be very close to what I had in mind, yes. With maybe the difference from [the types mentioned here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism#Philosophies) that it doesn’t try to define what the consequentialism should prioritise (e.g. in contrast to *state consequentialism*): that would depend on the practitioner’s values and judgements. I guess in that manner you could even classify it as ethical egoism, with the egoist agent potentially having a vast array of things included in the domain of their self-interest (e.g. the above-mentioned utopian society as a value to strive towards).

      And also, if you defined consequentialism in the Hollywood supervillainy type of “ends-justify-the-means” manner, it wouldn’t be what I had in mind because the means themselves are also part of the consequences. But at least some of the articles on Consequentialism seemed to be addressing this, so this paragraph is mostly for clarification.

      So, mostly, yes, it’s a consequentialist person that I had in mind that wouldn’t demonstrate hyporcritical, self-contradicting, or inconsistent principles (e.g. see the revenge example) halfway through the story.

      *p.s. I think I’ll wait for the Friday off-topic thread to ask for book recommendations with main characters like this.*

      >The way you're describing it, this sounds basically equivalent to what people with no particular code of morality but also no particular malice do anyway.

      Well, no. I think there are several differences from what you’ve described. It’s one thing to just not have a well-defined morality code and another to both explicitly reject morality and also have a developed system of principles that works in its place. Additionally, depending on the person’s values and worldview, they could still be utilising this system both if they valued malevolence or if they valued altruism. 

      It’s just a general personality template that can be tweaked this way and that to get the desired character. I guess with a proper brainwashing\transformation you could even turn a previously altruistic consequentialist into a malevolent one.

    Maybe I'm slightly oversimplifying here, but isn't that the basis of non-religious morality? If empathy, avoiding harm to others/society, etc., can be considered as motivators, then it seems you've only removes the label of "morality" from those motivators, rather than "replacing morality"...

    This sounds almost exactly like how I live my life lol. Every sentence I read I ended with "so... reality then?"

    The one part I disagree with is that you claim "blame" becomes irrelevant. On the contrary, "blame" becomes extremely relevant because without morality, revenge becomes more important as a means of controlling other people's actions (the number 3 motive in your post), and "blame" is the targeting mechanism for vengeance. 

    So it is not irrelevant whether or not the worsening ecology is the fault of such corporations, the blame needs to be assigned, lest its vengeance fall upon yourself.

    I think that all the different parts of that are already covered by existing terms.  If the decisions are solely based on cost and benefit to oneself, then you have [preconventional morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development#Pre-conventional).  If the decisions are based on cost and benefit to society as a whole, you have [conventional morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development#Conventional).  If it is a government deciding how to deal with other governments, you have [realpolitik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik).
