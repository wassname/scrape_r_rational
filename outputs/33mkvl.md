    I do like how they "fixed it" in Portal 2, making GLADOS a somewhat realistic case of a [Portal 2](#s "drugged-up involuntary upload") rather than a bizarrely human and incompetent UFAI.

  Mine is "does not actually write The Reckoning" because I usually post the link when there's a chapter update for [The Reckoning](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning), and several people have mistaken me for the author.

  Mine is "Metropolitan Man" because I wrote [*The Metropolitan Man*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man). I should maybe change it to [Shadows of the Limelight](http://alexanderwales.com/shadows-of-the-limelight-ch-1-the-rooftop-races/), because that's what I'm writing right now, but maybe I'll give it a few chapters first.

  It's a simple flair. It basically just says that I like TTGL without signaling anything else about me or signaling pretentiousness. The fact that it's also one of the defaults is nice because, again, avoiding signaling pretentiousness.

  The one flair that really spoke to me [for who knows what reason] on this sub was  /u/AmeteurOpinions's *"Meh, I could take her"*

  It caught my attention enough to google it, and it turned out to be a cool Worm reference.
  ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    My favorite part about it is that it was started by the commenters and then used by a certain character in the story. Plus, it's *Worm*, so it's cool by default.

  Yeah, that sums it up.

  Mine is the most-coherent short bit of the [Wizard's Oath](http://www.youngwizards.com/The-Wizards-Oath) that seemed to work out of context, and the series is one that was fairly formative growing up for me.

  My flair is `Cloudbank Citizen` because the world depicted in the game Transistor is pretty appealing to me.

  Transistor is one of the more notable Solar Punk stories I have come across. Solar Punk as in: Art Deco, high fashion, high art, green energy, augmented reality, intellectualism, naturalism, etc. The polar opposite of Cyberpunk.

  In Cloudbank, everything is up for vote. The weather, the architecture, the city planning, the colour of the sky... If anything it is a world which is strictly better than the one we live in currently: everyone is healthy and educated. (There is no insinuations that there is a scarcity of resources or a lower class at all in the game.)

  I did that [Munchkin This Nickel](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ib7ua/dmkmunchkin_this_nickel/) thing awhile back.

  Funnily enough, I'm not that big a fan of The Legend of Zelda.

  "Project Freeelancer" is an organization in "Red Vs Blue" that pushes the boundaries of science, human knowledge, and the law. They find a way to indefinitely copy AIs, invent temporal distortion technology, build robots that pass the Turing Test against trained soldiers, and they even have the ability to bring back the dead to an extent.

  Basically, they're Aperature Science if they had to work with severe budget limitations and strict military oversight, and still made badass tech that rivals anything. And we actually get to see how it all fell apart too. The Director is also one of the most tragic characters I can immediately think of.

  IDK why it's my flair, out of all the refferences I could make. It might be my Rooster Teeth community pride shining through. Maybe I'll switch it out for "Cadmus Initiative" at some point, for DCAU cred. But for now I'll keep it like it is.

  Sun Tzu said that, and I say he knows a little more about fighting than you do pal. 

  Because he invented it! 

  And then he perfected it so that no living man could best him in the ring of honor. 

  And then he used his fight money to buy two of every animal on Earth, and then he herded them into a boat, and then he beat the crap out of each and every single one!

  And from that day forward any time a bunch of animals are together in one place, its called a zoo!

  Unless its a farm!

  Because I'm a Computer Science Major with an AI track and this subreddit *loved* to talk about AIs a lot more around the time I came on. So I decided to joke about working on making CelestAI a real AI. Well that and showing my support for bronies; too many people seem unfairly prejudiced against the FiM fandom.

  I've actually thought about changing it, but I can't think of anything better. Anyone got any ideas?

    >Because I'm a Computer Science Major with an AI track and this subreddit loved to talk about AIs a lot more around the time I came on.

    I thought you said you were a Cognitive Science major :-P.

    > Well that and showing my support for bronies; too many people seem unfairly prejudiced against the FiM fandom.

    I think people just need some notional spot in the Geek Hierarchy labelled with the rough concept of "total fag", or "person whom it is acceptable to beat up and steal their lunch money".  Right now, that's people who watch ponies.

    >So I decided to joke about working on making CelestAI a real AI.

    I'm often unsure how much of a joke this actually is.  Not with you, specifically, but I was trying to bridge the massive inferential gap of my Marxist politics with a friend a week or two ago on Facebook, and I asked him how he supposed the world was *supposed* to be organized, and his answer was, "I ask CelestAI to organize it for me" -- *and he doesn't even watch MLP*.  And I've at least occasionally seen /r/rational, /r/hpmor, and LW posters reference uploading themselves to pony-land as an appealing escapist fantasy (at least, *qua* escapist fantasies).

    The Facebook message thread was insufficient to contain my sputtering of, "But but but that whole story is so *reductive* of human potential and it gets so many things *wrong* and why can't someone *do the original work* of thinking up something *better* and you can't ask fictional unfriendly superintelligences to make your decisions on social issues *for* you!  And even to the extent she *was* partially Friendly, if you *punt* to your *imaginary construct of her*, you'll never understand the Friendliness thing well enough to actually *build* a program that does anything like that!  How do you expect to *get* Pretty Pony Paradise if you don't understand what underlies it!?"

    So instead I just said, "Listen $FRIEND'S_NAME, if you keep punting your decisions to imaginary superintelligences, I'm not building you one."  Hmmm... that would make a great flair.

  A comment thread where several posters with AI-themed flairs started suggesting that their flairs were actually clues about the superhuman entities secretly controlling their every action.

  Mine is a specification in set-builder notation (in Latex) that should read, "[eaturbrainz] equals the set of strings too Martin-Loef random for you (the Turing machine `\mathcal{M}`) to compress them."  It's kinda-sorta a pun on Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem.

  This is partly named for the way I confuse the hell out of people when I first meet them by not fitting into any preconceptions.  It's also because I think Chaitin-incompleteness and its associated field of study offer an avenue forward on certain LW-y things we don't talk about because everyone knows they can't be done (but which the official papers on doing them anyway label "Vingean reflection").

  And deep down, isn't exponentially-growing optimization power thanks to recursive growth [what being a Spiral is all about](http://gurrenlagann.wikia.com/wiki/Spiral_Power), and exactly why Spiral Power is dangerous?  (Or in other words: I am a TTGL fanboy.)
