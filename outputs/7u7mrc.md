  Anaxares is quite possibly my favorite fucking insane character.  He's been brainwashed/raised into believing all this servants and fancy living shit is awful, and then he's forced into it and it's driving him even crazier and it's so amazing to watch this train wreck in action.

  He kind of reminds of of Worf.  Worf was raised on stories of Klingon honor and followed them religiously, when it turned out the entire empire was super corrupt and he ended up being the only honorable one left.  Poor Anaxares is the last true scion of Bellerophon.

    I would argue that he isn't actually insane or brainwashed. He's simply just raised (which you mentioned yourself) to believe that all men are equal, except that belief is carried out fully. He just sticks to his beliefs, even when they are inconvenient, which I think is pretty cool part of his character, although it also helps that the majority of his lines are wonderfully sassy.

      You can be logically self-consistent and still be insane
      ```

      - u/Clipsterman:
        ```
        But then, how do you know when someone is insane, rather than just believing something different from you? You could argue that capitalism, communism, religion or even the concept of freedom is insanity.
        ```

          Yep!  Insanity can be based on social values which be their very definition only exist because people agree they do!  But I can believe that Jews control the world and logically go to the nearest temple to help my stock portfolio.  I'm consistent, not correct.

  I've got to say that I absolutely adore learning more about the history and customs of the Free Cities. That tidbit about Bellerophon leaving an open seat for the Gods Below but giving them only a single vote was just perfect.

  Anaxares is also swiftly becoming one of my favorite characters; there's something oddly compelling about his complete abdication of responsibility in the face of his unwanted title, I just can't tell what.
  ```

  I like how Anaxares perfectly depicts the league of free cities. On the surface he is supposed to lead and coordinate them. To arbitrate their disputes and different ideologies.

  But look deeper? At the end of the day, each city does as it wants and acts according to their beliefs. The Secretariats are confused that he does not answer their scrolls? They send a scroll to ask how to send scrolls. The Tyrant has "surrendered" his rule to the Hierarche but he rules nonetheless and the others now this.

  The Nicea's wish his support? They give him a damn Palace. Bellerophon sends a diplomat without any power and a delegation of kanenas to follow the Hierarche. Stygia sends a magister to ask if he wishes slaves, the Atalantians go on about their crusade and righteousness and Penthes shows itself to be a rulership mess with many Exarch claimants (which is what Black did to disorganize the city and is also why we have seen so little of them).

  And to make everything worse, Anaxares refuses to exert even the bare minimum of control he can. I'm reminded by Anaxares thoughts from the prologue:

  > Named or not, one could not change the face of the Free Cities.

  The League of *Free* Cities stays free and true even if it "unites" under a ruler.

  Edit: Spelling.

  ```
  So, the guy whose Role is to be the neutral arbitrator of the group of cities that aren't able to cooperate does nothing to regulate their behavior and just lets them do whatever they want to. Seems to make sense. I wonder if his character development will further parallel the sociopolitical situation and relationships of said cities.
  ```

- u/MutantMannequin:
  ```
  I can't be  the first person to think this, but just about everything going on in the Free Cities feels like ErraticErrata is channeling Sir Terry Pratchett. It all feels very Discworld.
  ```

- u/TwoxMachina:
  ```
  Doesn't Anaxares realize, not deciding IS a decision.
  By not saying anything, the Tyrant speaks for him.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    He definitely knows that. He knows that he's stuck between two impossible choices - either he speaks and shapes the course of history as one man, one Named... or he doesn't, and the Tyrant shapes the course of history as one man, one Named - and that perhaps the greatest choice he could ever make is to stand by and let the Tyrant free. He knows he's been played. He knows that any move is a losing move. So, in the absence of all else, he falls back to his principles.
    ```

  ```
  Shouldn't this be an Interlude?
  ```

  - u/LordGoldenroot:
    ```
    It is one of the monthly chapters and not one that is directly in the main story, so it is not an interlude.
    ```

    - u/sharikak54:
      ```
      The extra chapter tricked me too, since it's not a new month yet.
      ```

- u/TheEngineer923:
  ```
  Oh snap, now we'll never know what the Tyrant's plant was... Was it a rose? Chrysanthemum? Weed? I bet it was weed. Now they can't act recklessly...
  ```
