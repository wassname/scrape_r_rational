  A good fic, dunno that itâ€™s all that rational though.

  Also, the place where it ends is kinda depressing.

    Seconded. It's one of the few good The Gamer crossovers and it counts as rational since the guy has realistically (dumb) intellectual agency and thinks through his (bad) decisions.

      I thought that the first 25% of the fic was reasonably rational. The protagonist's INT/WIS were low, so it made sense that he often made bad decisions. Later on, however, when his INT/WIS were at least average, his decision making process became inconsistent. Sometimes he made good decisions while other times he made very bad decisions. Either I was missing something about the character that would explain these inconsistencies or it was just authorial fiat aka "the idiot ball".

      Worse, other Worm characters -- Battery, Cauldron, Skidmark -- were often making decisions that I couldn't see them making given the information that they had and their stated goals.
