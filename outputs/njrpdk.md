## Review: Chili & the Chocolate Factory

### Post:

The first section of this review has mild thematic spoilers for this work; the others have moderate spoilers.

#### Overview &amp; Recommendation

[*Chili and the Chocolate Factory*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation) (85,356 words) by u/gazemaize is a completed sequel fanfiction of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Set in the near future in the Roald Dahl-verse, it follows the story of a new Golden Ticket contest held by the now elderly Charlie Bucket. As in the original, *Chili* comes with wacky kid characters, an even wackier confectionery magnate mastermind, and puns and jokes galore. Unlike the original, it contains metaethical themes, exploration of philosophical and psychological topics like the marshmallow test or the problem of evil, and discussion on the nature of fiction, stories, and puzzles.

Of the works that this community is generally familiar with, I'd say this comes closest to Scott Alexander's *Unsong*. The similarities are striking. Both stories are set in worlds filled with a dizzying amount of throwaway gags and jokes which run on [Rule of Funny](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny) while also remaining recognisably rational. Both stories often go off on tangents to explore said world in a manner that is delightfully whismsical or frustratingly pace-breaking, depending on who you ask. Both have the problem of evil as a major theme- how should we react to a world that isn't fair?

Also by the same author is [*Sivad's Question*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13635237/1/Sivad-s-Question), a very Borges short story that I also highly recommend, and... nothing else. I mean that in the best, most exciting way. Gazemaize  is a bright new rising star. I am really happy/proud of myself for discovering this author. I've read better works, and more obscure works, but *Chili* is a contender for the highest quality/popularity ratio I've seen. It doesn't even have a TvTropes page. I will be watching his career with great interest.


A more in-depth discussion for those who don't mind moderate spoilers follows.
#### Things I Loved

I blazed through this fic in a single night. I haven't binge-read in a long while and I'd like to congratulate the author for writing a story that can pull that off.

This was largely due to *Chili*'s greatest strength, which is the humour. The second greatest strength is also the humor. (Those who have already read _Chili_ will see what I just did there.) This work is **Funny**, in a way that is not often seen here, and this rescues the story from a common pitfall in the rational genre.

Many works posted here suffer from a problem that I call wiki-adequacy (it's not a good name, but I'm not good at naming things). That is to say, given access to a detailed Wikipedia-style plot summary, as well as a well-curated TvTropes page, how much of the work's original value can be extracted? If this quantity is especially high, I am tempted to skip reading the story, look up the cool plot elements, and mark the story as consumed in my ledger. The more abstruse SCPs are a great example of this- why should I work through reams of technical jargon that I've seen a hundred times before, when I could just read some entries on r/SCPDeclassified? (To a lesser extent, this is why I haven't read all of wildbow's stuff yet- I feel satisfied just reading about cool powers and plot twists on TvTropes.)
_Chili_ is not this kind of story. You need to read it to get anywhere near the full experience, and by Wonka what an experience it is.

Apart from this, I also loved the integration of common rationalist themes, which for the most part fit pretty naturally into the narrative.

Additionally, the author is clearly familiar with Dahl canon, and _Chili_ comes with a very generous sprinkling of references to Dahl's other works. You may not get all of them if you haven't read those stories, but it won't be a big issue- you'll just assume it's another wacky zany thing in this wacky zany world. But even apart from the references, this story manages to capture the essence of Dahl's crazy humour, with made up words and puns everywhere.

Did I mention the puns and wordplay? Gazemaize gives friggin Scott Alexander a run for his money here.

####Things I Wasn't a Fan Of

First off- I'm not too sure about how well the update to modern times has gone. The original book has a rather timeless quality to it, and it sometimes feels jarring when I'm reading online chatrooms and liberal profanity in a supposed Dahl story. I think _Chili_ would be much improved if all instances of the word *fuck* were replaced with made up words. What puzzles me is that this is already kind-of done, so I'm surprised Gazemaize didn't go all the way here, it would make the tone a lot more consistent. 

Now, if I were being lazy, I'd just copy a list of criticisms of *Unsong* and paste it here. Seriously, if I did that and changed a few names around, you probably wouldn't be able to tell. If you did not like *Unsong*, I'd be very surprised if you liked _Chili_.

To wit:

- Loose plot threads that don't really go anywhere (Looking at you, Gabriel and Chillenial). This is mostly a first-half issue, and goes away after the story enters the factory.
- Character focus issues. Despite being the titular character, Chili is not the main character of this story. Actually, the main character is Keerthi Ahir, a morally grounded, emotionally intelligent 12-year-old who- wait, no, actually, it's that other kid who won the contest- wait, actually, it's Chili... or is it? You get the idea. Chili himself is not a very good protagonist, in more ways than one. His arc does not start in the right place for its ending to be satisfying, and his character development is rushed and takes place entirely offstage. The story is carried by the rest of its ensemble cast, and honestly I'd advertise it as such.
- The ending. Oh God the ending. Eighty thousand words for a gag like that? I have to admit I was really disappointed by that. I worry that my point may be misunderstood by the fact that in the pun business good, high quality puns are described as 'terrible'. The better the pun, the more groan-worthy it is. I'm not playing any games here, the payoff ending pun does not _work_. To elaborate: the setup is inadequate.  Given the information in the story, it is *not possible to derive the ending*- the final payoff relies on a rather contentious external fact, which the average reader may not even know of. This alone might be okay, but setting up the final revelation warps far too many plot elements (Mahuika's essence, the true nature of reality, etc.) for a payoff that ultimately does not pay off enough. In the pun business this is complicated by the fact that longer, more elaborate setups award more terrible-points, but even this has a limit.

 AND IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO THIS WHY WHY WHY WOULD YOU HAVE AN INDIAN CHARACTER AND EVEN MENTION GODDAMN LENTIL SOUP AND NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT >![DAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal)!< EVEN THE FRIGGIN PRONOUNCIATION IS THE SAME AND INSTEAD YOU GO WITH THE THING THAT'S BEEN MEMED TO DEATH BY RICK AND MORTY WHICH DOESN'T EVEN SOUND THE SAME WHY WHY WHRRRRFGRBFTH

Ahem.

  LOOK IT'S MORE CHILIPOSTING YESSSS

  (If you haven't read through them, I actually do very seriously recommend paging through [the discussion threads back from during Chili's publication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=Chili+and+the+Chocolate+Factory&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on) (And I'm not just saying that because I'm proud of my own Chiliposting (although I'm not *not* [proud of it](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/go9y95/rtffwip_chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_chapter/frfaqp3/).))

  >Gazemaize gives friggin Scott Alexander a run for his money here.

  Hard disagree here. UNSONG was a masterpiece, but didn't come anywhere _close_ to the sheer dazzling density of wordplay in CatCF.

  >I think Chili would be much improved if all instances of the word fuck were replaced with made up words. What puzzles me is that this is already kind-of done, so I'm surprised Gazemaize didn't go all the way here, it would make the tone a lot more consistent.

  I liked this a lot, actually. The work is a deconstruction, and its target audience is very much not children, but, well, _this subreddit._ The chat conversations were, in large part, based on real conversations and participants in an /r/rational-adjacent Discord server. The made-up swears felt Dahlian to me, and the in-universe swearing felt to me like it served important purposes. The fact that it had both traditional and Dahlian swearing was part of what sold the tonal marriage of this subreddit's culture and voice with Dahl's entire canon.

  >Loose plot threads that don't really go anywhere (Looking at you, Gabriel and Chillenial).

  Have to disagree with you again here, at least as somebody who experienced it as it came out. The consequences of Gabriel's actions actually _do_ crop up during the ending, although it's not explicitly spelled out. And I honestly loved that. Chillennial, on the other hand, served multiple narrative purposes, but primarily to act as a voicebox for the theorizing going on here in the threads about the story on this subreddit. I think he holds up after the fact as a container for the kind of predictions that ratfic fans would be likely to make having read up to that point in the story.

  On another level, Chillennial Lee and Gabriel Munoza were head fakes. We expected them to be children who'd get golden tickets. Everybody who's familiar with the question of AI safety knew what was going to happen with Gabriel's chocolate-maximizing AI. The idea that happiness is produced from the murder of animals, which gets drilled down into later in the story when we learn about quarks, gets introduced with Gabriel and his dad.

  On another level, the "incompleteness" of their plot threads serves a dimension of the storytelling which we're told about diegetically: the fact that incompleteness _can in itself be an artistic statement._ Truncatism is presented as a joke, but this is also part of the deconstruction of rational fiction, in my opinion: ratfic readers _really_ don't like having things spoonfed to them or spelled out explicitly all the time, and there really _is_ art to knowing when to stop expositing at your audience and trust that they'll pick up the rest as implied.

  >Character focus issues.

  I didn't have a problem with this. Protagonists get a lot of moral weight by virtue of the fact they're protagonists, and Chili strips that right away off the bat by having the "main character" be hateful and grating. Gazemaize didn't trap us around that horrible child's perspective all the time and I'm grateful for that. More subversion and deconstruction, and making an implicit promise to the reader that things will happen according to internally consistent rules, not following some imposed external framework like some silly "hero's journey" that describes everything that is going to happen regardless of any logical progression of events or character motivations. 

  Honestly? Masterfully done, all of it.

  >The ending.[...]pun.

  I dunno, I was pretty familiar with Dahl's >!antisemitism!< prior to reading the story, and when I read the relevant line, I literally leapt up and ran around screaming for a bit at the terribleness of the pun. (In the sense of being so groanworthy as to break the scale.)

  I was one of the people who originally thought that perhaps Wonka had turned himself into a pickle. I didn't mind if it was that meme, so long as it was well done, then lo and behold! It wasn't that and I still didn't mind.

  (Also I'm really sorry but I'd never heard of that food before. Interesting idea there?)

  Anyway, thanks for giving me the excuse to wall-o-text about Chili again. And /u/gazemaize, deep and sincere thanks again for making something that brought us so much unbridled joy.

    >Gazemaize didn't trap us around that horrible child's perspective all the time and I'm grateful for that.

    Yeah, me too. It really shines as an ensemble fic. I just don't understand why the the story has his name in it. If it was for a pun, I'd understand, so I was surprised when it didn't. Like I said, these are mostly minor issues.

    >On another level, the "incompleteness" of their plot threads serves a dimension of the storytelling which we're told about diegetically: the fact that incompleteness can in itself be an artistic statement.

    On one hand, I love arguments like these. On the other, it's a fine line, take it too far and you end up sounding [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGfHnJ1KTA0). I prefer to err on the side of universal understanding; I'd say something 1000 people rate 9.5/10 is, in a quite objective sense, *better* than something 10 people rate 10/10.




    >I dunno, I was pretty familiar with Dahl's antisemitism prior to reading the story

    > I'd never heard of that food before

    ..and that in a nutshell is my main gripe with building a whole work around something that only a fraction of the audience will understand. My problem with the pun in question wasn't so much on how prevalent the knowledge was, but rather that it was outside-context and relied on real world info to be solved, which doesn't sit well with me.

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      The incredibly narrow niche of the >!Road Dill...Cinematic Universe?!< is why I'd recommend the discussion threads too. This was 100% off the rails at the time. It felt like anything could happen *and it would be totally justified by some bullshit Roald Dahl published in 1980.* I definitely didn't get a decent chunk of the jokes until I checked the thread; this probably detracts from the  experience of reading it now, but it really drew me in at the time.

      >De gustibus non est disputandum

      >I'd say something 1000 people rate 9.5/10 is, in a quite objective sense, better than something 10 people rate 10/10.

      This is one more place we differ, really. I'm all about weird, specialized things for specific audiences. This argument feels to me like "Twin Peaks would be objectively better if there were explanatory inserts to make the story more accessible to more people." Art has to commit to an audience or else risk becoming not-art, in my opinion and experience. Like Thomas Kinkade paintings.

      >..and that in a nutshell is my main gripe with building a whole work around something that only a fraction of the audience will understand.

      Judging by the comments threads when it came out, I think it was a fairly *large* fraction of the target audience that got the joke. I will say that Chili is certainly *deeply rewarding* of doing the background reading (or even background Wikipedia skimming); I understand and appreciate where you're coming from here, but I also cannot fault the work itself for being such a *comprehensive* love letter* to Roald Dahl (warts and all), even at the expense of its own comprehensibility. 

      Anyway, thanks for having opinions different enough from mine to "justify" me posting this much about this story. I foam at the mouth for opportunities to write my Chiliposting screeds (obviously) and it would have been so much more boring if all I'd been able to say was "yup I agree with all this it's one of the best things I ever read."

      - u/Brassica_Rex:
        ```
        >Art has to commit to an audience or else risk becoming not-art

        Oh yes there's definitely a lower bound to this too, something that 10,000 people rate 9/10 is better than a something a billion people rate 7.5 (cough MCU cough). The exact point at which the tradeoff is optimal is up in the air and probably what the other stuck afterlife in Sivad's Question is debating. 

        >Chili is certainly deeply rewarding of doing the background reading

        Yes yes so much yes. I looked at the discussion threads and found so much I missed. I thought I was good for catching the Matilda/Danny/Esio Trot references, but I'd never have gotten things like the Skin reference.

        >warts and all

        >love letter\*

         \* hopefully clear what I meant by 'love letter.' CatCF doesn't worship Dahl or project perfection onto him, but it is highly, highly _aware_ of him through the entire work. Dahl isn't the omnibenevolent god of his realm, more of a demiurge which was the product of its time. In keeping with the properties of the pickle as established diegetically.

  I loved this fic. I agree that you can't derive the ending from the setup, but I interpret that as a deliberate prank on us. The author certainly liked playing them.

  There was even a bit in the middle where a character talks about mysteries and endings. About how sometimes there isn't any payoff. The fic was then marked as complete, before we even entered the factory.

  Something that I think is worth pointing out, that you wouldn't have properly understood if you binged through it after CatCF was finished - 

  The gut punch that was chapter 6!

  Look.  Chapter 6 was published in the first week of January 2020.  At this point the story had been going for a few weeks, we were all invested in it, lots of guessing about the solution to the puzzle, and etc.

  And then - a chapter called "The End", the story's status changing from in progress to completed, a chatlog of a character complaining how nobody who doesn't enter the factory will ever know what the solution to the puzzle was or what happens inside the factory.  It fit, it fit so well with JUROR and incompleteness and etc, it felt like this was definitely how the story was going to end.  I personally was devastated and I know a bunch of others felt the same way.

  And then we got a new chapter!  And the story kept going!  And it was so good and so much fun!  I'm so happy that chapter 6 wasn't actually where it ended but I do wish there was a way for future readers to feel the emotions we felt at the time.

    Oh right I almost forgot, the HPMOR style contest at the end of chapter 21 was pretty similar.  I never doubted for a second that gaizemaize would actually truncate the story, and I laughed so much at seeing how everyone who submitted an answer had submitted the correct command.

It felt a bit like a roast of a beloved retiring celebrity, and I am left with the same feeling of denouement.

  I just binged this in 3 days while I should have been researching freight trucking electrification, so thanks for that.

  It was an utter joy and gave me a feeling similar to the one I got from reading the original as a kid--whimsy cranked up to 11, plus a healthy dash of cosmic horror (I definitely remember being terrified of the Knids as a 10-year-old). I'd call myself a fairly knowledgeable Dahl reader, so a lot of the references were absolutely delightful (I was looking for the Skin reference the whole time), but his corpus is broad & deep so the comment threads helped soothe my completionist urges. The reddit search page you linked should be pinned to the [ff.net](https://ff.net) page, the comments feel like required reading.

  I am always surprised when I see folks talk about this story and not give any mention to the hatefulness of the characters. Chili was bad enough, but Bucket is so incredibly nasty. Whatever else it had going for it, I found reading Charlie’s interactions with the children to be far too distasteful to enjoy the story and I ultimately did not finish it. The whole story was steeped in the tone of r/SneerClub in a way that I was very surprised the sub took to so acceptingly.

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Interesting. I absolutely agree that Chili and Bucket are horrible people in a visceral way. It's unsettling and might move the story into unenjoyable territory for some readers. But it also works with the mood whiplash that makes the story so good.

    However, I don't think I follow the sneer club comparison. While the story was clearly poking fun at various rationalfic tropes, plot beats, etc, they scanned more like in-jokes than mockery to me.

      I was referring to the palpable joy those characters took in their cruelty to others. I don’t think I’m describing it quite right. It’s a specific emotion that EY has talked about previously (and in particular stated he does not experience and cannot model well).

      I did not mean to imply that I thought the story itself was sneering at the community of readers, only that, e.g., Charlie would fit right in posting on SneerClub.

        Oh. Yeah, I can totally see that. There's got to be a name for this. Like schaudenfreude with agency. I was trying to describe it when writing that post but ended up cutting the following:

        > the way they're written reminds me of villains in a Stephen King novel, doing horrible things for reasons that are *obviously irrational* to us but just uncomfortably human. The scene that came to mind was early in The Stand, where some two-bit criminals hold up a drugstore for cash, which snowballs out of control and ends with half a dozen gory shootings. It's visceral, it's pointless, it's a drop in the bucket compared to the millions dying of the plague in the background, but it makes you hate these characters. That was Charlie and Chili for me. You just know that this is not a person you're comfortable enabling or being around. You get that feeling that if you were there, looking them in the eye as they said it, you *wouldn't do anything about it,* because they don't think the way you expect and you have no angle. And you can imagine those kind of people around you.

          I think Charlie in particular needed to be presented /really/ intensely for the story to have the same impact it did, and to a lesser extent Chilli. The way that everything is amped up to 11 doesn't necessarily help, but I think the payoff was pretty good along both lines, with Charlie dying after having his beliefs rejected by the characters, the readers, and the world itself, and Chili finding offscreen reformation.

      Sure, I've definitely struggled to convince people to try worm and I do agree it has it's flaws. It's just that it feels like the flaws are more in the editing and quality of the prose (especially early on) rather than in how much value you can get from consuming it vs reading the wikipedia summary. A large part of the enjoyment of reading worm (at least for me) was in experiencing the escalation and breathtaking pace of the middle arcs. I'm not sure if that is at all captured in reading a clinical description of Taylor taking over the universe. Perhaps I'm not understanding wiki-adjacency correctly.

        ```
        I just mentioned Worm because it's a well-known work that exhibits this trend, not because it's my main gripe with it or even has a lot of this problem.

        Wildbow's worldbuilding is absolutely stellar. I feel confident saying this not because I've read all his stuff- I've only finished Worm- but because I've read their entries on tvtropes.

        It's just- when I feel like I can get a good proportion of the value of  a work by reading a detailed synopsis and looking at the tvtropes entries, which usually give adequate context, quite often I find myself doing that instead of reading it. I've flipped through the character list for Ward a few times, and I'm very interested in the new characters, their powers, and their relationship dynamics... but I still haven't found the motivation to get more than 3 chapters in, because I remember how *tired* reading Worm made me.

        Worm was such a page-turner, to the extent that by the time I was approaching the climax, I was almost skimming the stuff- I have very little recollection of the plot roughly around the time skip.

        I guess this is as admission of fault on my part as a reader- I don't pay enough attention to the words as the action ramps up, and by the end of a particularly exciting story my reading comprehension sort of hydroplanes.

          I can sympathize there. For me part of the charm was that rush of "this is so good I can't put it down," which I was able to do because I was mainlining Worm while in the passenger seat on a road trip.

          I read Wildbow's other stuff (up until Pale) as it came out, so there was an enforced pacing that kind of improved parts of the experience. For Pact in particular, I suspected I enjoyed it a lot more than most of the binge readers.

          Twig is the one I would expect to hold up best in this case. It's more episodic at first, with R&R between team missions, and a somewhat more subtle use of worldbuilding as opposed to the >!twist after twist on a known formula!< of superhero fiction or urban fantasy. The character dynamics are also the best out of all the Wildbow stuff I've read. Their tighter network makes it a bit easier to keep track of relations and I found skimming less likely.

          The wiki doesn't really dive into any of the literary, thematic, or metatextual elements of Worm, which are some of my favorite things about it. I love how it can be enjoyed as a dumb, fun superhero action romp, while also being an absolute joy to dissect in a more literary way.

          There are scenes where every time I come back to them, I find new ways they connect to or contrast with existing characters and plot threads. If you haven't, I really recommend checking out the [We've Got Worm](https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-worm/) podcast, where two hosts come at the work arc-by-arc from different perspectives. It's an absolutely engaging listen.

  The thing I liked most about this fic is that it showed more vividly than anything else I've read just how *horrifying* the just-world fallacy can be when taken to its logical conclusion.

  By the way, I'm so, so happy you made this review. I absolutely adored this story, and it saddens me to see it fall into obscurity now that its finished. What an absolutely wild ride, and I wish there were more stories as unpredictable and clever as it was. Thank you!
