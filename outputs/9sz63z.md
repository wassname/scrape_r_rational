  I sort by controversial a lot, and most of what you get is:

  * People being really self-righteous
  * Low-effort statements (which I imagine are upvoted by people who are upvote-happy, and downvoted as useless noise)
  * People who were initially upvoted, then downvoted due to shifting opinions with increased views and/or being called out.
  * People with opinions that go against the hivemind for that subreddit

  Also, this:

  > You can also generate titles that will get maximum downvotes, but this is boring: it will just say things that sound like spam about penis pills.

  Is wrong. Spam gets downvoted until it's below the threshold for views, then no one sees it or feels compelled to vote on it. The *actual* most downvoted posts are those that get linked from elsewhere ("brigaded"), driving people to come in specifically to downvote.

  For more, visit /r/TheoryOfReddit.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    And the most most downvoted posts are when some powerful entity tries to justify something that a lot of people are upset about, like "sense of pride and accomplishment" and whatever the admins say when a new round of major subreddits is banned.

    Also opinions that go against the hivemind of the wider Western civilisation/culture in general. Or even broader than that, against the hivemind of humankind.

  > Any predictive network doubles as a generative network. If you teach a neural net to recognize dogs, you can run it in reverse to get dog pictures. If you train a network to predict Reddit upvotes, you can run it in reverse to generate titles it predicts will be highly upvoted. We tried this and it was pretty funny. I don’t remember the exact wording, but for /r/politics it was something like “Donald Trump is no longer the president. All transgender people are the president.” For r/technology it was about Elon Musk saving Net Neutrality.

  That would be a fun little time-waster if someone put one of these up on the web with a public interface.

  Wow. Wow. Wow. That was just... far too plausible for my taste. Delightfully scary story for Halloween.
  ```

  - u/nicholaslaux:
    ```
    If it helps... It's not really very plausible. If anything, the most plausible part was the comment about it showing past events, but written from the perspective of a non-data scientist who entirely forgot about how their model was definitely overfitting the data.
    ```

    - u/TrebarTilonai:
      ```
      I should rephrase. The technical details about how the Scissors function don't make a lot of sense. I don't have a lot of experience with machine learning, but I'm pretty sure you can't just reverse a predictive network to generate content.  


      That being said, I found this to be an interesting take on the human psychology of controversial statements and how it interacts with society at large. I am a strong believer that most people are fundamentally decent and that most controversial is the result of a differing set of fundamental axioms which, when applied to current events, result in massively differing opinions. The tribal nature of an us-vs-them mentality which can be seen so strongly in modern day politics also comes into play. So the idea that there exist basic statements that seem either fundamentally correct or fundamentally incorrect based on your initial set of axioms makes sense to me, and the idea that that would quickly devolve into escalation based on which side of the fence you fall is plausible.

        you can, actually. it takes a little bit of tinkering, but this is actually a technique which was developed in order to inspect what was actually happening inside image recognition networks. look up "deep dream" to see examples of images generated by networks originally designed and trained to detect and classify images.

        no comment on the rest though, I felt like the effect described in the story was a little too extreme to be realistic. good halloween story overall though.

  What is your most controversial comment? reddit.com/user/<username>/?sort=controversial

  Mine is a post starting "What do you think of the statistical claim that police killings are equivalent for blacks and whites, once you account for police encounter rate?"

  Third most controversial is a post saying suicide bombers are not cowardly.
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    My most controversial post is me asking people in the subreddit I moderate to act like human beings, which actually doesn't surprise me. 

    My second most controversial comment is me stating my opinion on Adnan Syed's prison sentence:

    > Even if he's guilty, the sentence was far, far too long for the crime in my opinion. I mean yes, a human being is dead, and there are few tragedies that can compare to that, but justice shouldn't be about punishment, it should be about rehabilitation and whether the perpetrator is a threat to the community.

    Which is apparently a Shiri Scissor because I still 100% stand behind that and can't fathom how someone would think differently!

      While we consider anger as just an indication that something needs to be changed, others take anger much more literally. People who want Revenge for something that's happened to them won't be satisfied with a gentle rehabilitation.

        I think Penn Jillette said it great: 

        (paraphrasing) "If someone killed a member of my family, you can bet that I would be furious. I would want to kill them with my bare hands and yell and scream at them for what they did to my loved one. But the point of having a society is that we are better than a mere sum of our parts, that we aren't just angry monkeys murdering each other because we can set rules in our rational moments. So even though I'd want to kill that motherfucker, it makes me very, very happy that society would hold me back from it."

        But yeah, I know other people have different opinions. I guess I have trouble relating to vengence, which is weird as I've got a very vengeful/spiteful sort of attitude IRL

    This concerns Cards Against Humanity. I guess I don't generally say controversial shit.

    Mine was answering why Last Man Standing was getting a revival when Brooklyn 99 got canned at Fox, that there were plenty of people who "just wanted safe conservative white people humor." with the posted source that "my (soon to be) ex-wife ate it up, alongside crappy reality shows and Angry Birds."

    In retrospect, my view may have seemed (been) _slightly_ biased towards my then active frustration and resentment towards said ex-wife.

    My most controversial comment was telling some people complaining Patrick Rothfuss isn't dedicating 100% of his time to writing the next kkc book to take it down a few notches.

    Second most controversial one is me not buying into the idea that 4 dimensionsal creatures are automatically terrifying to  those of us stuck in 3 dimensions.

    Unsurprisingly, all political except for a comment on subredditdrama. Surprisingly, none I'd realized were polarizing, because I didn't have the controversial tag on.

    I was reading chapter 19 of *Lighting Up the Dark* when it was posted here and thought Velorien put in a reference to the game-meme. It turns out that they were referencing the quote "the only winning move is not to play".

    I got down-voted for me making other people lose the game. Thanks for bringing up the game, *again*.

    My most controversial was about how Bernie really wasn't that close to winning the primary and that most democratic voters wanted Hillary, and she didn't win because of a secret cabal or conspiracy, she won because she was the more popular candidate.

    My third most controversial comment was saying that men's opinions on whether or not abortion should be legal were as valid as women's opinions. I also pointed out that since men and women have nearly the same proportional views on abortion, believing this doesn't change the national discussion on abortion 1 iota.

  An excellent story! 

  One possible flaw is that the second list would’ve been calibrated with the entire country population as its target group, not fine-tuned for one specific person. And there would be plenty of people in that set for whom the statements ranked #1–#3 would’ve been just irrelevant, even those for whom the entire list would’ve be irrelevant [\(e.g.\).](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality)  In other words, the network was trained to generate the most controversial statements for that target group, not the most controversial statement for *all* members of that group.

  This is not an outright plot hole for the story, since the narrator could’ve easily just not been lucky enough to be one of such people, but I think the story should’ve touched on this at least with a few sentences or a paragraph.
