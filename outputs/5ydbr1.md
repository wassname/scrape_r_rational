## [Question] Trojan war fanfiction suggestion?

### Post:

Hi, are there any entertaining fanfics about or related to the Trogan war, Illiad, and the Odyssey?

Thanks

  Not a fanfic, but the 'Troy' trilogy by David & Stella Gemmell is rather good. I wouldn't classify it as fully rational, but it's definitely got a few rational-style changes made to the original story. If you know the story of Troy, this shouldn't be a major spoiler, but it's an example of the sort of thing I mean: [Trojan Horse](#s "The 'Trojan Horse' is the name of Troy's cavalry. The attackers take armour etc. from some of the dead and pretend to be a section of the cavalry to get into the city.")

  It's been a few years since I last read it, but I remember enjoying it rather a lot.

  [Ilium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(novel): The Trojan War is being recreated by Greek gods that are actually hyper-advanced post-humans. Also lots of other stuff going on.

  ```
  David Gemmell's Troy series is the best Illiad fan fiction you'll ever read. First book is called Lord of the Silver Bow. 

  I'll see you in a month.
