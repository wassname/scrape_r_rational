  Yes!

  Someone finally takes Abigail seriously! I've been waiting for Cat to have The Talk with her, and we finally have it :D
  ```

- u/TideofKhatanga:
  ```
  Silly Catherine, she's too old to be your Squire!

  If Abigail takes to Cat's teaching, I'll be surprised. The mind of Our Lady of the Blaze takes strange paths and, besides Black, no one sees the world quite like she does. She's a decent general but half of that is quick-thinking with enough military background to come up with almost workable plans, and the other half is madness that allows those plans to work anyway.
  ```

  - u/Morghus:
    ```
    Does she need to become a squire, or can she become an independent factor of support and lateral thinking just like Cat? There's an old adage about the unwilling ruler being the best ruler
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Cat is already an unwilling ruler. That doesn't seem to have turned out well for Callow.
      ```

- u/Allian42:
  ```
  Cat has been bleeding friends for years now, things were bound to change and Abgail is perfect for the situation. A decent callowan soldier with decent morals, a knack for tactics, and one that don't think she should lead. A good recipe for a good general.

  That aside, did Cat just initiate a pattern of three with Razin? God dammit Cat.
  ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    Patterns of three are for Named, and only for those that have significance to each others beyond mere hostility. This situation doesn't meet these requirements at all.
    ```

    - u/Allian42:
      ```
      You're right, I've forgotten about that. I still feel like she is going to pay for that one latter, even if it's not mandated by the powers that be.
      ```

- u/melmonella:
  ```
  Can someone explain what, precisely, were drow needed for in this scheme? Catherine broke the river on her lonesome, and if she needed an appearance of an army to bait the charge, she could have used legionnaires. I distinctly remember three turtles being destroyed in the fire last chapter. If each of those is 50 people, 2/3 of them drow, that comes down to 100 dead drow to... What? Keep cat company while she did magic?

  Why is Catherine wasting her heaviest hitters like that?

  Why is Sve Noc going along with this murder of her people due to gross negligence?
  ```

  - u/ch3rryredchariot:
    ```
    If the cavalry didnâ€™t rout, the drow would have been needed to fight.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      She specifically notes that drow are *worse* than legionaires at holding cavalry charges though? So besides the waste of using them as meatshields being comparable to using disposable napkins made of gold, they aren't even *good* meatsields. Just like golden napkins.
      ```

      - u/Turniper:
        ```
        I mean, in daytime sure. At night, Jindrich alone would wreck that entire force. The sheer ludicrous power of some of the mighty basically means that Cat's army is invincible at night to conventional forces (Minus dwarves or gnomes obviously), she basically has 30 odd lesser named following her around. Also, if she didn't have them following her, Ravin most definitely would have tried his luck at killing Cat then and there.
        ```

  - u/Azzazeal:
    ```
    It didn't really matter if she used drow or legionares. She needed someone to kill the few people on the other side of the fire so she didn't tap into the Night. She picked Jindrich for that task.

    &#x200B;

    Why do you consider it gross negligence however or why would Sve Noc care for that matter? They had a mission to protect the first under the night while she was performing her miracle and a few of them died while doing it.
