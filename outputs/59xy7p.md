    Tips for becoming better at dialogue:

    1) Write a script and ask people to or act it out yourself.

    2) Open a novel and read the dialogue.

    3) Have a fast-paced IM conversation with someone.

    * “Oh, it’s just you. For a moment there I thought you were Ino, or better yet, Sasuke come at last to profess his undying love for me.”

    Would turn into (not correcting for character since I don't know who's speaking):

    “Oh, it’s just you. For a moment there I thought you were Ino--"

    "Piss off."

    "... or better yet, Sasuke come at last to profess his undying love for me.”

    "You really talk like that, don't you?  Huh."

    4) Do or watch long-form improv.

    5) Read a script written by Aaron Sorkin, then the script for The King's Speech.  Which is more real?

    6) Read whatever is the current best faithful, non-modernized translation of The Tale of Genji or Snow Country to get a feel for Japanese dialogue translated well, if you're trying to account for the Japanese background of Naruto.  Anime dialogue isn't very good, generally, instead depending upon style and voice acting skill.  Most people can't speak as eloquently as Japanese voice actors, so anime is a poor representation of human vocal intercourse.  Hence the novel suggestions.

    > the comical ineptness and malice Iruka shows towards Naruto reeks of bad fanon

    That surprises me: I remember fanon being that everyone in the village is evil and wants to kill Naruto for no reason, except Iruka and the Third who are the only good ones.  

    In canon Iruka was always a bit of a prat, screaming at his students whenever they did not obey him. He only became nicer to Naruto after Naruto brought up his parents, and since that did not happen here...

    I agree that the chakra thing is a bit of a weak plotpoint though. 

    >Your Sasuke is completely different from canon, in the worst way possible

    This might be a case of YMMV. Everyone who comments keeps saying things like "X is bad, Y is good!" while forgetting that there are others who say the exact opposite. Remember, canon Sasuke was just as divisive amongst the fanbase. 

    I'll tone Sasuke down a little, as well as the reference to the Inuzuka.

    >In canon, substitution is high speed movement + distraction object

    I'm aware of the original explanation given by Sakura, but Kishi completely contradicts this when characters use it to teleport out of their restraints (Sasuke vs Kakashi, Pain vs Jiraiya...) So I have to make it consistent somehow. 

    Given that both replacement and body-flicker are described as involving high speed movement, I think my interpretation is reasonable. 

    >In canon, transformations are completely physical.

    Kinda true (It's actually more like a shadowclone 'shell' around the user that breaks when damaged), but the problem with this is that such a power is completely gamebreaking, and it's never explained what the limitations of such a power would be. As such I elected to nerf it to prevent it from dominating the story.

    Considering that regular clones definitely *are* purely illusory, again I think it makes sense to say that the two techniques work in more or less the same way. 

    >Your mizuki knows far too much for a random chuunin

    Ah, but this is rational!Mizuki, and I bet someone like Kabuto would know at least as much.

    >I'm just being super critical because I think that your writing is very technically strong (MUCH better than your prologue, IMO)

    Cheers! Again though, it's surprising to read this because I have had at least one author that I respect tell me that the prologue is much better written than chapters 1-3!

      Transformation is not game breaking at all. 

      1. Breaks easily unless you have a special technique like a combo technique like Kiba and Akamaru or Naruto and Gamabunta. Those special combination techniques seem to relatively limited in usefulness or costly (Kiba doesn't use his 3 headed wolf thing all the tone-- it's a finishing technique.)

      2. Ninja fights involve lots of physical impact, so if something breaks easily, and it hits an enemy that can withstand being punched into solid rock, take down giant bears, jump 30 feet at minimum (all part 1 Sasuke feats) then that technique isn't useful for anything except stealth. And in fact, thats what it's used for. Naruto, probably the most skilled user of it, uses it to trick enemies until he can deliver a finishing blow. Ways to counter: passwords, code words (ala Chunin exams). 

      So I don't see how it's game breaking. 

      You're right about inconsistency of substitution, but those uses are very rare and it's generally only used against opponents that are much slower than the ninja using the substituon-- Kakashi vs the demon brothers, orochimaru vs Sasuke in the Chunin exams, etc. All ninja can escape from restraints pretty easily-- see Sasuke escapinf Naruto tying him up in early canon. So it's not inconceivable for someone to quickly untie themselves and substitute to trick an enemy. 

      Re: clones

      The academy technique is illusory but every other clone tech uses is solid in some way. 

      Re: shadow clones

      They have varying levels of durability. Early Naruto shadow clones break easily. End game Naruto shadow clones (in fight against kaguya and against Sasuke) survive immense damage. Seems to be a matter of number of clones made and the skill of the user. 


      Re: writing

      The prologue felt very stylized, like faux!mythic, and while that style can be good, it's usually overdone. IMO you're a great writer when you stick to the regular style, but it's hard for anyone to write a long scene with mythic style. 


      Re: Sasuke

      Canon!Sasuke, until the Kage Summit arc, is very sympathetic. He's honorable, brave, never needlessly kills someone, but also kind of a sarcastic jerk sometimes. Here he comes across as a pretentious jerk who relies on his clan name for respect. Very few good qualities. In canon he isn't interested in social domination or respect. Here he loves it. Completely opposite characters.

    Canon of that show is pants-on-head retarded. It embraces all the worst shonen anime tropes with a zeal I've not seen before or since. One character with any development, (Sasuke, and he has a shitty character arc) a nonsenical world domination plot that relies on the power of narrative causality, ignoring whatever in-universe rules previously detailed so the MC can power up with power of FRIENDSHIP/DREAMS, and plot holes the size goddamned Hummers. Attempts to make the story a bit less dumb are commendable.

        In defence of Tracers' claims:  
        1) Naruto IS typical shonen, but that's also why it's so popular as an intro to anime.  
        2) Characters do have development, but most only have the extremely lazy "start out bad, then turn good" character arc. Look at Neji: Starts out as promising character, then is turned into a Naruto fan through the power of face-punching, then... nothing.  
        3) The world domination plot is indeed idiotic: The moment Madara actually TRIED he succeeded in capturing all 9 beasts in a matter of minutes, yet he makes his plot that convoluted?. Throughout the whole story the main villain, who was unkillable and could teleport anywhere instantly, took 16 years to do... nothing.  
        4) Power use is often clever and interesting, but they are also forgotten or invented as the plot demands.  

        I love Naruto for the setting, the great fights and of course magic ninjas, but it certainly does have big weaknesses!
