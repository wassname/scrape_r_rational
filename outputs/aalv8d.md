## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  A mysterious being appears in your dreams, and tells you that it is selecting 10 randomly chosen humans to be its apostles in collecting human followers. Each apostle gains the following abilities:

  1. Whenever a human swears an oath of devotion to an apostle, that oath is magically binding. From then on they are magically compelled to obey any command given by the apostle to the best of their ability. The oath of devotion is irrevocable (even the apostle cannot cancel it), and can only be sworn once (a human cannot be devoted to multiple apostles).
  2. Dominion over an emotion. When you become an apostle, you must choose an emotion that hasn't been chosen by any other apostle. Henceforth you and your devotees will only be able to feel that emotion, while all other humans are unable to feel that emotion.
  3. Whenever an apostle dies, their consciousness takes over the body of one of their devotees (randomly chosen). So an apostle only truly dies if there are no more devotees to take over. But even then they can be revived if someone later swears devotion to them.

  &#x200B;

  Note: An oath of devotion can be given to an apostle even if the apostle remains anonymous, the potential devotee just has to identify the apostle indirectly in their oath. For example, they can swear an oath of devotion to the nearest apostle, or to the apostle with dominion over emotion X, or even to the apostle that their friend A has sworn devotion to.

  &#x200B;

  By chance, you are the first human this mysterious being has contacted. If you refuse its offer, it will simply find other humans until it has 10 apostles. Do you accept its offer? If so, what emotion do you choose and why?

  &#x200B;

  EDIT: It seems the original rules had effects that were too drastic to properly munchkin, so let's make some changes:

  1) Total dominion over an emotion takes time. An apostle that chooses an emotion gets only 10% (additive) dominion over it per year. What that means is, if the apostle chooses an emotion like "hate", one year later, all non-devotees will feel 10% less hate whenever they feel hate. And 10 years later, only devotees of the apostle will be able to feel any hate.

  2) Apostles and their devotees can feel every emotion except those claimed by other apostles.

  3) Whenever an apostle dies (even if there are still devotees to take over), the dominion of the emotion resets to 0%. So an apostle has to stay alive in one body for 10 years in order to gain total dominion over an emotion.

    > Henceforth you and your devotees will only be able to feel that emotion, while all other humans are unable to feel that emotion.

    I know this sounds narratively interesting but I suspect it is mentally crippling to everyone involved. I think you've underestimated the role of emotions in normal human behavior. There's evidence that having preferences is inherently emotional, and that having a damaged capacity to experience emotion impairs decision-making.

      This sounds like one of the more evil mysterious beings.

      An apostle chooses happiness. Every human not sworn to them...becomes depressed? Until they and all their followers die?

      Fear. Sadness. Awe. Love. Joy. Curiosity. Nostalgia. Grief. Remorse. A desire for change. Complacency. Contentment. Enlightenment.

      The only way an apostle exists and humanity still exists is if

      1. The apostle says "humanity" or "human" and they get the full complexity of experience - and everyone else loses it until they swear to them. (Humanity is reduced by a current scale factor of several billion.)
      2. An apostle meets aliens, and chooses one of their emotions that humans can't feel (already).
      3. An apostle makes up an emotion humans don't feel, or finds a way to make the deal without the emotion aspect -  just \~immortality + control of those sworn to you (after they become an apostle).
      4. Someone manages to come up with an emotion that doesn't exist anymore, or currently exists only in nonhuman animals.

      >the potential devotee just has to identify the apostle indirectly in their oath. For example, they can swear an oath of devotion to the nearest apostle, or to the apostle with dominion over emotion X, or even to the apostle that their friend A has sworn devotion to.

      5. Instead of specifying the emotion directly, the apostle uses a condition like one of the ones above or "an emotion which humanity is not reduced without, if any".
      ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      *Extremely* crippling, because even the apostles get shafted. The first apostle to get joy/happiness is going to give literally the entire human race depression, the first apostle to take fear is going to give the human race the capability to commit suicide without second guessing themselves to say nothing of the other stuff that happens, etc.

      Emotions are basically how we weight decisions: does this make me happy or sad, will this lead to happiness or sadness, how guilty will this make me, how does this affect other peoples emotions, etc. I'd say that it's impossible to make logical decisions without properly working emotions (see: depression, drugs)


      As to the prompt: I'd ask whether the being defines joy and happiness as the same thing, and then take it. I'm probably going to horrifically die from compromised decision making, but at least noone is going to take my happiness away. I'd also hope that contentment is covered under that, or that noone thinks to take it.

      Another strategy is which emotion would cripple the other apostles to the point that they're incapable of choosing an emotion. Happiness is probably too general to do that, so hope or excitement might cut out large swathes of the populations. That still leaves anger, spite, and hatred as motivations for choosing an emotion, which might not be the best if you're trying to keep yourself as unmodified as possible. 

      How fast is it? Is it instant, takes real time, or something else? 

      I'd also use the fact that I have a monopoly on happiness to get the other apostles to swear an oath to me, simply to find out if killing them will end the curse they inflicted on humanity.

      >With that in mind, I choose "Desire to Become an Apostle" as my emotion, ensuring that no one else will accept the deal and humanity can continue mostly unharmed.

      It wouldn't really work, since there are plenty of ways to get the same result using different emotions. Even if you feel no desire to be an apostle, you could feel extreme apathy and just accept because you don't really care one way or another. Or feel impatience and accept because you just want to get things over with. Or feel fear about letting other people become apostles and so accept to be one yourself. Or feel disbelief and say yes to challenge the mysterious being to see if it can really make you an apostle.

      > But let's not think in such absolute terms. Maybe apostles are merely masters of emotion, and while other humans seem muted in comparison, they aren't actually brain damaged.  

      Good idea, I've changed the setting so that the dominion over emotions is gradual, so other humans are merely muted in comparison at first. An apostle must stay alive in one body for 10 years before the dominion is complete to the point where other humans are actually incapable of feeling that emotion.
      ```

    I looked over the list of emotions on Wikipedia. Any of the choices seem like they would resemble brain damage. The least-bad one I could find was interest, but even that would resemble brain damage if you are always interested regardless of appropriateness for that emotion. Should you feel interest in every advertisement you see? Every bit of gossip? Every meme? Every idea or plan? Every drug? There are times when it is reasonable, appropriate, and even necessary to be disinterested to avoid getting dragged into stupid, useless, self-destructive crap.

    Depression and anger without reason for it are both studied as psychological disabilities. I suspect that you would be unable to pick any emotion that could be present at all times and not appear to be a form of brain damage.

    To repeat everyone else, using this for the being’s purpose probably can’t go well. With that in mind, if I’m limited to things most people would consider emotions (i.e. nothing incredibly specific), the only thing that seems moral would be to pick hate, attempt to direct it at the being, and kill myself immediately to combat its plans. This would still have a huge impact on humanity, but at least I think it would be a change for the better. Now, the other 9 would be likely to ruin the world, but I have to hope that they would also do their best to limit the damage from removing an emotion entirely.

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Are tribalism or uncooperativeness emotions? In either case, this would result in a perfectly unified world after 10 years, which would have a few decades to figure out the Tower of Babel situation when I die and the dominion resets. I would accquire a few apostles younger than me just for the immortality and ability to reorder things if we can't figure out the Babel problem, but getting an army of followers doesn't really appeal to me.

  [Dungeons and Dragons 5e]

  I posted in here a little while back about defending the town, but that endeavour was ultimately successful. By turning the enemies on their own siege engines and decapitating the leadership, the opposing army was turned away and the city saved.

  Now, we are the effective rulers of a badly damaged city of 8000 people. With the *Fabricate* spell, I'll finish rebuilding the destroyed houses and walls in about 4 weeks, but that's not a very time-consuming endeavour. I personally have about 4400gp of wealth, and even that is flexible as I can *Creation* up gold to give to shopkeeps. 

  I have about 7 weeks of downtime. I can either [craft magic items](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dLdgN05CeM1ZTIInmorsBhDkOdz6RIS-/view?usp=sharing) or alternately [conduct spell research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RavNnZ3eyD6K3Yosz6dph5vZdotORVvThZI8IXaSl3U/edit?usp=sharing). Crafting magic items (according to the existent ones from WotC seems fairly useful, as for instance a Broom of Flying provides permanent non-concentration, non-attunement flying at the cost of one hand used to hold on. On the other hand, conducting spell research *potentially* has new and incredibly useful effects. In the spell research document above:
  * I first list out all the spells I have and brief comments on how they can be used. This is probably not useful to you.
  * I then list out how those spells can be slightly modified or combined for more effective results. This is what I need help with.
  Given the base spells that I have available, what avenues of research would be most valuable? What creative applications of old spells in combination or with slight alterations could lead to powerful results?

  There are two objectives in particular to optimize for. First, at some time during the downtime, I need to destroy a castle. It's filled with Cthulu cultists who are doing bad things to spacetime, so ideally the destruction of the castle also kills all the cultists but I'm okay with a 2% survival rate. This would be trivial but for the fact that my wizard has sworn to do no harm (hit point damage) personally, so it needs to be outsourced to proxies. Second, the next section of the campaign will involve fighting dragons. A lot of dragons. Anything that's optimized specifically towards that is helpful as well.

  So yeah, in summary, I have a lot of free time, and I have to either make items or make new spells to let me destroy a castle and fight some dragons. Any ideas?

    Unless you're using some weird house rule, precious metals made with [Creation](http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/spells/creation.htm) only last one hour, so they're worthless for most purposes other than cheating people. Your idea to use Fabricate should be fine though, as long as you have appropriate raw materials to work with.

    Your best munchkiny usage of Creation is probably to create vegetable-based fuel materials, like coal, wood, etc. and burn them. For example, a five-foot cube of coal would weigh about 6,250 lb. You could burn it for about ~85 GJ of energy (~24 MW⋅h), enough to continuously sustain about a megawatt of output if you cast the spell once per day. You could use that to run a lot of smelters, forges, and kilns, allowing the town to produce large quantities of weapons, armor, tools, and pottery at somewhat reduced cost. The 5E SRD doesn't list a cost for wood or coal, but in 3E and PF it's 1 cp for 20 lb. This would make the spell worth about 3.12 gp in terms of money you could save by not needing to import or locally-produce the coal or firewood.

    ... Uhm.. Fighting lots of dragons, means you need the clone spell, like, yesterday. Or some other way to get back from the dead, because you are going to need it. Repeatedly. Seriously, a campaign to fight dragons in job lot would be challenging if you are a *lich* - for a wizard... uhm. yhea. 

    Dragons are smart, rich, long lived, and oh, yes, also enormous fire breathing flying lizards. Those facts are ordered in *descending* order of threat.  Best bet if you cannot render yourself unkillable would be to try and craft a spell that turns this into a campaign of "Lies and Deceptions in caverns" - that is, a disguise as a dragon that will actually hold up to a dragons sensorium and magic, and even then.. Uhm.

    transumute rock, a 5th level spell from xanathars(p.169), will help you with the castle. turn a 40' cube of stone wall/tower into mud from 120' away. 

    for the dragons, 1st suggestion would be a ring or cloak of protection for everyone on your team. the +1 to save is a nice bonus, and everyone will be making wisdom saves vs fear and dex saves vs breath. generally you want to find solutions that help solve those two problems. there is a level 1 reaction spell that will give you resistance, absorb elements (xanathars, p.150). have that prepared and you will be able to take half damage when the dragon breathes on you- it can save your life (unless its a green dragons poison).

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Also bring a lot of rogues and clerics whenever fighting a dragon. Beacon of Hope will give advantage on WIS saves vs. fear, and Evasion is excellent for breath weapons.

  You have come into possession of a box of "darkbulbs" - lightbulbs that radiate darkness and shadow instead of light. Specifically, they emit scotons: elementary darkness particles, that counteract photons.

  The darkbulbs resemble common household incandescent bulbs, but where one would expect to see a wire filament, there is a small lump of black glass. When the bulb is powered, everything within line of sight of the bulb becomes visibly darkened, with the darkness falling off over distance just as light does, and also reflecting off objects. The darkness feels cool on your skin, and the bulbs become very cold after extended use.

  The box comes with 8 bulbs, each rated at 60 watts and 800 fuscens. The brand name is "Moon King", and there is text on the back of the box explaining how to install and use the bulbs, and a support address for somewhere in New Zealand. The package design is functional yet amateurish, and lacks any legal information about the product or company.

  What do you do with these bulbs?

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Various science experiments of course! Since they are anti-light and anti-heat, check if they have other anti-properties. Do they have a (very weak) anti-gravity field? Could they be related to the dark matter in the universe? When electric current runs through the darkbulb, does the electromagnetic effect have reversed polarity? Are there any supermagnetic effects? Since they are some kind of negative heat energy, can they be used to reach temperatures below absolute zero? Is it more energy efficient to cool temperatures with darkbulbs as opposed to other cooling technologies? Do they allow ***backward*** time travel?

    If all those experiments fail to produce anything useful, these darkbulbs can still be super useful, so find a way to mass produce them. Shining darkness has all kinds of uses, especially for war. There's a reason why night attacks were so common in wars, because darkness is awesome for hindering your enemies. 

    You can even launch satellites with lots of solar panels to collect sunlight to power super strong darkbulbs, and place those satellites over enemy countries, creating a permanent night where they live. Without sunlight, their crops will fail and they will slowly starve to death without you needing to send in a single soldier.
