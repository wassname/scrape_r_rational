  So this is what an outside context problem feels like. You go around having an adventure in Kanto. There's some ecounters with the storm birds, and they are terrifying but at least a known quantity. There's mysterious renegade plots afoot. A hidden conspiracy to create a manmade pokémon that you might be let in on because of your special psycic abilities. There's many plotlines going on, but every day you and your friends learn more and grow stronger, hoping to make a difference in the world.

  Then it all ends because some idiots down in Hoenn played around with forces they couldn't control and you die in an earthquake, crshed by debris. Or maybe survive, but only due to dumb luck. You're not even getting involved later on, there's some other kids having their own adventure who are working on it. Because not everything in the world revolves around you, and the planet is filled with lots of people all living their own lives and being the protagonists of their own stories. 

  But hey, maybe you find a secret team rocket base in a basement and fight the secret evil boss and get some magic ghost goggles and everything works out somehow. Who knows, it might happen.

    You hint at a possibility of the continuation of this story being the death of the OG trio as one of the senseless acts of violence that visit all our lives, and a pivot point to continue the tales of Brendan and Wally and May.... Fascinating. Like a Mega-Ned Stark.
    ```

    - u/Electric999999:
      ```
      Not very likely, May, Brendan and Wally seem pretty close to the end of their adventures so we're unlikely to see much of them.
      ```

      - u/Radix2309:
        ```
        I mean there is always the Johto squad.
        ```

        - u/PDNeznor:
          ```
          Ah yes, a two year time skip so we can read the exciting story about jumping down a well to stop the sales of slowpoke tails. Fuck it, why not?
          ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    Max and May are already inbound on Rayquaza so we probably won't even hear any more about this except for aftermath and offhand comments. An underground renegade bunker is much more important because that's where our heroes are.
    ```

    - u/I_Probably_Think:
      ```
      Generally agree with the statement except it seems like they’re actually on Lati@s. That would explain the two different locations, and the use of the word/comparison “jet”.
      ```

      - u/mbzrl:
        ```
        Yep. And Wally is on a random island, random as in the sky pillar

  BEST. CHAPER. EVER

  Yes I am a Hoenn baby. I was lucky enough to experience gen 3 as a kid, so my imagination made everything greater. But it never EVER came close to this level of disaster. I don't think words could explain how this chapter makes me feel, a deep part of my mind finally watching its childish adventures adquire the size and horrifying terror they should inspire. I feel like... like justice has finally been made for Hoenn.

  I am so happy right now. My only regret is that we don't have a whole book of this. Bias aside, the story of brendam and the others looks much more interesting, they even got latios and latias! And wally is with them! And bias inside, you even sort of confirmed mega evolution!
  ```

  - u/WankSocrates:
    ```
    > BEST. CHAPER. EVER 

    Seconded. So many perspectives, all of them great, and wow did it paint a hell of a picture of just how much trouble the world is in right now.

    I love everything about this arc so far.
    ```

  - u/The_Magus_199:
    ```
    I want to live in the alternate universe where DaystarEld wrote Pokémon: The Shoulders Of Giants or something set in Hoenn, hehe. I love Hoenn so much...

    (Seriously tho I’m kidding around, the story we have in this reality is incredibly good.)
    ```

    - u/Ceres_Golden_Cross:
      ```
      Shut up now I want it too. Why does kanto has to get all the good stuff.

  I didn't realize I needed a Hoen interlude this much  


  and now I need more

  ```
  > or all of life being drained away and turned to stone 

  That migh be a reference to Yveltal?

  > or its light eaten away to leave them in eternal darkness. 

  That one has to be a reference to Necrozma
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Yep on both.
    ```

- u/CarVac:
  ```
  So this is the difference between 580 base stat total and 670…

  Mere destruction versus near-omnipotent manipulation of the world itself.
  ```

  - u/mgmfa:
    ```
    Don't think that plays much a part, given that Mega-Metagross has base 700 stats
    ```

    - u/CarVac:
      ```
      Yeah, even a dragonite has a higher BST than the stormbringers.

      Unless levels are uncapped in this world, and the legendaries are ancient and level 62870 compared to trainers' level 70 pokemon...

      Also, these are probably primal forms with BST 770.
      ```

  - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
    ```
    I figure that there's an inherent Legendary bonus going on here. That, or they've exceeded level 100 by a considerable bullshit margin.

    Obviously the most effective strategy is to feed the Titans experience until their level exceeds 255 and ticks over to zero and they can be caught in a basic Pokeball. Or perhaps a butterfly net.
    ```

    - u/CarVac:
      ```
      Just chuck a Master Ball at them, easy.

      (how's /u/DaystarEld gonna handle Master Balls? Do they even exist?)
      ```

      - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
        ```
        A Master Ball is like a missile case with a label that says "your weapon of mass destruction here -->".
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I wonder what that says about [Urayne](https://pokemon-uranium.fandom.com/wiki/Urayne)...
    ```

- u/anenymouse:
  ```
  So there are definitely hints that this is more ORAS than RS mostly from the whole riding of Latias/os, the emotionless girl running with Team Magma, the pirate reference in regards to Team Aqua, the Mega-stone-element-type-things, also the teams having the right orbs and the legendary they're associated with getting larger within a visible timespan is probably foreshadowing it's primal reversion. The whole Groudon and Kyogre conflict thing being "solved" in canon by rayquaza is less than encouraging in the general sense. I really think it's funny that where our group of Red, Blue and Leaf got stalled by the appearance of a Mobile Disaster Legendary that Brandon, May and Wally weren't stopped and that their plot speed progression went apace which leaves their climax months of time in advance.   


  Also nods to the fact that Dark-trainers cannot be teleported (yet) which is internally consistent and appreciated. Also small island is probably mirage island, Birch isn't a former trainer from his being tree-ed by a route one mon which in this canon was much more of an actual threat and less of a joke in context. I also appreciate that Groudon is literally hot enough to burn through/sublimate the ozone layer above it.   


  Also Mewtwo is riding along with Kawabata which means the AI has officially breached containment and may the basilisk have mercy upon them all.
  ```

  - u/royishere:
    ```
    I thought the small island was the island with Rayquaza's tower on it - i.e., Brendan and May went off to stall Groudon and Kyogre while Wally woke the dragon.
    ```

    - u/PDNeznor:
      ```
      That's Mirage Island. And I'm pretty sure the final lines of the chapter imply that he was successful and Rayquaza is about to drop some gale force whoopass on everybody in the vicinity.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        The sky pillar and mirage island are not the same. 

        In the games, the sky pillar has the crumbling floor you need to bike the really fast, and in the manga, it requires two people (one adult sized and child sized) working together to traverse. In both, it is an enormous tower with powerful pokemon that Rayquaza sleeps at the top of.

        Mirage island, on the other hand, is an island that only appears under rare circumstances. In the game, it’s the only way to get the wynaut line and a rare type of berry, and has no impact on the plot. In the manga, time alternates between flowing quickly and slowly, and it’s somewhat sheilded from the outside world; as such, it’s where Ruby and Sapphire practice teamwork to take down Kyogre and Groudon while Steven Stone uses the Regi trio to stall them in sootopolis.
        ```

        - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
          ```
          Steven Universe crossover confirmed!
          ```

    - u/anenymouse:
      ```
      I mean that's possible but like we've never seen any legendary that was willing to help people I wasn't sure that we could even count it as a possibility. It does make some sense that in general Rayquaza is the force that balances Groudon and Kyogre, but like we don't have the same kind of benevolent Legendary context of most other canons. I mean even a neutral would probably be good enough in this situation but like i'm not convinced that Rayquaza doesn't just still the air around it to the point that even getting near it suffocates you. At the same time Brendan and May riding the Lati-twins so it could go either way.
      ```

      - u/diraniola:
        ```
        This might be the start of benevolent legends awakening. Depending on how the lore develops we could see Lugia calming the stormbringers with Ho-oh doing the same for Jhoto's dogs. Mewtwo could be the catalyst, bridging the gap between wild Pokemon and humans in a way that doesn't subjugate the ancient forces of nature represented in later gens.
        ```

        - u/DavidGretzschel:
          ```
          Ho-oh isn't asleep. It's just.... kinda shy? But Aiko saw it, like Ash in the anime in the first episode. And it does create Pressure.
          ```

        - u/anenymouse:
          ```
          It's certainly possible. I still feel wierd in retrospect that like N is running around and while Leaf isn't the opposing hero that like Reshiram and Zekrom aren't like the big ticket legendaries of Unova. I mean even within the canon of Alola like the Tapus are just a force of nature and it's hard to ascribe either malevolence or benevolence to them. Like even StormBringers are explicitly compared to like giant storms and it's hard to imagine a force like choosing ***now*** to intervene minus like explicitly a force of i dunno stasis or something? I mean it kinda does give Lugia a counter theme to Ho-oh's rebirth if it's stasis in contrast.

          &#x200B;

          Edit: like yeah no it seems like most of the box art legendary mons are either secluded or outright sealed, but like it's even wierder to think that anything could seal them. Or that say Reshiram and Zekrom would be forgotten given their place in history. Also calling it now that AZ's weapon weakened the non-active Legendaries or like made it so that they were dormant till now.
          ```

  - u/Toastybob42:
    ```
    The small island could be mirage island but it seems more likely to be sky pillar, unless that was changed somehow in ORAS.
    ```

  - u/sharikak54:
    ```
    Nice catch on Birch being the professor that gets chased by a Poochyena!  That’s a great reference.  I love this fic.
    ```

  - u/Toastybob42:
    ```
    What do you mean by riding along?
    ```

    - u/anenymouse:
      ```
      " Mixed in with those worries are a feeling of gratitude, and it isn't until he reaches the power room that he recognizes it as separate from himself."

      Which in my mind tells us that Mewtwo or a fraction of Mewtwo is able to influence other people maybe this is the first time only done in response to the earthquakes. Also how much the guy is tempted to let Mewtwo loose which most of the people should know better than to casually consider.
      ```

      - u/Toastybob42:
        ```
        Interesting. I assumed it was just standard psychic mind reading and emotion projection.
        ```

- u/Odisseia:
  ```
  I liked this chapter overall, even though I have some problems with Magma and Aqua being dumbly evil. I guess Giovanni as mafia boss was a realistic evil mastermind, and Archie and Max are the most unrealistic of the entire series. Really liked Steven chacterization, also Phoebe and Drake. Cant wait to see Brendan and May and Rayquaza.

  Also, the Sinnoh titans are the Regis? I had though them to be Hoenn's, Sinnoh's trio being the Lake one, which would be pretty cool.
  ```

  - u/Ceres_Golden_Cross:
    ```
    I would say that some hints have been drop that their motives aren't just dumb evil... radicalized and blind groups for sure, but like the irl ones. Man I really wish we could see more of TOoS' Hoenn.

    &#x200B;

    > Also, the Sinnoh titans are the Regis? I had though them to be Hoenn's, Sinnoh's trio being the Lake one, which would be pretty cool. 

    Actually, in Pokémon Platinum you can find the Regi Trio. And even the Storbringers get to roam around...
    ```

    - u/Radix2309:
      ```
      It also reflects the flaws of rational enemies without trust. Archie seems to have betrayed Maxie. This means Maxie cant trust not to betray him again. Archie knows this and cannot trust Maxie either.

      This lack of trust causes the prisoner's dilemna. Each is worried about the other getting the Titan, thus needs to get it first. Each is worried about the ideology they believe the other holds that surely endangers the world. While in reality they each are likely not as extreme.

      Also in the Manga, Maxie was a bit more altruistic, while Archie was a complete monster.

      It also doesnt help that Giovonni is involved somehow as a wildcard.
      ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    So the Lake Trio seemed like the most likely legendaries to be non-destructive? Or at least non-walking-disasters. One thing I've been very aware of whenever I mention other regions is that, if people want to write OoS-fanfics in other regions, I don't want to stomp on too many of their own ideas for how things would work/go (this chapter in particular was hard to write because of picking up a story so close to the end without focusing on any of the major characters).

    I know Hoenn introduced the titans, but they were locked in caves. Since Regigigas is in Sinnoh, and to awaken him you have to bring all the regis to his location, *and* there are regis in Sinnoh as well, the way I'm envisioning it is that there's actually multiple regis, and if Regigigas in sinnoh rises during "the Sinnnoh story" it'll be because the ones there converged on its location. Whether that means there's a Regigigas in every region that has titans, I'm less sure. Maybe it can just be formed anywhere that the titans are awake?

    In any case, this is the event that causes the titans in Hoenn to wake up, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Couldn't think of a way to work it into the weather trio before/during other than them trying to fight Groudon and Kyogre, but that seemed like it would take too much away from them being each-other's fated enemies.
    ```

      >One thing I've been very aware of whenever I mention other regions is that, if people want to write OoS-fanfics in other regions, I don't want to stomp on too many of their own ideas for how things would work/go

      Reading your story *always* makes me want to write my own OoS fanfic, so I'm happy to see you've considered it!

      Also I just want to take this opportunity to say I love your writing, even outside of OoS. Thank you so much for taking time to do so!
      ```

      - u/Cariyaga:
        ```
        If you ever do, be sure to post it here! I'd love some OoS-fic! :D
        ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    >even though I have some problems with Magma and Aqua being dumbly evil.

    Also one thing I tried to do with the first line was show that the myths of what Groudon/Kyogre can do are not quite as explicit/extreme in this world... which maybe helps? Like if they don't say "they will drown the world" then maybe you think a pet God of the Sea is a good idea.
    ```

    - u/gamerpenguin:
      ```
      I interpreted it as something like Archie and Maxie having a prisoner's dilemma. The animosity from Archie's seperation meant they knew they wouldn't go the "wake up neither" route, so they had to wake up both to stop the other.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yep.
        ```

  - u/Aretii:
    ```
    I was also confused about this; Hoenn was where the Regis were introduced. In Gen 4 Regigigas showed up to be the trio leader, but you need the Regis imported from Gen 3 to encounter Regigigas in Diamond/Pearl.
    ```

    - u/Radix2309:
      ```
      Until Platinum. There you could get them in Sinnoh.

       And Daystar has been taking from all generations that fit. We even have the potential for Mega Evolution.
      ```

      - u/Electric999999:
        ```
        Pretty sure Steven has Megastones, so he must know about it.
        ```

        - u/Radix2309:
          ```
          He has them, but he seems to have discovered the minerals. Ee dont know anything really about them or where he got them. But he also doesnt seem to be aware of their capability to Mega Evolve yet. 

          He may have discovered it during his studies of evolutionary stomes and may tie it to a specfici pokemon, but I feel pile if he discovered mega evplution, people would know.
          ```

          - u/Electric999999:
            ```
            I feel like he wouldn't name them after Pokémon without a good reason.   

            I could definitely see people trying to keep it as a secret weapon when first discovered, particularly in Hoenn which doesn't seem to have the same roaming legendary disasters as other regions and therefore has much less pressure to use every advantage possible, particularly for someone already as powerful as a champion, save it for a big emergency or a major challenge to your title.
            ```

            - u/sibswagl:
              ```
              I think it's plausible that he knows it does *something*, but hasn't quite figured out what yet. It's possible Aggronite reacts to an Aggron, even if you don't Mega Evolve it, for example.
              ```

  - u/writersfuelcantmelt:
    ```
    I'm also curious about this. Don't the 3 Regi's call Hoenn their home? I also assumed they'd be sleeping, perhaps even moreso than the weather trio... But then, who would wander and wreak havoc on Sinnoh? Darkrai and Cresselia? The Lake Trio? Surely the Creation gang slumbers as well.... Maybe Sinnoh is as safe as Hoenn (or it was, anyways...)

    Come to think of it, most legendaries start the series comatose and are brought to life. Makes you wonder how many of these plots overlap; obviously gens 1 and 3 are occuring. We heard rumour of Giovanni's son, Silver, implying that perhaps gen 2 plot is underway, or just being setup to start after gen 1. But then who woke the Dogs? Or where they 'always' active, like the Birds?
    ```

    - u/Radix2309:
      ```
      Canon gen 2 takes place after gen 1. Usually a few years later. The rest is up in the air.

      The beasts were always active since their resurrection I believe.
      ```

      - u/writersfuelcantmelt:
        ```
        Isn't their resurrection the result of the main character though?
        ```

        - u/Chosen_Pun:
          ```
          The legend where Ho-oh returns 3 pokémon to life to create the Legendary Beasts takes place 150 years before the events of the games, in what is now only known as the Burned Tower.

          They only appear after a certain point in the game but it's more for gameplay reasons; narratively, it's vaguely implied they took an interest in the player character as a potential trainer (like most legendaries across the series) but they weren't "dormant" before you "woke" them in any direct sense
          ```

          - u/writersfuelcantmelt:
            ```
            That's a huge deal! Thanks for clarifying
            ```

            - u/Chosen_Pun:
              ```
              Of course, in fanfiction, anything can happen; if an author chose to interpret the Burned Tower sequence from the games as "kid exploring abandoned ruins stumbles into hibernating lions' den, accidentally unleashes hell on earth where previously there was none," it wouldn't be *that* much of a stretch.

              Keep in mind that in the original canon, the Legendary Birds wait patiently for you to confront them in their roosts, and the whole Stormbringer thing is, if not *entirely* original to OoS, a deliberate and well-reasoned departure for the sake of drama and education in risk assessment.
              ```

              - u/writersfuelcantmelt:
                ```
                Not to mention being thematically consistent and believable... We now know that there are both earthquakes ripping apart infrastructure, and a partially completed power plant North of lavender. I could definitely see Zapdos showing up, maybe even roosting there for it's off season; but, inherently, will move soon.
                ```

    - u/DavidGretzschel:
      ```
      We have Aiko encountering Ho-oh, which is implied to be the missing Spring-time Stormbringer. Aiko and all the other pokemon on the ranch experience the Pressure. Sadly she never told anyone before she got herself killed :(

      In the anime, spotting Ho-oh is what happened to Ash (minus the Pressure, which isn't a thing in the Anime). It was a little weird, cause it happened in the first episode when the Gen 2 games weren't even out yet.
      ```

- u/The_Magus_199:
  ```
  I’m not going to lie, when I saw that this chapter is an interlude, I was a little sad.

  ...for about five seconds. Then I remembered what happened last time, and what this interlude was likely to be, and holy shit am I so glad to be right.

  This chapter was so cool! It felt almost like a peek into an alternate universe where this story is an adaptation of Hoenn, and the Birch scene is the culmination of a fic-long character arc about his insecurity about not being a battle professor but wanting to help, haha. Seeing the hints at Brendan and May’s journey from third-party perspectives trying to figure out what the heck is going on was really cool.

  I think the Weather Institute head is my new favorite character.

  - u/ArcFurnace:

    I'm a little uncertain if the "Birch and Norman's kids" line is supposed to be implying that the two are together, or rather that at least one kid is Norman's and another is Birch's.

      Yeah I read that section again and you're right, they could just have a kid each. That and they're calling each other by their last names, which would be weird for a couple. ~~Perfect, that makes the ship more crack.~~ So I suppose it's just Steve.

- u/Dragolien:
  ```
  Amazing chapter. Initially I was disappointed to see an interlude right after last chapter's cliffhanger, but reading about the events in Hoenn definitely works as a substitute.

  I won't lie, after this I'd be incredibly interested in seeing more of the protagonists from other regions. If you decide not to elaborate much more on them, I'd be expecting a few metafics to pop up down the line.
  ```

- u/Leemorry:
  ```
  Holy shittttttt, this is so much to digest!  

  I have to admit, as someone who hasn’t seen the anime/movies or played any of the games, I feel like I’m out of the loop at this point, but it’s still incredibly exciting
  ```

- u/TheGreatTactician:
  ```
  So DaystarEld, I have to ask something that's been on my mind lately about your world's setting. It's obvious at this point that legendaries and mythicals split into two categories: well-known terrors who roam the world, or myths and legends that no one is truly sure if they exist or not. It seems like the only legendaries that the populace as a whole acknowledge as existing are the violent legendaries that threaten people's lives with their very existence. But, surely there must be some benevolent legendaries and mythicals that people know exist, right? Are there truly no well-known legendaries in this setting that are considered benevolent or helpful? I know that in your setting, the idea of the legends being actual beings of nature or gods is blurred, but certainly, there has to be some legends that are helpful, right?
  ```

    I imagine the Lake Guardians of Sinnoh this way, as well as the "fairy" mythics (Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, Shaymin, etc, the term existed before Fairy did as a type), as well as the Swords of Justice in Unova and the Tapus in Alola. Also probably the sword and shield dogs?

    In a sense these are actually "neutral" by the way they don't cause massive destruction, but in that sense Ho-oh and Lugia fit the bill too. It's hard to justify actual "helpful" pokemon because that implies some level of sapience, unless they just have a passive positive effect, which is how I imagine pokemon like Xerneas working. My headcanon for the Swords is something like "they seek out powerful opponents" which is why there are stories of them only ever fighting rampaging, powerful pokemon, rather than killing humans.
    ```

    - u/TheGreatTactician:
      ```
      Very interesting. I suppose since, aside from Mewtwo, none of the Pokemon in your setting are sapient, it'd be strange to have "good" Pokemon so I can see where you're coming from.
      ```

    - u/FletchMaster26:
      ```
      Interesting, I would've thought that some level of sapience could have been something separating the "fairy" legendaries from the rest of the Pokemon species, though without that it further highlight's Mewtwo's uniqueness. Perhaps this is just coming from a personal desire to see the protagonists team up with powerful yet independent Pokemon a la the 5th Pokemon movie (or really any other Pokemon movie come to think of it), or the idea of hidden forces of (mostly) good acting in secret or being able to be awakened or called on.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        I definitely get the appeal of that kind of world, but I feel like sapient and good pokemon would fundamentally change the pokemon world as presented, let alone sapient, good, *powerful* pokemon. As soon as someone with the ability to change, say, the weather, or enable time travel, or heal wounds, becomes a "character," the genre changes entirely. This is in fact a big part of why canon takes on the pokemon world are so often nonsensical.
        ```

        - u/FletchMaster26:
          ```
          True, sapience itself would be too big a departure. A more realistic situation could be the protagonists coming across a Pokemon without a trainer they're unable to immediately catch (for whatever reason) but isn't immediately hostile, which an encounter with one of the "fairy" legendaries would maybe provide. I'd be curious to see the different reactions from Red, Blue, and Leaf, and potential discussions from each of their points of view, because it seems like it'd be an unusual situation within the context of this world.
          ```

          Sapient, good, powerful pokemon only present as benevolent gods so long as they agree that humanity and their activities qualify as good.

          Few things are worse to fight against than a justified apocalypse.

      Aren't the Tapus responsible for destruction in the games, though, like Tapu Village and the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yeah that's kind of what I meant by "neutral" more than anything. I see the the Tapu in specific as being fiercely territorial of certain areas, which leads to instances like that, while not actively rampaging generally, and also defending the islands from sufficiently powerful invaders, leading to people would worshipping them as (fickle) guardian spirits.
        ```

  - u/PDNeznor:
    ```
    We get a little of that in this chapter actually with the latis. Its been stated before that the only real problem with them is if they break the sound barrier too close to settlements. Otherwise they seem to have a thriving taxi business transporting 10 year olds to battlefields.
    In the games, legendaries are also split into two categories: those in the game and those gifted at events. The latter ones are called the mythics (mew, celebii, darkrai, arceus, keldeo, etc). It seems daystar is more or less following that trend where the gift legendaries are the fairy tale pokemon and the in game legendaries are the force of nature pokemon.
    The only legendary group that might break this trend is probably the lake trio since their lore is closer in feel to that of the mythical pokemon.

  I like that Groudon and the Big Aquarium Fish don't seem to have Pressure (consistent with the games, too!). If only so we can see Prof. Oak fight again.

  The truce with the ~~villains~~ renegades gives me Worm-vibes, but it's not like Stormbringers aren't obviously similar in concept to the Endbringers. I like it, especially because these two friends are very much more so in the end-bringing business.

      Tier 3s are wide effects over an area. It feels like Tier 4 would be region-wide event. So tier 5 is across the entire island? Or is it the top level of the scale and global?

          ```
          This feels like a not-very-useful schema, given that regions are political units and so most things impactful enough to be a T4 would slide into T5 if they just happened to take place close to a border... but that is a very realistic sort of classification inefficiency that I can absolutely imagine people making for black swan events.

          - u/sir_pirriplin:
            ```
            It's not inefficient. A T4 that happens close to a border should be bumped to T5, because T5 probably has protocols for international coordination and so on.

            The important thing about the T whatevers is not how big the crisis is, but how to respond to them.

            - u/Radix2309:

              Plus it seems like most regions are a bit scattered, with Kanto and Johto being unusually close and kind of 1 region. The exact organization of the Indigo league between the 2 hasn't really been clarified.

          - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
            ```
            The tier classification is entirely about committing the right amount and kind of resources to a crisis, and one that involves multiple regions has a very particular suite of response requirements.

  The problems of Kanto and Johto look almost quaint by comparison to the problems the Hoenn team seems to be dealing with! I love how interconnected the regions feel in this story, which makes me curious how the main team will fair once things start kicking off in Sinnoh... EDIT: Oh wait, I think the Sinnoh events start around the Lake of Rage incident in Johto, so maybe not.

  Not too familiar with much that happens after Pokemon Blue, but these last two chapters are really making me want to pick up some of the more recent games.

  Honestly, I'm hoping that things don't get too serious. Lots of serious things have happened that are still unresolved, and having the party get swallowed up in another impersonal tragedy does feel somewhat exhausting. It would be great if their own involvement in the fallout remains something close to home.

  Still, curious to see where this is going.

  At first I wondered if Steven's confusion over Tabitha being male or female was a rib on his name being feminine. But on retrospect, maybe that's a somewhat sexist notion. I guess it's a rib on his cartoonish character design then? With his non-gender-conforming name just a point of additional confusion for later, if poor Steven tries to follow up on that train of thought.

  Another point of curiosity: Brendan, May and Wally had other companions with them? In a way it makes sense, since breaking into a renegade hideout is something you probably should have numbers for, but Birch's PoV didn't indicate he was aware their group was bigger than the main three, like it would if he thought to get around the "glitch" by locating where Brendan and May's friends are clustered...unless the "other trainers he's keeping tabs on" passage specifically meant he was trying exactly that? (I actually thought the extra members could have been Latios and Latias, since in some stories they're depicted as being able to shapeshift into/create illusions of humans - but probably not, considering what was said elsewhere in this comments page, about pokemon with sapience breaking the setting.)

  Another thing this comments page enlightened me to: the Pokemon games apparently have a canonical ordering, where Gen I and III takes place at approximately the same time. So the awakening of two of the Weather Trio here wasn't *just* a matter of unfortunate coincidence wrecking the floor of Celadon casino's floors and presumably some of Team Rocket's secrecy along with it, huh.

  Further random thoughts: high-profile Dark trainers like Sidney and Karen seem to consistently favour Dark pokemon...or maybe it's the opposite, and Dark pokemon, at a high enough level, tend to come under Dark trainers. Either way, that's probably not helping the perception of Dark trainers being attracted to Dark pokemon. Also, looking back, it probably should seem odd that everyone refers to Norman by first name and Birch by last name, and only doesn't by virtue of the fact those are the only names for them that we know. From an in-universe perspective though...is Birch's first name something really embarrassing? That might explain why even a (presumably) close friend like Norman refers to Birch via last name. Well, the alternative is that Norman is just strict enough in character that he refers to most people by last name...but nah, the idea that Birch's first name is embarrassing it too amusing.

  Not sure if the next chapter's going to be another interlude to finish off the side-story in Hoenn, or we're heading straight back to Kanto to see how things are going down under the Celadon casino, but looking forward to it regardless.

    I'm basically treating them as genderqueer/non-binary, if not outright trans, due to the translation error of their name, and yeah their new appearance is fairly androgynous.

    As for other characters like Norman and Birch, I tend to cobble together names from their Japanese and English ones, so if one of them is missing it's just easier to treat them like the kind of person everyone refers to by their first/pseudonym (gym leaders) or their surname (most professors... who also might just be using pseudonyms, because goddamn are there a lot of plant-based Professors somehow)

  I loved this. It makes we want to revisit my D&D idea of someone summoning an Atropal in a neighbouring locale and the characters having to deal with the effects during a different genre adventure.

  I have a couple of questions.

  1: Regardless of whether they actually show up in the story, which seems unlikely, how much of a threat do you figure the Ultra-Beasts to be? How would you have them work in this setting? The games and show have both depicted parallel versions of their worlds that were wrecked by them, and there is a chilling theory that the universes where the original games were set were ultimately destroyed by Ultra-Beast incursions because they lacked the power of mega-evolution and Z-moves necessary to contend with them.

  2: I caught a shiny Groudon in Pokemon Go. Is there one of those hiding below Hoenn too?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    1: Since Ultra Beasts apparently aren't quite "legendaries" of their own world and don't even have a BST of 600, I would basically treat them like very powerful but not godly pokemon, on par with pokemon like Snorlax or even the pseudo-legendaries, despite their lower stats.

    2: Congrats! And... maybe! :D
