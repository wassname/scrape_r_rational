## [META] How is /r/punchingmorpheus related to rational fiction? Why is it in "Related subreddits"?

  I agree. Don't really see how it qualifies as even a remotely related subreddit.
  ```

    If that's consensus I can remove it. It predates my time as a mod though, so I'm not sure when/why it was added.

    Edit: Alright, removed.

      Huh, I didn't even realize that was there. I made a post that linked to it a few months ago as a bit of cross-subreddit awareness for rational relationship advice/philosophy, but agree completely that it doesn't belong in the Related Subreddits field.

    Removed that one too, mostly because it's run its course and the sub has too few people for any actual discussion, plus its relationship is almost entirely tangential. (Feel free to give me any strong disagreements here.)

    I started /r/rokosrooster as a place specifically to discuss how silly he basilisk is, especially because it's one of the most internet-popular pieces of LW culture.
    ```

      It wouldn't be a part of LW culture if the wider internet would stop pretending it is, which I suspect is the reason that /u/FuguofAnotherWorld objects.

      That said, yes, the Basilisk is silly, and I can think of no less annoying context to say so than /r/Rokosrooster.

  Funny story. It was originally a sub dedicated to the abolition of sleep on the premise that the art we produce now is more thrilling than dreams -- instead, they said, we should spend that time making and consuming rational fiction. Sadly lack of sleep did a number on their heads, and their tired logic suggested that even bothering with art was useless because relationships provide a more primal pleasure. So between sleepless promiscuous nights they're now trying to perfect those through a Dr. Bronner-esque philosophy that we're held in a false entrapping Matrix, termed the Blue Pill, of political correctness and effeteness that dilutes the primality of our desires, but from which the only and equally wrong escape is the Red Pill, representing the domineering view that women are weak and worthless. In short, there is no escape. I repeat there is no escape. Neither pill is acceptable. All we can do is avoid sleep to see the horror with more clarity.

  The sleep is behind me right now, isn't it?

      Don't slay the courier of an ideology. I like dreams too.

      I know, right? Like saying that water is outdated because we have hard liquor. Don't get me wrong, hard liquor has it's merits, but it's kind of shit at the hydration thing.

      Not from my perspective.

      I would trade my right arm for the ability to never have to sleep again, and never being tired in the sense of feeling like I have to sleep.

      I doubt that I don't dream, but I have never been able to remember one, or even have a vague feeling of having been dreaming. I naturally find it more than a little difficult to fall asleep unless I'm exhausted, and once I do fall asleep, I wake up with no time having passed from my perspective.

      Unfortunately, if I don't get 7+ hours of sleep, I feel like shit for the whole day.

    That escalated quickly.

      That part isn't made up.

        Eh, okay. They have some strange jargon and worldviews. I still don't see what misogyny and the pills from The Matrix have in common, but I'm sure it makes sense to them.

          You clearly haven't been awake long enough.

          People who take the red pill in the Matrix see the world for what it really is when they wake up.

          People who "take the red pill" in the real world are people who accept the worldview of that subreddit. They're said to see the world for what it really is, instead of deluding themselves. Of course, the reality is completely the opposite, but that's their thought process.

  To aid mobile users, I'll link small subreddits not yet linked in the comments

  /r/punchingmorpheus: This subreddit is dedicated to those who want to throw off society's expectations of gender roles and sexual strategy and form real, lasting, healthy relationships with their significant others, regardless of sex or gender.

  I remember this! 

  It was posted here a while ago; I didn't realize it got put on the sidebar at the time, it was just bringing attention to the subreddit at the time.
