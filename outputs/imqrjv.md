## [FF][RST] The Erogamer: A Darker Timeline (sfw)

### Post:

The Commander stood straight with his hands clasped behind his back, carefully upright despite his age even with no one present to bear witness to it.  His eyes had fixed on the sterile white drifts beyond the reinforced window of his office, now appearing black beneath the night above.  Some might have called the view uninspiring, but not far beyond the window lay a grave.  It was not a much-decorated grave considering the expense it had taken to bury its sole occupant there, beneath a shipping tag torn from a compressed-air container and pinned in place with a knife.

The Commander wished that it was the grave's occupant standing here now instead of him.  He didn't know what the hell he was supposed to do now, but whatever it was, the grave's occupant would have done it better.

Failing that, being able to phone home for orders would have been nice.  The first flash of bad weather that knocked out their radio hadn't perturbed the Commander.  The second surge, that knocked out the repaired radio, had perturbed him more.  After receiving their unexpected visitor they'd took a chance on activating their last set of spares, and a storm had knocked that out too.  Now they were out of contact for days, at least, until the base technicians could improvise another solution.

It didn't seem likely the visitor could have caused all that.  But he was also having a hard time believing that it had been sheer coincidence.  Perhaps their visitor had known that they would be out of contact, at this particular time, and had chosen just then to arrive...

The communicator on his desk warbled out its mock-melody, and the Commander took a step over to press the button with only a glance at the ID.  He'd been waiting on this call.

A young woman's voice said, "Sir."

There had been a time earlier in his career when he would have been nervous about handing over duties this important to a member of the fairer sex.  He felt no such anxiety this day.  Nobody got assigned to this Base unless they were damned good at their jobs.

The vidscreen flickered into action, displaying the upper half of - the Commander privately admitted and would certainly never say out loud - the prettiest sight on the Base, or at least, she'd been the prettiest sight as of one day earlier.  If Major Jane Getherde was feeling any feminine jealousy about her suddenly materialized competition, she wasn't showing it.

"All right," the Commander said.  "Tell me about our... guest."

"Do you want the most important parts first or should I take things in order?"

"Take it in order, if there's nothing of imminent urgency."  He should have been woken again from his sleep if that had occurred.  He wouldn't have been sleeping at all, in this situation, except he'd already stayed awake the previous 36 hours trying to fix the radio problem.  He was no longer as young as he'd been.

Major Getherde's comportment betrayed no sign of fatigue from her own sleepless night.  "All the noninvasive examination I could do with medical instrumentation I had on hand showed our guest as an ordinary human female in every respect.  Zero scars, zero birthmarks, no evidence of significant surgeries.  White, perfectly aligned teeth with no evidence of fillings or other dental work.  Her feet do not have calluses."

The Commander raised a hand and massaged his temples.  "Can you tell me whether we're looking at advanced medical care, genetic engineering, or something wearing a newly grown body?"

"I can't think of an easy way to tell.  You could order me to inflict a small cut on her and observe how fast it heals."

The Commander grimaced.  "Let's continue holding off on that for now.  The items she had with her?"

"The earrings glow faintly in the dark.  No alpha or beta, very low gamma, consistent with a properly shielded isotopic power source.  The high heels seemed ordinary on a surface examination.  I didn't want to try more destructive tests, such as X-Rays that could potentially destroy concealed microfilm, without waiting for orders."

Considering that the visitor had been wearing nothing except earrings and high heels on arrival, under circumstances where a visitor should have been wearing rather more, he would have bet a great deal of money that the heels were not ordinary either.  "Agreed.  Keep holding off on that."

"A full medical examination revealed that the subject had a small case hidden in her vagina.  I, ah, took it out.  It wasn't locked, and inside were two ampules that looked like they were intended for a hypodermic injector.  The case is self-refrigerating."

The Commander grimaced, not liking to think of the required invasion.  "Any notion of what it was doing up there?"

"No sir.  Obvious thoughts are that she was hiding it, or that something about her transportation method made it easier to carry things inside her body.  The XO decided that the equipment should be kept away from the subject for now."

The Commander nodded.  "I concur.  Continue."

"The two ampules inside the case appeared to be filled with a homogenous transparent liquid.  Since there were two seemingly identical ampules, the XO agreed that it was reasonable to draw a small amount of the liquid for further examination.  After optical microscopy failed, I had the electron microscope moved into the medical section.  Electron microscopy showed virus particles in suspension."

The Commander didn't straighten, because he was already standing completely straight, but his expression sharpened.  "A virus?  Are you sure?"

"It was hard to be sure from electron microscopy alone.  After some discussion with the XO I decided it was worth the risk to inoculate a live mouse with a tiny amount of the fluid - under highest biohazard conditions - in order to observe the results."

The Commander shook his head, frowning.  "Not what I would have done," he understated.

"I wasn't sure how long the sample of liquid would survive.  The XO thought it made more sense to use it before losing it, rather than needing to draw another sample later.  It did seem like something we'd want to try at some point."

The Commander sighed.  "So do we now have a shape-changing psionic supermouse destroying our base?"

"No sir?"  Major Getherde sounded uncertain.

The trouble with youngsters nowadays was not just that they lacked history but that, lacking history, they lacked imagination.  If you were a Native American and people in unfamiliar ships suddenly showed up on your shore, you would be mistaken to assume that your experience with arrows let you understand the destructive potential of the invaders' ammunition stores.  Playing with the stranger's toys while she was asleep had not been the correct move.

"What did happen?" said the Commander.

"After a period of four hours consistent with rapid incubation of a disease, the mouse developed a fever.  At four and a half hours it began to bleed from all orifices, then it... melted... and then what was left caught on fire."

The Commander scrutinized Major Getherde to see if she was joking, although that seemed unlikely under the circumstances.  "A bioweapon?" he said, feeling chilled.

"I would be shocked if it were intended as a weapon, sir," Major Getherde replied, sounding more confident than her previous statements.  "A bioweapon should have a long period of contagious incubation, and should only produce symptoms that contribute to its propagation or lethality.  Nobody engineering a bioweapon would sit there thinking about how to make the corpse catch on fire after it finished melting."

The Commander nodded, feeling ashamed of himself for not seeing that earlier, and mentally upgrading his estimate of the girl's competence by another notch.  "Do you have any idea what the virus is, if not a weapon?"

"Speculation only.  I think we may be looking at a biological Swiss army knife, a multitool.  A portable lab.  I can't see much detail with our equipment, but the virus particles were huge, as large as a herpes virus, and those can carry hundreds of kilobases of DNA.  In the hands of an expert, there might be specific settings that produce supermice.  We didn't know how to use the portable laboratory, so it deployed random effects that melted the mouse and set it on fire."

That made a surprising amount of sense.  The Commander turned the idea over in his mind, considering it.  If he had been traveling far from his home civilization, unable to carry even the clothes on his back but still able to carry one kilo of material, his first thought would have been to bring with the Library of Congress on a hyperchip, plus a microfilm on how to construct a reader to retrieve the hyperchip's data.  Taking an entire laboratory wouldn't have occurred to him... but that was because his civilization still thought in terms of machines and engines, rather than kilobases of DNA.  His race had unlocked the secrets of the Atom; the mysteries held in Life were of a higher order.  "Do you have any idea how to operate her... laboratory?"

"It could be a matter of exposing the ampule to a sequence of colored lights.  Or feeding a subject the right mix of eye of toad and tongue of newt before infection, if the tool is meant to operate in more primitive settings.  The key could be in the earrings, or the high heels, or something we haven't spotted.  It seems likely to take considerable experimentation, if we can work it out at all."

The Commander grimaced.  "Had the feeling it was a stupid question, but I was hoping you'd tell me otherwise."

"Sorry sir."  Major Getherde looked genuinely apologetic.

"Not your fault, son," the Commander said before he could stop himself, then helplessly considered if he should correct himself to "daughter" which did not sound right to him, or apologize to her, or... it was probably better to just drop it.  "Next steps?"

Major Jane Getherde spread her hands.  "Wait for our guest to wake up."

As if timed to her words, beeping began to sound from off the vidscreen.

\-------------------------

A couple of hours later, the Commander was sitting beside Lt. Commander Akio Nagasaki, his base second-in-command, one of Japan's contributions to NATO.  Major Getherde had been the only person to have physical contact with the visitor, sealed away from the rest of the base in the medical quarantine unit - the most obvious and basic of precautions.  The Commander had on further consideration taken the less obvious step of ordering that only Major Getherde was permitted to communicate directly with the visitor.  The existence of psionics and mental superpowers still seemed unlikely, even under the circumstances.  But the Commander couldn't be sure, that was the problem, he couldn't be sure of anything.  The visitor could have a hyper-advanced organic computer buried in her brain, indetectable to X-Rays, augmenting her ability to read body language and manipulate lesser minds.  God damn it, shouldn't his base have had detailed protocols on file for a Little Green Man scenario?

"Report," the Commander said to Major Getherde's image on the vidscreen.

Major Getherde had a distant look about her, as though she was operating on momentum while not really believing in what was happening.  "Our visitor identified herself as 'Starry' and presents herself as being... well, sir, I know it sounds unbelievable, and I'm not asserting any such thing myself, but 'Starry' claims to be from an alternate branch of Earth's history."

Beside him, Nagasaki's eyebrows flew up, the Japanese man showing more open emotion than he usually did.  The Commander's own mind was recalling dim memories of sci-fi stories he'd read when he was a good deal younger, in particular the Paratime stories by H. Beam Piper.  In his mind's eye he stretched out a long timeline of Earth's history, ready to extrapolate possible changes.  "Point of divergence?" the Commander said at once.  He'd been prepared to stay calm in the face of stranger stories than that one.

The Major looked taken aback herself at her Commander's lack of shock.  "Ah... I'm not sure.  Taking everything she said at face value, 'Starry' said she was from the United States of her world, a town called Norville in central California.  We don't seem to have a national street map on base, so I couldn't check her knowledge of local roads, but she had Interstate 5 right.  Her belief about the current date and year matches ours, minus the day she spent unconscious.  She confirmed George Washington as the first President and that Abraham Lincoln won the Civil War.  She recognized Eisenhower's name, though she wasn't sure whether he'd been President.  Mentioning Harry Truman's name made her say 'Dewey defeats Truman', so that part happened the same way.  World War II ended with atom bombs being dropped on, ah..."  The Major's eyes darted in the direction that would correspond to Akio Nagasaki on her own vidscreen - an unnecessary concern, but the Major evidently didn't know that.  "The same two cities.  No recognition of Adlai Stevenson's name, or any later Presidents from our world except Jimmy Carter.  She named John F. Kennedy as a President in her own world, one she remembered because he'd been assassinated."

That put the divergence at 1960 or earlier.  Part of the Commander's mind was trying out possible stories for what would have changed without Stevenson in power.  More of his attention was focused on the further implications of her not knowing whether Eisenhower had been President in her America.  "She didn't know her own world's history?" he said.

Major Getherde wore a look of faint disapproval.  "She had to think hard to remember the current Speaker of the House - Nancy Pelosi, no idea who that is - and she had no idea at all who her Representative was."

"Amnesia?" Akio said.

"I don't think so, and she didn't seem otherwise stupid or scatterbrained.  More like she'd played hooky on all her high school civics classes and her family didn't subscribe to any newspapers."

Akio snorted, mirroring the Major's disapproving look.

The Commander lifted a quelling hand.  "Don't judge her when we don't know her circumstances," he stated.  God knew there were still some kids, even in America, who legitimately had more urgent concerns than their future civic duties.  "The larger implication is that our visitor is not an experienced... parallel-timeline traveler, let's call it, or 'paratimer' for short.  I would expect a veteran paratimer to have a wide grasp of history."

"Our visitor seems reluctant to speak of how she got here," Major Getherde said.  "But it did seem like her journey might have been... unintended."

Beside him, Akio was frowning.  "She brought arong a biorogicar raboratory in her vagina," he said in his accented English.  "I doubt she arways carries one in her vagina."

It was a good point.  The Commander pondered it.  "Her apparent age doesn't square with travel on diplomatic or military business," he said aloud.  "A stowaway?  A refugee of disaster?"

"Our visitor did seem somewhat in shock when she first woke up."  The Major seemed slightly embarrassed.  "My first priority was putting a blanket around her and telling her she was safe, which seemed to help."

Akio and the Commander traded glances.

"Continue with the report," the Commander said.

Major Getherde looked down and off-screen, probably at her notes.  "Again taking all she says at face value, her timeline is advanced beyond our own in the biological and computational sciences, behind us in atomic energy and space travel.  Specifically, her timeline doesn't seem to have developed liquid-phase fission reactors, with drastic consequences for all civilization.  She had vague memories of learning about an 'oil crisis' that happened in the 1970s.  Global warming is becoming a planet-threatening catastrophe.  She didn't recognize the names or models of the first Nerva-series spaceships, and seemed genuinely shocked at the concept of using atomic energy for propulsion.  Her first question was about radioactive waste contaminating the atmosphere, and she looked surprised and interested when I said a spaceship's atomic reactor only heated the propellant rather than spraying out fissionable materials."  Major Getherde spread her hands to display her own puzzlement at the visitor's puzzlement.  "Her world has one space station and that's it.  She didn't know its tonnage, or whether it was in low orbit or higher.  Her people visited the Moon in the 1960s a few times and then they never went back."

The Commander pursed his lips, loading this scenario in his mental timeline.  "I hadn't thought liquid-phase atomics would represent a serious technological bottleneck," he said.  "I certainly wouldn't expect the idea of using a reactor to heat inert propellant to be a difficult concept."  He glanced at Akio, who might know more.

Akio seemed absorbed in thought.  "Both riquid-phase reactors and inert-properrant rockets have great engineering difficuruties," he said eventually.  "But I wourud not have expected it to be impossiburu in the face of effort.  There is no brirriant invention at the core, only much work."

"It could be a cultural issue," said Major Getherde.  "Our visitor seemed to show traces of a superstitious or religious dread about atomic energy."

"Hm," said the Commander.  He was by far the oldest person on the Base, the token Experienced Officer appointed to ride herd over much healthier youngsters.  Even he wasn't old enough to remember the initial introduction of A-bombs in 1945.  Still, he knew that dread of atomic energy had been widespread immediately after.  If that attitude had persisted and grown, producing a general retreat from material technology into the realm of the mental and biological... he could see it, the Commander supposed.  Especially if their timeline had acquired stronger justifications for fear.  "Any large-scale atomic exchanges in their history?  Any use of atomic weapons above the deca-kiloton level?"

"I... I'm sorry, sir, I didn't think to ask explicitly.  It hadn't occurred to me that she wouldn't have mentioned something like that, if it had happened."

The increased fear would have needed to begin early enough to avert research into liquid-phase atomics, which had begun in the 1960s according to his memory.  Truman had still been elected in 1948, with events proceeding similarly enough to duplicate the famous headline...  "Maybe ask her about the Korean Invasion in particular," said the Commander.  "Truman played a damn tight game there.  Using Mark-4s may have gotten the NKs to back off, but a lot of historians worry it could have gone the other way - normalized the general use of nukes in warfare, instead of showing that we were willing to use tac-nukes defensively."

Major Getherde nodded.  "I'll ask.  However things played out, their Cold War ended in the late 1980s with victory to the West -"

"*How?*" the Commander demanded, leaning forward at the vidscreen as if to press answers out of it.  That could be the single most important item of knowledge their visitor had.

"She had only vague ideas.  Her rough picture was that the Soviet Union ran out of resources to contend with us and gave up, dissolving into its constituent countries."  Major Getherde spread her hands.  "The Eastern economies have always been less efficient.  As it stands, they're wringing their civilian populations dry to maintain a war footing.  Take away everyone's atomic generators, and..."

"Christ," the Commander muttered.  "Talk about the mother of all mixed blessings."  What he wouldn't have given for a good look at the history shelves of a dozen timelines!  If there was a real Paratimer civilization out there, their grasp of history would be chemistry to his Earth's alchemy.  A true science that laid out cause and effect with surgical precision, relegating his own historical monographs to poetical essays for the fiction stacks of the library... with an effort, he focused again on the vidscreen.  "Maybe I'm being sidetracked from more important issues, but curiosity is eating me alive.  What happens after the end of the Cold War?"

Major Getherde hesitated.  "Not... not what we'd hoped.  My impression is that her United States is also on the verge of dissolution."

A shock of horror went through him.  The Commander reminded himself that it wasn't his world... but if there were mistakes that could destroy the West, it was the type of lesson best learned in a single world, once.  "What's happening to them?  Running out of coal?"

"I..." Major Getherde looked at her notes, and shook her head.  "I don't know how to - I don't understand - her attitude towards capitalism versus communism was one of utter despair in both systems.  I don't know whether to write it off as teenage nihilism or if her world has been through experiences I can't imagine.  I asked if they were having an economic depression.  She said that official statistics said no, but it seemed to her like the economy in her city was feeling very sad.  And though she didn't say it in so many words, it sounded to me like her America was heading for civil war.  As if the only thing holding the USA together had been the Cold War, and once the common enemy was gone, internal divisions began tearing America apart.  Political lines more than racial ones, 'reds' versus 'blues'.  And it also sounded as if - as if the United States lost interest in its ideals once we didn't have the Soviet Union to contrast ourselves to.  People being arrested and held without trial and, and worse.  She didn't seem to think other Western countries were better off, and she didn't think the decay was being driven by environmental meltdown or resource exhaustion but by some type of - inward despair, madness, a mass psychological catastrophe of unknown origin.  I halfway expected her to describe Martian telepaths launching a psychic assault on all of Terra's sanity like in *War of the Worlds IV*.  Some of what she said sounded like a joke, or insane, the most extreme case being that Donald Trump was elected US President in 2016."

"I have not heard of him?" Akio said, glancing in the Commander's direction.

The Commander was trying desperately to keep a straight face.  President Donald Trump.  Christ, that wasn't funny, it wasn't funny at all, what was wrong with him, that had actually happened in some poor lost timeline out there.  There were real people living in that para-Earth, American citizens, his officers would be rightly critical of him if he started laughing.  He just hadn't been prepared to encounter those three words in that order.

"Imagine the most vulgar man in the world," the Commander said, once he felt confident in his ability to keep it together.  "Donald Trump is twice as vulgar as that.  The only reason the Dems would field him for the White House would be if they wanted to horrify Republicans as much as possible."  He was tempted to crack a remark about having not thought even the Democratic Party could sink that low, but he restrained himself.  It wasn't his world's Democratic Party, and political dialogue was vitriolic enough without mudraking for scandals from multiple timelines.

"Ah... sir, she said Donald Trump was elected on the Republican ticket."

For a second the Commander thought he'd misheard.  "Say again."

"Donald Trump is a Republican President in their world."

"Is he a conservative in their timeline?" the Commander said blankly.  "Family man, distinguished service record?"

"She had only vague ideas about his policies but said that the main one she remembered was building a giant wall between the United States and Mexico."

Akio and the Commander looked at each other, and both started to speak at the same time.  Military protocol being what it was, that meant the Commander went first.  "Can you imagine selective developments or non-developments in military technology that would make a new Maginot Line useful to the USA in the event of war on a Mexican front?" the Commander said.

Akio shook his head.  "Extreme deemphasis of air power?  I have nothing."

The Commander looked at Major Getherde.

"I - I don't think - I don't think we *can* understand - there's something very wrong with her world.  I said that to her outright and she just nodded.  The things she said - I can't summarize, it was a gestalt feeling - that was the largest single thing but there were little things too.  She's from a timeline where that is what their lives are like."

"Something went wrong with their advanced biotechnorogy," Akio proposed.

The Commander felt the chill all the way to his ankles.  His base's reactor needed a more powerful self-destruct.

Major Getherde glanced back down at her notes.  "I had a similar thought," she said.  "There could be some drug or supplement that everyone was taking, with undiscovered effects on the brain, like the lead-poisoning theory of the fall of Rome.  They'd have no way of knowing that what was happening in their timeline wasn't normal."

The Commander thought that the woman might have an unexplored talent for writing psychological horror stories.  Christ, what a terrifying thought.

Major Getherde was still talking.  "Another possibility is that it has something to do with their more advanced hyperchip technology.  'Starry' said they'd recently developed the false-reality device that's always five years out according to Popular Science - completely surrounding a person with a binocular 3D vidscreen built into a helmet.  That could be having an effect on their psychology, I suppose?  People losing contact with reality?  Or some broader psychiatric syndrome caused by too much contact with the inhuman logic of computers.  An emotional reaction, people clinging to instinct and illogic as a form of protest..."  Getherde let out a breath.  "I keep wondering whether there's some way for our dimension to launch a rescue mission to their dimension, but I have no idea what we'd do once we got there."

"Let's not get that far ahead of ourselves," the Commander said.  "Anything else to report?"

"Our guest seemed oddly interested in hearing about," the woman looked uncomfortable, "well, our sexual standards.  I think she was surprised when I told her we were, ah, normal.  As if she was expecting to arrive in a culture more... licentious."  Major Getherde hesitated.  "She seemed surprised that I, personally, was making no attempt to force myself on her.  Despite the *extreme* inappropriateness given the age difference *and* the serious overall situation *and* my position as a medical doctor, on a *military* base where both of us were being *recorded at all times*, not to mention that she is effectively our prisoner and protected by *international conventions!*"

"She's a resbian?" Akio said.

The Commander gave the younger man a sideways glance, just to make sure he wasn't leering, but his comport looked as decorous as usual.

"More that she expected *me* to be homosexual, and - and she thought that's what homosexuals were like!"  Major Getherde sounded even more uncomfortable than before.

An intuition tickled at the Commander, born of years of command and experience with subordinates being evasive.  He thought again about sci-fi depictions of psionic powers, or implanted hyperchips for reading body language.  He needed to ask Major Getherde, in strict confidence and with some urgency, whether the visitor had in fact been right about her - whether the Major had felt a desire to take advantage of their visitor, and properly repressed it.  But not with Akio listening.  The Japanese were less liberal than modern America about such matters.

"The two packages of virus?" said the Commander, giving the Major a chance to change the subject.

"She seemed surprised that I'd found them at all.  Then she said she'd only discuss that with the base commander."

The Commander pursed his lips thoughtfully.  It could be a trick to get into his presence.  It could also be a legitimate request for any number of excellent reasons.  Put Akio in temporary command?  The man was as steady as any XO he'd known.

"That reminds me," Major Getherde said.  "I'm not sure, but... I think the visitor might have recognized your name when I said it, Commander?  She did ask for you by name, after I explained the radio outage and said you were at the top of the current chain of command."

"Ran for President in her timerine, on the Democratic ticket," said Akio, and the Commander shot him a glare.

The Major hesitated.  "Actually... I'd have to review the recordings... but in retrospect, I think that mentioning your name was when she stopped acting like I was about to sexually assault her.  It was shortly afterward that she first asked for clothing.  It's - it's sad that the flag on my uniform wasn't enough.  I would have hoped that the Stars and Stripes would mean more than that, even across timelines.  Are individual people greater constants than countries?  Do genes count for that much?  Or fate?"  She shook her head.  "Sorry, sir, it's hard not to think about - to get distracted by - doctors usually don't have to deal with issues this deep during medical examinations."

"Hmmm..." the Commander hmmmed.  Akio's crack there, born of long acquaintance between them and trust enough to jaw about politics, had triggered a thought.

Then the Commander chuckled, unable to help himself despite the severity of the situation.

He'd spotted the joke.

"All right," the Commander said, "I guess I'd better talk with the young lady.  Akio, I'm relinquishing command to you pending our recontact with home."

"Sir," Akio said.  He hesitated.  "Are you certain this is wise?"

"If we trust appearances, this young lady knows one of my alternate selves quite well.  Well enough to wind me up some while letting me know that she and I are acquainted.  I doubt she made up the story of her dying world from whole cloth, but she did change one detail."

Akio raised his eyebrows again.

The commandant of Heinlein Base leaned back in his chair, an easy motion in the low gravity.  Beyond him in the window behind, the searing darkness of the Lunar night stretched out above Mare Imbrium, the white dust blackened beneath it, save where a single spotlight imperishable shone upon the grave of the base's namesake.  "*Republican* President, my ass," said Commander Marcus Adan.

  I'm probably never continuing this, unless I decide to start a story series written in "the Dimension of 1950s Republicanism" without other reference to the Erogamer continuity.

  For those who aren't familiar with the style, this is written as "the future as described in pre-1970s science fiction".  Including, for example, the fact that Akio speaks with a written accent; I would not otherwise write a story in which somebody had a written accent like that.  Or in which I bothered to look in on a military commander's thoughts about whether the medical officer was pretty, etcetera.  If either trope strikes a modern reader as jarring, it's meant to be so.

  Not posting this to [the original Erogamer on Questionable Questing](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465) because they have a rule against multiple accounts (which is the kind of rule I usually obey without strong reason otherwise) (so I can't make a throwaway account) and I prefer not to reveal which account there is mine.  It might also violate their Rule 8: No Politics, but that's a moot point given the previous one.

    ```
    Not sure if it was intentional but your attempt at writing Akio's accent was pretty piss-poor. Japanese-accented English doesn't replace every l in the spelling with an r. Japanese language just doesn't have an l or an r phoneme in it, so English learners often can't remember which one it is when speaking (and it can go either way, so "rabbit"->"labbit" is as likely as "hello"->"herro").

    Anyway, words like "would", without an audible l, are not affected.

  If anyone enjoyed this, they might also enjoy Larry Niven's "The Return of William Proxmire," which is a 10 page story that is also about alternate timelines, 1950's Republicanism, and Robert Heinlein. 

  I couldn't find it hosted anywhere accessible on the internet, so I'm going to include a link to a google docs version that I'll take down in a bit.

    Diane Duane's short story *Uptown Local* is in some ways pretty similar.

    Though it's also simultaneously *Young Wizards* fluff (fanfic by the author? She even does self-insert fic on Tumblr), urban fantasy, science fiction, and a Heinlein tribute from a friend. Not sure if there's a free version online, but I'll recommend anything in the setting and this is a great entry point.

      Thanks, I enjoyed that one quite a bit; I read some of the Young Wizards books while growing up, which I think nicely prepared me for some of the commons themes and ideas in rational fiction. It’s fun to see that Diane Duane has her own entry in the hyper specific genre of alternate universes, 1950’s conservatism, and Heinlein tributes; three  examples of that genre is already more than I really would have anticipated, wonder if there’s any more

        I think the key is that, well, what else could a Heinlein tribute be? The author's introduction to *Uptown Local*:

        > Most of my stories are presents for somebody or other. When Jane Yolen asked me to write something for her anthology  Dragons and Dreams, the recipient I had in mind was Robert Heinlein—who (to my complete astonishment and delight) was a fan of the Young Wizards books. It’s been impossible to forget the time he brought up  Deep Wizardry in the middle of one phone conversation. “I’m a Navy man,” he said. “We don’t like sharks. You made me like that shark.” A pause. “That was a dirty trick.” And his laughter…  

        > I miss him.

  Your prose remains very pleasant to read.


  I enjoyed the ambiguousness of the title, with the readers probably having differing thoughts than the characters on which timeline is the darker one. It works especially well due to Cindy's canon pessimism coloring the explanations she gave them. Their reactions may have been slightly too strong though. Not sure if I would jump straight to mass scale biological accidents when hearing of Trump's presidency. Granted, as a European, I did feel some disbelief when I heard he was elected.


  I am missing the twist at the ending. Marcus is Charles' grandfather, if I recall correctly, and Heinlein is ofc a sci fi writer who in this timeline apparently was a moon base creator instead. But what detail did Cindy change? And what does the last line mean?


  Edit: ah, the last line refers to Akio's joking comment. Still don't understand what conclusion the commander reached.
  ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    Marcus Adan, characterized as an eternally 1950s-style Republican to the point of that being his religion, thinks Starry is joking about Trump being a Republican President, and thinks that her timeline actually had Trump as a Democratic President.

    Note that even in our timeline, Trump was a Democratic donor before something got into our water supply.

      The spinning in Barry Goldwater's grave is now fast enough that if they hooked him up to a generator it would power the entire state of Arizona. :/

      My guess is that the same thing happened to him as happened to my dad and countless other adults of his rough age group across the country: rightwing radio/news radicalized him from mostly centrist to insane conspiracy theorist.

  I haven't read the Erogamer, who is Marcus Adan supposed to be?  Is this understandable without the original context?
  ```

  - u/ArisKatsaris:
    ```
    Charles Adan is Starry's fiance/primary lover/most important love interest.
    Marcus Adan is Charles' late grandfather and a person that Charles holds in the utmost respect as a pinnacle of moral virtue and wisdom.

    So basically Cindy realized she was in the custody of (and about to meet) her fiance's extremely highly esteemed and respected grandfather, that's why she asked for clothes and stopped thinking she was experiencing a sexy adventure where the guards would molest her.

    To be brief, he is the grandfather of the protagonist's Dom, Charles Adan, who is also her primary moral compass reference point. Charles speaks highly of his grandfather often, crediting much of his worldview to Marcus.

    No, he's a character in the original fiction.

  thanks for writing this!  Did the original Erogamer quest end?  I just realized that I have not seen an update here in a long long time
  ```

  - u/groon_the_walker:
    ```
    No.  But I may write a final update set and end it soon.  I have less free time during the Coronaviral times, rather than more, and the series has been getting harder to write over time.

      Damn, that sucks to hear. It's one of my all time favorite stories. If it does end though, I'm wondering, do you have any plans to write anything else?

      woah, the actual author, thanks for doing what you do!  while you are here, could i get a link to the official story? my google-fu is failing me

      Why would you end it? Even if you just put it on hiatus, the story has *so much promise*, I want to see this story continue!
      ```

    - u/yourrabbithadwritten:
      ```
      Yet another vote for hiatus rather than ending. As far as I concerned, it had barely *started* yet, but even so I would prefer it *not* to end. As in, if it came to that, I'd rather prefer it be abandoned entirely, rather than end, though of course I wouldn't like either.
      ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  Wonderfully written, as usual. This makes me want a Three Worlds Collide where instead of aliens it's representatives from three alternate histories (or, from our perspective, our history +2 alternates) colliding.
  ```

- u/the_one_butcher:
  ```
  After Marc has outlined his speculation, the rejoinder could be:

  "It... it might have been the climate. After the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded and irradiated Europe we became too afraid of nuclear power to save it. The republican party was backed by corporate interests. When it was determined that we needed to slow down our industry to save the climate, they blocked it. They began to deny the problem. They started lying. If once you tell a lie the truth forever becomes your enemy. Soon they needed to deny science to defend their lie. And all good honest men fled to the democrats."
  ```

  - u/CronoDAS:
    ```
    The other thing that got the Republican party the way it is was Nixon's "Southern Strategy" of appealing to the racist vote. My impression is that by the 1950s there were racists and anti-racists in both parties; racism and civil rights were an important political issue, but not a *partisan* political issue. When LBJ managed to get the Civil Rights Act through the Senate, he remarked that they had just lost the South for a generation; the Democrats ended up as the party of civil rights and the Republicans eventually turned the South red.
