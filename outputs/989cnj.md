## [HF] Some worldbuilding by the author of Unsong: "There are two worlds, Wake and Dream. Wake is our own world. Dream is another world people go to when they sleep... Can anyone think of any more interesting or unexpected dynamics that might come up in a world like this?"

  TL;DR: Dream is a pile of dead babies.

  If the mechanism through which people are projected into Dream connects to the brain in any measurable way, Wake scientists would begin to notice something odd once brain scanning became possible. This is the best mechanism I can think of for bridging the gap between the worlds, as memories one forms concerning the existence of Dream while awake might not be erased, and if they were erased others would still notice the discrepancy.

  Everyone in Dream basically has a discount version of Coil's power. If they try something that doesn't work in Wake, they won't try it again in Dream. This would have really interesting implications for war, and I don't even know how to model conflicts in a world where everyone knows a ton of things not to do. 

  Even worse, people vanishing from Dream when they Wake would make any kind of strategy hinging upon people being in specific places at specific times downright dangerous. A dog barking in Wake could cause a plane to crash in Dream, so any kind of transportation which requires people to run it is only as reliable as the driver's sleep schedule. Also, if you always respawn in Dream exactly where you left off, vanishing from Dream while in a moving vehicle pops you into existence outside that vehicle. This probably means that transportation technology beyond handcarts doesn't exist in Dream. The only safe way to move anywhere is to walk.

  Natural disasters in Dream are even more deadly because you won't be able to escape from them. If a forest fire starts while you are in Wake, you will pop into a blazing inferno and die in agony. If predators exist in Dream, they could note where a person pops out and lie in wait until they pop back in, devouring them before they have a chance to respond. I'm assuming you can't telefrag, but what happens if there's a flood over a massive area? Do you appear above the water and get stranded, assuming you even survive? Do you get placed on the nearest solid surface? Do you replace fluids within your body when you pop in, meaning you could enter Dream while under water? This needs to be clarified.

  Face-to-face cooperation with people in Dream is only possible if they share timezones, and if anyone goes onto night shift in Wake they basically have to leave their friends. Assuming they have friends in the first place, as constantly defecting is a great strategy in a world where people will be completely absent and unable to protect their stuff a significant fraction of the time.

  I don't think human society is possible under these conditions. Technology just can't be built or operated past the most rudimentary, everything in nature is way more dangerous, and trusting people is impossible when they could take everything you have and be hours away by the time you get back. Sure, people will bring knowledge from Wake, but a modern soldier is useless in a world where the infrastructure to build and distribute guns can't exist. Engineering in Dream would have to be so radically different that Wake engineers would be hobbled. Ironically, Wake advancing past a certain point might wind up plunging Dream into a perpetual dark age as nobody is born anymore who knows how to build all the steps to even make modern tech. An engineer is only as good as his tools, and they won't be able to make them.

  The fact that infants appear next to their mothers makes women of childbearing age even more valuable. Dream sex produces no offspring, so the entire world is dependent upon the reproductive succes of Wake mothers. Dream women presumably don't experience pregnancy, so they can remain valuable while creating free babies. However, baby mechanics really need to be redone entirely because babies sleep way more than new parents, meaning that entirely defenceless Dream infants will be lying around on the ground hoping that someone pops in to care for them. Infant mortality will be horrendous. In fact, I doubt anyone would survive. Forget all the other problems, the current Dream is a world filled with rotting baby corpses.

    Arbitrarily bumping age of first Dream visit to three to avoid the babypocalypse:

    People are awake for twice as long as they're asleep, so the population of Dream at any given moment will be a third the population of Wake.  The largest portion of this population rotates around the earth in darkness, with only a tiny nocturnal minority.

    So at any given moment there are only about two and a half billion people in Dream with five to ten hours of time per visit. Popping into and out of existence like they do, I assume they only need about one meal per "night." So there are an enormous amount of resources available relative to Wake: Literally fewer mouths to feed.

    I assume people, back in tribal times, would have established communal living arrangements to deal with changing sleep schedules (over which Dream has no control) and they'd leave "offerings" for the desperate, lonely nocturnals to keep them from stealing and destroying while nobody's around.

    Very few would start as nocturnals, of course, and there'd be nothing in Dream to predict who would become one. Most children would start on a diurnal schedule, however, and the cultural knowledge of what it means to be nocturnal would be passed to them when they were young regardless of whether they actually became so. Similarly, family and friend relationships would be well established by the time somebody gets the late watch or a night job in Wake. The soon-to-be nocturnal may even know in advance. They can leave notes or signs to let everyone else know what's up, and carry on a sort of conversation.

    They might even be able to do the maintenance and guardianship that is otherwise impossible for the vast majority with normal sleep schedules.

    The varying sleep schedule issue is another reason to establish tight communities: Much of the danger of popping into and out of existence can be limited if everybody works together as a group.

    My guess is that technological progress will look very different in both places, because of the population limits and the limited resource requirements. One wouldn't merely be advanced to the other, but Dream will have an entirely unique set of needs and limits enforced by cultural forces distinct from those in Wake.

      Bump the age back even further and it could become a coming of age event in society. Around 12 or maybe 15, you experience dream for the first time.  

      It would be interesting if dream world happened on a plane or tiny planet as opposed to earth.clone. Giving this other world 1/3rd the land mass could keep population density roughly the same. 

      Also, depending on how popping in or out works. Some tasks could be terrifying. Imagine climbing down a ladder in dream, then being woken up. If you pop back to that same place, what if you are not ready to hold fast to the ladder. Imagine the amount of fear you would have that day, and the trepidation you would have as you go through your day knowing that you will pop back to an awkward position. This is even worse for older people with poor balance. They will sometimes find themselves going from luring down on their bed to mid stride. 

      Last thought; what about special interactions between worlds? Could a medical disease give a person the ability to communicate with people in both worlds? Does a person in a coma dream? And would there be a business built around inducing people into deep sleep so they may take care of business in dream?

        I agree it would be interesting to have Dream  be a totally different world than earth.  maybe even different physics, fauna, or magic.

    I would hope humans would figure something out? Like the woman might say "hey everyone, my waker is pregnant, baby's first spawning at [location], [time]" and other people will arrange to be there? Unless we just never got anyone surviving to adulthood ever.

    Bear in mind we don't have to build civilization right away, and even if we can't hunt and gather we can at the very least scavenge on baby corpse meat.

  I have to wonder if people would still call these two worlds "Wake" and "Dream", if they had existed for all of human civilization.

  I mean, why would people think Wake is the "true" world, instead of Dream? In Dream you're perfectly cognizant of both of your lives, while in Wake you can only recall your Wake life. It seems more like Wake would be seen as the inferior other-world, not Dream.

  In fact, where would humans even get the terms "wake" and "dream" from, in this universe? When you go to sleep in Wake, you don't experience surrealist visions cobbled together by your resting mind. You wake up in a completely different world, in a completely different body. The concept of dreaming shouldn't even exist for the Wake Dreamers. Nor should the concept of being "awake". In our world, being awake implies being free from the limits of unconsciousness. But for the Wake Dreamers, there are no limits imposed by unconsciousness. You just move to your other body in the other world.

  I just thought of another question: can a woman get pregnant and give birth in Dream? What happens then? Does the child only remember their life in Dream, but remembers both in Wake? Can the child even reach Wake, or do they just stay in Dream their whole lives? Or is there a third unique layer above Dream, that Dream-children go to when they fall asleep?

    Wakers wouldn't call it anything because they don't know. Dreamers spend most of their lives forced to passively watch the Wakers, so they might use a word that captures the situation from the perspective of the wakers? Or not.

    I mean, so far as I can tell, Wake looks virtually identical to our world, so the notion of waking and dreaming should exist to the same extent as they do here, at least in Wake.

  The "if you die in dream, you don't dream for the rest of your waking life" has the chance to be a very weak communication channel from dream to wake. Probably too weak to be useful in most cases, maybe if some people were doing a scientific study and already looking at certain people's dreaming patterns?

    A group of lucid dreamers who know each other in Wake- people very likely to notice a creeping epidemic of dreamlessness- starts killing its members one by one in the dream, such that the first letter of each one's name contributes to a message. Somewhere, someone assembles a log; first William, then immediately after, Everett. A long time passes, then Kyle, Imogen, Lucy, Lain. Another break. Tim, and Oswald fall off. And then Sarah, Patrick, Eve, Andrew, Polly.

  Why assume people will keep their Dream identity the same as their Wake one? People poof into existence since their infancy. In years of their developmental stage they will find out that doing the same thing as in their Wake hours is wasteful, no matter what they value. By doing the same thing, they won't achieve better school/work performance, they won't make more money, they won't have more fun. So they do things differently.  

  To be clear, try to imagine this. You try to master a skill in Wake, you get an accelerated rate in Dream. Soon, you'll be an expert in Dream, and sometimes you find out those skill don't pay as good as you first imagine them to be. So you stop, and ignore your Wake who is still trying to master that first skill. You explore something else, hoping that this time, you'll be involved in something more rewarding.  

  Years after years doing things differently will result in situation that is much different.  Changes compounded. Your Wake is now only limited as insight, an inspiration; your Dream will now be the time to do things for real. People may migrate, have different career choice, try to date person other than they fancied in Wake, and have different social circle. Again, changes compounded. In due time, the Dream will be entirely different that the Wake. The Dream will follow their own rule.  

  Interesting thing about romance; If in Wake your love life is not fulfilling, you are more willing to leave and move on. You'll try to find a new romantic partner in time, and you'll want to make sure that (s)he is the one. You gather gossips, you try to find out how they behave from their Wake friends. Exploiting information advantage that is the Dream world. Once you're sure they can make a good lover, you approach them for real. But eh, you'll find out their Dream personality is not the same as their Wake. They experience different thing throughout their two life after all. And once again, the game of love is one where you have to take a risk.  

  And the woman often use, "My Wake is having children," excuse to explain a baby that soon poof beside them.

  Assuming that people age in both worlds separately given that they can live completely distinct lives and assuming that inhabitants of this universe keep the same sleep patterns that we do here, age is likely to be a significant difference between the two world which could have some interesting consequences in Dream. If people spend 1/3 of their time asleep on average, then a 30 year old in Wake would only be 10 in Dream but would have all of the memories and experience of a 30 year old. Someone like Nicola Tesla who only slept a few hours each night would diverge even further and essentially be a child prodigy, while someone who spent half their day sleeping in Wake would be significantly older than your average citizen in Wake.

  If they age at the same rate in both worlds, that leads to different discrepancies. From Dream's perspective, people will continue aging while they don't exist so they would need to cram much more into their existing hours to have the same number of lifetime accomplishments as their Waking self. The Tesla example from before would have the opposite issue: they would age very fast compared to the amount of time they are in existence. Life is likely to be lived at a much faster pace than in Wake.  


  The post mentions propaganda and how the lessons they learn in Wake would impact their philosophies in Dream. One question that leads to is how closely do people in Dream identify with their Wake selves? The point of divergence is apparently the first sleep after birth. Given that they can live completely distinct lives to the point of living in different places in the world, why would they be inclined to consider Wake selves as anything more than a particularly vivid story?

  How do sleep-related disorders impact Dream? If someone is narcoleptic in Wake, for example, they are likely to have a very different experience than someone who has a normal sleeping pattern. What about people with sleep apnea? Insomnia or hypersomnia? 

  Outside of disorders, some people in our world have varying types of dreams. Assuming the comparison holds, does that have an analogy in Dream? If someone tends to have dreams about their day-to-day life, what advantages or disadvantages would they have compared to someone who has more abstract or fantastical dreams? What about lucid dreaming? 

  The logistical problems of people disappearing and later reappearing in the same place have already had lots of exploration within this thread and other rational or semi-rational literature. For those who have read Worm, Clockblocker does some interesting interplay with bringing people in and out of the time stream. In this case they disappear from existence rather than appearing frozen, but a lot of the same concepts would apply both in how you can deal with someone "frozen" as well as what the perspective of the Dreamer would do. They may appear in the same place, but the world could move drastically around them. Hopefully no-one is angry enough to dig a spiked pit underneath where you disappeared, for example.  


  Sports would look drastically different as would any other activities that require a great deal of precise coordination. I'm not a sport guy so I can't do a lot of exploration here, but I imagine something like American football would not be possible given that for any given offensive or defensive play, you might have players suddenly missing.

  How much continuity of thought is there between a Dreamer's moments of existence? Do they instantly remember who/what/where they are and what they were doing? If they are in the middle of a movement when they disappear, do they seamlessly continue with the movement when they reappear or do they have to readjust to having been another person for hours?

  The biggest thought would be the ability to focus on one skill.  You want to be the best at a skill? Spend 12hrs working on it in Wake, then start fresh in Dream for another 12hrs, then head over to wake for 12hrs more. 

  In fact, if I were searching for others who know how to live in both worlds, I would look first among the highly skilled and second among the highly erratic.  The erratic people could potentially be experiencing setbacks or successes in the other world.

  Conspiracies would be interesting if you meet up in one world with like powered individuals.  Then plan coordinated shenanigans in the other world where you never directly interact.  Anyone living in only one world would have no real way to figure out who is part of the plot.
