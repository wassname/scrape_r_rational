## r!Animorphs update schedule

### Post:

Hi, everyone, not dead.

I've got about 60,000 words of r!Animorphs in the chamber ready to go.  Turns out, that's Not Very Many Chapters At All.

Ze plan is to finish up the chapter that I'm currently writing, and then post pieces of what I've got once every two weeks, through at least five chapters and hopefully through the end of the fic, which is maybe a dozen or so chapters away.  

First of the new updates will go up in a week, on Nov. 9, if anyone wants to reread or re-skim or theorize or whatever.

As always, sorry AND thanks, in equal measure.  =)

  Wow, time flies when you viciously suppress expectations. It's almost been a year, which isn't even that long in the grand scheme of hiatuses.

  It's weird, I still remember finding out about this fic when it had 5 chapters and thinking "Wow, this looks super promising. I hope it keeps updating" like it was a few months ago.

  This is easily the greatest work ever written on r/rational by anyone who isn't Alexander Wales. Keep going, you're getting there!

  Woohoo! 




  That's all I have to say, really. Super happy this isn't dead.

  You know, in cases like this, you'd assume that the chapters are getting ridiculously bloated and going on wild tangents from the main plot.

  But no, having eead these chapters, I can attest everything is relevant, and the plot still progresses ridiculously fast.

  Hurray! 

  Would you mind including a “Previously on...” segment at the beginning to refresh us on previous events?

    Actually, since there are unlikely to be any more Garrett POV chapters, I think maybe I'll kick things off with a Garrett-centric "What I Did On My Summer Vacation" recap chapter to catch everyone back up.

      That'd be awesome.
       I was debating just ploughing through everything again since it's been so long, but would have been a big commitment. 
      Love the story and super happy you're back.

      But... Garrett was supposed to wake up soon...

      *oh no*

  It's done when it's done.  No need to rush it.  I've enjoyed it so far, so thank you for your work so far, and I look forward to the next chapters.

  Yaaay!!! I was worried this was dead. Time to ramp up my reddit usage again.

  I guess I can dump a few questions

  I also assume nobody is in this thread unless they have read at least like half the chapters

  * why did not >!v3 acquire elfangor!<
  * is ax using the term >!"Mararauders map" (ch 32)!< intentional >!(maybe he has it from tom?)!<?
  * can thoughtspeak be directed at a person you do not know where is or never met but you know by e.g. name or have a vague idea who is? >!see v3 and tobias -- I assume that was private and not broadcast.!< What about if that person is in morph?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    V3 did not acquire Elfangor in a fit of pique.  It was irrational, he *knew* it was irrational (he reflected on it, in the moment), but he didn't care.

    Ax using the term was intentional, yes, to show that Tom's thoughts were leaking across the barrier.

    Yes, you can direct thought-speak at someone nearby as long as you can identify them uniquely.  This is probably "too strong" and should've been rationalized/weakened, but oh well.  Them being in morph doesn't make a difference.

      thanks

  Hyyyyype! Thanks for all the work you've put into this, really looking forward to the conclusion.
  ```

- u/TK17Studios:
  ```
  FYI, all: Recap interlude is out, giving it one day to digest before posting Ax.
