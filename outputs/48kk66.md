  Pretty good chapter! The writing is solid, and I really like Cassie's reflections on morality.

  Two nitpicks: the question of **why** they don't go to the military is getting more visible. Jake seems to have considered the idea and rejected it for some unspoken reason, but the only one I see is "so that the Animorphs can stay relevant to the story".

  Also, I feel that the "morphing AK-47s" thing is getting a bit far from what the morphing power represented in canon. Morphing people, morphing away injuries, even reading thoughts and memories felt like logical extensions of the same base power. But if you can morph supplies and weapons, well, you've just become a superweapon in an inconveniently human-shaped package. Why would the andalites bother to put this technology in they soldiers, instead of directly in their guns and their tanks?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    It's not that you can morph INTO a nonliving thing.  It's that you can SEND a nonliving thing along with your real body as you morph into an animal (just as you send along your nonliving hair and your nonliving clothes).  While a frog, I cannot use any of that stuff, but if I morph INTO a frog, go out into a swamp, and demorph, then when my body comes back it will also bring with it my hair, my clothes, and my AK-47.

    Also: Tobias is missing.

      > just as you send along your nonliving hair 

      Are you saying the gang lost all their hair each time they morphed before figuring out how to morph with clothing on?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        No.  The morphing tech takes mental commands, remember—Andalites interface with a lot of their hardware telepathically.  This is why their hair kept going, but their clothes didn't—they first saw Elfangor demorph from human to Andalite, shredding his clothes in the process, which set up (for them) a subtle subconscious belief that clothes simply weren't part of what gets morphed.  Cassie challenged that, and voila—success.

        There are two in-story phenomena that are explained by this; being able to morph away an AK-47 is one of them.
        ```

    - u/philh:
      ```
      Oh! I totally got that bit wrong. I interpreted it as, he'd acquired a person who was holding grocery bags and when he morphed that person he also got the bags, duplicating them and their contents.
      ```

  The nostalgia is strong here: watching Ax play with sounds. "Bird-watcher's dream". The personal morph line-up. 

  Still loving it.

  So is the reason the Yeerk morph didn't work because the morphing technology uses Yeerk components anyway?

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    > What do the Yeerks actually want? What's their wincon?

    The removal of the Andalite military as a threat. It could be achieved through diplomacy or other subtle means, but is most likely to happen by actually destroying the Andalites military capacity, one way or another.

    > What's the Animorphs' best next move?

    Recruiting. They have a power multiplier, the blue box, which does not seem to need fuel or other supplies to work, only time. Thus they need to use it as fast and often as possible. Also, getting actual people with resources and military experience on board.

    > What's the Animorphs' best next move, given V3's attempts to model their thinking (turbocharged by a psychic glimpse into Rachel's mind)?

    Avoid tactics that can only work if Visser 3 is unaware of them. Focus autoimmune-style combat, where the cost of reliably protecting against you is higher than the damage you actually make. A lot of it depends on V3's goals, personality, and what Rachel saw of them when she was exposed to the psychic glimpse. Does she know he knows about Alloran's backdoor? What does she know about yeerk politics?

    > What will V3's reaction to the Animorph's best next move be?

    Being evil. Otherwise, probably what he's already doing. His strategy seems to deviate from the optimal strategy of putting multiple infestations centers in India and capturing billions of people, so I would suggest switching to actually doing that.

    > What would you do with the blue box?

    Take over the world with my supervillain army.

    > What would you do with the one laser beam you stole from the Yeerk pool?

    Reverse engineer it as fast as possible. So far, the only thing that's keeping the military from destroying the yeerks is their aerial superiority. Bug fighters can destroy any explosive missiles shot at them, and dodge kinetic missiles, and the pool ship can do orbital bombings without ever being worried. Destroying it should be the opening move of, let's say, the NATO. Once the yeerks have lost their aerial support, they can be easily quarantined, and will start to negotiate for a surrender.

    > Is V3 still accounting for the presence of real Andalites (i.e. Ax)?

    Depends on what he saw in Rachel's mind. He knows they acquired Elfangor, but he's proably too proud and not paranoid enough to assume that they know about the backdoor. He could know about Ax's distress signal, and make the appropriate deductions.

    > How soon would the Yeerks spill over into another city?

    A month ago?

    > Who would you recruit next, and how?

    Trained soldiers. By talking to their superior. In the meantime, non-captured cops from another city.

    > Would you risk turning this into a shooting war?

    The question is not whether this will turn into a shooting war, it's when. Both sides have two objectives they want to complete before an open war: the yeerks want as many bodies as possible to be able to take prisoners after they win battles (that is, not just nuke the other side into oblivion), the humans want better technology to actually win said battles. If it became a shooting war right now, the yeerks would loose any fight because of their unsustainable logistics, but anihilate the other side anyway because they hold the high ground (mothership orbiting your planet).

    > What is the logically inevitable conclusion of the Yeerk pool being taken out?

    A lot of people dying. Otherwise, it depends on several factors we don't know about. Are yeerks ready for diplomacy? What is the state of the war on other planets? In any case, if the yeerks loose their pool, they're not going to be able to install a new one in any strategic location without annihilating the entire local military first, so they're not going to nab their seven billion people.

    > What is Rachel not telling everybody else?

    So, remember that time when __something__ completely blew our surprise advantage and led to our parents being captured and any hope we had of not losing millions of people disappeared? Yeah, well, there's a funny story...

    > Would you attempt to rescue your family, given the current situation?

    I'd probably mount an assassination attempt. If I weren't a 13 year old kid, that is. Well, Rachel and Tobias totally would.

    > How would you get your hands on 200lbs of Cesium?

    *cough cough military*

    > How would you go about interacting with adults, as a teenager with morphing power?

    I think they would be kind of distressed by the whole "child soldier" thing. Also, since the kids don't have much experience child soldiering, by opposition to canon where they had three years under their belt, I'd expect them to be (slightly) more willing to shut up and listen to the grown ups.

    > Atlantis? Helmacrons? Explicit Ellimist sidequests? Ants morphing into humans? David? Rachel splitting into two? Rachel vomiting a crocodile? Rachel superpowered by an evil omnipotent being?

    No, no, maybe, nope, maybe, god no, no, only if she actually accepts and gets to take over the world.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Oh, oh, oh, that's horrible and I doomed the human race, but...

    > What are V3's contingency plans?

    I think everyone is assuming that the Yeerks biggest constraint is that they need to feed every three day, which means that the controllers are dependent on yeerk pools, and must go to one regularly at all costs, so they're screwed if their only pool is blown up, right ?

    Well... not exactly. If we leave canon aside, there's not explicit rules saying you have to keep every human infested by the same yeerk. It's not like they have to keep track of continuity (like, one yeerk makes a promise, the second one doesn't know about it and blows his cover) since they can read their host's memory. So yeerks can keep operatives on missions away from a pool for weeks by supplying them a stream of replacement yeerks to be infested by. They can cut the time spent by the hosts at the pool to a few minutes by swapping yeerks instead of keeping the hosts in cages. And of course...

    > What is the logically inevitable conclusion of the Yeerk pool being taken out?

    The yeerks can just set up their agents with multiple yeerks under stasis to keep in their homes. Instead of going to a pool every three days, they can just go to a warehouse to resupply every two weeks, the warehouse itself being resupplied by cloaked bug fighters. It might be a logistic challenge, but you can support a millions-strong invasion for however long it takes to build a new pool that way.

    I'll elaborate later, when I'm not on a tablet, but I've got some initial ideas. First, though, there's [an idea I first proposed almost a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/30vbzw/ranimorphsthe_reckoning_theorizing/?), which seems still valid. 

    I can't theorize about Visser Three's plans in general, because I *know* what they are. Dang it. 

    Right now, though? He's enjoying a nice book, and maybe looking forward to the Pool dance-off that's happening later tonight.

    Please no helmacrons. Or Atlantis. Or similar stuff that I can't remember right now. Please. 

    Someone needs to interrogate that Yeerk they got. The Chee can take care of their Yeerks, so maybe something could be done to interrogate those as well (I doubt there'd be much help from a Yeerk who knows it's going to die no matter what).

    I would try to abuse access to Elfangor's brain/knowledge. 

    I would totally risk turning this into a shooting war. Earth is not worth the galaxy. Elfangor and Tobias have the right idea. 

    The speed with which the Yeerks will spill over into another city will depend on their rate of reproduction. If I were them, I'd consider trying to inoculate the mainstream population against belief in Yeerks by taking a few major conspiracy theorists as hosts and spreading easily-debunked theories about parasite invasions which are, despite being false, still in the general area. The kids are still a problem, but it means that escaped hosts won't be believed (and escaped hosts may be worth thinking about) and the kids will have to work in person and reveal themselves to anyone they want to convince. 

    Try to get the government as quickly as possible. Set up Plan Bs in other countries. 

    Consider North Korea: Is government collusion there possible? If so, then go for it. Heck, if you could somehow nab the higher officials, you wouldn't have to worry about collusion, and then the rest of the country falls like dominoes. 

    Consider recruiting in war zones where people can easily disappear without anyone being surprised.

    > How would you get your hands on 200lbs of Cesium?


    Frankly, I wouldn't. Too much shit can go wrong, it needs to be stored in oil to prevent explosive reactions, it has a melting point of 28C, which means it'd probably be either very soft or a liquid if you were to carry it around on a regular California day. Not to mention, it will *ignite spontaenously in air*. Also, from Wikipedia: "...a caesium-water explosion is often less powerful than a sodium-water explosion with a similar amount of sodium."


    Imo, using Cs is overall a bad idea. It's incredibly difficult to obtain and store, not to mention transport. You'd need special training to avoid seriously hurting yourself, and teenagers won't have that. Additionally, no one is crazy enough to store 200 lbs of it in one location, which means you'd have to raid multiple different places. Na on the other hand is way easier. You can get a fair amount of it (maybe anywhere from 10 to 20 kg in total) from school/university laboratories. Or chemical suppliers, but then you'd have to either get the funds, or steal it.


    But if you're going to go that route of poisoning the Yeerk pool, why not use a fuckton of bleach? It kills fish (and everything else) very effectively, after all. It can do some nasty chemical burns even to human skin (speaking from experience). It's cheap. You could buy a whole grocery store's worth and then go buy more afterwards. It doesn't have much flash and dazzle, but that works great for a stealth mission. And people won't even think too much of the smell, they'd just think someone was doing some cleaning nearby. You put bleach in the Yeerk pool, they're going to lose a lot of Yeerks, and spend ages, fucking AGES, filtering it out. Or having to drain and refill the entire pool. Hell no.
    ```

    - u/philh:
      ```
      Blowing up the pool feels like it would take longer to clean up than bleach.

      Whether the best way to do that is Na or Cs or something else, I couldn't say. If you're willing to sacrifice an animorph, then sneaking into the pool in a morph that's hiding explosives seems sufficient. If you're not willing to sacrifice someone, it becomes a lot harder.
      ```

      - u/KnickersInAKnit:
        ```
        Oh, I agree. But if it came down to choosing explosives over poison, I think Cs would be a poor choice of explosive substance. A gas leak would be excellent. Sneaking in a propane gas tank (limiting my choices to cheap, easy and straightforward for teenagers) and shooting it with a Dracon beam would guarantee some serious damage. A gasoline slick on top of the pool lit aflame would create a lot of panic as well.


        Actually, here's a fun consideration - they've got a stasis container now. Would it be possible for Ax to rewire it into a delayed explosive device, or to keep an explosive (about to go off) in stasis in the container, with a timed failure programmed in? Would be so innocuous if that were the case, stroll down and leave it on a table somewhere. Walk out, count to 60, boom.
        ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      I don't think poisoning the pool is the way to go. In canon, yeerks were completely replaceable, reproduced exponentially, and were mostly hostless. No I don't know if that's true here, but I'd think yeerks aren't their bottleneck. Infrastructure and actual people are.
      ```

      - u/KnickersInAKnit:
        ```
        This is true. Thing is, putting Cs in the Yeerk pool should create CsOH, an extremely strong base. This is if we make the reasonable assumption that Cs will follow the trend of group 1 metals, which is to form a strong base upon reacting with water. According to Wikipedia, CsOH is one of the strongest bases, strong enough to *rapidly etch silicon semiconductors*. If the Animorphs were to put a large amount of Cs into the pool, this would result in an explosive reaction, and then form a large amount of CsOH, raising the pH of the pool into 'insanely alkaline' levels. I'd imagine the resulting Yeerk deaths would be on par with that of bleach. 


        Now granted, in canon, the Yeerk homeworld has crazy acid rain. I'd expect the natural (and therefore Yeerk-built) pools to be somewhat buffered against pH shifts, but it's still very possible to overcome a buffered solution with a strong enough or large amount of acid/base.


        Also, I think Yeerk population currently is the bottleneck. Tons of hosts (actual people), but not enough Yeerks. Infrastructure is definitely valid though.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          Nah, the hosts are the bottleneck. Well, not the individual hosts, but the population centers. The Yeerks have plenty of humans available, geographically speaking, but none of these humans are "theirs" before they are regularly to the yeerk pool and staying there until reinfested.

          Infesting any given human is trivial if you're ready to throw resources at it (send a bunch of cops arrest them), but infesting high numbers of human is a logistic problem, where you need to take into account variables like the risk of exposure, what to do if you capture someone who's passing by but lives far away from the yeerk pool, etc...
          ```

    Oh, also: for weights in the range of about 50lbs to about 250lbs, T ≈ -.00001297W^3 + .01W^2 - 2.756W + 322.  After that, it levels off in a way I wasn't able to cheaply approximate, with a typical adult Andalite male weighing in around 388lbs and having a morph time of about 61 minutes.

    Apparently, I'm *very* excited to be writing and chatting again.

    If we can acquire the morphs of others, and store weapons with morphs, would there be a way to create multiple Dracon beams? What happens to morphed weapons when the user demorphs? Could the Animorphs attach the Dracon beam to a morph, hand the dracon beam off to another to another to morph it and thereby have dracon beam morphs?
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      No way to create multiple Dracon beams using morph technology.

      Alice has a Dracon beam.  She morphs into a badger.  Her real body, holding the Dracon beam, is off in Z-space somewhere; all that's in normal space is a badger body with some extra Yeerk tissue in its brain.

      Bob acquires that badger.  When Bob morphs it, he's morphing a badger with a little extra Alice-control tissue in it, with a little *more* extra Bob-control tissue on top (the brain is getting crowded; you can't pass morphs along forever).  But Bob hasn't acquired anything related to Alice herself, or the Dracon beam she's carrying with her off in her own little Z-space bubble.

      Good question, though.
      ```

  - u/rictic:
    ```
    Based on what's been said in the story so far (I only read one animorphs book as a kid), the biggest potential strength for both sides in this war is also largely untapped by both parties: global human civilization. If the Yeerks have control of key influential people they should be working to leverage that into governmental and military control. The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is a heck of a lot more defensible than a public swimming pool.

    For the kids, recruiting is strong, but it has a weakness. Only the ones that met Elfangor got the anti-yeerk defenses installed, and anyone who has used the cube is able to destroy it at will from any range. The self-morph armor might or might not work against Yeerk infestation. Given this, and the Yeerk's likelihood for exponential growth, this may suggest that the kids should do a single big recruitment push followed by an all or nothing strike against the earthbound aliens.

    On reflection as a reader this is probably a bad idea because of what I infer about the games that the gods are playing, but from the kids' perspective I think it makes sense. I'm also not sure how the kids should react to the knowledge that they're pieces in a game of 5 dimensional hyperchess. Without more information it seems like the gods exist solely to justify the story staying at a human scale rather than escalating into global war.

    I think intelligence is really needed as well. I'd try to leverage Ax to figure out the larger strategic situation of the war. Why are so few Andolites and Yeerks involved at this point if Earth will decide the fate of the galaxy? 

    The vulnerability of the Escafil device does not mean that it should not be used. It's just a powerful asset that's risky to deploy. But there's little difference in a destroyed asset and one that you never use at all.

    Likewise, the kids need to militarize humanity against the Yeerks. Yes this should become a shooting war, a mind control torture parasite infestation that's on the verge of pandemic is one of the better casus belli of history. Cells of military trained humans working outside of a centralized command structure and minimal communication seems like a good option for fighting Yeerks if we assume that morph armor isn't a defense against mind control.

    An interesting way to play it would be to make the crayak and eliminist more blue and orange morality and less good and evil, which allows you to explain their game, and relatively subtle actions in the universe


    One possibility is to make it that they both have alternative goals for the fate of intelligent life in the universe, and their ways of playing the game match with that philosophy. 


    E.g. the ellimist values diversity  of different minds throughout the universe, even at the cost of those minds suffering, so makes a myriad of subtle changes, Crayak is more interested in maximising intelligence overall, so wants a single dominant form of life to assimilate everything, and takes fewer but more direct actions (e.g. the howlers)

    Your video made me more interested in just what color is your hair, and how strong you are to be able to pull off some of those maneuvers, than supporting your fiction.

    Unfiltered reaction breakdown, in case feedback in this form is something you value:   
    "Ah, a patreon.  I'll see how they're doing.  Video - watch it later.  Two people so far, only one pledge level... fairly high... but no actual pledges there.

Perhaps a way to show his personality without giving a clear look at the face?  Don't know how effective that'll be.  Did his hair change style and color?  Just color?  Nope, it's red.  Does it keep changing?  Nice production value.  Wonder if he did it all himself.  I have to google his name now to see if I can find out his hair color.  Two pictures.  CFAR employee.  CFAR doesn't pay him to make the middle school bootcamps?  Wonder what he does.  Github is also TK Studios.  Same guy?  Compare.  Same noses, eyes, brow, glasses frame.  Does his eyebrow match the red color slightly?  Is it the same person?  Must be.  Dyed?  Maybe.  Can't tell for certain.  Probably, but without knowing the brow color... is his facial hair red?

  So, was that caused by Garrett's fear? Maybe he panicked and thought of a scary movie he once saw, or something? Also, I am not sure what they are trying to do.

  Part of me thinks they were trying to morph Garrett into a biological flesh coat a la the Terminator, going on the theory that living things inside other living things would be immune to the disintegration rays. This seems reasonable, otherwise the Yeerk hosts would get sick from losing all their gut bacteria. If wearing a living Chapman skin suit lets you through the scanner, that might be within the Animorph's capabilities.

  However, this seems like an unnecessarily convoluted way to pull off this plan. Why not just morph into a tick or other parasite and hide underneath the real Chapman's skin? I think a dust mite on the hairs inside his nose would probably be safely unobtrusive. It would be simpler than whatever thing they were attempting to make Garrett become.

  Alternatively, they might have been trying to morph Garrett into something entirely nonbiological, essentially the inverse of the Terminator's skinsuit. Again, that seems unnecessarily convoluted to me.

  Logistically, it is surprising to me that the Yeerks do not have more K-ray generators and pools. They are spending billions on securing this one location, and nothing on redundancy or decentralization. It is explainable in terms of their psychology or the economics of K-ray generators, potentially, but it is hard not to notice that this is quite convenient for the Animorphs' plans.

  I assume the Yeerks have backup plans along the lines of "what to do if the Andalite terrorists kill 95% of our forces in one fell swoop?" Maybe they have various leaders' aides infected already, even though they are too paranoid to dare yet go any further? Just hard to think that they wouldn't have redundancy of some kind, if they were indeed rational. Sorry for making the story harder to build, feel free to ignore any of this.

  In a way, Yeerks are potentially the ultimate guerilla terrorists, if they are able to avoid the K-ray limitation, so in that sense they do have a lot of redundancy. If you think that counterinsurgency is difficult, you haven't seen anything yet. "Battle for the hearts and minds", literally, but they don't stay won. Mopping up stragglers in the aftermath of a Yeerk war would be totally impossible no matter how crushing your main victory was, so it's a good thing the K-ray limitation exists.

  I liked the edit from the beta chapter I read, good job.

    In canon, they ran into issues morphing mosquitoes. Those same issues might complicate other very small insects. 

    Also puts bacteria/virus morphs off limits.

        > Esplin had long ago depilated his host's body, to hinder infestation by tiny morphed parasites, but if the Andalites had gone this far, who was to say they wouldn't try infiltrating as bacteria, to slip through the holes in the decon net?

        Sounds like morphing bacteria is currently impossible, but during the time that Esplin thought that several massive revolutions had occurred in the field of morphing, he couldn't rule anything out.
        ```

          Thanks for looking it up.

          I think Esplin's countermeasures aren't very good. I had to look up what depilated means, and it just means removing hair from. But they could still get inside his skin. Also, I think a good way to assassinate someone would be to morph a tiny animal, enter someone, and then demorph into a human being. During the demorphing process the morpher arguably might be protected from breaking bones or dismemberment by the template of the Escafil device, but even if not a suicide attack on top Yeerk officials is worth dying for, especially if you can come back to life in someone else's head.

          Also, I wonder if there will ever come a time when an Animorph literally sits on top of his head in his eye stalk blind spot.

              He could wear a bodysuit, kind of like Coil. I don't think he morphs that often, or that clothing is so expensive he needs to worry about ripping it when necessary. Maybe humans are the only species that wears clothes and it's still a novel concept. But you'd think they would have to understand the general concept through things like spacesuits or shields or heat insulators which they would almost definitely have already thought of.

               Although clothes that a mutated horse centaur can put on itself might not be possible, come to think of it. It would be a ridiculous hassle unless the clothes involved fancy nanotechnology or something. Plus I assume it would be uncomfortable for a horse to wear a bodysuit, and the Visser would experience that discomfort (and distraction) as well. Makes more sense now.

    Wasn't he trying to morph a Yeerk? That was definitely the impression I got
    ```

      So, he turned into a giant Yeerk abomination, because the technology can't handle that properly since it is made from Yeerks? Makes sense.

      I didn't know they already had acquired a Yeerk morph, though it might have happened offscreen.

    Yeah.  I've been experimenting with being a lot more spare with my description in recent chapters, trusting readers to fill in the gaps (e.g. what's going on with Marco, the context for all of the short, swift scenes in the middle, how Rachel spent the previous three days).  I'd be interested to hear people's opinions on whether the current balance of spelled-out vs. left-up-to-you is close to ideal or not.

      Well I, for one, felt *extremely* lost during this chapter, in a stark departure from previous ones. Most of my confusion was cleared up from reading the comments here, but I *still* don't know what the hell was going on with the John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt or the three-fingered clawed hands. If it matters, I have zero knowledge of canon.

        I'm guessing that they were testing to see if very loud thought-speak, which is beamed directly into your brain, could hinder your reactions / thought processes. Think of it as the equivalent of someone suddenly yelling right next to your ear. 

        Hands: In canon, Cassie had a natural gift for controlling the order of her morphing, rather than having it occur randomly. My guess is that she morphed only the hands of a Hork-Bajir, in order to give herself a powerful weapon.

        John Jacob and three-fingered claw hands are meant to be mysteries/cliffhangers/things you can hypothesize about but may not fully understand.  I would expect most of the confusion to be unrelated to whether or not you know canon.  Thanks for the feedback; updating toward being less unexplicit.

          Seconding that you should be a little more explicit. I think you're in the neighborhood of where you should be, just, like, on the wrong side of the neighborhood maybe? But still close.
          ```

          - u/ZeroNihilist:
            ```
            My guess for the importance of the John Jacob bit is that they're trying to weaponise thought-speak to shut down Visser Three's ability to react. He can't plan if he can't think, and thought-speak is intrusive.

            It's possible that Visser Three will have countermeasures for this (e.g. being able to shut out all thought-speak),  but since he's the only one with an Andalite controller he might not have had any practice with it. It costs them little to try anyway; mentally yelling a song you know by rote doesn't require much concentration.

            The three-fingered claw hands could be from a dinosaur or something (maybe the Jurassic Park staple velociraptor or [therizinosaurus](http://dinopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Therizinosaurus)?). I'm a little fuzzy on the rules about acquiring from dead animals and fossils, but it must have been difficult since only Cassie (who is preternaturally skilled at morphing) could acquire it.

            I'm not sure how many dinosaurs would actually be superior to modern morphs for most purposes, but I'm sure there are a few that would be very effective if you could actually acquire them.

  I'm confused about why Tobias needed to put together that the morphing tech used yeerk biology to interface. That would be something Visser Three knew, so Rachel presumably should have known all of it already, along with several other things this chapter.

  For that matter... I don't think any of what Rachel got was explored in this chapter. I assumed it would be of great importance. Is she keeping it to herself for some reason? I guess I can wait for her chapter to find out...
  ```

    [If you don't want to wait for her chapter to find out...](#s "Imagine having an eidetic memory, and being flashed a page for ~2sec.  You'd be able to recall the whole page afterward, in theory (?), but you wouldn't automatically KNOW all of the things on the page.  It would take processing time.  And, if your initial glimpse was insufficient to really lock it in, or if your memory wasn't REALLY eidetic, there would be gaps and holes.  Rachel and Erek and V3 each got a total glimpse at one another's psyches (similar to the Lethe touch in SD), but that glimpse was momentary.  They received a burst of information, much of which immediately faded, and much of which will be foggy or distorted by the time they pull it out, and ALL of which requires active, conscious review rather than simply 'being known.'  Still tremendously valuable, but nowhere near 'they each know everything about the other.'")
