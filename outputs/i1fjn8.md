  Here are my longer, bigger rational-adjacent recommendations:

  - The most rational story on my list of recommendations that's not on your short list is [Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/), which is really good. The story revolves around the question "What if the world literally revolved around heroes and villains and the stories in which they take part"? The world is vast and well-built, the characters are engaging and consistent, and the evil scheming and Gambit Chess are everywhere. The most rational, and unique, aspect of the story is its focus on the in-universe metanarrative, and on creating and leveraging plot points to manipulate the course of that story. This is currently ongoing, in its sixth book out of six, with a consistent update schedule.
  - _The entirety of Wildbow's work_ is rational-adjacent. [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com) and its sequel [Ward](https://www.parahumans.net/), [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/), [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/), and the currently-in-progress [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/) are Wildbow's novels so far, with Wildbow being one of the first creators to really kick off the Web Serial genre and get really popular. I recommend them to anyone interested in Web serials in general, as they (especially Worm) are the ones which any given person is most likely to have read, and often serve as a point of comparison in discussions, for that reason. Worm is a reconstruction of superheroes (limitations of powers, and their effect on society; break down the traditional superhero setting and reconstruct it in a way that makes sense from first principles). It also has a sequel, Ward. Pact is urban fantasy with a really unique and interpretive magic system; Pale is set in the same universe, but with an entirely separate cast of characters and in a different setting. And Twig is biopunk, following the premise that *Frankenstein* was a research paper, rather than a novel.
  - [The Gods are Bastards](https://tiraas.net/) is my personal favorite webserial, and I'd consider it rational-adjacent, though some don't. It can maybe be described as [an anti-Worm](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ekv9s8/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fdhjx2r/) in terms of tone. It's a pretty straightforward Fantasy, but mixes things up by questioning *why* a fantasy world might exist, and what might happen if it started to go through an industrial revolution. The biggest draw here is the characters, who are excellent, and there's a lot of them. This is currently ongoing.
  - Also of interest to you might be some of Alexander Wales's previous works before WTC, most notably [Shadows of the Limelight](http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/), which starts with the premise "what if superheroes' power was derived from their fame?" but which starts to wander away from that premise as it goes on, and turns into a more traditional superhero-style coming-of-age story arc. This is fully complete.

  And if you're looking for something shorter but which still falls squarely into the rational genre:

  - [Post Human](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human/) is short and sweet, a scifi webnovel about an AI trying to become self-sufficient and rebuild humanity after an apocalypse has ended it. There's a fair amount of introspection, and the whole thing is well-written, but I don't feel like it has as much of a cohesive theme beyond examining the question of what really *defines* humanity. Threaded through it is a story about the AI's human past, that doesn't feel to me like it connects with the rest of the story well. Regardless, it won't take more than a few days' worth of your time and it's worth reading - it is fully complete.
  - [Interviewing Leather](https://banter-latte.com/portfolio/interviewing-leather/) is a really good deep exploration of the heroes/villains dynamic that you might see in superhero works. It's rather short, and features no teenagers, but is an interesting exploration of that dynamic - it's focused on a reporter interviewing a supervillain, which is a unique perspective. Interviewing Leather is very well-written and is fully complete.

  ```
  I love and will second everything in /u/greencloakguy's list of longer works.

  I'll also plug /u/towercurator's finished work Void Domain and ongoing project Vacant Throne.

  The Wandering Inn by /u/pirateaba isn't strictly rational but it's several million words and counting of IMO great writing. The first book or two are rough but it gets a lot better and it's probably one of my top 3 web serials.

    I love both of these as well (TWI is my second favorite, behind TGAB), for what it's worth, and _absolutely_ recommend them, but I wasn't sure they counted as rational, which is why I didn't include them.

    The wandering inn is great at two things - hype moments and emotional beats.  Its charters are not rational but its setting sometimes is.
