## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I was reading a story where acceleration and deceleration were different forms of magic. This got me thinking. If you only have deceleration what could you do.

  Rules(through not the ones from a hero’s war)

  You are aware of any macro scale motion within 10 meters of you. 

  You may set any object’s velocity to any velocity between yours and its current velocity. Ie deceleration relative to you. 

  You may affect multiple objects at once, as many as you can focus on.

  If an object is only partly within your range, only that part will be affected, but it will drag the rest.

  Objects travelling too fast will past by before you can react.

  You have the power described above. What can you use it for? How would you exploit it. How would a civilization exploit it if some fraction has it.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    These two powers are not very different, yours just has a slightly less convenient reference frame. 

    You could e.g. have a cheap engine propel yourself forward on a train track, then aim your power at the leading car of a 50,000-tons train sitting idly behind you on the track and "decelerate" it to match your speed.
    ```

    - u/Valeide:
      ```
      Simultaneously lower and higher tech option: you can run inside one of the cars and constantly accelerate it as you run. It might be tricky to run properly, but you can accelerate the train to arbitrary (as in, as fast as the rails can safely support) speeds at the cost of the energy it costs to run.
      ```

  - u/Valeide:
    ```
    1] If you're in a vehicle, you can run inside of the vehicle and constantly accelerate it to match you.

    2] You could engineer a [vehicle](https://i.imgur.com/wJ1I2Gx.png) (I'm an amazing artist, I know.) with sufficient acceleration to escape gravity and even quickly reach the speed of light. Have a bunch of spinnable wheels mounted inside of a much larger box. Strap wizards into the wheels. Spin the wheels. Whenever the people inside of the wheels are moving towards your target, have them activate their magic and accelerate the vehicle in that direction. 

    Accelerating the outside vehicle will quickly cause them to accelerate by the same amount, because of the weird way in which the wizard is moving relative to the outside vehicle. 

    I'm sure there's some better way to do that one, but that's the basic idea.

    3] Free energy/crazy new labor options. 

    etc. The power is basically the same as regular telekinesis, as Roxolan said.

  Magic has five talents:

  - Warp, which is an intuitive understanding of the world

  - Weft, which is the ability to manifest your will into concrete existence

  - Shuttle, which is the ability to weave a change into the fabric of reality

  - Comb, which is the ability to shape the after effects / wake / ripples of magical usage (this can be the actual point of a spell, or it can just be a beneficial side effect; discrete comb effects have themselves (weaker) combable wakes)

  - Sight, which is the ability to see (perceive; it's not strictly ocular) magic and the fabric of reality


  What do you feel, as a reader, are the most and least powerful one- and two-talent combinations? How would you use your _lack_ of a talent as an advantage in some scenario? Best I can come up with is basically magical flashbangs for people without the Sight.

    What is the difference between   
    >	manifest your will into concrete existence

    and 

    >	weave a change into the fabric of reality



    I would think that Warp + Sight would be an effective information gathering combo. Comb with Sight speaks to me as the most powerful Comb-based two-talent builds.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Warp + Sight gives a combination that can understand almost anything.

    Weft + Shuttle gives a wizard who has the magical equivalent of a swiss army knife in a dark room - he can do a lot, but he can't see what you are doing.

    Sight+Comb makes for an *infuriating* opponent. He can't do a thing on his own, but the moment you fire off a spell, he redirects it and uses the echoes to do what *he* wants done.

    Warp+Weft makes for an interesting combination - he can only do imprecise effects, but he can do them precisely where and when they will be most effective. (If he limits himself to probability alteration, he can get away with merely looking *incredibly* lucky).
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Yes! (Never gamble with someone who has Weft, btw. They *will* draw the inside straight.)
      ```

  - u/SpaceTimeOverGod:
    ```
    Warp seems to be the most useful, intuitively understanding the laws of physics (and magic)  is an incredible advantage. As for weaknesses, it is hard to see how knowing the way the world work puts you at a disadvantage against somebody unknowing.

    I have trouble understanding what you can do with the other talents. 

    Does "manifest your will into concrete existence" mean you can use telekinesis? Cast a fireball? Do you need high willpower to use Weft effectively?

    What is a "change into the fabric of reality"? Creating matter ex nihilo? Changing the laws of physics in an area? If so, it is extremely powerful, especially if combined with Warp.

    Let's say somebody cast a spell neat a Comb user. Can the ripples of magic be used to cast another spell? to counter the original spell? to make a long lasting effect at the spot the magic was used?

    With Sight, you can see the "fabric of reality" what does that mean? can you see the space-time continuum? The laws of physics?
    ```

- u/lysogeny99999:
  ```
  You wish to help people (and preferably humanity as a whole) and are incredibly powerful.... inside of an isolated 8 foot x 10 foot x 8 foot room. Inside the room you are completely immortal, can create any object that is either naturally occurring or has been made by humans before, can manipulate matter with atomic precision, and can alter the laws of physics (with a few exceptions noted below) at a whim.

  However, no effect generated from inside the room can affect anything outside the room. Anything you take out of the room will "revert" to how it was before entering. For example, if you bring in laptop parts and assemble them in the room, they will go back to being parts when you take the device out. The only exception is that humans retain their memories when leaving the room.  


  A few additional things you cannot do with your power:

  * No time or space fuckery (You cannot for example, do anything to give yourself more time to act in the room relative to the outside, nor can you alter space to give yourself more effective room than the 8x10x8 provided.)
  * You must actually know specifically what object are trying to create with your power (For example, thinking "I want to create the cure for cancer" will not work, even if there is a naturally occurring substance somewhere that would effectively cure all types of cancer).
  ```

  - u/Genarment:
    ```
    * Rapid prototype expensive equipment. 
    * If you can create *specific* objects, like part #352 from batch 402 of the John Smith Space Parts Plant, destructively test them in the room. If not, have them brought to you for destructive testing; they'll revert to normal after you're done. 
    * Solve arbitrary computation-intensive problems by screwing with physics to give your computers faster computational speed / arbitrary information density. 
    * *Examine* objects at the atomic level. Simulate them with the aforementioned arbitrary compute power.
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      You have arbitrary computing power? Fuck the outside world, just bring everyone's brains into the room one by one, scan them, toss the meat into a mini black hole, and upload all the minds into your simulated instance of Equestria.
      ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    Super-rapidly iterating through ideas for battery storage tech and better superconductor tech seem like the thing to do. Solve those two and you save the world!
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    So, the things I create in the room will *always* revert on exit? So that means I can create a virulent disease in there, infect a volunteer in order to test a cure... and then if the test fails, the volunteer can lose the disease entirely by simply leaving the room?
    ```

  Identity Virus Supervillain:

  \- you gain the power to turn people into a copy of yourself, whenever you bite them (the bite must draw blood)

  \- Only their bodies and minds change into yours, not their clothes etc. They gain/lose mass magically to match yours. You do not get their knowledge or skills.

  \- whenever one of your copies die, their memories, knowledge, and skills gained since their creation are beamed to the original, to seamlessly add to their own. All further copies made personally by the original get that extra skills. The process is cumulative, and depends on the copies being quantum entangled, or something similar.

  \- Copies are instinctively loyal to the copy who "made" them, and that one to their progenitor, etc back to the original. Copies instinctively know which of them is of "older generation" and thus have automatic leadership structure.

  How would you utilize this power to take over the world the fastest, most optimally and efficiently?

  Round 1: your goal is simply to take over the world ie: become its greatest political and military superpower, able to call the shots on a planetary scale. At least 90% of humanity must be de-facto ruled by Yous.

  Round 2: your goal is to convert EVERYONE into a copy of yourself. At least 99% of humanity must either become You or dead.

  Reverse Round: you are in charge of a task force intent on stopping such a self-copying Menace. By the time The Task Force is organised, the Copier had made 10 copies in EU, 10 in the US, and 10 in China.
  ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    >you gain the power to turn people into a copy of yourself, whenever you bite them (the bite must draw blood)

    * How fast does the conversion occur? This significantly impacts potential strategies, since a day-long conversion process is far easier to mitigate than the absurd case of conversion which takes place in under a second (which could end up close to *28 Days Later*).

    * Is there any variability in conversion time? In other words, could some people get bitten, think they're fine, and then later turn into me?

    >Only their bodies and minds change into yours, not their clothes etc. They gain/lose mass magically to match yours. You do not get their knowledge or skills.

    * If they are injured or have other medical problems at the time of conversion, do those problems go away when they are converted into me?

    * Would biting a copy of myself cause that copy to turn into a more recent version of me?

    * How injured does someone need to be before biting them does not convert them into a copy of me? For example, if they had a heart attack and their heart is no longer beating, but I bite them and then start providing CPR, would they still convert?
    ```
