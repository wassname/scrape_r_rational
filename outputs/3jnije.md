  I enjoyed it.  I remember another snippet with a similar chain of events but a different outcome.  In response to the challenge on the sig figs of his percent, Spock quoted a huge variety of relevant statistics he had memorized to come up with the most accurate estimate possible.  Does anyone remember the link to that snippet?
