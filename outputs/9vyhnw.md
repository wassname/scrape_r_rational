  I just bought the first book yesterday on a whim after reading raving reviews about it. Is it as good as they're making out to be?

    ```
    Yes, in my opinion. I'm rereading it right now, after having bought the second, getting part way through, and realizing that you kind of need a good feel for all the moving parts as introduced in Book 1.
