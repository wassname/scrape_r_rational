  A lot of folks here seem to enjoy the Cradle series, so here's me letting you know about the latest book in the series being released.

  Just a shill for those who haven't heard of the [series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0753FP6SP?ref_=dbs_p_mng_rwt_ser_shvlr&storeType=ebooks) before:

  A lot of people here don't really like the Xianxia genre and I agree with their criticisms of how many main characters are very villainous, under-developed enemies and female characters, the economies of cultivation aren't logical, the poor scaling in conflict as you go from one city to interstellar in scope, and awkward prose. But I bring up all of these flaws to say that the Cradle series completely avoids all of the typical flaws in Xianxia and has a very smart character who sets out to cultivate smartly instead of bullheadedly.

  Lindon is well-developed with empathy instead of being a sociopath. There are multiple strong female leads who aren't merely romantic interests (ex. Yerin and Mercy). The power levels are well-defined and we see the top most tiers of power early on who are relevant instead of emerging as needed as the protagonist grows in strength. The scale in scope from one place to interstellar stays meaningful and coherent.

  This series alone rescues the Xianxia genre and makes the setting's tropes enjoyable again.

    Hopefully it's better than Uncrowned, which was so aggressively mediocre it made me lose a lot of faith in Will's ability to carry this series to a satisfying end.

        Scope bloom can be partially dealt with using real-life levels of decay. The more things which are gained, assembled, or achieved, the more things there are to decay, wither, fossilize, or go out of control.

        Look at politicians, who regularly go from one political crisis (or at least problem) to the next, usually juggling multiple ones at any given moment, only to see the same ones rise again in a slightly different form later - not even necessarily stronger, but having to be dealt with all the same. Maybe even with political tools which have gotten rusty or underfunded or the people originally in charge have moved on and the new ones are unknowns.

        Of course, that means a series either stays at the same level of action, or levels off, which doesn't really fit the 'continual progression' aspect.

      Agreed, I also don't like where the story seems to be going, >!he could stay in cradle and be a highly influential ruler and live a good comfortable life with a happy ending. But instead he's going to ascend and become recruit level space police, kind of lame!<. This seems to be a problem with most xianxia, they don't know where to stop. 

      &#x200B;

      Hopefully the final arc is going to be everything Wright wants it to be, my expectations are low though.

        IIRC Lindon has a sort of traumatic paranoia that means that he'll never truly feel safe until he's become strong enough to protect the things he cares about from anything that might ever *even possibly* deign to threaten him or those things.

        Ignoring the fact that, as he gets strong enough to deal with a threat at level N-1, that makes threats at level N start paying attention to him...
        ```

        ```
        But that's pretty obviously not where the story's going, if you've been paying attention. Did you forget the bit with >!Ozriel's message?!<
        ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        Yeah, that's a pretty bad reading of what's gonna happen. Like aggressively so.
        ```

      - u/PerhapsLily:
        ```
        I trust that Lindon isn't going to *stop* once he becomes a recruit. Isn't that the whole point?

      What didn't you like about Uncrowned?

        I think it's an increasingly shallow experience. The worldbuilding, the characterization, even the magic system are all left unexplored in favour of keeping a tight pacing. 

        Even when we're shown a precious moment of intimacy and connection between characters the author will write something like "they then talked about the tournament and training for the rest of the evening while holding hands"(<--paraphrased from an actual scene in Wintersteel, btw) rather than, you know, actually show them having a conversation. 

        I'm reading the latest book right now and you have Mercy and Lindon showing all this concern for civilians and all I can think of is that they haven't had a single line of dialog with anyone that wasn't moving the plot forward in some way. Why do they give a single shit about the Blackflame Empire? We know nothing about it, met only a few random cultivators from there(all discarded as characters by now), in the end it's just a place they trained in for a few arcs.

        I'm aware that a lot of people are fine with the story as it is, and that's fine, but I'm not. The funny thing is, I read Unsouled on release day, and I'm pretty sure I was the first person to recommend this story here, and a few other subs. I thought it showed a lot of promise.

          Hmm, I see where you're coming with that. The author does really cut the writing to the bone. Personally, I kind of like how pared down it is, but I can see feeling it goes too far. 

          > Even when we're shown a precious moment of intimacy and connection between characters the author will write something like "they then talked about the tournament and training for the rest of the evening while holding hands"

          I agree this scene really should have been where more actual emotional intimacy was explored. It was a bit odd that it just kind of... ended when they had dinner. 

          > Why do they give a single shit about the Blackflame Empire? 

          I will say that for Lindon at least, it's extremely clear why he cares. It's been made clear over and over that his motivation is to try to save his home and family from being completely wiped out by the Dreadgods. It was the spark that drove him to leave Sacred Valley in the first place. Yerin, for her part, seems clear that she cares about advancement, Lindon, living up to her memory of her former master, and nothing else.

          ```
          As someone who agrees with you regarding Uncrowned, this one is a vast improvement in almost every way.
          ```

          - u/LLJKCicero:
            ```
            I loved Uncrowned, but still, Wintersteel is clearly superior, in a big way.
            ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It more than made up for Uncrowned in my opinion — might even be better than Ghostwater.
      ```

  ```
  God bless Will wight as well as Travis Bauldry (audiobook narrator).

  To everyone unhappy about the past book or similar: I do agree the books aren't 100% perfect, but I am here to see Lindon kick ass, while occasionally meeting cool new people. Sure we could get as much detail and character building as stormlight archive or some such, but this isn't that kind of story and I don't think I'd want it to be. We get basically 0 boring downtime. It's almost always action, and it's definitely always awesome. If I wanted every rock described I'd go pick the wheel of time up from where I stopped reading because it got too slow.

  Don't mean to come off mean. Basically just wanted to say that this series delivers what I want in a good package, and i think it's awesome!

  ```
  And the first 7 books are free til Oct 7.
  ```

- u/cthulhusleftnipple:
  ```
  I'll second this rec. I tried the Cradle series just a couple months ago, and liked them enough that I finished them all within the week. If the previous books are free right now, I'd highly recommend giving them a go. 

  For reference, I haven't been particularly taken with any other Xianxia series in the past. They're mostly not well written enough or too sloppy to keep my interest. Cradle is both well written and with solid enough world-building to keep my interest throughout.

  - u/KamikazeHamster:
    ```
    Have you read Street Cultivation? It’s another trope busting xianxia story. There are currently 2 out and she just posted a new book on Royal Road too.
    ```

    - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
      ```
      I read the first book and part of the second. It was fine, but ultimately not that compelling to me. It subverted some of the tropes, sure, but mostly it didn't really go anywhere. After a book and a half, there didn't seem to be any over-arching plot of any real meaning. Building up to beating the bad guy in a big fight is fine as far as it goes, but it's kind of a weak hook to just keep using over and over in a series. There wasn't really... anything more that it seemed to be building to. 

      Also, I found the fights to be incredibly repetitive.
      ```

      - u/KamikazeHamster:
        ```
        Fair enough. I enjoyed everything he did outside of his fights. Different strokes for different folks. 

        What about the Thousand Li series?
        ```

        - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
          ```
          > What about the Thousand Li series?

          Haven't tried that one. Any good?
          ```

          - u/KamikazeHamster:
            ```
            I liked it. He’s not OP, just a dude trying to get by. It’s got a simple martial arts sect at first but then he goes exploring. Has a nice slow pace too. Check out some reviews.
            ```

            - u/TREB0R:
              ```
              I never read past the first book. The author was pushing a noble vs. commoner underdog story, which didn't really make sense to me with cultivation being added to the equation that should have been a huge equalizer. If I'm remembering correctly, it was the nobility from the mortal world that was being overbearing, which seems like they would lose power once entering a cultivation sect based on talent. Please correct me if I'm remembering it wrong.
              ```

- u/LLJKCicero:
  ```
  I love Cradle, though I'm not sure I'd call it rational fiction. The only things that make it so are just generic good writing things like believable characters or a world that at least sort of makes sense.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    I don't consider it rational fiction either. It's just labeled as Progression Fantasy which is a genre that lot of people here already like, and there's already multiple fans of Cradle who discuss it sometimes in the Off-Topic Friday Thread. Hence me posting about the series here.
    ```

- u/AStartlingStatement:
  ```
  I enjoyed it. 

  I mean... the entire thing is essentially just The Legend of the Gutsy Ninja, retold. But that's a good story. As I get older I see less and less point in criticizing stories for being unoriginal since you eventually realise that almost nothing is original and really its just minor variations of the same story beats, promises and payoffs retold again and again with slightly different coats of paint.
