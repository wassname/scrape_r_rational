## [WIP] [HF] Second draft of magic system, now with context and backstory

### Post:

This is a follow-up to [a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3dg9rs/wip_hf_i_have_a_magic_system_in_mind_but_i_think/), but since most of the ideas within have been scrapped, going back and reading it isn't important.

Before I begin, allow me to say two things. First, I intend to work a revised version of this concept into a novel over the next couple of years. As such everything written here is a spoiler, so if that novel actually gets published then I'll have to come back and delete this post. 

Second, please tear apart every single aspect of this concept. Be merciless, come at me bro. I want this concept to be really polished-off before I even *start* writing a novel around it.

...

The world initially shown is populated almost entirely by elves, with humans being a much smaller minority. Elves live thrice as long as humans, stand several inches taller on average, have larger eyes with sharper sight, and have an easier time building muscle and losing fat thanks to an enhanced metabolism. 

The technology of this world is antiquated. There's no electricity, no firearms, no vehicles more advanced than a carriage, no weapons more advanced than *maybe* a crossbow. Metal is extremely rare and any tools made of it are prized; other materials like stone/obsidian/wood are more often used. Horses, cattle, cats and dogs... none of those are anywhere to be seen. Aside from elves, the setting of the story is populated mostly by a wide variety of reptiles and birds.

There is a kind of magic every elf can use freely, but humans never/almost never can. The system is regulated, each individual elf can only cast a certain sort of spell. Someone who can cast fire-based spells can *only* cast fire-based spells. 

Why? What the heck is going on here?

I'll be the first to admit the explanation is a little weird.

This isn't just a high fantasy setting. Magic comes from somewhere; it was *made* by something. 

I'll cut to the chase. Many, many thousands of years ago (think 20,000 or so), this world was inhabited by a very advanced human civilization. They'd even successfully managed to edit their own DNA to enhance their bodies and pass those enhancements on to their children. 

Elves are transhumans.

Of course, this all had to go wrong *somewhere.* This civilization has been gone for 20,000 years and no one even remembers it existed; there are no artifacts of that era left in plain sight. 
So again, why? What happened?

They say any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. So they advanced their technology to a sufficient degree; all of the advanced machinery humans relied on to run their world was replaced by a more elegant wave of a hand. Why drive a vehicle when you can fly, for instance? User interfaces became obsolete entirely; humanity had cut out the middleman and made the user and interface one.

This went well... for about a week. Then someone, probably a world leader with authority over a large population with access to magic, decided it'd be nice if they were in charge of the whole world. So a war started, a war fought by magic-users who had pretty much no limits on how creative they could get with their magic.

Any way you could think of munchkining a free magic system, someone probably tried it. They probably didn't have as much restraint as you'd expect either, since they were in the middle of a world war after all. If *they* didn't start throwing around magically-spawned viruses and nukes, surely the *enemy* would, right?

To stop the war, the magic system was modified. Restrictions were put in place so each person could only cast a certain range of spells. The idea was to tone down the power of the system enough that Person A, not using any magic, could conceivably subdue Person B, using magic and trying as hard as they possibly could to kill Person A. The odds would be very heavily slanted in B's favor of course, but as long as A had a chance, that was good enough.

At this point there wasn't much left of the world. Most of humanity's population had been wiped out, countries had been utterly wiped off the map, every trace of every city erased from existence leaving only dead black soil behind.

The remaining people, transhuman elves and unmodified humans alike, weren't left with very many resources to solve this problem. Someone with unrestricted magic access could cover the planet in life again... but the surviving creators of the source of magic, the only ones with, shall we say, admin permissions, decided they couldn't trust anyone with that kind of power. 
They instead gave an FAI access to magic with looser restrictions and assigned it multiple directives:

> Render the environment of the planet stable and inhabitable,

> Prevent any possible extinction events,

> Interfere minimally in human affairs,

> Never kill a sapient being,

> Contain (and dispose of when possible) any dangerous artifacts from before the fall of civilization.

(there is room for improvement here and I damn well know it)

Flash forward an appropriate number of millennia and we find a nation of elves established on a volcanic archipelago near the equator of their planet; it's a very lively tropical environment at odds with the wasteland that once covered the world. 

A certain someone with an unusually powerful spell (not violating the restrictions of magic's power level, but about as powerful as a mage can be in the setting) has dethroned the King of the nation and put himself in power. The common people almost universally hate him and he knows it; he's openly adopted the title of "Dark Lord." There are multiple resistance groups aiming to kill him and restore the King to his throne.

One in particular, the King's Glaive is formed mostly of former members of the King's royal guard. One of their agents managed to get his hands on the "phylactery" of the Dark Lord; as long as it exists he can't be killed. Unfortunately the King's Glaive find themselves unable to destroy it, so the Dark Lord sets out to retrieve it while he can.

The story follows two characters: the first is Sigurd, a member of the King's extended family and therefore somewhere back in the line of succession. A certain chain of events sees him in possession of the phylactery and on the run from the Dark Lord. The second is Brenna, a member of the King's Glaive sent to retrieve the phylactery and attempt to destroy it (she has a plan, but I won't go into detail).
