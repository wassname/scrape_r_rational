## Fanfic rec: Star Trek TNG - “Another Tomorrow” - I’ve only read chapters 8-10, as I found it while searching for fanfics involving Cetacean Ops. I’m hooked.

  I'm sorry; I couldn't get past the first chapter because of the writing style.  I used to read a lot of webcomics, and there's a tendency of webcomic fanfics to reduce everything to dialogue-dialogue-dialogue-action-action-dialogue without any space devoted to character reaction or introspection, or exposition about the setting.  It's become something of a pet peeve, which this fic aggravated in spades.
