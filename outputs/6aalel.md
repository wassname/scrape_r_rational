  ... the casual implication that Ranger just traipses into Skade every new season to pluck the eye out of the Fae equivalent of a Calamity in order to wear it as jewelry is just... whoa. Like her game of inviting the Kingdom of the Dead wasn't badass enough!

  I too think that "All if forgiven" will come back to bite Cat, especially if we discover that the Fae have been doing some sketchy stuff Cat and Co. don't know of yet. I also wonder if Masego's implied asexuality is going to completely trip up the jealous Fae lover, or if Masego will somehow get drawn into their story against his will.

  >And just like that today’s game of *this does not feel like a coincidence in the slightest* had found a winner.

  I'm not sure I understood the meaning behind this... anyone able to explain?

    Even re-reading this just now I can't see any meaning with a high level of confidence. Perhaps this

    > “An invitation is always sent to the Courtyard, Hallowed One,” the steward said hesitantly. “It’s simply that usually we… do not receive guests, in this part of the season.”

    Implies that Cat's and her team have been manoeuvred into an existing story? Manoeuvred by the King of Winter (or whatever he's called) who assigned them this courtyard.

      I have to think 'Chiaroscuro' is relevant here. It was immediately assumed Heiress was behind this because it seemed Cat got the short end of the stick with major incursions. But we learnt from heiress viewpoint and 'Lies' that Summer has the heavy hitters military wise and Heiress did not set this in motion.

      While the Winter/Summer kings likely have their own motivations and could be the source of the plotting there are other potential sources:  
      Black or the Empress could have some long game (supported by the fact that Cat *should* have an easier time than Heiress)  
      This could be a gambit by First Prince to weaken the empire as she's shown willingness to destroy Callow in pursuit of the goal earlier.  
      Ranger's intentions are a mystery and her agents keep popping up at convenient times. Additionally she has access to the areas/people needed while it has been unclear how other actors would do this.  

      My current guess is the Fae got wind of what Heiress is planning, through one of the above or on their own and started attacking. Winter is using the cover of 'Summer is at war so we must be' to gain a foothold in the mortal world as always wanted.

  Not your usual cliff hanger, but quite intriguing nevertheless. Would anyone care to make a prediction?

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      What exactly would that do? It's not like she was expecting reparations, and forgiving them for invading is not permission to continue.
      ```

      - u/JdubCT:
        ```
        I, honestly, have no clue. Promises to fae never end up particularly great for those involved. I'm sure it'll turn out fine in the end seeing as she's going to manipulate the hell out of them though.
        ```
