## [Q][WIP] S.I. Book Two: Anyone want to help me with some tables and drawings?

### Post:

I'm about to write something resembling a First Contact scenario; and if feasible, I'd like to include some of the simple tables and diagrams that the characters try to use to establish words and symbols for some of the basic concepts. I haven't even used MS Paint in years; so would anyone in this subreddit be willing to help me create an image-file for this?

  I’m game. Although I too am going through a period of exam-induced PS celibacy, yet unbroken - I’d be happy to help out. A bit unsure as to what exactly you are going for though, particularly about the tables. Could you elaborate a bit?

  Maybe  you could draw a quick draft of the symbols on paper and then send us a picture. We could then clean it up a bit, touch it up.. 

  Also, First contact is totally <3  - can’t wait to read it :P

    I'm just now writing down what I've worked out in my head... and I'm about to run some errands, so it'll be a few hours before I can add more, but here's what I've got down so far:


    * Physical medium: Using knives to scratch onto wooden/plastic blocks, the blocks about a meter across.


    * First table: introduces various representations of numbers 0-12.
    - First column: That number of dots.
    - Second column: That number in binary, with vertical strokes for '1' and horizontal strokes for '0'.
    - Third column: Variations of regular digits, so that each digit has the appropriate number of interior angles holding digits. Eg, 0 is round; 1 has a serif on top but not bottom (looking almost like the number 7); 2 looks like a Z; 3 looks like a sideways W; 7 has both a crossbar and a serif at bottom. 10, 11, and 12 have no entries in this column.
    - Fourth column: Regular digits.
    - Fifth column: The number written out as an English word, though written in para-Unifon letters.

    * Para-Unifon: Unifon is a proposal to write English with one sound per letter and one letter per sound. 40 letters. Para-unifon uses the same principle, but slightly different letters. (Para-unifon is the alphabet used by the Toledo Free Press.)
    Ant: A
    Apron: A with stroke at bottom, or https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Gaelic-fonts.png
    bAll: A without a horizontal stroke
    Bee: B
    CHair: C with a horizontal stroke
    Dog: D
    Egg: E
    EAgle: E with the vertical stroke in the middle
    hER: mirrored E merged with R
    Fish: F
    Goat: G
    House: H
    Igloo: I
    Ice: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eihwaz
    Jaw: J
    Kiss: K
    Law: L
    Man: M
    Name: N
    riNG: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngvi#The_Ingwaz_rune
    pOt: O
    Ocean: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odal_%28rune%29
    bOOk: O with a vertical stroke, or double-o
    OWl: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn
    OIl: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%92
    Pipe: P
    Rat: R
    Sun: S
    SHirt: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esh_%28letter%29
    Tent: T
    feaTHer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eth
    THermometer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_%28letter%29
    Umbrella: U
    rUler, nEW: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur_%28rune%29
    Unicorn, YOU: U with horizontal stroke at bottom
    Vest: V
    Wagon: W, or double-u
    viSIon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhe_%28Cyrillic%29
    Yam: Y
    Zoo: Z with horizontal stroke

    Basic math symbols through examples: Equals, plus, minus, times, divide (using obelus sign), exponent, decimal point, negative number, imaginary number


    * Physics
    - Based on the Voyager record, the symbol for hydrogen: a 1 in a circle, with a small stroke at the top of the symbol.
    - A hydrogen atom: Two symbols for hydrogen. On one, there is a small dot on top of the small stroke, on the other, a small dot on the bottom of the small stroke. They are scaled so that a line with two endpoints above the atom is as close to 21.1 cm as possible.
    - Length unit: 21.1 cm is titled "Span" (in para-unifon)
    - Oxygen: An 8, surrounded by a circle with two strokes, surrounded by a circle with six strokes (2, 2, 1, 1).
    - Chemistry: Water: two Hydrogens and an Oxygen, joined.
    - Mass unit: One cubic span of water. (~20 pounds), titled "Stone"
    ```

      So.. the beginning of the table is roughly [something like this](http://oi58.tinypic.com/152c47q.jpg)? The idea with the angles is brilliant - love it.

      This might need a collaboration with a few people though - breaking it into parts. We can do plain black brush strokes or set fonts on a transparent background and then someone can compile it together on the plastic or wooden background. Mess around in PS to change all the black strokes into scratches.

      Edit: the writing is on improvised materials so, stock images of random worn junk with flat-ish surfaces for each section? If we have a photomanipulator or digipainter here who knows, maybe we could even add furry pink hands holding them.. n_n
