## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I'm continuing to do worldbuilding and magic system work on *Shadows of the Limelight 2: Electric Boogaloo*. You can read the two appendices [here](https://alexanderwales.com/shadows24/) and [here](http://alexanderwales.com/shadows25/), but the short version is that fame gives you powers, and those powers all relate to a domain in one way or another.

  One of the big things that I'd want to do in a years-later sequel is expand upon the domain system. As it stood in *Shadows*, it was ~60 domains, each of them a single-word noun that referenced a specific animal, material, or phenomena.

  For the expansion (which either works in-universe as an upset in the alternate dimension meme-beast ecosystem, or as its own thing in an unrelated universe), this means many more nouns, and some verbs as well, meaning that people (in-universe) don't have a memorized domain list along with best practices, established strategies, etc., they have to tailor themselves more closely to individuals. I'm still working through the implications of this though, because it inevitably weakens the system somewhat, while also opening up the possibility for some really "out there" domains. But this brings it back to the "if there are lots of different powers, we need to do some math on power distribution, who's disrupting what, what systems arise from those power distributions, and the powerful corner cases, along with rules for it all" problem (the ITALODP,WNTOSMOPD,WDW,WSAFTPD,ATPCC,AWRFIA problem, for short). That's always thorny.

  **So,** if you've read [*Shadows of the Limelight*](http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/), or at least the appendicies, then what domains are cool or powerful as implied by either the text, the appendicies, or your imagination?



  (I've been sick with norovirus the last few days and I'm on the tail end of it. Hopefully this (and the other writing I've been doing) is coherent.)

    From the appendices, it sounds like it might be possible for there to be a domain of something that is part of the popular consciousness but is nonetheless false. For example, domains of miasma (as in the miasma theory of disease) or of phlogiston. If so, how would these manifest?

    Alternatively, what happens if a domain suddenly becomes broader in scope? For example, if sound and heat become popularly understood to be based on the same principles, would an Illustrati with a single one of those domains gain the abilities of the other?

    Have you read Jayne's "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"? (EDIT: not endorsing its accuracy) This seems like the kind of memetic shift that might be relevant, and could produce a domain of Thought or similar.

    I like the idea of a domain of Self, which would allow great control over one's own body and mind only. Maybe they could use the domain kinesis to fling themselves about or fly?

    Also, a lot of the domains deal with substances or processes. What about other abstract categories, such as shapes? Could you have a domain of Wheels? That would presumably be substance-agnostic (inasmuch as the substance could serve as a wheel) but would depend instead on how much the substance counts as being a wheel.

    What about other cultures, say on a distant continent, with poor communication between them?

    Being part of the same world, they would run on the same fame-based magic system; but being really, really separated for a long time, they'll be working with different cultures (and the difference in cultures would affect the magic available to their respective heros).

    Thus, if (as an example) Light is seen in the other continent as mainly searing, blinding, burning and Dark is seen as cooling, comforting, calming, then perhaps a Dark user from the other continent can use his powers in a healing/restorative way unavailable to Dark users from the main continent. (Sure, there'll be a lot of overlap in what Dark users can do, but the differences can still make an interesting contrast).

    At the same time, the new (and presumably recently contacted) culture is a *resource* - magic users already famed on one continent who move over to the other continent and become famous there as well will have rather significantly more power than those who stick to just one continent.

  I've been toying with the idea of how different algorithms and concepts in computer science could (if you ignored a lot of technicalities), improve how the brain works (in a sci-fi or fantasy setting). Basically defragmenting, backups, sorting algorithms, threading, etc. What ways could we implement our knowledge of computers to make our brains work better?

    Dude. Concurrent processing/Multithreading.

    Imagine being able to have multiple streams of distinct, detailed consciousness?

    You could get so much done it would be unbelievable.

    Writing your novel in one thread, making a grocery list in another, planning an event in another, digging financial planning in another, all whilst focusing on your current task at your day job.

      True, concurrency was one of the first that I started to think about. Even without true concurrency, just the ability to switch between tasks every microsecond would be incredibly helpful, your multitasking abilities would go through the roof.

    Memories (and other things) seem to be stored in the brain as linked nodes. For this reason, it's often the case that certain stimuli get associated with certain memories, for reasons that really aren't that objectively great. The smell of a rose can trigger a memory from childhood, which is a human pleasure, but the functionality of that is kind of bad, since it seems like it's "designed" for a small use case and then applied all over the place.

    If you could take a look at those nodes, you could reconfigure the whole graph so that, say, doing diagnostic work as a doctor wouldn't tend to bring up irrelevant memories. It would also pretty effectively allow us to remove a lot of the triggers for various mental maladies, like PTSD.

    I think that would probably be enough for a relatively small and tightly constrained mental magic system, though the biggest impact would probably be the ability to remove memories by unlinking them.

    You can go low-level, too. Pre-loaded physical content allowing you to instantly know how to perform actions. Optimized search patterns for our eyes. Frequency analysis on our ears for more precise locating and recognition of things. Constant muscle twitching to promote muscle growth. Back-up systems to help you recover from a fall. Pre-loaded scent knowledge. Performance monitors to track body's health and performance (basically a stat menu!). More "RAM" for short term memory tasks & more "HDD" to enhance long term memories. Squashing (or enhancing) hind-brain emotions like lust, fight / flight, need for spirituality, need to nurture, need to socialize.
