  The teleport marbles have a pretty terrible flaw, even if they work exactly how they're described - a single untrustworthy member of your group could teleport everyone away. Hell, a single untrustworthy *enemy* with access to a marble could teleport everyone away. I am fairly certain that you wouldn't even get a saving throw, depending on how the wording of *Teleport* is applied to the magic item.

  I don't know whether this flaw is intentional, but I suspect that it is.

    It's true, that could be an issue.  Mostly though, it's a question of priorities.  Suze was optimizing for "will let everyone escape very quickly as long as anyone can still act" and not so much for "secure".

    Also, note that she oversimplified the functionality slightly -- when you drop a marble, you are included in the teleport even though you aren't personally touching it anymore.  I wondered if I should call that out, but decided it was too fussy to spend screen time on.

  Jake's smart, but he has had a **massive** failure here.

  "I am imagining a magical item called the **Block of Power**.  A Block of Power is a three foot by two foot by two foot block of magically invulnerable adamantine that magically weighs no more than fifteen pounds.  Along one of the thin ends of the Block of Power there is an adamantine handle to facilitate the carrying of the Block.  Upon the speaking of a command word, the block will magically adhere to a single flat, continuous, nonliving, hard surface against which it is placed firmly.  It will remain magically stuck to this surface as if held there by sovereign glue.  Another command word will release this hold.  Neither the affix nor release command word will function unless the handle is firmly held by the one who speaks it.  Another command word will activate the Block of Power, causing it to begin producing electrical current that meets the following criteria: [insert appropriate wattage, amperage, and direct/alternating current type].  This power is not transmitted to the surface of the **Block of Power**, which always remains magically at 71 degrees Fahrenheit.  When the command word for power generation is spoken, an otherwise inaccessible compartment opens on the face of the Block opposite the adhered face.  When a humanoid reaches a hand into this opening, which is always 1.5' diameter they are able to safely retrieve the female end of a well-insulated power cable of up to 200' that terminates in a standard female outlet socket that is insulated properly to prevent someone touching it from being shocked."

  Seriously, with Jake's intellect he should be able to create a magical power generator that could power a completely nonmagical device that can read those books.  If he phrases it correctly, he could have that device send the output out of the antimagic field.  Then **shennanigans** can happen.

  Off of the top of my head, a magical device that 'reads' the output of one or more microscopes and writes that output into nonmagical books (or even a single magical book).  Even better, it reads them into a single magical book that has an improved version of Scholar's Touch that'll transmit the contents safely to the brain of someone touching it and speaking a command word.

  Jake. Has. Free. Wishes.  He also has a template for creating items with arbitrary spells, or that can cast arbitrary spells, EVEN IF THOSE SPELLS DON'T EXIST.  I really don't get why he looked at the room full of all the information he needs and gave up.  He hasn't even *tried*.

  He was drinking Pinot, but he's got that whole anti-alcohol thing. Also, I've got this weird feeling that Suze is more than she appears and the free pass on magic items has been used for some other purpose. Maybe she's that destroyed lich we just learned about. Her precautions went a little further than Afi could deal with, and now she's laying low with the resistance, waiting for the right opportunity.

    Re. Suze, there was a clue early on in the story where someone commented on her having an accent they couldn't quite place.  Ever since then, I've been paying attention to what she's doing, though tbh I can't think of more than a handful of ideas (like yours) for who or what she really is. If you use meta-knowledge, major characters in a story tend to serve a purpose to drive the plot, and we have yet to find out what hers is other than super-secretary.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Olivia was the one who had the unusual accent.  She was one of the Landguard brought in to protect Jake after Alpha Squad were all killed; she got turned into a wraith back in chapter 38.

    I don't think that's hugely likely.

    As Allison explained to Jake, servants in Flobovia were (de facto, if not de jure) at their master's beck and call for any number of 'services'.  Sure, "Suze-As-Lich-Queen" could be a possibility.  But that would imply that a Lich Queen would be able to bury her own ego and live as a mortal human girl, *serving* others, for a long period.

    Instead, "Not-Quite-Dead-Lich-Queen" could easily have lived as a commoner - or even a skilled craftsman or displaced foreign noble.  If access to the leadership was desired, I'm sure there's a dozen ways to do it that wouldn't require NQDLQ to pose as a servant.

    Sure, "Suze-As-Lich-Queen" wouldn't have to **actually** submit to serving a master in any unpleasant ways (she could always *Mindscrape* the desire away or false memories of it in) but she would have to live with the fact that everyone she meets expects her to do so.

    For a typical medieval commoner, raised to believe that this is just how the world works?  It's absolutely survivable and most likely prefereable to a life of hardscrabble farming or working as a common laborer.  For a Lich Queen used to commanding, and able to rewrite parts of reality with a tiny bit of effort and a few carefully-chosen words?  It would be intolerable.

    This isn't absolute evidence that Suze can't be a Lich Queen, but it's pretty strong evidence against that possibility.  Any conceivable goal that could be accomplished by a Lich Queen being Suze (whether that's by replacing an existing Suze or - more likely - by always having been Suze) could be better achieved by another hypothetical person that wouldn't have the socio-economic issues that a Lich Queen would find so grating.

      Geez. I go to all this trouble to set up foreshadowed-yet-unexpected twists, and then people start throwing out all these crazy theories which might or might not be true. It makes an author want to write cryptic and ambiguous posts that confuse the issue even more. ;)

    > He was drinking Pinot, but he's got that whole anti-alcohol thing. 

    Malbec, actually.  ;)

    Yeah, that was a complete brain cramp on my part.  It's fixed.


    As to Suze...mwahahaha.

  Is it really a good idea to put the books in the ritual fires?

  Even assuming they'll be forever useless, i think that there's a reasonable chance that burning the books will have a negative result.

  Because burning a million books full of secrets given to you by Loki in fires feeding a nascent goddess just seems like you're not only holding an idiot ball, you're standing on it while trying to juggle chainsaws.

  Those books are pretty good artifacts. Why not have some bookbinders unbind the pages, and have tailors sew the paper into anti-magic armor for the army?

  I can't believe I forgot about Chekov's Library.

  Well, that's certainly a thing.

  > more charasmatic **that** JFK

  Not sure if this is an appropriate place for mere spellcheck.  :)
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Thanks, fixed!

    And yes, this is a great place for spellcheck.  No matter how many times I edit, when I go back a few days / weeks later, I always find more errors.  :/  The chapters which have to be finalized on Saturday (such as this week's and last week's) tend to be a bit worse about that, obviously.

  So, Jake is giving up on getting the information out of those books? Also, who is going to be at the end of the railgun? They could end up forgetting a *lot*, depending on what information is in those books. Given that Jake's sacrifice meant he forgot about the idea of scrying other planets altogether, they may not even be able to function after. Getting an Ice Assassin to do it seems a good idea. 

  Wait, would it even work to get someone to sacrifice the books when they don't know what's in them? All other sacrifices we've seen had the person write the thing down and sacrifice it, not sacrifice something someone else wrote down. Actually, might the person who wrote it down lose the knowledge lose it in that case? I can see this annoying Loki significantly. 

  Why is Jake concerned about the others discovering that he enhanced his intelligence? I can't see any reason that they'd care. He's already told them about him having jewels which can cast Wish.

  Loki's mention of Expeditious Retreat seems significant, by the Law of Conservation of Detail, but I can't really see why. Neklos' land speed increasing by 30 doesn't seem particularly useful, unless he can stack it or something. And it doesn't do anything about dying. 

  Jake's plan remains mysterious. It clearly involves doing something to Neklos, rather than just talking, since he needs reinforcements and is worried by Neklos getting an action. But you almost explicitly said in last week's thread that Jake does not plan on killing him, and there was the issue raised about Neklos being able to foresee death. Could Jake Mindscrape Neklos? Does Mindscrape even work on a god? And since they have promised not to harm Melvin, and Neklos will be manifesting through Melvin, I don't think they can attack Neklos. The only use I can think of for the reinforcements would be to cast millions of spells at Neklos until he fails to save on at least one of them, but what spell would be useful? 

  Icefi's trust in Thomas' word seems strangely not paranoid. He knows that Mindscrape exists, the Landguard has access to it and the Landguard are extremely pragmatic. They would definitely use it on their leader if it let them kill Melvin, let alone Neklos.

    > Why is Jake concerned about the others discovering that he enhanced his intelligence?

    He originally concealed from them the fact that he Wished his intelligence higher.  Now that he's no longer psycho he doesn't feel that he needs to have an edge to help him with his plan to kill everyone, but he isn't comfortable admitting to having hidden it from them.  This gives him a simple out.

    As to the rest -- these are great questions, but I can't answer them without spoilers so I will leave the answers to your fertile imagination.

    >Does Mindscrape even work on a god? 

    Does polymorph yadda yadda work on a god? If so, that ain't a problem anymore, per Icefi's demonstrated ability to circumvent type limitations.

  Has Suze been through the FLEA and the POPE?
  ```

- u/drageuth2:

  I -really- like the way you handled Jake finally getting his wis and cha upgrades.  It hasn't really changed him directly, it's just made him pass all his saves.  Now people are kinda forced to go along with even his stupid ideas, and have a reduced ability to debate and improve them.

  If anything, that's gonna get him in _more_ trouble!  Wonderful :)

  - u/eaglejarl:

    Thank you.  :)

    I wrote that section very carefully; I'm glad you enjoyed it.

      If Jake had gotten his INT enhancement from POPEs, would it have had the same effect as when he got it from the Ring of Game Breaking?
