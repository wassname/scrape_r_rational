  I wouldn't ask about the future. I'd go for help. I'm not smart enough to optimize this.

  "Who should I demonstrate this ability to to do the greatest amount of good according to my values."

    what do you think he's doing, man? If I had potentially munchkinable superpowers, the r/rational and spacebattles would be the first places I'd ask (thinly veiled as a hypothetical, of course.)
    ```

      30 points to Ravenclaw.
      ```

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  "What's the best way for me to get ridiculously rich in the next few days without attracting media attention or compromising anything I might value?"

  I mean, what did you expect?
  ```

  - u/CFCrispyBacon:
    ```
    Lol.  Sadly, I don't think that the system I'm trying to use this in will allow something that vague.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      You might restrict it to yes/no questions.  Stronger limits make munchkining it more impressive, and a restriction to binary questions will clarify a lot of edge cases.
      ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  I'll cop the standard /r/rational answer:

  "Using existing programming techniques and hardware, what is the source code and appropriate hardware design for a guaranteed Friendly AGI?"
  ```

- u/noggin-scratcher:
  ```
  "Which publicly traded stock or fund will see the greatest rise in value between now and <future>?", with <future> replaced with however far ahead you can rely on the foreknowledge to be reliable.

  Eventually you may run into trouble with your trades distorting the market in which you're trading, and I'm not sure how your system would handle that, but you'd have to have gotten to the point of having *considerable* wealth to move the market single-handed. Especially if you start restricting the question to highly liquid large-cap stocks, so that there can't be any tricky business with a penny stock being predicted to massively jump in value *because* you're going to buy into it.

  Not sure how to route around the "mild chance for disaster" without knowing what form that disaster takes, but even if it gives you catastrophically bad advice 3 times in 27 you can mitigate the risk by not betting the whole pot on every trade; 24 good picks in every 27 would be easily enough of a success ratio to do very well.
  ```

- u/ajuc:

  There were no limitations on the way you ask, so you can join many questions into one, so that (and the 1/9 chance) is not a restriction really.

  The most restricting is the "few days ahead" limit, but with lottery it's easy to get rich anyway.

  But it would bring attention, so I think much better way is to ask for the address of a bank with anonymous account with the most money on it, and all the required credentials to get that money, and who to hire to get the money for me so (s)he won't betray me and will naturaly die a few hours later anyway (with unverse-wide google you don't even need to be evil, you can just parasite on the natural catastrophes).

  ```
  ...Is this by any chance Mage the Awakening?
  ```

  - u/CFCrispyBacon:
    ```
    I wish.  I'd pay good money to be in a Mage game. Close though-this is the Foresight merit in Vampire: The Masquerade.
    ```

    - u/Newfur:
      ```
      OK, because I'm actually working on determining the computational complexity class of P with limited oracle calls to bits from the future (using Augury/Flip of the Coin, or possibly Shifting Sands). Also, I've figured out how to make a Halting Oracle in MtAw.
      ```
