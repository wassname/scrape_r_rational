  Good story... but the hypertrophied brain sounds off to me, or at least somewhat wrong. i don't know, i could be wrong.

  Might we conceptualize the consciousness as having been *gradually transferred* to the earring (with minor modifications which do not necessarily destroy person-hood) rather than as having atrophied to nothing?

  A very nice story. 

  I recall a related thought experiment suggested elsewhere by Daniel Dennett: 

  One of the neurons in your brain is steadily accumulating damage from old age. So you decide to have surgery which replaces it with a computer chip. The chip sends out currents on the axons connected to the neuron which are exactly the same as those the  original neuron would have sent out. 

  When you wake up after the surgery, you don't feel any different. 

  So you do it again. Prevention is the best cure!

  10^12 surgeries later you are a robot.

    Bet the thought experiment is very different. The point of it is that you remain unchanged: it doesn't matter if your brain made of meat or silicon ships, if the pattern is the same, your identity, that which makes you - you, remains exactly the same. 

    In Scott's story knowing the optimal course of action 100% of the time completely obliterates you - you sorta turn into an interface between the earing and the world, your personality becomes forever irrelevant and atrophies. Pretty much a polar opposite outcome.

      why would having the Path to Victory be a bad thing?
      ```

      - u/notmy2ndopinion:
        ```
        Perhaps because it is a Path to Happiness and Being Moderately Better than You... not a Path to Victory.

        As a side note, Contessa's PtV makes her ramp up conflict, since it really is Path to teh Win, despite this solution obviously being the wrong one in the end.

        [Worm Spoiler](#s "By this, I mean that it was really Oliver's 100% Balance formula that made Scion give up at the end and passively commit suicide from Flechette's Sting. Contessa didn't play any role in the end-game IIRC, but I may be mistaken.")

          Well, if it weren't for her there wouldn't *be* any Balance Formula, I suppose. And the others helped a little.

  Am I the only one who doesn't really care all that much if I no longer exist if my goals are being achieved better then I would achieve them.

  I don't even like existing that much for one thing, for the other even if I did, it's way less important too me then getting stuff done.
  ```

- u/Jiro_T:
  ```
  If the earring starts out by saying "better for you if you take me off", then it understands that a series of short term decisions that can be good will have a long-term impact that is bad.

  If the earring then fails to say "take me off" when actually making short term decisions, then the earring is providing bad advice, because it is deliberately ignoring the long term effect of the decision to claim that the decision is good solely based on its short term effect.

  (The obvious response is that the earring doesn't say "take me off" for the innocuous reason that it won't repeat a suggestion that was already refused.  This argument doesn't work because 1) that opens a way for the earring to be manipulative by choosing exactly what aspect of the current situation it's making suggestions about so that it can avoid having to make such suggestions later, and 2) what counts as a repeat suggestion is not well defined.)
