  I've only read the very first section, but I already want to compliment you for writing a news article that neither portrays its author as dumb nor as a motivated truth bender. That's rare in the fanfics I've come across.

    Just for flavour - Jimmy Firecracker is (canonically) the name of the reporter who films the Cell Game at Mr. Satan's side. The author of this piece, Hank Firecracker, is (in my headcanon) his dad.
    ```

    - u/NotACauldronAgent:
      ```
      Wait that’s his actual name? I thought that was just TFS. Neat.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Nah, it's canonical. DB names are silly :D.

  So in your version of the Red Ribbon arc, our heroes are working side by side with the Red Ribbon Army, at least at least so far as the make themselves trustworthy. 

  I like that reasoning for why such a large mercenary army exists when the country seems to be at peace in general. Being a dying holdover from a more violent era makes sense, and even explains their canon behavior a bit better than Commander Reds motivation.
  ```

  ```
  The Red Ribbon army getting tech from Capsule Corps can't be good. I wonder if the other scientist Commander Black is talking about is Dr Gero.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I love your dialogue, the interactions between Black and the others in particular.

  I think Black truly believes that the RR army is finished... unless he does something about it. That's likely to be his true motivation for arguing against the destruction of the Dragon Balls. And for asking for Bulma's help. When talking with her he showed concern for the welfare of the world but... if he really cared about that would he have served in the RR army in the first place?
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Consider that while the RR isn't exactly a charity in this setting, it's not the cartoonishly villainous organisation of the original either. It's more or less like one of our real life mercenary organisations, except much bigger (due to the different distribution of power in this world), which allows it to get away more easily with some shady dealings. You can be a yakuza boss and still not be okay with the destruction of humanity. There are shades to immorality, and even within the RR there are different philosophies (the Instruments being an extreme example of a faction that thought the command had gone too soft). Black is someone I'd class as lawful neutral; he does what benefits him, he has a respect for order, but he doesn't go out of his way to be a bastard any more than he does it to be a saint.
    ```

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  I really don't understand your world's geopolitics. Some dynasty a few generations in managed to become the absolute (or at least some highest) authority of the whole planet and have every formerly independent country of any note swear realty to them, all without the use of force or even an overwhelming threat of such use? And kept it for decades despite being known to see armed conflict as a last resort even in the face of being threatened with the loss of its monopoly of violence? Why did not a single territory of notable size go "we'd rather make all our decisions more locally and would be willing to right for that"?

  Also, the army numbers seem tiny. The legal military of literally the whole world can't even defeat an army of less than 100,000 soldiers. That's less than Poland's active military.

  Then we have that the top General talks about enemy forces close to their cities, but isn't that always the case, globally speaking? 

  The only thing that would explain all this is if the world is literally so depopulated that, combined with instant information exchange and quick transportation, it simply makes sense to administrate the whole planet as if it were a medium sized country. Civilization got decimated so much that Furry's nation of origin was pretty much the only place that still had its shit together to the point where most of the rest of the world flocked to being part of an actually functional government and there actually aren't that many places on the globe that deserve to be called a city. Also real estate is so abundant that if people say "this here spot is mine and mine alone to rule and exploit the resources of" no one actually cares as long as people are allowed to leave the place and no horrendous crimes reach the wider public.

  But even then it seems like a weird world if everyone ceded power to a hereditary monarchy sometimes on the other side of the planet just in the last century or so and yet said King doesn't answer to any kind of federal council or permanent guarantees of autonomy or whatever.
  ```

  - u/Flavius_Belisarius_:
    ```
    I mean, I’m pretty sure there are only five major cities portrayed in canon, so saying the world is severely depopulated makes sense. It would also help to think of the political situation as one more similar to China or Japan than that of Europe, where unification is the goal and the former kingdoms had little difference culturally. Even so, the king doesn’t seem to actually rule all of the world directly, the Ox Kingdom would have to be at least mostly autonomous for the events occurring in canon to take place.

    The military situation isn’t outlandish either. Given a much smaller, sparsely populated world, it makes sense its active military would be quite small. The US directly prior to WWI had a population of 100 million, but a standing army of less than a hundred thousand. This wasn’t even during a truly peaceful time, as it was currently dealing with military raids from across the Mexican border, which was in a civil war. If the world here has a smaller population than that, it stands to reason their military wouldn’t be all that large either.

      > the Ox Kingdom would have to be at least mostly autonomous for the events occurring in canon to take place

      Earlier in my story, Pilaf mentions that he expects the Ox King to be still loyal to his dynasty. The Ox Kingdom broke off after Daimao Piccolo's war, as they didn't acknowledge the new king, and was independent ever since.

    A few things - given that yes, it *is* a bit of a weird world because I still need to operate within the constraints of what Toriyama defined, and the Red Ribbon always was a pretty weird organisation to even exist.

    First, yes, it's not a very populated world. Canonically the setting is mostly modelled on China, really, which makes sense since the original inspiration was "Journey to the West". So, you have some big cities with a lot of population and then vast, vast, *vast* rural areas of low population density and with comparatively little centralised state control. 

    Second, it's not a very militarised one. The Piccolo wars put the end to one era, breaking up the world into smaller fiefdoms, and the kingdom that was born after that, the Corgi's, slowly reunited the world under its control throughout the following centuries, a process that's almost complete at this point. As you pointed out, even compared to the population, the numbers are tiny; but that's because there never was a big push for a major military. The RDF is more of a militarised police force than a true army; it never had to fight anything *remotely* as big as another kingdom of the same size of the one that supports it. On the other hand, the Red Ribbon is somewhat of a mix of a mercenary army and a paramilitary organisation, like the kind that the most powerful crime syndicates could field. It grew in the (vast) spaces of lawlessness in between the areas more tightly controlled by the government.

    I think your description is more or less what I imagined. Add to that that the entirety of the world's habitable land is basically only one single continent in the Northern Hemisphere, a bit like if Eurasia was all there was to ours. [This](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/4/47/Dragonball_world_map_by_0some_weirdguy0-d4qonuq.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120424171225), for reference, is the map I'm using. The Desert Fox Den would be approximately at the centre of this map, south of the Capitol and east of West City.

    The cession of power wasn't always entirely peaceful (the next chapter will mention one example...), but in general it was mostly due to economic pressures - it's hard to go it alone while surrounded by a foreign kingdom when the size difference is so massive. If you're offered the chance to join, and the other government isn't especially oppressive or anything, it makes sense you might accept.

    That's more or less the best I could come up with to reconcile both what we know of the Dragon World's history and what we know of its present politics (namely: there is only one King, there is an army, which in fact we see fighting the Saiyans, Cell and Majin Boo later, and yet there also is the Red Ribbon running amok). Of course it's not perfect, but with those constraints, I'm not sure how it could have been made more believable.
    ```

      > it's hard to go it alone while surrounded by a foreign kingdom when the size difference is so massive

      But that's only true after the World Kingdom has grown to the size of at least 50% of inhabited territory. How did it swallow other countries before that to even get to a point where tiny holdouts have to choose between gentle submission and economic isolation?
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        It got a head start, the world already was unified *before* Piccolo's war, Piccolo just caused it to break up a few pieces, but the Corgi's original kingdom was still probably something like 70% of all land or so. The culture was already unified to begin with, so there weren't strong identitarian resistances. And I didn't say explicitly Furry's whole *dynasty* was always 100% peaceful, though it generally strongly preferred diplomatic means over war. Furry himself never waged wars of annexation, but by the time he took the throne, the world was already massively unbalanced.
        ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Whoa that map is tiny. First time I ever saw it. Is the rest of the planet an ocean spanning more than half of it, or is it just a tiny planet?
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Not sure. Gravity should be approximately the same as on our Earth, so I guess it's just one big ocean.
        ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      It's actually quite a reasonable way of explaining the situation, and I like it.

      You are right in saying that it was a lot like old-school China.  In this case, there also used to be many fiefdoms of warlords who might oppose the central authority, but so long as they weren't too close or weren't too extreme or expansionist about it, there'd be little reason for the small central army to do anything about them.  And if they got out of hand fast enough, it might not even be possible.

      Enter the Red Ribbon army, which as a mercenary organization could be hired to fight against the warlords by the common people or by other warlords.  It's effectively profiting enough to do a 'world police' job, but as long as it doesn't threaten to attack, eclipse, or conquer the 'normal' army, it's permitted as it allows the central government to spend more time governing rather that fighting wars.  All the while the warlords become *less* powerful proportionally due to losses and the RR's growth over time.

      The existence of it would keep the warlords more-or-less in check...  At least until a super-powerful alien comes and conquers all the warlords and unites them into a single force.  Then the balance of power is broken horribly.  Red Ribbon becomes more unified, as does the central army, but it doesn't matter too much when you have Dragonball power-level bad guys who honestly don't care.

      But once the alien warlord has conquered the others himself gets vanished, well, the warlords are functionally done, leaving only the Red Ribbon (now partially without purpose) and the central authority.  It's no surprise the Red Ribbon would begin to factionalize, as they'd have to find new purpose for the organization (the Instruments) or would have to slowly guide it in its decline until its members could acclimate to new lives and jobs (Black's plan).  It would still do individual mercenary work, but its income would be kneecapped unless it turned to crime.  And if it did that as an entire organization, it would be an enemy to the world government.

  Finally, I've been waiting so long for this.  
  Very good chapter as usual.  
  Where did you get Zeeman, Pitt, Liu, etc. names?  
  I hope next one will be released a bit faster.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Just random themed names I picked. For Zeeman I was thinking of the [Zeeman effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect). For Pitt, it was [Pitt the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt,_1st_Earl_of_Chatham) and [the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger), famous British Prime Ministers. For Liu, I don't think it was anyone specific - just a common Chinese name I guess :D.
