## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Working on some new dragons for a D&D campaign, players be warned, spoilers ahead.

  All dragons have a demiplane with them, linked to their dragonheart. They can go in and out of the demiplane nearly at-will (unsure on what kind of restrictions there are on this), but in order to pull something in or push something out, they need some kind of ritualistic or engineered magical solution.

  A dragon's early life is marked by doing a lot of normal dragon things, like stealing sheep and raiding villages, but as they get older, they tend to rely on and expand their demiplane more and more, until eventually the great elder dragons have an entirely self-sufficient space, hundreds of miles across, with all the food they could ever want, and usually a population of captured people, some of whom are so many generations removed from the real world that they have no idea it even exists.

  The aging of dragons, in relation to their habits and demiplane:

  * Wyrmling: Hunts creatures, sleeps in a cave or the woods, sometimes antagonizes civilized folks, inhospitable and tiny demiplane primarily used for emergency retreat.
  * Juvenile: Starts pulling rock, soil, air, and water into their demiplane through planar circles built away from prying eyes, still primarily eats through hunting/pillaging but spends a lot of time in the demiplane, especially once it's been seeded with enough plants that the air is permanently breathable (or they've used the planar circle to steal enough air).
  * Adult: beginnings of a well-developed demiplane with lots of land, some inevitably pulled in from the elemental planes or other places where enormous quantities of materials won't be missed, sometimes by temporary attaching the demiplanar to those planes rather than the prime material. Initial kidnappings usually happen now, but they might happen earlier in isolated ways. Typically an adult dragon will be drifting toward making their demiplane able to fully support them. Magic is often used in the pursuit of this, especially to lower the demands of meat/plant consumption.
  * Wyrm: Almost all the dragon's time is spent in the demiplane, with the exception of quests for relics or attempts at finding a mate (which can be quite difficult give that wyrms spend so much of their time in demiplanes, hidden from both the world and each other).

  I was thinking about this for yet-another-dragon-variant, since I like to play on the classics. I think it's got a lot that I like, such as hiding dragons away to make them more rare and mysterious, and giving them a proper, interesting "hoard" (accessed by others via the dragonheart?). Plus I don't think that I've seen it done before, and I have an abiding love of demiplanes.

  In theory, the players can be introduced to this particular variety of dragons through an multi-session questline that starts with some mysterious disappearances, leads to a criminal crew that's been hired on to enact those kidnappings, and eventually leads to the dragon herself, who has orchestrated the whole thing and converted the basement of a large building into a planar processing center (still working through the specifics of this). Dragons being quite rare, this means that the players are uncovering a secret of the world at the same time.

  **Thoughts or interesting things to add?**

  There are some conceptual problems that come from having demiplanes, like where the light comes from, or how the air doesn't just dissipate, or what's beyond the bounds of the area, but that's nothing that can't be solved with "it's magic" (though I would like more interesting answers to those questions, if possible, especially if those answers can include plot hooks or clues to the true nature of dragons).

    There is no light in the wyrmling plane, nor the early juvenile. The mass the dragon can generate and/or steal into the demiplane (per second) scales up along with the square of its own body mass. When a sufficient quantity of hydrogen has been absorbed, a self-sustaining fusion reaction births a small demistar, providing light and heat and allowing for plant seeding and an oxygen/water cycle. Most wyrmlings die before this happens, and once dragons reach this state they're on easy street.

    Also, that's how they breathe fire--an internal portal to the demisun's emissions.

    Also, of course, our universe is itself the demiplane of the biggest known dragon, Yahweh.

    Or not, obviously! I do think it's a very cool idea.

    > There are some conceptual problems that come from having demiplanes, like where the light comes from

    Have you already solved the "where does light in dungeons come from?" problem? It could be the same answer. I usually include a "sunstone" mineral that catalyzes an [ambient magic + C02 => light + O2 + soot] reaction. This lets there be breathable air and light for plants down below, so you can have dungeon denizens and weird underground jungles. If you have an equivalent idea, dragons could just steal loads of sunstone to light their demiplanes.

    > or how the air doesn't just dissipate

    I always thought a demiplane was a closed space. The air diffuses to the size of the demiplane, then maintains whatever pressure that is. If the demiplane is expanding, you'd be constantly losing air pressure, but that's just another thing a dragon can solve by stealing (air).

    > or what's beyond the bounds of the area

    It's a closed space, so nothing. Some options for what to do at the boundary:

    * There is no boundary, because it's curved in N+1 dimensional space, and wraps on itself as a hypersphere. I think this is what most people think of when they think of a wrapped space. But actually picturing how you navigate the surface of a hypersphere is a bear though.

    * Curved in N*2 dimensional space, wraps on itself as a hypertorus. This is the one where space appears to repeat itself infinitely in each dimension. 

    * Wall. Probably has a color like true black, perfectly diffuse white, or mirrored.

    * Invisible wall. Beyond the wall is an illusion of similar-looking contents to the plane itself. But it's not actually there.

    > clues to the true nature of dragons

    You could also discard everything I just said, and make the boundary of the plane be endless dragonfire. Solves the lighting problem, explains where the dragon gets its fire from.

    Some thoughts:

    The dragons seem to be trying to create a personal demiplane that is reflective of the material plane.

    The material plane is a combination of the various elemental planes and outer planes, so depending on the dragon's ideal, they could perform persisting rituals that would "pull" energy/laws/concepts of the Planes into their demiplane.

    They could be lazy and just pull the "finished" version of the laws directly from the material plane (and they likely will initially as a juvenile), but elemental planes are less populated, less likely to be disturbed/noticed, and allow for better customization.

    I would imagine these persisting rituals to "drain" the area near them. In the material plane, these rituals would make materials more crumbly, the air thinner, gravity weaker, light dimmer, etc.  Things that enter slowly become diminished versions of themselves, but things that leave will slowly restore to their relatively normal versions. It would basically be stealing the energy of an area in the material plane to fuel the demi-plane. Without personal protection, these rituals would be relatively easy to disrupt.

    In the elemental planes, it would be able to be tailored to be much more specific and with much less concern of sentients. It's still similar to an "it's magic" answer, but things would continue to persist in the demiplane because they are being conceptually solidified by the energy/concepts stolen with the rituals.

    For plot hooks, it would probably have to be a younger dragon that is still learning the ropes or a dragon that is less in control of their desires. Their persisting ritual is too noticeable, and they are constantly defending it. A dragon decides that setting up a ritual where a population currently lives is worth the trouble. An impatient dragon kidnaps people and forces them to help them make the demiplane (that they now live in) sustainable or die. A young dragon has gotten a decent demiplane going but now desires a hoard that includes talented people and royal blood.

    What's beyond the bounds of the area?

    Depends on planar mechanics, I guess.  It could just be an unbreakable boundary. The boundary could push into nothing/the void/ethereal plane/astral plane/weirdness/unreal space/generic demiplane space and create more demiplane. The dragon would have to make more or expand existing rituals to support more demiplane.

    I'm not really sure if it is ever explained where demiplanes are, even in the demiplane spell.

  So, a game where the world moves itself to make it interesting for you. I'm thinking of scifi, and these examples will be very star-warsy to have something to work off of for now.  
  So, you could be a sith, a bounty hunter, a rebel leader, an aristocrat, a smuggler, etc.  
  The world would move in ways that provide an interesting experience consistent with that character. A smuggler (especially one with a 'heart of gold'), is far more likely to get events like someone sneaking on their ship who is running from bad people. A sith is likely to get opportunities to commit acts that play into their usual anger issues, and get the opportunity to get an apprentice.  
  Other aspects of the world would also work for them. If you were to steal from the mafia, then instead of getting shot you might get recruited or rescued at the last moment. You could still die, but you have an absurd amount of plot resistance to it.  
  So, you have this world that bends itself over to give the players an interesting experience, and you go for the "all the players get transported into this universe permanently".  
  The players would run into the issue - once they realize this is a legitimate universe and that these probably aren't just NPCs - that some of them would not want to continue what they were doing. Most of the people playing sith-lord wouldn't want to *actually* go around killing people for fun.   
  Yet the 'game' (or whatever is influencing it now, doesn't really matter) still puts them in scenarios that reflect their choice of class. Even after your bounty hunter has tried switching to being an accountant, they still get strange and interesting offers in the mail. Etcetera.  
  So, essentially they influence plot to emerge and include them, but while they certainly get tropes they aren't completely influenced by them. Ex: It isn't interesting for the 'player' if they become a mentor and then die because of that usual trope. They can still get heavy downsides, but the aim is to be interesting to the game players (but may be less interesting/enjoyable to the players in the actual world that runs on this).  
  Any thoughts? Common sci-fi character-types? Ways to try to abuse/avoid the 'plot'? Perhaps, what would you attempt to do to study the behavior of the 'plot'?
  ```

    ```
    The biggest point of interest is what would happen when two players come into conflict.
    Alone, a player can choose to do almost anything, regardless of class, because the world would try its best to make sure they always have the option to do their class thing in the future. As long as they don't do anything blatantly suicidal, they will get out OK.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      > The biggest point of interest is what would happen when two players come into conflict.

      If I was designing this game, I'd try to have a library of cliche plotlines for each combination of classes that might bump into each other up to some size. So a smuggler, an aristocrat, and a rebel leader meet, and it pulls events from a pool for that 3-tuple, rather than from each individually. If the max size is 3, it'd pick three characters at random from a group and pull a plot based on their classes.

      With just the examples listed above and only going 3 people deep, that's already 125 combinations. You probably want more than one plot for each of those, and it expands horribly with more classes, even worse considering more people. One big corner worth cutting is doing fewer variants of 4-person events than 3-person, more of those than 2-person, and more of those than solo.

      And then this leads to how I'd suggest /u/Missing_Minus could abuse such a system. Figure out there's only one variant at 4-person events, start trying to force different ones, and find the most beneficial or at least least murdery plot among those. Then when you find out the only plot it knows for a sith, a bounty hunter, and two rebel leaders is a redemption arc where nobody gets killed, those four stick together and avoid anyone else with a character class.
