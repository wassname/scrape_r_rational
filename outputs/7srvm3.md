    They're going to sit down for a drink and bond over having sweet magic like simulacrums and transcontinental portals and stuff.  QI will tell them Ulquan Ibasa and they'll probably come to some common ground.

    Then Zorian will convince QI to be his new tutor, so he can have the full set of "you got *who* to teach you *what*?"

            If you don't find the fleshing out of a millennium old archmage interesting, I don't know what to tell you---especially given the amount of world building that this story usually has going on in the background. I find pretty much all of Zorian's teachers intriguing and they're merely normal aged.

                i'd argue a generic lich is merely a lich with a back story that hasn't been sufficiently fleshed out. Anyone who has lived a life that is simultaneously highly academic, aggressively power-seeking, *and has a built-in resurrection point* is likely to have a compelling story.

                Actually, it wasn't that he'd kill them -- they were worried that he'd demote them and otherwise humiliate them. Ibasan leadership are more fond of executions, but QI is a "General Mattis" among the Ibasan forces present.

                Again, as far as I'm aware. I could be 100% wrong.

            I mean, he's literally a candidate for the greatest (arch)mage alive (well, you know what I mean haha) and probably up there on the list of GOATs given hes lived for millenia and literally outlasted gods themselves 

            Incidentally, because of his unique perspective (age, experience, tendency to treat ordinarily mortal threats cavalierly, soul expertise, etc) hes one of the few people who can truly relate to Z&Z (the immortals such as silver Lake are probably the next closest)
            ```

    - u/silver7017:
      ```
      I am aware that you are joking, but it would actually be a really good (and more importantly, reliable) way to short circuit what would otherwise be an ungodly amount of effort and which isn't even guaranteed to work every time even once they do get it right. it would also be the ultimate capstone to the whole "unreasonable teachers" theme, the only thing I can think of which could top Silverlake. it also might be the only way for Zorian to actually survive. I fully expect him to effectively be a lich given what sorts of soul jumping and body snatching abilities he will need to steal the original's body, if that ends up being what is waiting for him on the outside.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        I find it unlikely that QI would tutor adversarial mages . . .

        BUT I can imagine it. Maybe for all his vileness, he's still a scholar and gentlelich. Having lived for nearly a millennium, unique individuals like ZZ are actually a delight in his eyes.

        Maybe he used mind magic on one of ZZ's allies and learned about the loop and that the end is nearing. Rather than try to get into the loop by doing experimental stuff with his all-important soul (or maybe to give him time to do such experimenting), he attempts to convince ZZ that he'd find it really entertaining to help them and teach them. Maybe one of his hobbies is teaching precocious young necromancers---private tutoring can be incredibly rewarding for the teacher. :D

        After all, he did let RR hang out with him.

          >Maybe for all his vileness, he's still a scholar and gentlelich.

          What do we know of him that's genuinely vile? I'm really asking, my recollection is kinda weak (time for a re-read!). 

          Alanic clearly finds lichdom vile in general, but he's likely very biased. 

          Now, I would find it unlikely for QI to turn out to be an ethical soul mage of some description, but he might be an "evil" soul mage without being actively malicious.
          ```

          - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
            ```
            I believe in MoL, being a necromancer/soul mage generally involves a lot of morally bankrupt research practices---live test subjects, etc.

            Edit: Sorry, triple post.

            - u/xachariah:

              I think it only requires you to be able to cast simulacrum and to anchor your soul to an object.  Simulacrum was explicitly mentioned as being already halfway there.  

              The story so far with Zorian creating simulacrums and then linking them to golems seems like he's basically building a lich body.  Combine that with the soul trap (for just yourself, not millions of souls), and you've got 99% of what makes up a lich without ever doing anything immoral.
              ```

              - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
                ```
                Sure, but again generally those disciplines *do* involve questionable practices. How many scruples do you think QI had when finding souls to practice soul magic on? Zorian has soul sight and knows enough soul magic to defend and examine his own soul, but offensive soul magic is an entirely different bag of tricks.

                QI is a master soul mage. What kind of practice do you think attaining that level of skill entails? I can envision capturing people just to pick apart their souls slowly to better understand how souls work. How did Zorian get so good at kind magic? Unfortunately, a portion of his skill comes from a few months of pulling apart the minds of countless aranea, yes to steal their knowable but also afaik for practice.

                And then we're also talking about QI who starts wars willy nilly. I'm not saying he's *completely* deranged---he clearly has his own thoughts on morality---but I doubt he took the "do no harm" pathway to mastery.

                But who knows . . . ? Well, I can think of one person who might . . . :P
                ```

              - u/3combined:
                ```
                I think perhaps more relevant is that the story starts with the lich casting soul meld on Zorian and Zach. Considering how spells seem to generally need a fair bit of practice to work properly, it's not a stretch to assume he's been involved in some pretty awful experimentation.

                edit: though I've just realised that animals have souls as well, so this isn't really an issue. However, when the murder based soul sight route was mentioned before, no-one seemed to even consider that animals could be used, so there may be some fundamental difference that precludes their use as experimentation subjects.
                ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                > without ever doing anything immoral?

                Where, pray tell, did Zorian learn most of what he knows about necromancy? By thoroughly and forcibly (and illegally) ransacking the mind of Sudomir, who has performed all manner of horrifying experiments.

                And how did he get the skill to do that? Well, it included mind dives that reduced Ibasans to mindless husks, cheating at card games, large-scale unprovoked assaults on aranean webs...

                Zorian bypassed the usual path of highly illegal and immoral soul magic experimentation, by pursuing illegal and arguably immoral mind magic practice.

        While I'm sorta joking, I've been hoping for this for a while.  My posts on this [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7nc4zv/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_79_crime_and/ds0x768/) [chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7nc4zv/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_79_crime_and/ds0ylg8/)

        >Similarly, it seems odd that they haven't tried to use diplomancy on QI at all.  They know it can be done since RR did it, and it would open up huge capabilities for backstabbing QI.  Yes, he is very very very scary, but talking to him is not much more risky than the Aranea mindbreaking Zorian before he learned mind magic or how they're trusting Silverlake right now.  

        >As the Ghost Serpent and Silverlake and the Aranea and literally everyone else they've ever opened up to has mentioned, it is a literally unbeatable tactic.  And unlike the Ghost Serpent who wants nothing they have to offer, QI is making a very desperate and expensive gambit right now and could use all the help he can get.

        ...

        >Quatach-Ichl is also a highly respected, rational, heavily competent leader of a country who has already been shown to treat his subordinates fairly, work with timetravelers, and balance diplomatic concerns.

        >...

        >QI is a big risk, but since they can now reset the time loop instantly or even negotiate via simulacra, he's not much more of a risk. It's probably less of a risk in absolute terms to try to talk to him than to face him in battle.

        I agree with you that diplomacy with QI is the best route to take.  And not just for immediately getting the crown, but for long term success after they escape the sovereign gate too.

        - u/eroticas:

          A lot of what yu've written forgets that QI is a soul mage. Soul modification, damage and death is permanent, doesn't reset through restarts. He could also easily add himself to the time loop, the same way he added Zorian. And all he needs to do to get all the information necessary to do this is to rip open Zack, Zorian, Kael, or Alanics mind, and he's a competent mind mage.

          And now he knows about them. Who knows *how much* he already knows, he could've easily broken into Kael or Alanic's mind *before* this little meeting. The safest move is probably to kill Zach asap and restart the loop.
          ```

    - u/RiOrius:
      ```
      Seems unlikely for this restart, since QI's impression is that they're adversaries, but I could totally see them trying a restart where they attempt to make contact with that intent from the get-go.

      Although considering how much nonsense Siverlake put them through, it would surprise me if the lich king were easier.

      I personally think it isn’t all unlikely. For the last twenty-something chapters I have a feeling Zorian is on a good way to become a necromancer out of the pure practicality of the thing if not in the story itself then probably once it’s over. And with every new chapter I am more and more sure of it.
      While I think Zorian wouldn’t like the thought in the beginning and no idea how lich “apprenticeship” works, it still is something Zorian should (and I think he will) consider. After all, Quatach-Ichl is old and experienced, he had a lot of time to learn something aside from necromancy as well. 

      (Plus no one heard from Kel’thuzad from World of Warcraft for quite some time, and I would really appreciate a snarky lich in my life with a direct approach and a possible cat. So I am entirely opened to having Quatach-Ichl around.)

      Wow, I would love to see this happen. Maybe they could make an arrangement that QI gets the dagger (it was a dagger, right?) afterward. Anyway, if they could befriend the ancient Lich that would make for so many great moments, although I doubt it's going to happen.

        They don't need any of the Keys after they unbar the Gate. They can promise all of the Keys as payment for help in getting the Dagger, once they have them next to the Gate.

          ```
          Unless the artifacts are powerful items in their own right (QI has one maybe for it's special powers?), so giving such a strong enemy a bunch or new  toys that belong to a set . . . seems questionable.

          - u/sicutumbo:
            ```
            If they get out of the time loop, why does it matter? In my hypothetical, Z&Z keep the Keys until they reach the Gate, at which point they tell QI that he can have them. The Gate protects the Controller from outside influence, so if they get it to work at all then it doesn't matter what happens after.
            ```

            - u/Bighomer:

              Your hypothetical lives and dies on the premise that they somehow get QI to agree to this, though:  
              How do they convince QI that they'll give him his crown back, let alone the other artifacts (most of which they don't yet possess)?  
              QI is probably smart enough to not let himself be fooled so easily, so you'd have to entrust a lot of information to him, as well as a guarantee that Z&Z will uphold their end of the bargain *after they leave the time-loop.* This is all kinds of messy and dangerous, given just whom they're dealing with.

              - u/sicutumbo:
                ```
                I may not have made some things clear. For one, don't tell him about the time loop at all. Say they want the Crown and the rest of the Ikosian Artifacts that are also the Keys, and that they need them in the secure research facility, but never why. Tell QI that he will get all the Keys as soon as they are finished. Since they already have one, and generally know where the rest are, they have some credibility.

                Also, he never has to give up his crown. Bring QI in his human guise along with them to the research facility, and use the Crown for unbarring the Gate, and QI never has to give up possession of it.

                If QI already knows about the time loop, then my plan doesn't work at all. But if he doesn't, it might make getting most of the Keys, and especially the Crown and Dagger, much easier.

                  I don't think he knows about the time-loop, or ever did.  
                  It's just the part in which QI plays nice and goes along with Z&Z to the threshold of the Gate that I don't see happening, or ending well.  
                  It's a classic scene, where an alliance breaks right the moment they're about to reach the goal because everyone plans to backstab the other. And that's assuming he does come, he's a pretty important person after all and busy with a big-scale invasion.

            Presumably the traps wouldn't be set up until near the end of the loop before the battle with QI, so at most she could get a day or so of Zach/Zorian in a soul-bottle IF she managed to somehow backstab and kill them. She hasn't shown that capability yet so I think it's premature to be that paranoid about Siverlake's intentions.

              I do think seeing Zorian up close and intentionally looking for how to get into the loop might be successful for QI. However, would QI really be willing to do some potentially highly experimental modifications to his own soul? It depends on the difficulty of the procedure for him, but . . . I'm not sure it's entirely worth it given there isn't *much* time left in the loop. However, I do feel if anyone could make use of that limited time, QI definitely could.

  I feel that many people here are *still* underestimating Quatach-Ichl.

  *First*, consider ending of [chapter 45](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/46/Mother-of-Learning). Sudomir is, I would expect, a much worse soul mage than Quatach-Ichl, but even he was able to notice that Zorian was activating the restart switch fast enough to react. Sudomir's reaction constituted asking a pointless question; Quatach-Ichl could reflexively mangle their souls or something, as soon as he realizes that Zorian is doing something unexpected.

  They're under an immediate threat of multiple-restart or permanent damage.

  *Second*, he accurately determined that Z^Z are working against him. Information-gathering capabilities implied by that would make it trivially easy for him to further identify their associates — such as Alanic, Kael, Taiven. He came to this meeting under a Mind Blank, which may or may not mean that he knows about Zorian's mind magic, but which definitely means that he regards them (two apparent teenagers) as possible archmage-level threats.

  We can expect him to have accurate intel on Z^(Z)'s abilities and associates, and likely associates' abilities as well. Why *wouldn't* he mind-read or torture someone else from their time-loop conspiracy before approaching Zach and Zorian, someone who couldn't protect against him?

  There's a significant possibility that he already knows everything about their plans and about the time loop. Their operation security was laughably lax, in hindsight.

  **tl;dr:** Z^Z are really screwed.
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    You're overthinking it.  In any universe without a time loop, QI is basically invincible and can do basically whatever he wants.  

    If he hears about someone who wants to mess him up, he drops off his crown (so he won't lose it on the .00001% chance if he dies), then rolls up to them and has a talk.  Why?  Because it's the fastest way to get information and they can't do anything to him.

    He doesn't have to look at any other info or check out their associates or anything.  He's 100% assured that they can't hurt him and that he can kill them if he wants, so he just does the obvious thing and goes to see them as soon as he finds out about them.

    And it would work out 100% of the time, if it weren't for the time loop (which he has no reason to suspect).

    Also, he uses mind blank because he's a purely mental/soul entity, so the only thing that can mess him up other than soul magic is mental magic.  He might not even know if Zorian is a mind mage; it's just standard when he has prep-time.
    ```

    - u/I_Hump_Rainbowz:
      ```
      If he learned about them from the devil wasps instead of Silverlake then he would know about the mind magic.
      ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    Yes, so much is right here. If QI found Z^Z, then he may very well have found someone else in the group first and now their plan is utterly open---*including all the information they shared about the time loop*.

    If QI now knows of the loop (or at least seriously thinks it's a possibility), I think there are two approaches he might take:

    1. Feign diplomacy while examining their souls closely for any hint as to how he can piggyback into the loop.
    2. Offer token support in return for cross-loop notebook-style continuity of some sort.

    Assuming he knows, what other options might QI be considering?
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      Try diplomacy. If it's not as successful as he would prefer, subdue and capture them, then spend the rest of restart figuring out the marker and/or modifying their minds to be subservient to him in future restarts. He would probably be able to at least put Zorian into coma (see [the incident with the Sword Divers](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/35/Mother-of-Learning)) and plant a suggestion on Zach to teleport to next-restart!Quatach-Ichl's location as soon as this restart is over, if given a day of work, and then he would have a whole month to himself.

      If he knows about the time loop, the only reason for him to *not* do that is uncertainty regarding the speed at which they could initiate a restart, and possibly regarding their passive defences. Zach's marker already resets the loop automatically if his soul is tampered with. Quatach-Ichl may be worried that Z^(Z) set up similar active defences against mind magic, especially given the discussion about liches' preferences for those in this chapter.

      But as soon as Quatach-Ichl figures out their exact capabilities *OR* realizes they're not going to cooperate *OR* figures out the marker, that would become the best available strategy to him, I think.

      (This is all under the assumption that he is a perfectly selfish agent, mind you. He may be a nice, trustworthy guy, right?)

  I wonder if telling Quatach the truth about Primordials (they aren't actually summoned, and thus won't eventually disappear after a certain amount of time) would get him to change his mind about the ritual?

  Given that he's such an ancient and powerful mage though, I doubt it. He likely already knows. He likely knows (and approves of) the wraith bombs as well.

  Maybe cutting a deal with him (they're both going to be very influential in Eldemar after the time loop) and making necromancy legal would help things out? Opening up trade, perhaps? 

  Edit: Then again, knowledge of primordials is more of a church thing, if you aren't specifically interested in them like Silverlake, and he doesn't get along with them. Plus, he didn't know about the ritual's true purpose (dominating the primorial), and I feel that he's too smart to deliberately unleash a godlike monster that won't simply vanish after a while, even if it can't get to his island.

  Really looking forward to their conversation though.

    That's probably a nonstarter, especially since it's unpopular and the church is still influential. And as gentlemanly as he seems, diplomacy is probably not an option for someone who'd start a war of choice that'd immiserate half the continent.

      > And as gentlemanly as he seems, diplomacy is probably not an option for someone who'd start a war of choice that'd immiserate half the continent.

      Depends on whether he was pressured into the attack by his fellows. He had to protect the vampire girl, despite his dislike of her, after all.

      Maybe his people are starving and desperate, cut off from trade by Eldemar? They live on a Northern Island that is likely very cold (bad farming conditions?) and Eldemar had a naval base watching/blockading them. It's certainly possible this is an attack he's personally behind in order to get revenge on the people who exiled him and made necromancy illegal, but there are other possible motivations.

      He's called off the invasion before, after all. 

      >That's probably a nonstarter, especially since it's unpopular and the church is still influential.

      They've waned greatly in power, and when Zorian assaulted the manor in the Sarokian Highlands, it was pretty explicitly said that Eldemar would keep the soul-trap around so they could experiment.

      It would be a tough sell, but it's possible Zorian could eventually try to open up trade with Ulquan Ibasa. The war was never actually ended between the two countries.

      Bottom line, we don't know what caused the war. Desperation, or simple pride and revenge? I assume we'll find out next chapter.

    I think diplomacy is the only thing that will get them out of this encounter without resetting the loop. With a prepared battlefield, they're unsure that they can get the Crown from QI. Here, QI knew in advance that he was going to talk to two powerful mages, and Z&Z didn't expect or preprare for him at all. Fighting will not end well for either the bar or Z&Z.

    Well, ok, it might end in a fight and without resetting the loop, but not in a positive way.

  So now that I have had a chance to calm down and think about it. Quatach-Ichl just casually tracked down Zorian and Zach to a tavern, with only about a 3 week timeframe.

Not only that he did it without tipping off Zach and Zorian that anything was weird about the loop.

        Sure, but he hasn't been publicly on the continent since Eldemar chased them to that island. Which was over a century ago, I think? I'm pretty sure there's no trade between Ulquan Ibasa and the mainland either.  No one is going to have information locally, certainly not anything they don't already know from fighting him.

        Now, if there was a scene of them interrogating or bribing Ibasans for info, this would make a lot more sense. As is, it just seems like it opens them up to needless risk for no real gain.

    Silverlake has a lot to gain from cooperating with Zorian and Zach (Youth potion ingredients, at the least), and nothing really to gain from Ulquan Ibasa. She's already immortal--why would she risk losing her avenue to eternal youth by pissing the protagonists off?

    I definitely wouldn't be surprised if she screwed them over by escaping the time loop on her own (she's definately leaving coded info in her notes about that), but I don't see how cooperating with Quatach-Ichl would help her do that.

    ...Unless she's giving Quatach info in exchange for access to the primordial's prison, so she can experiment on it each loop. Sounds incredibly risky for her though. She'd have to hide the fact that she's going there from Z&Z, and risk that Quatach would use the info and thus expose her, as well as risking that she'd be betrayed by her new "ally." I guess shes dying at the end of each loop anyway, but it still seems rather pointless.

    She *can't* find the ancient Salamander or get the grey hunter eggs on her own. Her best hope there is to make nice with Z&Z and not give away the recipe, so they gather enough ingredients for a potion for the three of them after the loop ends. She doesn't get that by siding with Quatach.

    FTFY

    Okay, putting aside my new favorite pairing (Quatorian), I am very curious to learn about QI's motivations.

    He has led armies several times before so he's possibly a bit of a warhawk. On the other hand, Eldemar has essentially imposed extremely longterm sanctions on QI's area of residence, so military campaigns may be perfectly reasonable.

    So, QI finds a small group of extremely well-funded mages are poking into his affairs and movements and now wants to meet them. He's powerful enough and has probably watched them form afar for a few days, so he feels safe walking up to them like it's nbd.

    Let's be real though: Under normal circumstances, he might expect to talk work them and learn what's up, end them in an overkill opening salvo leveling the building, then teleport away to have judo afternoon tea. You don't throw a bunch of resources investigating a powerful lich if you want to play patty cakes; he knows these people are probably enemies.

    Given that they're bold enough to investigate QI in the first place---given that they even *know* to investigate QI when the invasion should still be secret---this group may well have ideas on how to defeat a powerful lich. This means that QI may very well regard ZZ and Co. as a serious existential threat. Yes, he may feel safe approaching them in this way by surprise, but QI probably didn't get to be a lich by underestimating possible threats. (The soul coin thing let's admit was a fluke. Who would expect a 16-year-old to have access to such an item?)


    Or he could string them along

    friendly isn't the term you'd want to use probably XD  

    but do remember that it has been mentioned that QI seems to be a very strict but fair leader/commander
    ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  That was a fun surprise.
  ```

- u/melmonella:
  ```
  I know everyone is terrified, but bear with me, I think this is probably the best case scenario for a contact between the dynamic duo and QI. 

  First of all, QI started this conversation in a public place instead of, say, ambushing ZZ in a quiet place outside of Cyoria. This means two things:first, he can find them (as evidenced by him finding them) and second, he would prefer to not fight them. This is probably the least advantageous situation for QI to start fighting: 

  * he can't realistically prepare a battlefield in advance-I doubt ZZ picked some specific tavern instead of a random one, and new massive wards within a populated city full of mages would have been noticed.
  * if he does fight, he loses the invasion-it seems doubtful he could keep his disguise up in a fight, and all it would take is for ZZ to scream about the invasion, or damage his disguise, or teleport to the police station to ruin everything. At best he could try to portray this as a barfight gone bad between three powerful mages, but that still means police investigation *and* would prevent him from using any really powerful magic since that would still point at him.
  * he can't rely on support-QI doesn't trust his mage force much and thus probably wouldn't have told them he is meeting with a powerful third party that those mages could use to one-up QI. He can't use his army either, see previous point. And he can't use his subordinates from the island either, since those would definitely prompt an investigation to see what they were doing in Cyoria.

  On the other hand, ZZ would be just fine to fight here: 

  * Zorian constantly keeps anywhere from 3 to 6 simulacra in different parts of the world that he can instantly communicate with through his soul. Those simulacra, in turn, can do everything zorian can, including teleporting to his allies and making Gates between themselves. This means that all Zorian has to do to get a pretty significant number of allies on the scene in if not moments then minutes is to tell his simulacrums where he is.
  * With their newfound soul defences it seems unlikely that QI could take them down in moments. At the very least it will get to a fight, which already benefits ZZ more than QI. Furthermore, magic such as what QI could use to turn ZZ into his slaves is likely very involved and takes a long time, meaning their allies will arrive on the scene.
  * Any complicated soul magic used on Zach will trigger a loop reset, wherever QI knows it or not. This means that Zach is safe from soul magic while Zorian is probably safe from mental tampering (and can do a Mind Blank himself if push comes to shove). Since it seems doubtful QI would have access to that information, he is at least 50% likely to use a wrong permadeath spell on the wrong person and get either mindraped back (can't use mind magic while your mind blank is up, can you) or just die because the loop reset.
  * ZZ still likely have the orb on them, and using it means getting an instant golem army on the spot, plus possibly other allies they have in there.

  This means that QI is more or less screwed either way. Don't use soul magic-ZZ reset the loop after the conversation. Use soul magic-either reset the loop immediately or get into a fight where ZZ might escape and reset the loop. Try to disable them first before analysing them and using soul magic later-get into an even bigger fight and definitely lose the invasion.

  Because of that, his only venue is diplomacy, which he is trying to do. There are actually some avenues for progress here you might not suspect:

  * QI likely doesn't know that his mages are attempting to control the primordial, or that it is not summoned and as such will not go back to it's cage. Giving him this information might cause him to reconsider the whole invasion plan, as that is a key point in it.
  * QI likely doesn't actually want to invade Cyoria as a terminal goal-war is a continuation of diplomacy by other means, after all. As such, giving him an avenue for diplomacy with the Eldemar other than literally directly invading them will probably serve his goals just as well as the invasion itself, if not better. Eldemar doesn't seem eager to invade his island either, meaning they would also prefer not to fight, wherever church says undead are abominations upon creation or not. That means that some common ground already exists between the two, and some diplomacy might be possible (most likely for the purposes of trading magical research). ZZ can make that significantly easier too, by trading political secrets about Eldemar nobility that would possibly make it easier to convince Eldemar that bringing their whole army down on the undead is a bad idea.

  As such, while I think it'd have been better to not meet QI, this is probably the best case scenario for how it would have happened. Certainly beats him showing up and opening with a soul magic salvo.

  Another idea for QI becomming aware they're targeting him..

  > I think I have something that might help you take down Quatach-Ichl," she said, pulling out a weathered old scroll out of her bag.

  > "Oh?" Zach said eagerly. "Do tell."

  > "It's a trap field that prevents souls from escaping out of the area," Silverlake said, throwing the scroll in his direction. Zach caught it, fumbling slightly with the catch due to not expecting the move. "For undead like Quatach-Ichl, it stops them from leaving until they shut down the ward. If you can lure him into the field, it should give him trouble for a time at the very least.

  QI could have made a number of scrolls like this, with spells usefull in battle against liches, added a listening spell to them, then scattered them around. Maybe even getting this one to Silverlake intentionally (without her knowing he sent it), because he considers her a threat.

  If someone preparing to battle him is doing research on how to defeat him, they would come across a scroll with a spell perfect to use against him - then discuss battling him near the scroll.

  QI just has gets an alert when they move, then listens to stuff happening near them.
  He could also track the scroll's location to find them.

      Granted QI hasn't been shown to be *that* powerful, but then again, it's a genius idea. And considering in some ways QI is basically what Voldemort wishes he could be, and that even Voldy had a similar idea with attaching the Taboo to spoken mention of his name, I can totally see QI doing something like this if it's within the limits of his abilities...

    It really depends on what QI's values are, and what kind of offer/negotiation Z&Z can come up with. It's clear that QI is a rational character, so all Z&Z have to do is make an offer that provides more risk adjusted value to QI than what the invasion would accomplish.

  Now that Red Robe is out of the narrative, it's about time for another loop twist.

  Quatach-Ichl is old enough to have been around during the last time someone was sent into one of these time loops. Like the serpent spirit he may have been able to identify one is, or was, about to happen.

  I think we're about to find out that Quatach-Ichl is trying to escape the loop even though he's not a time traveler. Maybe in order to duplicate his soul or something.

    There's no way QI would help RR join the time loop without getting himself into the time loop as well.

      He *might* help mark someone else, depending on the circumstances. If he didn't want to perform a risky procedure on his own soul, or if he wanted an outside observer to evaluate and refine his own participation in the invasion, or he just wasn't entirely convinced but was willing to take a chance on RR because it wasn't hard for him to do.

      Geas is just one possibility.

  Thinking about this chapter, why do Z&Z need to have the Crown? Yes, the Crown needs to be present when they interact with the Gate, but why do they need to have it? Could they possibly convince QI to help them get the other Keys, and then have him tag along while they go into the Gate, promising all the other Keys as payment once they have unbarred the Gate? It's not like they actually care what happens to the Keys after they've used them for unbarring the Gate, and QI seems smart and selfish. Since Z&Z's goals don't actually directly conflict with QI's, it's possible that they could get him on board to help. Letting him know about the time loop is of course out of the question, but I think it's plausible for QI to get enough benefit that he won't care about the secrets.

    Well, QI is one of the few people in the world that can permanently destroy them. Zach ostensibly was knocked out for many restarts when QI did the initial soul merge. Zorian doesn't even have Zach's "auto-restart on soul tampering" protections, so QI could still permanently maim him.

    I do think Zach should be okay with Zorian poking around in his head at this point. Personally, I'm guessing RR put a deep-seated aversion in Zach's head to avert that sort of thing.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > How have you not tried talking to this fellow before?

    Perhaps because QI is a reasonable, fair, far-sighted, ridiculously competent leader who has apparently decided that he has sufficient cause to burn their city to the ground and unleash an eldritch abomination to kill as much of their continent as possible?

    How can they negotiate with that, when he's already thought things through? What positive *or* negative incentives can they hold out, when he's more powerful than the two of them combined despite the loop? Why take the risk of even trying, when he has mastered one of the few skill sets that can pose a real danger to them?

    I don't expect them to walk away from this "negotiation" without a loop reset. Let's just hope QI doesn't whip out a diabolus ex machina and block that ability.
    ```

- u/xeroxedechidna:
  ```
  The end is especially interesting because of his lack of scruples. Even if Zorian and Zach perfectly avoid giving anything about the time loop away, he can just force it out of Kael or take some other people hostage. Remember that soul magic has a permanent effect in this loop, so he has the power to effectively remove anybody from the loop even if they can be reset when the loop ends.

  They need to effectively string him along without giving him control regardless of whether they let him in on the loop.
  ```

  - u/SpeculativeFiction:
    ```
    > Remember that soul magic has a permanent effect in this loop

    I don't think that's actually true. The "Soul-Kill" spell Red mage used is something that just removes people from the Sovereign gate's list of things to remake each loop.

    It was mentioned somewhere in story that if souls were actually being brought back, people's reserves and control would increase immensely over time, and would be very noticeable. People who ran into soul-magic using mages or monsters would show up dead/insane at the beginning of the loop, and that would accumulate over time with all the butterflies the protagonists brought up.

    Hell, the invasion of Cyoria likely has at least a few soul-magic spells thrown around each loop, given that Ulquan Ibasa is a haven for necromancers. Even if it was just one per loop, that would build up over the decades Zach has been around.

    Zach has traveled around finding and beating up necromancers and Liches over the time loop. Many of those are infamous for experimenting on people with soul magic. If people were perma-killed or driven insane through the loop, they would have to find new victims to work on each month.

    >"I doubt he can," Zorian said. "I don't think the spell actually kills souls. I think it simply marks them in some way, letting the time loop mechanism know it should not recreate them at the beginning of the new restart. If the time loop is, as the Ghost Serpent believes, some kind of training mechanism, then it makes sense to include a function like that into it. It allows the Branded One to get rid of impassable obstacles by removing them from the loop entirely."

    TL;DR: Soul magic likely doesn't transfer over for anyone who isn't a time traveler.
    ```

  - u/silver7017:
    ```
    soul magic is reset at the end of each loop for anyone who isn't a time traveler. the only reason red robe was able to permanently remove anyone was that he had access to time loop specific abilities.
    ```

  - u/Rayuu:
    ```
    That isn't how I remember it?
    Yeah, soul magic is dangerous as fuck to Zorian specifically, because any alterations to his soul risk fucking up his soul marker, but everyone else is destroyed and reconstructed back again in the start of the loop no matter what the damage is, and Zach is basically immune to someone with no prior knowledge of the Sovereign's Gate self-defense mechanism barring a lot of bad luck.

    I think the most dangerous thing is the fact that apparently Quatach-Ichl just apparated from fucking Eldemar or whatever to the Xiotic region in a very small time-frame, after getting information that Z n' Z were asking about him on the other side of the continent. Like holy fuck how.
    ```

- u/Green0Photon:
  ```
  Just had the thought: was QI around during the last time loop? If so, could he have been the person who got looped, or added and escaped like Zorian?

  Also, the loop now was supposed to be a month later. What if QI kept thinking the loop was about to happen, and wanted to start out from a position of strength? He could know that he might not like whoever's looping, and needs to make sure he'll be ok, but instead kinda got caught with his pants down.
