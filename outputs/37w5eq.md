## [D] [Q] How would a rational character in a D&D 3.5 fic best use his abilities (listed in text, some rules savvy is needed)

> Improved Spellcasting (Ex): When casting paladin spells, a Mystic Fire Knight can treat her caster level as equal to one-half her paladin level +2. If she also has arcane spellcasting ability from another class, she can add her caster level from that class to this value to determine her paladin caster level.

> 
> Magical Training (as a wizard): Grants him a spellbook with 3 0th lvl wizard spells that he can prepare and cast as a wizard.
> 
> Precocious Apprentice: Grants him a 2nd level spell he can cast at a penalty until he can naturally cast 2nd level spells
> 
> Sword of the Arcane Order: Allows him to prepare Arcane spells that he has access to in his Paladin spell slots

(CHARACTERNAME) has the following spells prepared on a given day: 

[Ghost Sound](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/ghostSound.htm)

[Prestidigitation](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/prestidigitation.htm)

[Dancing Lights](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/dancingLights.htm)

[Silent Image](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Silent_Image)

[Protection from Evil](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Protection_from_Evil)

[Minor Image](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Minor_Image)

To all outside appearances, (CHARACTERNAME) is a Paladin, and should, to the casual to intermediate observer, not be able to cast illusion magic, therefore wizardly debunking is off the table, for the most part.

What are some creative, rational, and nonlethal ways in which (CHARACTERNAME) could use these spells and his presence as a Paladin to subvert or defeat a wide variety of opponents? Especially include creative, innovative, and unique uses of illusory magic.

tldr: Help me break non-suspect illusion magic in the D&D 3.5 Universe

EDIT: (CHARACTERNAME) is aware of scientific study to the equivalent of magical Renaissance Spain or Italy.

  Got this from HPN20, but: Silent Image and Minor Image can be reused, as long as nothing distracts you from maintaining it. Just have it "show" the "image" of something really small on your person, until you need it again. There's literally no reason to dismiss it.

  (Unfortunately, this doesn't work with Ghost Sound.)

  Prestigitation lasts an hour, and it's pretty versatile. So every time you cast it, you're a minor miracleworker for an hour. It can "slowly lift" a pound of nonliving material, which I *think* can deal damage when it falls even though the spell itself can't deal damage. It could also be used to fake pretty much anything "crude, artificial and delicate", or which could be passed off as such. Also, it can colour living things, for what that's worth (which is a fair bit), although it wears off. 

  There are a fair few tricks you can pull with Prestigitation, actually; might be worth seeing if you can find a pre-made list of them.

  Dancing Lights explicitly mimics a torch or lantern, so it's pretty much designed for leading enemies astray or faking troop movements/distractions at night.

  Anyway, the big one: you can use the *Image* spells to fake ... pretty much anything about you. Just stand inside the image. However, I'm not sure how this interacts with the *Bluff* skill if you're in a D&D-rules 'verse.

    Unfortunately, Silent Image is limited to the size of the effect ((4 + level) 10ft cubes), so you can't carry it with you very far.

    re: falling damage, a one pound object deals 1d6 per 70 feet fallen, but Prestidigitation has a range of only 10 feet, so you'd have to start over a cliff or something.

    Also, the last one doesn't work because "Figments cannot make something seem to be something else." (PHB p173)
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      I just now realize that's ambiguous, but I think the "size of the effect" just refers to the largest object you can "create", not the range (which is 400 ft. + 40 ft./level, and centered on the caster.)

      Drat, you're right about falling damage. You could drop magic items on someone, maybe? And yeah, I guess the rules preclude that use of the *Image* spells because ... reasons. (You could wear an illusory uniform, though.)
      ```

      - u/Uncaffeinated:
        ```
        The reason I interpreted it that way is because it says

        > "You can move the image within the limits of the **size of the effect.** "

        > "Effect:	Visual figment that cannot extend beyond four 10-ft. cubes + one 10-ft. cube/level (S)"
        ```

      - u/derefr:
        ```
        > And yeah, I guess the rules preclude that use of the Image spells because ... reasons.

        Mostly because it makes it such that illusion magic is effectively more useful than some of the higher-level "real" spells.

        Which is a problem if you *want* those real spells in your world-setting. I always just thought it would be cool to have a setting where illusions are the *only* "magic" in the worldâ€”but where they have no nonsensical restrictions.
        ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  A silent image is like a Wall of Stone in a 1st level spell slot: They both do the same thing, stop line of sight and people from moving from point a to point b, and if you use it on the right targets (ie, ones who aren't going to try to break through 5 feet of solid rock), it's just as good.
  ```
