## [BST] I'm in a dilemma. My very genre defies rationality.

### Post:

I like my fiction to be rational. I really do. One of my favourite book series ever is ASOIAF, because when characters do stupid things, the plot comes back to bite them in the ass at least temporarily.

*But*, and this is a heavy but, my favourite genre (which happens to be the genre of my original WIP) is one that defies rationality. Magical realism isn't supposed to be rational. Irrational things are *supposed* to happen. Blood is supposed to flow across a street and dodge the furniture and end up at a grandmother's feet. My main character is supposed to drop into a flower's dream and wake up and move on and the world is supposed to keep turning.

It's hard. It's really hard to write this. But I don't think I can write it any other way.

Basically, do you think it's possible to inject rationality into a fairy tale world *that's explicitly written in a fabulist style*? Because I'm drowning without it.

  In short? No.

  Okay, let me back up a little. "Magical realism" has a lot of definitions, some of which contradict each other. But if you specifically mean magical realism in the sense that there are unexplained things going on which aren't given due examination, then I think that's a genre directly opposed to rational fiction. It's the opposite of "sane and consistent". (This is totally fine for that kind of fiction, it's just not rational.)

  Now, some other definitions of magical realism I think you can do as "rational". If you mean "magical realism" as "the supernatural contextualized as mundane" that's totally doable; you can write a story with werewolves and vampires as just part of everyday life, following distinct rules but not surprising to anyone or remarked on as strange. But I've always thought of that as "weak" magical realism.

  I would welcome some counterexamples of "rational" magical realism though, if anyone has them.

    Yes, I specifically mean traditional magical realism (for lack of a better phrase). The genre of One Hundred Years of Solitude, like I alluded to in my post. It's supposed to be insane. It's supposed to be inconsistent. I'm just trying to find some rules, however loose, to restrain the damn thing and give me some peace of mind. 

    It's hard because I know the moment I start explaining things the story is out of the genre and on its way to plain fantasy. Like the example you gave *would* be cheating - in a traditional magical realist book vampires and *werewolves* in particular would not exist. A character who eats raw bloody meat and growls and howls and can pick out the stranger in town by scent, yes, but once they're described as a being other than plain human that forms special pack dynamics then you've broken the mundanity.

      One Hundred Years of Solitude was batshit insane. Beautiful, but insane. Wonderful dreamlike logic.

      Let's say it runs on dream-logic or story-logic.  What's the logic of a dream, or a story?  Well, there's psychology to this: for one thing, the logic of a dream is often a lot like the way we *really* model the world, but with our ability to use priors turned-off (Yvain once posted an article on that).  So things that have absurdly low genuine probabilities but high likelihoods when priors are set to uniform 1 could happen in dreams.

  From my perspective, my favorite part of rational fiction is that characters show good habits of thought (all definitions on the sidebar are, after all, just one guy's opinion). This can absolutely be done in magical realism - things can still be magical and unexplained, it's just a matter of being sensible about them.

  If peoples', say, cats are disappearing mysteriously, the typical rationalist story focuses on finding an explanation. But suppose that you have characters who are very sensibly trying to find an explanation, but no explanation is to be had, and so that part of their story must end with defeat and ambiguity. Can that still be magical realism? (I'm reminded of [House](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3hm7sh/bst_im_in_a_dilemma_my_very_genre_defies/cu8mvuw) of Leaves.)

  Or suppose a person wants to achieve a thing, like escaping from small-town Quebec to move to the city where their older sister is, and mysterious and metaphorical events happen along the way. And further suppose that as a condition of the story, the character cannot be appropriately shocked or sidetracked by all this magic. Then still, your character can show good habits of thought, e.g. can ask "what do I want, what do I have, and how can I use the latter to get the former?", so long as they do it in mundane contexts.

  Wildblow's "Pact" actually does this fairly well. There aren't "rules" in the classic science sense, but there is a logic, and you can learn how to work in that world.

  [Spoiler](/s "The whole world is basically a show for the spirits, so what they're convinced of, goes. Basically.")

  So yeah, I tots think you can. Think about chaotic social situations. Plenty of irrational things happening! But you can still act rationalist. You can still try, and, arguably, full-on bayesian rationality is the only form that'll really work, since it's the one that inherently recognizes probabilities - in other words, that a set of causes are some degree of likely / unlikely to result in the same effects.
  ```

- u/TwoMcMillion:
  ```
  On the other hand, you could potentially use a story like this a *deconstruct* the rationalist ethos: you could argue that the universe inherently defies human comprehension, and that even if humans were capable of comprehending the workings of reality it would be better for us not to. That's somewhat like the Lovecraftian outlook, but I don't think a story like that has to be depressing.

  I may or may not be working on a project along those lines.
  ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  From a rationalist perspective, the only difference between magical realism and regular fantasy is how far away the explanation is.  The story I've written that I'm proudest of (which I'm not putting on Reddit or any connected accounts) blurs the line between the two, by having events initially appear unexplained, but gradually make more and more sense over the course of the novel - as though Hagrid's "yer a wizard, Harry" reveal occurred during the third act of Harry Potter rather than the first.  Therefore, it shouldn't be that hard to do rationalist magical realism - the explanation for the events just needs to be beyond anything a rationalist could uncover during the course of your story.
  ```

  I think the main concern of rationality is that your world must be internally consistent. Inexplicable things can happen, but they should always causally follow from the same source, whether it be a godlike entity driving the show or the power of magic. Leave as little room for coincidence as possible.
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    So anything is rational as long as the preface states there's an omnipotent actor acting on a whim? Since that makes anything internally consistent.
    ```

    - u/eniteris:
      ```
      One: the godlike entity need not be omnipotent. If they are shown to have powers, ensure that they stick to those powers. No introducing new powers as you go along. Characters can try to evade the powers based off limitations of power.

      Two: The characters should, in some way, interact with the godlike entity, and preferably find a way to use its power for themselves. If you can't interact with god, by Occam's Razor it doesn't exist.
      ```

  > Irrational things are *supposed* to happen.

  Rationality is not an attribute of things that happen. It is an attribute of people. Do people just accept that magic works in mysterious ways, or do they try to predict it? Whenever it stops feeling like quantum randomness and starts feeling mysterious, that just means that it started looking predictable. You just know it's going to dodge this next piece of furniture just like it dodged all the previous ones. Perhaps the world is supernatural and things happen on a mental level rather than a reductionist one, but that just means that you need a person to predict it rather than a computer model.

  Rational doesn't mean reductionist. It means being smart enough to accomplish your goals.

  Of course you can! Rationalist doesn't necessarily have to be "reductionist", or even particularly clear headed in tone. It just has to attempt to improve the reader's rational decision making process (which many stories do t some extent, but in rationalist works we're explicitly *trying* to do that). Even many of Yudkowsky's stories don't always clearly define what's going on - the Sword of Good, for example, is merely deconstructionist - we don't bother with world building at all. Same with the [Pebble Sorting](http://lesswrong.com/lw/sy/sorting_pebbles_into_correct_heaps/) story - it's an allegory, like Plato's Cave: we're not meant to ask questions about how this ridiculousness scenario came to be.

  Aesop's Fables come to mind. "The goose that lays the golden eggs", is about hyperbolic discounting - no one cares about the mechanism of the thing. In "Sour Grapes" we don't need to question that the fox can talk, we don't ask why a sentient fox can't just get a crate to stand upon to better jump at the grapes...none of that actually matters for understanding the lesson about rationalizing failure that Aesop was trying to convey. 

  In fact, the story Sour Grapes itself is kinda dull isn't it? I bet the only reason it got popular was that the common population presumably found it very valuable to condense "the act of deciding something is bad because that view prevents one from feeling the pain of not getting it, and rather than out of any reasoned judgement concerning its worth." into the idiom "sour grapes". This implies the story *successfully* improved people's thinking about thinking. Lesswrong does this condensation of complex ideas into short "jargon" phrases which make it easier to think about pretty often.



  Religious texts are great sources for non-reductionist tales aimed at conveying a lesson of some sort: mahabharata, elder edda, bible. You also see it in classics like The Little Prince, and it's actually really common in movies: the recent Inside Out for example. More obscurely, I thought the Devil's Carnival did it particularly well.  (It doesn't matter if the story sometimes teaches a bad lesson - the point is that the medium can communicate lessons)


  I think it would be fairly easy to depict rationality-improving concepts like loss aversion, gambler's fallacy, etc in any genre or style. Flawed characters in fairy tales teaching by negative example is a proud old tradition. Deeper philosophical lessons are possible too, but it's more work, of course. 

  I'd advise thinking "When I started writing this story, what is it that I wanted to tell?" and then going forward from there. If you were drawn to the "fabulist" genre (I googled it but I'm still not sure quite what it is?) to communicate this, then I don't think reductionism need necessarily play a part in what you were trying to tell.

  (Or do you specifically *want*  advice on logically-consistent/reductionist stories which can be solved in a puzzle-like fashion that retain a dreamlike style? That's harder but I bet it could be done...)
