  Why is the title here "Fantasy Grab-bag" when the challenge is "Fanfic Grab-bag"?

  I've been wanting to see a rational No Game No Life, which looks like it was designed to be a rationalist fanfic if it weren't for the fact that the majority of it is bad advice.

  Rational Touhou would be interesting. Especially if you manage it without making it grimdark, which is difficult considering that the majority of the cast is man-eating monsters.

    Er ... because I screwed up.

  Sens8, for sure. A group of eight people, each with different skills who live in different locations around the world, all psychically linked in a way that is loosely defined. One's a scientist, one's a business executive, one's a hacker, etc. I enjoy the show, but it focuses much more on characters than the "magic system". I'd love to read a rationalist take on it. I'd be working on it myself, but I'm already working on a different project.

    That's definitely one that I've had my eye on. I'm not really a fan of the show, in part because I don't find their character work to be that compelling, but one of the good things about it is that if you wanted to you could just translate the magic system to a completely different cast of characters of your choosing.

    (I'm actually curious whether anyone has done a multi-character fanfic crossover where eight people from different canons become linked with each other. I assume someone's working on that somewhere.)

  I've been playing *Prey*, which is a pretty classic "things go horribly wrong in an isolated environment" type of game, which makes a lot of sense given that it's a spiritual successor to System Shock. There's a definite undercurrent of "Science is Bad" and "Things Man was Not Meant to Know", which I'm not hugely fond of, but it's fun enough despite that, and some of it is more of the Jurassic Park variety coordination problems, planning fallacy, failure to be properly paranoid, etc.. (I have not finished the game, so can't yet speak to what it's actually trying to say, but I do think it's probably good fodder.)
