## [RT][WIP] Superhero Web-Serial Creep, updating every weekday

### Post:

Sometimes, having Superpowers is more of a burden than a gift. The story CREEP is my take on a world where Heroes are drafted for service and it's hardly a hot gig. If you're lucky (and attractive), you get a cushy domestic job. If you're not so lucky, they'll put you on the front lines, fighting power-crazed would-be Godkings. What else would human beings really do with unimaginable power, anyway?

Now, if you're *really* unlucky,  >!they may just decide your powers are more a liability than an asset...!< 

Our protagonist wants no part of this system. Walter simply wants to be free to make his own life and feel in control of it. Yet, he'll have to figure his way out as disaster is crapped right into his lap. Body horror is a thing in this work.

The story stands right now at 35k with the first arc wrapping up shortly after just sixteen days. People seem to be liking it and I had hoped you all might too. You can take a look at the ratings, reviews, and blurb on the front page if you're interested. [LINK](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29145/creep).

Or you can jump straight into the [first chapter](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29145/creep/chapter/438521/1-a-hero-wakes-up) and see what happens.

Either way, thanks for taking the time to read this post! College is starting back, so good luck to many of you out there as well. Especially my fellow writers :P. We need it.

  Every weekday sounds crazy fast. I'm not sure how anyone could keep that up while maintaining quality, and readers don't really demand that rate anyway.  Just a suggestion, but a few specific days a week will probably improve your story with more editing planning and give you more runway without hurting momentum for your readers

    It's brutal, man! Yet so far, this has been the absolute largest success of any of my serials and virtually no single reader has done anything but treat the schedule with glee and praise. While I completely agree that going slower would improve quality and there have been a few times that it killed me to go on when I really wanted to do a big edit (like split a chapter in two) I got over it. The crowd has spoken, and the crowd says quantity > quality. 

    That said, I like to think I'm a pretty decent and entertaining/meaningful writer, even at these speeds, so I would encourage you to give it a chance. I might add that if you're looking more for proper literary art than entertainment (I try my best... but *honestly*) you should probably not be reading web serials. Funny enough, I don't! :P

    Thanks for your response. Good to know some people exist who value a more deliberate pace. As it stands, I'm just trying out a different tactic to writing. I've done weekly updates and I've done biweekly. Been at this a long time. See my RRL profile for more fiction!

    Thanks!

      I think the big advantage of a harsh schedule like that is that it pushes writers to just write and publish without looking back, and the biggest way to improve is to actually write a lot. Of course if the outline of the plot and basics of the world aren't planned it will end up being kinda incoherent in the large scale, but often times the specific scenes, plot points and even characters tend to change as you write anyway.

        Definitely. I have a definite plan, but here's hoping we don't get a big mess anyway, lol.

  Nice. Keep going. I read the first couple then skipped to the most recent (the level of grim isn't for me at this time) but I like the world-building in that latest chapter, and the something-to-look-forward-to. I'd like to see perspective chapters from people with wildly different characters and mindsets than Walter.

  You mentioned body horror, how does the current arc compare to FoamingHam's Twig?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    That must be wildbow's handle on here. I have to say, it's hard for me to judge. I think Twig probably did it more, also had a lot more time to do it. Was it *worse?* Probably. For me personally, the body-horror has not felt as scary *as I would like to end up being* if that makes sense. And that is about as bad as Twig's, with the occasional 'ew I hate parasites/that mental image' moment.

      ```
      People shuffle ethusastic-porkers's handle with synonyms after how he twisted the nightcrawler scenes' when his name was used in the extra-apes comments section. I think the Gieco gecko, not-ziz or Miluk started it.

        You learn something new every day! I was reading back in 2011 and I must have never caught the joke.
