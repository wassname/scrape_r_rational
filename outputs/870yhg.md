## [BST] Ways to make Muggles/Mortals interesting?

### Post:

So a common trope in fantasy novels is that whatever special race the story focuses on are always decisively better than muggles.
In Harry Potter wizards are muggles, but they have magic.
In Eragon the elves are like humans, but smarter, longer-lived, better at magic etc... And dwarves are also longer-lived than humans and posses magics and technology humans don't, as well as an actual god?like being that appears whenever they crown a king, making even their strong religiosity somewhat rational.

In all these stories, the main advantage of humans seems to be 'numbers', which is kind of boring and overused at this point. So I'm trying to think of way to give humans a decisive, advantageous trait that could explain why they still exist in a world full of fantastical beings.

But just giving humans a magical ability would kind of take away from the point of them being muggles, so I'm deciding to go the other way, and take something away from classic magical beings instead. There is some essential human quality that they lack, because it actually is a 'human' quality; there are drawbacks to being magical.

I ran into a roadblock when I started considering ways to find a basic human ability that could be removed from wizards (for example), and still result in them not being too alien to write. 

But then I read The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker, and was inspired. Maybe only muggles have the language instinct, and other beings actually do have to learn language from scratch as babies, impairing the progress of their civilizations.

And that go me thinking; there's a whole wealth of potential there. There are probably tons and tons of now defunct theories on how human intelligence/mental capabilities work/evolved, all defunct because they are less elegant than the current accepted truth (the human mind works better than the old theory thought it did). Making these old theories of mind true for different magical beings, and then extrapolating from there, could make for some easily alien-but-still-very-humanlike characters. 

It would even make some rational sense; the advantages conferred by magic allowed these beings to make do with relatively 'inefficient' minds, while muggles, without such advantages, had to evolve to what appears to be the limits of how intelligent biological brains can be (in that any more improvements would be an evolutionary disadvantage due to tradeoffs).

And it would provide an interesting way for any muggles in on the Masquerade to avoid jealousy; maybe, in the modern era, not all muggles even want to be magical. If Petunia, growing up, watched Lily struggle horribly with language, or in some other mental area, maybe she wouldn't have been so envious of her magic.

And it could even make for an axis, with the power of different magical being/humanoid groups depending on the severity of their deficiency. Wizards might struggle with language, for example, but still manage to be successful because their magic allows them to compensate for that in some way, while elves could be held back by a crippling lack of empathy that prevents their societies from properly functioning. 

So I've come here for help brainstorming; what are the best old, wrong theories of mind/cognition/mental faculties that, if taken to be true for different magical beings, would make for the most interesting characters or civilizations?

  I am an ecology student, and instead of viewing things in a strictly direct competition sense, which tends to result in a clear loser and a clear winner, I prefer the interpretation that there are different evolutionary *niches* that different kinds of intelligence have evolved to fit.

  Imagine humans as being your standard endurance-runner savannah-dwelling species, living in small tribes, developing language and intelligence due to strong *intraspecies* competition and sexual selection. Take any aspect of that formula, and tweak the conditions, and you’ll get something different. 

  Let’s imagine elves as being very similar, but evolved for sprinting like a gazelle, ostrich, or cheetah. Suddenly, you have a vastly different metabolic profile, which will affect how the brain develops. You also have an entirely different set of instinctual responses, which means an entirely different *psychological baseline.* How does cooperation for such a species look different? How do they react to conflict or being startled? What draws their interest, what’s their beauty aesthetic? All of those things will be reflective of their different niche. And, of course, any clever being might find ways to exploit these psychological differences.

  You can do the same for dwarves. Imagine them as being subterranean creatures, like aardvarks or wombats. Imagine if they had a completely alien hierarchy—eusocial, like naked mole rats or ants. Suddenly, the stereotypical obsession with tradition and the social order makes a lot more sense, as they’re physiologically and hormonally conditioned to operate that way. Imagine if they live underground because they’re more of a prey species in their environment—how might that affect their worldview?

  You can do this for any number of fantastical creatures or even magical systems. Magic would be *at least* as big of an evolutionary factor as the advent of vision or language. In that context, how does it play a role in competition and ecological niches? How does it foster or inhibit competition? Does the way magic is structured incentivize altruistic behavior or selfish behavior? These are the questions you need to ask about the system.

    Have you by chance read The Nightmare Stacks from Laundry Series (reading prior books is not fundamental for this one).

    Cause it tries to do something similar by making elves a predatory version of human, Like Neanderthals, that developed amgic before developing speach.

    And implications that followed.

      Well, nothing’s known with *certainty,* but bear in mind that “sexual selection” and “intraspecies competition” are both extremely broad categories that cover practically all the bases, both evolutionarily speaking and in terms of the top theories today. It covers at least the sexual selection and social exchange theories for the rise of human intelligence—it’s my own personal opinion that these reinforce rather than conflict with each other, but some consider social (Robin Dunbar) or sexual (Geoffrey Miller) theory to be the dominant, driving force behind the evolution of human intelligence.

      The only things *aside* from those reasons are pretty implausible as applied to human evolution. It’s not given much credit that humans evolved greater intelligence to outsmart predators, for example, considering things like *Australopithecus* also lived in similar environments with similar predators yet never manifested higher brain volumes even remotely as fast as did humans over the same exact time span. Similarly, while hominids did likely come into hostile contact with each other and intelligence probably played somewhat of a role in determining who went extinct, they also were *separated* from each other long enough to speciate in the first place, and things like Neanderthals and other hominids had often *independently* developed to be about as intelligent as humans were at the time, or perhaps even a bit smarter, given their slightly larger brain volumes. Thus, the comparative advantage that determined who lived and who died out was probably something other than intelligence.

      There are exceptions, of course, as hominid evolutionary history is rather messy, with more primitive species living contemporaneously (albeit not necessarily alongside) other, more advanced hominids. *Homo erectus,* for example, lived a surprisingly long time alongside more advanced (taller and bigger-brained) descendants. Hominids were constantly migrating from one continent to another, undergoing speciation, and migrating back where they came from.

      Long story short, high intelligence is such a wildly useful and broadly-applicable tool that I’d be amazed if there was only *one* single factor that led to it predominating hominid evolution. If you ask me, it was probably at least partly due to natural selection (given the climate and ecological calamities of the time), but the primary driving force seems more likely to be sexual and social, evolution operating both on the individual (in the context of selecting a mate and successfully rearing children) and on the group (more intelligent/communicative groups being more successful), with the latter in particular determining which hominid species survived when and if they eventually came into direct competition.

    Yes, but the base Harry Potter universe, wizards are muggle++.  They have all the same mental and physical capabilities plus magic.  You would expect whatever traits make someone a wizard would increase in the population until 100%.
    ```

    - u/GrafZeppelin127:
      ```
      I wasn’t referring specifically to the Harry Potter universe. And even in that case, the traits that make a wizard would reach 100% not on the merits that wizards are objectively superior to muggles, but on the basis that *being a wizard leads to having more children than non-wizards.*

        I'm having trouble seeing a way a trait that makes someone 'superior' doesn't help with the baby-making.  Sort of a context thing.  I could declare that the mole on my face makes me superior but since it doesn't help me get laid it isn't.

        If I were super strong or could mind control people or just make my enemies forget I even exist or die spontaneously...I'd be able to make a _lot_ of babies.  And so would other people with my traits.  

        Wizards are just too powerful for anything resembling a stable ecological balance.

          We’re fundamentally arguing about a fictional thing, so take this with a grain of salt. I’d leave you with this tidbit of information, though—HPMOR explicitly states that the Wizarding world has a far higher standard of living than the muggle world. Many systems work this way, with wizards and witches living lives of relative privilege and wealth compared to peasants.

          Also consider that what might be the *single greatest unifying trait* of the first world as compared to developing countries, aside from their wealth and industrialization, is that the first world experiences a stark reduction in birth rates. The wealthy/privileged tend to have fewer offspring than the poor even within the same society.
          ```

          - u/SoylentRox:
            ```
            I think that is a short-term thing that is not what the long term trend will be.  What causes this is ready access to birth control.  However, birth control, from nature's perspective, is poison.  Over enough time, those members of the population with traits that 'resist' the poison will become prevalent.
            ```

            - u/GrafZeppelin127:
              ```
              Maybe, maybe not. We hardly have proof of that. Also consider that not all animals have the same strategy when it comes to ensuring the success of their offspring. Some invest great resources in a very limited number of offspring. Others expend their resources producing great numbers of offspring, but by the nature of these things, these individual offspring are often less fit than offspring that have had lots of resources showered on them.

          Throw in something like "Wizard fertility is highly dependent on the amount of magic in the area." In areas which had been saturated by repeated magic use for centuries, or which were naturally magical, wizards would have a normal reproduction rate. In areas which didn't have this, wizards could certainly *live*... but probably wouldn't have anywhere near as many children (or as many children who were wizards instead of squibs).

          So in the UK and Europe, you have wizards. In the middle-east you'd probably have lots of wizards, although the culture might be different. In Africa you'd have squillions of wizards if there wasn't something else working against that - maybe a far-distant wizard war clobbered the continent or its magic reserves.

          In North America, you have a reasonable amount of wizards, and slowly increasing. In South America... who knows? Could be a plot point. In places like Australia, either there's no magic, or the magic is continually drained away, or it's fossilized and can't be accessed easily.

          Asia? Lots of magic-users, of a thousand different styles, but not so many in the European mold. Maybe Asia has too *much* magic, and it's all jumbled up - spells which work in one location might not work the same way, or as well, or at *all*, if you travel fifty miles away.

  > crippling lack of empathy

  Perhaps subvert this - suppose a crippling surfeit of empathy.  Along with the ability to do magic comes a new sense: the ability to sense magic and magical connections.  This changes everything, but in particular it enables and _forces_ magicals to perceive the interconnected web of all being.  This results in much beauty and harmony but also cultural stasis.  Inflicting violence on others is literally inflicting violence on yourself, where violence is very broadly interpreted as not only physical violence, but also emotional violence and, at least for a faction, change in general.  It isn't that magicals couldn't invent agriculture, but that the resulting 'violence' to the web of being is intolerable.  Overpopulation doesn't occur in the first place because the community can perceive the violence it would entail (e.g. agriculture).  

  Mundanes are blind, but this enables them to commit violence without perceiving the harm they do to themselves - they are like fire consuming its own fuel, inevitably leading to its own doom, but overwhelming in the meantime.  The magicals discuss controlling the blind mundanes so they don't do so much damage, but the mundanes are no less strands in the web of being and control is a form of violence.  As always, the debates are endless and the action plans have timescales in the order of millennia.  As a twist, have the mundanes be a secret weapons program of an anti-stasis faction.  The faction protects the mundanes from magical politics and is able to use them to inflict violence on their (pro-stasis) political enemies 
  mostly by reason of their existence.

    it's a good idea that could be written brilliantly, but not by me; one of the tropes I hate most in some of the HP fanfics I read is the whole 'wizards aren't only behind both the world wars, but also, somehow, all the scientific advancements of the last two centuries', that usually goes along with 'all the great ancient philosophers were wizards, as well as all the folk heroes, and the gods, etc...'. It portrays muggles as lacking a fundamental self-agency that makes one question if Draco Malfoy wasn't right all along; if all the greatest 'muggles' are actually wizards, then what do muggles really offer the world?

    My main point for doing this is that I want to craft a fantasy world that muggles have a place in. A world where, conceivably, they can actually hold their own and, throw hard, hard work, maybe even thrive. A world where they have their own agency, and make their own decisions and can have a positive impact on the universe. 

    The idea is good, but it feels like a case of magicals being 'better' than mundanes. The mundane's blindness isn't really an advantage if it's eventually going to lead to their doom, and the magicals are actually right in their desire to control them. 

    Thanks for offering an idea though :)

      We are all doomed alike, magical and mundane, but mundanes are the agent of change.  What greater glory!?  Mundanes *are* adventure.  Mundanes *are* curiosity and experiment.  Mundanes possess an innocent freedom that those paralyzed by the relentless Music of the Spheres will never know.  

      Consider the agony of a society stuck in a local maxima, unable to justify the journey through a social valley to the (possible) new heights beyond.  Without the threatening fire of the mundanes, the journey might never begin.  Magicals *need* mundanes.  How dark the night without fire's light?  How cold the winter without fire's warmth?  The wounds the mundanes inflict will never truly heal, but there are no futures without scars, and after ashes comes the ecstasy of rebirth.  Even if it were possible to tame fire, who would deprive the world of its fierce joy?

  Take inspiration from real life. The neanderthals were arguably stronger and smarter than h. Sapiens, but that had an invreased metabolic cost-- about 200-300 kcal per day-- that made them significantly more likely to starve. There has to be some cost to being special, or everyone would be. That cost doesn't need to be metabolic, but something along those lines could work.

    I think the problem with a cost like that these days is it isn't a *real* cost. Wizards could need to eat five times as much per day and still be better; they could just steal it from muggles at extremum, after all.

      If it was that simple, either wizards would have long since outcompeted muggles, or wizards would have all starved to death long before modern agriculture allowed for the creation of enough food to feed wizard populations. The real world is complex-- story settings can be too.

    I kind of like this. Not all humans actually *would* do this, meaning that for the most part thought patterns would be very difficult to tell apart, and for the greater part of history people wouldn't even have the language to do so. But every so often, humans kick into third gear, even if it's just for a minute or two or after eating that weird mushroom or staying awake for three days or being a hair's-breadth from death, or you get a military or political genius who can switch it on more often, and over the years and centuries it starts to add up - human civilization starts to gain the barest edge, tends to have more ideas and sooner (if only on average), and so on.

    And of course no-one knows why. Maybe it's that weird human food. Or that they live in those weird houses. Or that they have those freaky cultural rituals. Or they raise their children in particular ways. Or because they live near rivers. Or grow and eat that odd plant. Or cook in strangely-shaped pots. Or maybe their gods have different priorities to our gods. Or the One God likes them because they're cute. Or... etc etc.

  Technology prowess

  Some kind of magical immunity
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Rather than magical immunity, an idea I've often had is this; science and technology is actually muggle magic.

    Magic is all about warping reality; that's the basis of spells. Muggles are always casting a rather simple, but powerful spell, that sorts the universe into the shape we know it to be. The universe is actually a wild place, akin to something out of an animist religion, where everything was a will. Smartphones don't work in Hogwarts, not because magic interferes with it, but rather because if there isn't a muggle nearby the electrons simply do what they want rather than conform to the expectations needed for high technology to function. Muggles would think we 'discover' new laws of nature, but rather this would be 'powerful' muggles or groups of muggles imposing new laws on nature. Science would make sense, because muggles would have to come to some kind of minimum 'consensus' for the law to take affect, and therefore laws that make some kind of intuitive sense would dominate. 

    A prehistoric wizard throwing a spear would have to worry about how the wind felt about him, his karma, whether or not his pray was in any way 'blessed' or something like that. A prehistoric muggle throwing a spear would only have to worry about wind resistance, weight, and how well he could throw.

    And so it wouldn't be that magical races can do everything muggles can do, and have magic on top of that, but rather that they can't do everything muggles can do and so have to use magic.

    A story like HPMOR would be about Harry learning that the tradeoff for being a wizard is that he can't make scientific investigations into the world/magic, as the world only 'behaves' when muggles are looking at it. The reason magic is declining could be something as nonsensical as 'the universe doesn't really like wizards that much right now', or anything else, and the reason the Founders so much stronger as simple as 'the Earth liked them better'. Becoming a greater wizard would be less about trying to munchkin spells and less about figuring out how to seduce Nature so that, if you were throwing a spear, the wind would always help you out.

    Any thoughts? I just think that this idea would be a bit more boring to write from a muggle perspective, then some of the things I've written in my comment replies below.
    ```

    - u/PL_TOC:
      ```
      >science and tech is muggle magic

      Then muggle becomes meaningless. All of what you described after can be the way one of the non-human factions work and you lose nothing.

      >so it wouldn't be that

      They should be able to. Rather than adding artificial handicaps you can raise the stakes. If anyone has a handicap it should be the humans *until* they discover or are able to use their ability, and not later in the story, but as quickly as possible after the story starts.

      >A story like hpmor

      This is one of the reasons YA falls flat with people who prefer stuff written for adults. Real people don't have strengths and weaknesses balanced as if it were a game of rock, paper, scissors; Lizard, Spock be damned. 

      The excitement comes when people overcome the impossible or become the impossible.

      I haven't come here to tear your ideas apart. These are just things I find really uninteresting in contemporary entertainment.

        ```
        Ah, but I'm not entirely sure I fully understand your objections. Why would muggle become meaningless? It would just go from meaning 'can't do magic', to having their own magic. From a muggle point of view nothing would have changed; individual muggles would still just be muggles, as vulnerable to everything else in the world as they always were; it would just give a reason for large groups of muggles to have managed to survive. That's even the reason I feel like that is my weakest idea; from the perspective of an individual, nothing really changes, and so it would be boring to write.

        And the thing is, this entire post is about adding handicaps, because without adding handicaps I can't figure out how to explain how muggles existed long enough to 'find their ability', whatever it would be. But enough on this topic, because this whole technology is magic thing is not the kind of idea I wanted to discuss in this thread and I really shouldn't have brought it up. 

        I've brought up a few better ideas in my comment replies, and would be very glad if you read a few of those; I understand that real people don't have their strengths balanced like in rock, paper and scissors, but the thing is that different species are kind of balanced in that way. If one kind of deer is actually just straight-up better than a different kind, than over time the inferior deer will just go extinct or be absorbed.
        So, in my world where the different magical beings really are different species, not just different cultures, I need to come up with a way to balance muggles. And if I buff them too much then, as you said, the word 'muggle' would become meaningless. And so instead I have to nerf magical beings in a way that lets them retain their classic flavors, and still keep them interesting and enticing; I don't want to risk turning them from different!muggles into worse!muggles.

        Naturally the balance shouldn't be as clear cut as Rock, Paper and Scissors; I still want my muggle characters to struggle. But I need there to be a reason they have a chance in the first place that isn't just numbers; because if they really were as straight inferior as they tend to be written they wouldn't have a numbers advantage in the first place.

        My other comment replies go in depth on the kind of differences I'm looking for; qualitative differences in mental faculties (usually made up for by magic) that leave magical beings with 'holes' in their thinking that muggles can take advantage of, but don't make magical beings just look 'stupid' or 'dumb'. The difference between being tricked because you're too foolish to know the difference between an apple and an orange, and being tricked because you're blind and your opponent can see.

        Any ideas on that front?

          Take one example of what people refer to as cognitive bias and redefine it as a feature rather than a bug, because of x context. 

          The way that humans will have held on? Just barely. Until they discover what it is they weren't understanding and learn how to develop it fully.

          As far as adding handicaps rather than giving different species different boons and watching how it would play out, it's just something which comes off as overly contrived.

            the thing is I feel as if giving the muggles a 'boon' that allows them to compete with magical beings on a level playing field would either feel even more contrived, or make them no longer be muggles.

            Could you go a bit deeper into what you mean by redefining cognitive bias as bug though? It looks interesting but I don't think I'm getting exactly what you mean.

              You've said you wanted humans to be magical to have been able to survive among magical species. Okay. Make them magical. What I'm saying is, present them as they are, but have them discover, realize, or activate something of their own that was a power they didn't realize they had, thought was something else, thought was a handicap, and/or was something they simply didn't know how to wield. 

              Have the events of the story force them to develop quickly.

              As far as a bias goes, I said redefine it as a feature rather than a bug in the course of this discovery. In what way it is a feature is what you build your human-magic around.

              As for boons, give everyone else clear advantages with no tradeoffs or handicaps.

                I don't want humans to be magical. That's the thing. I do not want muggles to be magical, as that would take away from them being muggles. My earlier idea, the whole science/technology thing that I shouldn't have brought up and no longer want to talk about because I think the other ideas I've seen/brought up in different places in this comment section are more interesting, was a way to give muggles magic without individual muggles actually feeling like they had power, which is foolish and hard to write and that's why I don't want to talk about it anymore.

                So I don't want muggles to be magical, but I do want them to have advantages. And since I can't buff them by giving them magic, it does mean I have to nerf everyone else. I know you don't have to, and asking this of a stranger could be pretty annoying, but please read a few of my other posts in this comment section for a clearer view of what I'm trying to do.

                Essentially it boils down to this; in a lot of the old stories I like, the human hero wins not because he's stronger, or faster, or better than the clearly more powerful magic opponent, but because he manages to trick them. And I want to preserve that feel in the story I intend to write; that a human (and human societies) can scrape by, and even manage to thrive in some rare cases, by being clever. Not by being magical, because they're muggles and I want them to stay muggles, but by being clever.

                And in order to write that without making every other race idiots/dumb, I've decided instead to add 'holes' in their thinking. Which makes some sense to me because our brains are something that evolved slowly, and over time; magic is such a powerful advantage developing magic could slow down the evolution of other traits. 

                So in my story, just as magical beings can exploit muggles lack of magic to win, humans can exploit these holes to survive; I wanted this thread to be a brain storm of what those 'holes' could be, and people have already come up with/inspired some ideas I think are pretty good.

                I don't want muggles to be magic; I want them to be able to survive without magic. And in order to do that I looked to a bunch of fairy tales, where the only way the protagonist wins is by trickery. And the only way I see to write humans being able to consistently win via trickery and guile (without the other races being idiots) is for there to be certain things human minds can do, that certain races just can't imitate; just like how no matter how hard a muggle waves a wand, they can't cast a spell.

                Also I don't see how handing out 'boons' is any different from handing out 'handicaps'; to me they both make the same amount of 'sense' story-wise.

      Or it could even be that magic is becoming weaker because there are more muggles to impose their science magic on the world, so it conforms to be orderly and bound by the laws of physics, which would in turn mean that wizard magic has less unorderly, wild universe to work with/affect.

        That would be a pretty interesting idea, and could actually make for some pretty awesome wizard antagonists. Any Dark Lord would be a lot more sympathetic if muggles were literally destroying the Wizarding way of life simply by thriving in the modern era; and finding a way to reconcile both models could be an awesome climax :)

      > The reason magic is declining could be something as nonsensical as 'the universe doesn't really like wizards that much right now'

      Or just that the universe doesn't have a preference for chaos over order; lifeforms using one or the other are just evolutionary paths. More muggles + more science = more structure imposed on the magic in and around the planet, but the universe doesn't care any more than it has a preference for orchards over jungles, or canals over natural rivers. It's just what's happening locally on one tiny planet.

  I think for it to really have impact, a cost like this can't simply be something being *difficult*, it has to be something being impossible. After all, it's not like a muggle can struggle extra hard at magic and achieve things through stubborn force of will. Language is probably the wrong sort of cost, unless you want to go so far as to make Wizards illiterate (which is a bit... off-stereotype anyway. Might fit Sorcerers though.)

  I think lifespan as a cost is a little overdone too, especially because it's the sort of narrative cost you don't see in a story if you don't want to. The cost should be something real and everyday, just like magic is. Good examples of costs might be color vision (minor), or the ability to lie (major).

    This is exactly what I'm gong for, and is why I've gone for some different examples in some of my replies (like different memory systems or intuition) that I don't want to repeat here cuz it would be a pain to retype and would look ugly if I copypasted it :)

    But the 'inability to lie' it something I've been mulling over in my head for a while, trying to figure out how to make it work the way I want to. I want these mental differences to be qualitative. I don't want to make it so that the Fae are basically normal people plus magic powers, but when they try to lie they can't. I want to make it so that the Fae mind works in such a way that crafting a lie is almost completely impossible, as inconceivable to them as imagining a new color is to us.

    And I'm having a hard time coming up with a way to do that, that bases the reason in a mental faculty. The only interesting reason I can come up is this; according to some youtube video I watched once, lying involves holding both the truth and the lie in your head, and keeping track of both without getting mixed up.

    So maybe Fae minds are easily corrupted by imagination, so that if they tried to lie, the risked overwriting the truth with the lie in their own heads? It would explain why their culture is so whimsical, and rooted in the arts and performance; a Fae person picturing a dragon actually sees the dragon flying in the air around them, and actually hears whatever background music they came up with to accompany it; they'd perceive it as clearly as they would a real physical object. 

    Muggles evolved the stark difference between imagination and reality to keep us safe, but the Fae can just use magic for that so they never had to.

    And so it would be that lying is actually very dangerous to Fae, as they would imperil their own memories, overwriting what actually happened with what they say happened. Exposing a lying Fae would be as simple as probing for details, and then you could just insert your own details into the story, confusing them until they believe whatever you say happened. The Fae sticking so strongly to the truth would be less about being magically compelled to be honest, and more about protecting themselves from being bamboozled; it would be similar to how muggle memories are fluid (experiments on eyewitnesses show how changeable memory can be), but way easier for non-Fae to take advantage of, if a Fae dared to start lying.

    And it would also be why changelings are capable of so easily blending in; tell a Fae that it's a four year old named 'Dennis' enough times, and tell it stories about being Dennis, and remind it of days out Dennis went on with you, and eventually the Fae will believe it (never mind if it's really a 20 year old named BlueLeaf or something) much more readily than a muggle would.

    Any other ideas? I couldn't think of a way to make lying actually impossible to a truly intelligent, sentient mind, but two heads are better than one! :)

      I sort of want to say that maybe you can take the next step, and Fae lies have the risk of becoming actually true, but in unpredictable, dangerous ways. That's getting a bit beyond the realm of purely mental effects though.

      Getting back to the original point, I think this sort of deficit would also come up in argument; a Fae can't readily be the devil's advocate for fear of accidentally becoming the devil. To even argue something hypothetically, a Fae must actually believe their own words. This could logically be extended to Fae often being surprised by other sides of an argument in ways a mortal might not be. The contradictory nature of human argument might leave Fae often bamboozled diplomatically, since the true intentions of a human can be so difficult to follow and their goals are often unclear.
      ```

    - u/daytodave:
      ```
      Another consequence of this would be that Fae wouldn't be able to simulate other minds. You can't evaluate a plan very deeply if the moment you start thinking, "If I do X, then she'll do Y, which means I'd have to do Z...", your perception gets overridden and you start to believe that X, Y, and Z are *actually* happening.

      From the point of view of other races, humans would have an incredibly ability to predict future events. In reality, the human power of "Second Sight," isn't magically seeing the future; it's the ability to hold one hypothetical set of events in their minds while keeping it separate from real events.

  >In all these stories, the main advantage of humans seems to be 'numbers', which is kind of boring and overused at this point. 

  I know this doesn't answer your question, but one thing that bugs me is how undervalued sheer numbers are.  Numbers means economy, and specialization, and education, and scale.  A city with 4x the population only needs to defend 2x the length of wall (the same goes for states).  A hamlet with 100 people will have one person in the top 1% of a trait, a city of 100k will have a thousand.

    Ah but the thing is, from an individual human point of view, numbers would be kind of boring to write. It's too familiar to how we operate now; the human response to most animal threats has usually been to either move, or overwhelm it with numbers; working in groups is quintessentially to how we operate.

    If I was going to make 'numbers' our advantage, I would have to think of a reason why other sentient magical species can't also form large groups and dominate us that way. Which is actually a really interesting idea, come to think of it.

    I already had the idea that elves simply have incredibly impaired empathy, and so their societies are plagued by large amounts of 'cheaters' that make it very hard for them to function; society is based on trust, and elves simply wouldn't be able to trust each other outside of small family based groups.

    And so in this way elves would powerful magic, but humans would almost always outnumber them, because we can live in cities and the most they can manage is villages, no matter how intellectually advanced they become. 

    Any ideas?

      Make magic flow between elves, and not losslessly. Two elves standing or living near each other would, eventually (and if no other action was taken), drain each other of magic over time.

      So a solitary elf has the most magic. Elven families would be deliberately giving up part of their magic for the advantages of a group, or at least making it harder to maintain a high magic level. Even with an ability to hold off the drain with an effort of will, allowing meetings and so forth over the course of hours or even days, an elf can't stay awake and mentally alert forever; they'd have to retire and recharge, and for longer depending on how long they'd been in the company of others. A society of elves would thus naturally tend to be somewhat distant, standoffish but polite (because they needed to be able to get along with each other during the times they *did* interact, without being able to maintain/reinforce those social links every day), and efforts which required multiple elves to work on something or collaborate in any way would take longer to achieve.

      Individual arts, skills, and talents would be far more prominent; painting, sculpture, carving, weaving, swordsmithing and armor-making and horse-caring and poetry and mapmaking and so forth. But you'd see far less evidence of *group*work, including things like industry, elves hiring other elves for grunt work, elven businesses which were larger than sole traders (and the occasional very rare family business). Elves would be largely solitary creatures by nature, with society running gracefully, with aforethought, and *slowly*.

      What would be shocking is what wizards would have to do without economies of scale. This actually plays into the "nature-loving elves" trope - they can trade with their neighbors for things their neighbors make, but there's no goods with long supply chains. Elves have to use magic to write and are shocked by cheap pens and ink, etc. But I suppose that very quickly, the wizards would trade with and become a subculture of the more economically active group.

The Marked never live longer than 20 or 30 years. The Unmarked 10%, who live normal human lifespans, form the island's Council and keep its history a close secret.

  I find this explanation of humans in star trek pretty fun and interesting, https://imgur.com/gallery/qSmHy, tldr other races see Doc Brown as the prototypical human. To carry over that to a fantasy setting you could have humans be really risk taking due to their much lower life expectancy and higher birth rates or something like that. This could lead to things like 1) other races avoid cooperating with humans since the death rate in all human plans are way too high for any elf involved  2) Human protagonists outsmarting people from other races since they are better at exploring riskier plans that wouldn't occur to other races 3) Other races struggling to negotiate with humans since they can't understand how humans possibly could value their lives/family/home etc when they always act so carelessly. Human society could also be marked by extreme progress and equally extreme variance. A society where all mages make crazy inventions that are extremely risky and completely goes against the common understanding of magic. This causes a near constant amount of huge explosions, magical pandemics and other threats that also put the older races at risk. But every once in a while they find something that works and they are approaching the level of sophistry that the ancient experts from the older races have developed over the centuries. 
  This risk taking could also mean that even muggle humans have spells cast on them for increased strength and similar. But if you want most humans to be complete muggles then maybe it could just be the case that there have been so many self experimenting humans in history that a muggle can bluff that hes super strong or that he has a self-destruct button and no one dares to call them on it.

          You'd need another Hogwarts (or at least a capacity expansion on the current one) if the number of students learning magic increased substantially over time. Like muggle populations tend to do. The world's (muggle) population has *doubled* in less than 50 years.

          In the time the books were set, Hogwarts as an institution was nearly exactly one thousand years old. (*Very*) rough estimates of European population around that are about 50 million, with about 740-750 million today. Even assuming various plagues and wars affected the Wizarding World as much as muggles, Hogwarts back then would have had one-fifteenth of its current capacity. Rowling's said there are around a thousand students at Hogwarts, with fans running the math saying maybe a third of that. So that would put Hogwarts-at-founding with perhaps 20-60 students (again, very roughly). Has it been upgraded over the years, or does it have some kind of standing spell similar to the Room of Requirement, which automatically increases its volumes, grounds, and other facilities as the need arises?

  In TES, mortals have one advantage over dragons- they are familiar with death, so dragonrend has a devastating effect on dragons and no effect on mortals.

  I think you get more interesting storytelling when the advantage is something mental rather than just numbers or caloric cost or whatever. Some examples that might work/ have worked in other stories:

  -Innovation.

  -Lateral thinking.

  -Ruthlessness.

  -Cooperation.

  -Adaptability.

  -Emotional resolve.

  -Revolutionary spirit.

  -Rationality.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I like this, but kind of want ways to narrow this down to 'faculties', rather than something like 'rationality', which is less of a basic mental ability and more of an application of your mental abilities (or at least that's how I understand it).

    For example, if I were going for emotional resolve, I would make it less 'humans are more courageous than wizards', and more 'wizards are completely incapable of regulating their emotions'.

    So calm, collected wizards are naturally capable of taking full advantage of their magic and dominating stuff (the Dumbledores), but wizarding society is plagued by things like dramatic Dark Lords and dangerous spell accidents because wizards can't will themselves to be calm. They can't take three breaths and calm down, but instead have to let their fear or anger or curiosity play out fully to get rid of it. And this would make them vulnerable to things like taunting or intimidation in a way muggles aren't, and make their groups less effective, because once a wizard's lost their cool, that's it. Wizard armies cannot rally once their ranks are broken, and tons of wizards die during puberty due to the upsurge in emotion mixing badly with the growth of their powers.

    And so the differences between muggles and wizards would be due a qualitative difference in experience (the ability to properly regulate emotion vs. the inability to do so), rather than quantitative (humans are more courageous than magical beings). And it would be interesting and easy to write was well; it's a lot easier to show someone steeling their resolve, or fighting their fear in a nice, obvious to the audience way, than it is to show muggles being more courageous without making wizards look like complete cowards.

    Any thoughts?

  I feel like there's a certain amount of inherent tension here - on the one hand wanting the magical races to not be *too similar* to the muggles (i.e. not just have some naff shared character trait or cultural quirk as the sole differentiator) but also wanting them to not be *too different*. 

  Threading that needle is *always* going to be difficult, regardless of what difference you pick on - might need to just embrace the xenofiction. Although of course that is difficult in a different way.

  I'm generally not a fan of different humanoid races evolving in tandem. Maybe it's just because of the experience on planet Earth, but the whole evolution thing doesn't seem to like it much.

  Another couple of unique muggle traits could be ambition and creativity. Do the whole elves never change thing, and Dwarven reproduction is basically they spend their entire lives working on a single original work (their kid) and that's the sum total of their creativity. So humans do all the inventing, art, science, etc. Even better would be just using a single alternate race with these qualities - probably dwarves would work best, but they don't have to look like dwarves (mole people, maybe)

  These aren't original ideas (though taking them to the extreme could be more novel), but they're ways to distinguish humans other than population.

  If there's actual magic though, and the people that evolved with magic are on the same continent as people without magic, I find it hard to believe that the people without magic would survive (there's a natural competition for resources) long enough for ethics to really come into being enough to prevent genocide. Unless the drawback to magic is huge without being crippling enough that the muggles end up killing the magicians.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Ah but that's the thing; I don't want it to be something like 'ambition' that sets muggles apart, though 'creativity' is somewhat closer to the mark. I want it to be something more basic, something more essential, that muggles could exploit to gain a foothold in the land. 

    A lot of the old fairy and folk tales I know hinge on the protagonist tricking their magical foe, not on brute strength, and that was something I wanted to maintain without making magicals all idiots/fools. Instead I'm planning on inserting 'holes' in their thinking, that muggles could exploit in order to survive.

    For example, if I wanted it to be that muggles advance faster, I wouldn't do it by giving muggles something as nebulous as 'ambition', because then it would be hard to write elf characters in a way that made them seem truly different, not just unambitious muggles. 

    Instead I would make it so that elves posses no intuition. Their conscious experience is, somehow, the sum total of their mental processing. They never have 'aha!' or 'eureka!' moments, and they never just 'get' a topic; instead they have to laboriously link ideas together every single time. An elf is never just 'good' at something, the way a human can just be talented at maths, or art, but instead must work for every single skill they have.
    This would be slightly mitigated by their long lives, and explain parts of their culture. Elf society is so striated because, without such a thing as talent, the elves higher up really are better than their peers in every way; the elf capable of becoming the best mathematician is also likely to be the best biologist and the best chemist and the best painter etc... because they have infinite time to learn and only one skill that matters; how well they manually link ideas. 

    So a human watching an elves would be in awe of their long lives and elegant aristocracy. And an elf watching humans would marvel at how fast humans can learn, how quickly ideas can come to them and how, inexplicably, they just appear to be 'good' at things, where an elf would always, always start at rock bottom. And so the envy would work both ways.

    And that's why it can't be something as nebulous as creativity, and why I choose the language instinct as an example. Wizards lacking a language instinct wouldn't mean they are any less intelligent than muggles, or less creative, or anything. It just means that, in some fundamental ways, the two minds work differently, in that if you put a group of 'blank slate' muggle children together they would quickly and almost effortlessly invent a complex, grammatically rich language, while a similar group of wizard children (despite being just as clever in every other way) would have to consciously and laboriously construct a language, and then teach it manually to their kids (who wouldn't just 'pick it up' like muggle children would).

      I get what you're saying about vagueness, but I think creativity is less vague than it is broad. I was using it to mean all original thought, basically saying that they get 1 original thought per lifetime, and it manifests in their offspring, and maybe they can learn from others of their species. Potentially all of their thought is tied into their magic, similar to how the fae in, for example, a practical guide to evil, are living stories.

      So like, the first ever magical spell of the first ever sentient being (perhaps it was magic incarnate) was the spell to create offspring, and then the offspring found they could also create food, and then maybe one of them learned how to create multiple offspring and that's how it became a race instead of a single entity that just sorta reincarnates  (i think you could probably skip straight to creating multiple offspring, in retrospect), but all the new generation are a fraction as powerful as the original. and then one of the new generation did it again and *that* created muggles, with the magic too diffused to be even usable, but that generation gained the creativity trait, but none of the "elves" ever did the multi-offspring or creativity thing again because it became idk taboo or something

  Well, the standard option is usually something like empathy or goodwill, resulting in the magic race failing to form civilizations. Or mental corruption from magical knowledge causing them to go insane or die. Or emotional corruption like Orange Lanterns.

  A rarer option is some kind of sensory failure. For example, you could make mages have permanent mage sight, so they always see the world based on how much magic an object radiates rather than how much light it does. That way they are effectively blind to mundane non-magical objects, and can be taken down by sneaky muggle rogues. Or constant communication with the spirit world so they can't hear well over the voices of the spirits.

  Some of my own ideas:

   * **Sleep**: You can make the mages require way more sleep than normal humans, like weeks of sleep for each day of activity. So even if they have the same lifespan as muggles, the amount of time they can be active during their lives is much less.
   * **Facial Recognition**: Do you know how hard facial recognition is? Programming a computer to recognize a specific person's face is ridiculously hard, we only manage it because there's "software" instincts in our brains that automatically recognize faces for us. You could take away this software from mages, so they can't distinguish between two people with similar body shapes. They can still form societies, but they would have a lot of trouble with individual identities. 
   * **Limited Memory Space**: Give mages a limited amount of memory space, as most of that space is filled up with spell components needed to cast their magics. So mages have to frequently use memory magic to choose which of their memories to keep and which to delete. They would be able to remember important information like their names and properties and contracts, so they would be able to form functioning societies. But otherwise they would behave a lot like amnesiacs, forgetting strangers, forgetting minor things they recently did, forgetting various details about their friends, etc.

They're an inflexible species that can't compete with human flexibility. Elves however are yeah, decidedly better in every way except numbers unfortunately. Even their biggest flaw, arrogance isn't really too bad.

  The easiest fix is probably to take the muggle/wizard divide further. "Muggles" can't do magic because they are immune to it or at least are highly resistant. A mage might be able to cast a spell that hurts them by heating up the air or by speeding an arrow on its way, or other circuitous means, but a "magic missile" or a healing spell would bounce off with no effect. Now, all of a sudden it has gone from a complete disadvantage to a situational advantage, but one that leaves your muggle characters unable to seek magical healing directly, leaving them with consequences. This is a fairly common trope applied on the [individual level](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnSorcerer) at least.

  Another approach to keep visibility low might be to incur some sort of karmic debt to everyone you introduce to the magical world. Now everyone could do or know magic, but you are responsible at some fundamental level for either the well-being or actions of everyone you introduce to the system. This requires an annoyingly global system of right/wrong or management though and some sort of control to prevent one person from damning themselves by introducing everybody to magic.

  To directly answer your question, if you feel the need to tilt the scales further against the wizarding population, you can always bias their experimental results with their expectations, cause technology to start to fritz out as a result, and you largely rob the magical world of the scientific method -- except for maybe a handful of monks who train to remove their internal biases, hello /r/rational. This then justifies the more classic wizard vibe in the modern world. This has already been explored pretty effectively in the Dresden Files and the like, though.

  I find it interesting that you immediately thought elves were smarter.

  Have you ever actually read something where this is proven? as in, Elves are the ones who push forward science? elves are the ones that are glib talkers who will outsmart you in every deal?

   Elves... live in tree houses in the forest. 

  As far popular depictions of Elves go, they're always wise. Never smart.

    I got the depiction of smarter elves from Eragon, and it is the main reason I stopped reading the series.

    The elves in Eragon are just straight up... better, then all the other races. They're clearly the author's 'favorite child', so to speak. Immortal, scientific atheists  whose cultures explores magic in a kind of experimental way (and therefore they are the best at magic, which really is an analog to science in the series).

    Even in mental combat they have the advantage; I finished the series a while ago, but I don't think I ever saw an elf depicted as being anything less than an expert in mental combat (which in Eragon is based on things like focus and willpower, so apparently elves beat humans there as well).

    And their minds are shown to be special as well; whenever Eragon touches the mind of elf he remarks on how strange and beautiful they are compared to human minds. 

    So to be honest, the groundwork for my drive to find a way to make muggles 'special', comes from reading a passage in one of the Eragon books where an asshole elf rants about how dumb/inferior 'humans' are, and realizing that, in the context of the book, the elf was kind of right. The elves were longer-lived, faster, stronger, smarter, better at magic and better at telepathy. In Eragon, humans really did have nothing to offer the world, that the other races didn't do better.

  In harry potter wizards slowly loose abilities due to the inventors not sharing how to do said ability. Dwarves are notorious for not sharing their forging techniques. In these asian fantasy novels I am reading the sword-arts and potion/alchemy recepies are secrets that are kept in certain states/sects/schools maybe muggles are more prone to share knowledge and thus learn faster?
