      My guess is that he wants the Praesi in charge of collecting and leashing all the horrible shit in the world, using the school as the prison.  No one is better qualified, and if anything does go wrong, there will be piles of heroes on hand to deal with it.

  So, everybody seems to like it, so I’m probably missing something. That said, as much as I like school settings (when they’re in the story with a generally younger cast), aren’t the Named just, well, *not about that*? If I understand Bard’s implied bargain correctly, it was supposed to limit the divine pissing contest and Fate influence to champions, and instead backfired by Named dragging everyone else into their conflicts, and Bard being forced to keep it going. But how is *compulsory education* a “play on the alleged purpose of creation”?

  The notion doesn’t seem to be congruous with the setting. Even if we’re talking about a medieval *universitas*-like institution - with disputes, riots and all - the only precedent to that is Refuge, and it’s held together by the personal authority of Ranger, and only “teaches” combat-related subjects. There’s simply no other reason for mostly combative Named to stay together for an extended period of time. Cat’s idea is reflective of her origins as a Squire explicitly mentored by a Black Knight, but why would anybody else be agreeing to that?

  Other than that, the proposed subjects are something that would be expected to be a part of the treaty instead. If the idea *started* with building a magic academy, and had the conditions for Named participation tacked on later, I would understand, since the magic studies are actually subject to the kind of centralization needed for that (from separate mage towers to extended apprenticeship systems to whole orders and libraries), but the pitch was stated as “put all the mentors in one place, and build a city there” (why?). That doesn’t look much more stable than regular mentor story, and we know how those are supposed to end. What’s supposed to be special about a Named directly telling other Named “do not break those” that can’t be subverted over generations the same way normal treaties are?

  I just don’t get why is everyone so excited about this other than “lol we hogwarts now”. Hogwarts was specifically modeled after old private schools, and while an academy is a good point to shift the focus from direct conflict to learning, on the current Calernia it’s not a *starting* point.

    Long response time, brace yourself.

    > how is *compulsory education* a “play on the alleged purpose of creation”?

    My understanding is that the "play on the alleged purpose of creation" isn't related to the education at all, it's the rules about Named conflict. She isn't prohibiting it, she's restricting it to a form where stories can still play out without massive collateral damage. The education's purpose is simply to ensure they all know the rules, why they exist, and how they will be enforced. Between historical Calernia, modern Calernia, relatively alien settings like the Everdark, and foreign lands like the ancestral home of the elves and the gnomish empire, we know Named conflict can take a variety of forms. There's no reason to assume this is inherently less stable.

    >The notion doesn’t seem to be congruous with the setting. Even if we’re talking about a medieval *universitas*\-like institution - with disputes, riots and all - the only precedent to that is Refuge, and it’s held together by the personal authority of Ranger

    Named are rare enough that I think we have to expand the scope to larger polities than academic institutions. There are multiple isolationist states in Calernia--the Kingdom Under, the Titanomachy, the Golden Broom, and, to an extent, Daoine--and at least three of the four explicitly have, or have had, Named. It's rare for their people to leave for any reason, and we have little evidence of them spitting out their Named to wreak havoc on the outside world. Likewise, all have been politically stable for centuries, which means they can't be suffering extreme, regular internal strife from Named conflict. It's entirely plausible that Named could gather in one place without running rampant, especially if that place grants them a controlled fashion to settle disputes in the form of duels.

    > There’s simply no other reason for mostly combative Named to stay together for an extended period of time.

    It's worth noting that, while most Named engage in combat in the series, their Names aren't inherently focused on it. Adjutant, Scribe, and the various ruling Names all deal primarily with administration and organization. Sorcerous names have immense combat potential, but magic is a versatile tool--Hierophant, at the very least, would very much prefer research to combat. Names also vary based on culture and the sociopolitical climate. Adjutant is the first orc Named since the Praesi conquest of the Steppes, and his Name bears no resemblance to historical Orc names. In times of peace, it's likely that combative Names would emerge less frequently.

    Also, they'll go because enough important people are working together that it's easier than *not* going. Not all Names are equal.

    >Other than that, the proposed subjects are something that would be expected to be a part of the treaty instead. If the idea *started* with building a magic academy, and had the conditions for Named participation tacked on later, I would understand, since the magic studies are actually subject to the kind of centralization needed for that (from separate mage towers to extended apprenticeship systems to whole orders and libraries)

    I agree with you here, but maybe for different reasons than the ones you bring up. You're definitely right that magical academia would benefit from centralization, but more importantly, it would *scale*. There are enough people with magical potential that an academy would have *huge* returns. For Named, though? You don't need a university, and you certainly don't need a university *city*. There are maybe one or two hundred named on the continent at any given time, and they probably only need a semester or two of schooling to grasp the ins and outs of the proposed laws regulating Named behavior. There would never be enough of them at the school to justify its existence by themselves.

    >the pitch was stated as “put all the mentors in one place, and build a city there” (why?). That doesn’t look much more stable than regular mentor story, and we know how those are supposed to end.

    The chapter doesn't actually say anything about mentors. Obviously, the academy would have instructors, and at least some of them would be Named, but the goal isn't to make the academy itself into a story. The instructors' goal wouldn't be to form a relationship with students, but to provide information. Teachers, in this instance, are an expendable, interchangeable part of the machinery of education.

    >What’s supposed to be special about a Named directly telling other Named “do not break those” that can’t be subverted over generations the same way normal treaties are?

    "Over generations" is a big part of this, I think. Sure, someone born decades into peacetime might not know the horrors of war, and might think it's a good idea to break the rules, but villains in this setting *don't age*, and villains are among the architects of this plan. It would take a long time for the Accords to fall apart by attrition. Said architects are also some of the most experienced, powerful, and intimidating Named of an era, so that's a point in favor of obeying the rules. Eventually, though, the goal isn't to have a few big names enforcing the rules, it's to have *everyone* enforcing the rules. If Calernia is free from Named conflict for a century, then some punk levels a city, it won't be just another Named running amok, it'll be *the biggest catastrophe in living memory*. People will see the horror for what it is, and they'll be tripping over themselves to stop the guilty party.

    The only way the system can really fall apart at that point is if an entire side (Good or Evil) breaks from the Accords at once, or if enough Named from both sides worked together to subvert it. Granted, there's another possibility: the now organized and educated Named jointly come to the conclusion that they would rule better than current institutions. Don't really know what to do about that if it happens.

    Yeah, the whole academy things seems super weird to me. I really don't see how they could make it work.

    Like, if someone's Name is "The Sadistic Assassin" or "The Anarchist", why would they ever accept to attend that school? Because other Named would force them? Saint's death shows that Named aren't great at coordinating to enforce rules, especially across the Above-Below divide.

    And why would the Dominion ever agree to these terms, let alone the friggin Dread Empire? They were almost willing to start an open war just to retrieve the Pilgrim's body, why would they accept to send their Named to another jurisdiction?

    And, even accepting that every nation somehow manages to enforce mandatory attendance... wouldn't the resulting school be super-segregated, Good students sticking with Good students and reciprocally, with mutual sabotage attempts and the like?
    ```

  - u/NZPIEFACE:
    ```
    > why would anybody else be agreeing to that?

    Cause Good heroes have their mentors saying "This is good idea, shut up and do it", and villains have blades pointed to them.

    She's making it compulsory. It's a part of the Accords.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Or, more directly, because “the mentor said so” isn’t that good a reason for anyone outside of Levant - and not even all Named there. The idea to drag everyone into the same city misses a whole swathe of stories about more standalone Named, and those whose Roles are about circumventing the law, like rogues and schemers. A lot of those need to be cut out, like diabolists and angelic intervention, but not all, and it doesn’t address the problem of what to do with their stories (that are both the core of the problem and not going to disappear on their own).

      Likewise, “the Accords say so” is a motivation of a politician running a country subject to them, not of Named that speak mostly for themselves. You need a way to enforce that, and Names *exist* for transcending those kinds of restrictions. Name *one* hero that was bestowed despite legal means being sufficient for resolving their core conflict.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        >Name one hero that was bestowed despite legal means being sufficient for resolving their core conflict.

        Hierophant just wanted to do research and find a way to hack reality. Perfectly legal and sensible motivation, unlike 95% of Named who just want to start yet another nationalistic pissing contest(waaaaaah independence for Callow, waaaaaah your ruler is bad and we will crusade you to death) within their crab bucket of Calernia.

        Of course, he is good as dead now, on account of losing his magic. And 95% of other Named want some variation of "I am sad because big bad people hurt my feelings, and no I don't understand how systemic incentives work, gotta go stab the biggest baddest guy in the face right now". So yeah, it's not looking workable.

          You missed his “don’t look at the other prisoners, look at the bars” speech; after witnessing the unmaking of his childhood home, the unraveling of the secrets of Creation *is* his personal struggle. Besides, he’s not a hero: villains start with an explicit desire to reshape the world way more often. 

          As for your (unnecessarily oversimplified) demonstration of initial motivation - yeah, stories are for making the political struggle personal for the hero.  Not sure how an academy far away from their region of origin is supposed to help with that.
          ```

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            >the unraveling of the secrets of Creation is his personal struggle.

            Yeah, but, like, that's not illegal. Magic research is not illegal. Definitely legal in Praes, maybe some other countries ban it.
            ```

        > Name one hero that was bestowed despite legal means being sufficient for resolving their core conflict.

        I mean, Hierarch's whole shtick is that he *is* the legal means.
        ```

        - u/melmonella:
          ```
          Hierarch is rule of the mob within his own pet legal system. Him being "legal means" would be like if Mexico came to China and started punishing everyone for failing to pay taxes to the Mexican government, and otherwise violating Mexican laws. Except in this analogy Mexico also has some kind of ridiculously powerful mind-controlling weapon that actually lets them back up their claims with pure force.

          Hierarch is not rule of the law, he is the rule of the biggest stick.
          ```

        - u/Zayits:
          ```
          Anaxares had been a diplomat (someone already directly concerned with resolving tensions between polities), and was told that he’s now the *ruler*, which is a blasphemy for someone of his origins. His legal means (the laws of the League) are indeed insufficient for satisfying his personal desires (abdication).
          ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      I could see magic academy-based centre for villains, a place of learning and power that follows Below’s objective of becoming more - that’s the reason Praes’ villains gravitate to the Tower. I could see a Good institution in the vein of real-life theological universities - already some heroes like Stalwart Paladin come from places like that, and Levantines put their Bestowed on the rolls.

      But while the two use the same basic framework, their purposes kind of pull them into opposite directions. The only precedent we have for a mixed institution  so far is, again, Refuge - which remains stable due to Ranger’s ban on conflicts between students. Using it to *contain* the conflict between heroes and villains is just asking for the school to get blown up.

      Overall, this just kind of feels a bit underwhelming and thematically inconsistent. Just like with the ban on ruler Names, it’s something you can spin as generally beneficial, and there certainly are people who want to do just that, but that doesn’t explain why this exact shape and how to enforce it with those who will protest.
      ```

      - u/NZPIEFACE:
        ```
        I think the whole point is that the school is a microcosm for the wider world while they develop their skills, so they can do their random and big bullshit out there.

        This also *really* reminds me of a [manga](https://mangadex.org/title/9854/maou-na-ano-ko-to-murabito-a) though.  
        It's a Japanese high school where there are special students with "Roles" that they try their best to fulfil.

        What does that sound like?
        ```

        - u/Zayits:
          ```
          You do realize that a standard manga/LN setting of “let’s take a typical (usually Japanese) high school and cram it somewhere it *really* doesn’t belong in” is usually a consequence of the high school setting being familiar to the audience and not a good in-universe reason, right? If the end result is anything remotely close to what the comments are bursting with right now, that might be sufficient reason to drop the series.

          School-themed spinoffs are, well, spinoffs, and doing that to PGtE would turn it into a parody of itself. So far it looks like it’s another attempt like introduction of “just war”: it aims to exclude the unsavory elements like madmen and rogues, instead of addressing them by undermining their Roles’ reason to exist. It can be subverted the same way.

          Yes, and that (aside from warrior-priests and runic arrays strong enough to seal a demon) is everything we know about them. No word on how Ministers of the East/West interact, what are their jurisdictions or their actual effectiveness at curtailing Named conflict.

    I'm sorry, what bargain?

    We've never gotten any information on how the Bard became the Bard, beyond the vague suggestion that she once opposed the Gods' experiment.

    Your theory about her making a bargain to limit the experiment to Named sounds interesting, but as far as I can tell there isn't any evidence for it.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Sorry, this isn’t even a proper theory, just a guess. It just struck me how the phrase about “grooves appearing in the workings of Fate” doesn’t necessarily mean that there should be a select few Named instead of an Arcadia-like setup, or why would there be a Fate in the first place. In the initial divine argument the final choice is what matters - and so the things that impact it are important for Gods, hence stories. But in the context of that same choice, Named don’t make the same kind of sense. However my guess is just one option as to why they work like that.
      ```

      - u/tavitavarus:

        It is an interesting theory. 

        If it was true, it would mean Cat is only the latest person to attempt to shield mortals from the Game of the Gods.

        It would also lend credence to the theory that the Bard has actually been helping Cat, in an effort to bring about the Accords.

        Certainly by encouraging the Saint she's given Cordelia plenty of reason to agree to anything that limits the influence of Named.

  I would be interested to see how/whether the Academy comes to be and whether it ends up influencing Names. Of course, people have name(Name) dropped things like Pitiless Tutor and whatnot, but what I'm talking about are how the Academy will influence things like public perception of Names, as well as the Stories and Roles that are fundamental in determining and empowering aspects.   


  Like, with all Named being more or less held accountable to a higher power (Academy and the Accords), will their Names and aspects be less powerful? Heroes and Villains draw their power from their Stories, and I feel like a Story that goes 'It all began at the Academy, where I had to answer to professors and higher laws' takes away from the romantic elements of heroic and villainous stories, which are in part what empowers Names.

  This chapter, and the previous one, calls to mind an issue that I never recognized as a potential problem. I can't recall if it was explicitly stated from Malicia's POV or inferred by Cat, but it was mentioned at one point that Malicia's deal with Neshamah included a provision allowing him to invade Praes if Malicia reneged. At the time, I saw this as Neshamah safeguarding himself against a famously traitorous empire, but now I'm seeing it as a weapon in Malicia's arsenal. If Amadeus takes the crown of Praes, there's nothing to stop her from triggering the contingency out of spite. In fact, I can't remember, but her losing the crown might have actually explicitly been the trigger condition.

  The academy instantly reminded me of Endless Space 2. In which there is an academy where all heroes (of all stripes) are trained, they have special meta powers (notably they are heroes in 4x game mechanics sense as well as name), and it's a game where you lead a nation around events using heroes and stuff.
