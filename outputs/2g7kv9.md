## [RT][DC] Primer (movie)

An underrated movie about time travel. Not going to say any more about this but it's on Netflix.

Also, I apologize if movies aren't allowed in this subreddit. Couldn't find anything about it in the sidebar.

  Sam Hughes (/u/sam512, author of *Ra* and *Fine Structure*) has written a number of things about *Primer*; [Primer Explained](http://qntm.org/primer), [Fan Commentary](http://qntm.org/commentary), [Time Travel in Primer Explained](http://qntm.org/coffin).

  I love this movie. I rented it when it came out on DVD, mostly on a whim since I knew nothing going in. After I was done, I immediately had to watch it again, in part because I felt like I only understood half of it. *Primer* is one of the best "a plot that the viewer solves" movies of all time.

  This calls into question what sort of model of time travel is actually being used in the movie. At first it seems like it's the static universe (used in HPMOR, *The Time Traveler's Wife*, *Terminator*, and many others), then it seems like it's the branching timelines model (used in *Terminator 2*, the new *Star Trek*, and many others), but that incident sort of calls that into question.

  Movies are allowed. I've only seen it once on Netflix, but I certainly enjoyed that watch. I'll get around to a second viewing someday (and third, and fourth....).

  Honestly, the most impressive aspect of this film is not the plot but the budget. [It was completed for $7000, and with only five people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film). Seven thousand! Five people! It's amazing that a timeless piece of cinema can be done like that.

    $7,000 *and* he used film stock instead of digital, which significantly increased the expense of the film (probably the right choice given the look he achieved). Shane Carruth has said that he's sort of miffed that people talk about the budget so much, in the sense that he thinks it crowds out discussion of the actual film, but pretty much everything about the production is damned impressive.

  In the vein of 'good timetravel movies', I recently saw Timecrimes (Los Cronocr√≠menes) and enjoyed it a lot. It was no Primer, but it was more tightly plotted and very fun. I recommend not reading anything about it before seeing it, it'll probably be more fun that way. It has some nudity and so forth so is not suitable for all ages.

  That director's most recent movie *Upstream Color* is fantastic as well.  Not really rational per se, but a mind-blowing and beautifully shot film.
