  Fantastic news! Mother of learning is absolute top-tier. 

  Please post again when it begins!

  Great! Zenith of Sorcery sounds even better than the Dangeon.
  ```

  - u/LLJKCicero:
    ```
    > Dangeon.

    Like a regular Dungeon, except every monster is Dan.

      ```
      Instead of ominous footsteps, you hear a consistent but quiet "Dunka Dunka"
      ```

    - u/Mandragorec:
      ```
      It's a dungeon with Dans screaming, "Dang you!" üòÖ
      ```

    - u/gramineous:
      ```
      Nah it's a spin-off of that Japanese high school murder mystery game, called Dangeon Roppa
      ```

  Zenith of Sorcery MC vs middle-aged Zorian fight when

- u/LLJKCicero:
  ```
  The story premise for Zenith of Sorcery sounds like it could easily also be the premise for The Continuing Adventures of Zorian and Friends, which is kind of funny to me for some reason.
  ```

    ```
    Honestly if he's gonna do Zenith he would've just done a story focused on Zac or Zorian like 10 years later. Or even Kirielle like 30 years later starting with Zorian getting assassinated. Already have hints of the interdimensional plot line, multiple fairly developed continents, and established Archmage characters. Only major setting difference seems to be that he wants the gods to be ascended mortals (and more importantly, for everyone to KNOW that the gods are ascended mortals). Including all the Tolkien races is a change too I guess, though MOL already had multiple sentient and humanoid races, plus multiple continents and difficult enough travel to allow newly discovered continents.

    Stories that start with a super strong protagonist often run into issues pretty quickly.

  zenith has me slightly worried because it was the second half of mol where the quality dropped off imo due in large part to zorian becoming ultra powerful.  hopefully this is good though.

  >There is a noticeable influence of xianxia on the setting.

  Oh nooooooooooooooooo

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    I got the impression that it was in terms of how magic works and progresses rather than character personalities, and I hope I am reading that right.
    ```

- u/matex_xizor:
  ```
  Great news! This is going to be amazing.
  ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  I felt like his other ideas were better suited for his style. But we'll see.
  ```

  - u/Bezant:
    ```
    I can't think of any 'mc already stupid strong' story that has been good long term.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Eh, replace strong with competent in his area. Bond, Holmes and his derivatives, Superman et al (?, IDK how good superhero arcs are though).
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I prefer Zenith to be honest
    ```

- u/Seraphaestus:
  ```
  Nice! None of the premises he posted really gripped me like MoL's does but I'll definitely be giving it a shot since I enjoyed MoL so much
  ```

  - u/EroticRubMuffin:
    ```
    You should read his Naruto fanfic if you haven't, https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5166693/1/Scorpion-s-Disciple. It's competence porn just like MoL.
    ```

- u/GlimmervoidG:
  ```
  I liked the Junkyard story idea best. It reminded me of the kitchen sink style of webcomics from back in the golden age.
  ```

- u/Tenoke:
  ```
  Huh, I didn't know his name but it kind of sounds like a name of a Mother of Learning character.
  ```

  - u/SkoomaDentist:
    ```
    ‚ÄùWhat kind of name is Zorian?‚Äù

    ‚ÄùAn Armenian one.‚Äù

    So yeah, there‚Äôs a reason for that.
    ```

- u/Gr_Cheese:
  ```
  More character dialogue this time around, please! Looking forward to the new work.

  Thanks, this gave me the opportunity to become his patreon.

  [Dead Tired](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dead-tired.894343/#post-71592214), Nobody103 edition? Let's see how it goes. I'm still nervous about how well he'll manage setting out the full array of the protagonist's powers without it force feeding us 30 chapters worth of infodump at the start, but with MoL he's definitely earned enough trust for me to watch him try.
  ```

  - u/Worthstream:
    ```
    Thanks for the link, this story looks interesting!.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Yeah I‚Äôm crossing my fingers on this. I think he‚Äôs a great writer but I can‚Äôt really think of any OP protagonist stories that actually have maintain good stories past the initial payoff.
  ```

- u/TheColourOfHeartache:
  ```
  My second favourite of his ideas, I admit I'm sad we're not getting the infinite dungeon.
