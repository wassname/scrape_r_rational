  I call it rational.  

  The stuff about people believing what Force tells them, and using this bias against them?  
  The fact that an emotionally powerful moment is actually a multiple-use joke? Nothing more than a trick, useful manipulation?

  Yeah, it feels rational.

    It’s not like I particularly intended it as Great Rational Fiction, but it does still center around an alternative explanation for why the Force might tell you that Darth Vader is your father.

      If you were to rewrite the Star Wars Story as a rational fic, from whose perspective would you find it most interesting to do it? If you could start it at any point in the timeline, whose story would be best to tell ( as a rational fic )? 

      Yoda and Sidious are obvious No-noes for me, but maybe I am wrong? Idk about Ani/Vader, that might change a bit much. Luke or Lea? I've always felt that SW can work very well as the story of Obi-Wan, so maybe that? ^^ Anyway, big fan, cheers :p

        Anakin is the obvious one, and it's not like I mind changing things up.  He could even still end up as Darth Vader, he'd just need a *legitimate reason.*

          Psychotic episode and comorbid dissociative identity disorder provoked by untreated post-traumatic stress disorder?

        I'd rewrite it around Anakin and Obi Wan, I'd make it a war buddy story first with Obi Wan and Anakin two isolated Jedi in the Republic's army, raising in ranks until one is General but the other keeps getting his promotions deferred over his reckless, anger-prone behaviour, then introduce a love triangle, keep Anakin believe himself Luke and Leia's dad, and have a double-take reveal in the trilogy prequels where it turns out it was really Obi Wan the dad all along.

    I am not sure if this falls under the bounds of rationality but it seems like there is a very common trope where  some horrible secret is revealed and immediately believed despite the lack of significant evidence. I suppose a rational take on this would involve the characters deciding to actually investigate the claims and demand evidence before coming to a conclusion.

    I recall a similar fanfic for Code Geass where the scene of Schneizel revealing that Zero / Lelouch possesses a mind-control Geass and turns the Black Knights against him goes differently with the Black Knights demanding proof and ultimately remaining loyal when it cannot be provided.

    Does anyone else have similar ideas for other fiction?

    It sounds cool. Not everything that sounds cool has to be rational.

  I don't understand how this is rationalfic at all, but it is certainly hilarious. I can't stop laughing right now.

      It's rational because it's not an anime ISOT and because Yud wrote it. Lol.

    I like this one better actually. It's certainly less hilarious, but it takes itself a little more serious.

  I 'm getting incredibly strong Homestuck vibes from this chat log. Maybe because it's a chat log, dunno.

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    Maybe I'm secretly Andrew Hussie!  Or, y'know, I read Homestuck and was influenced by it.  But it’s probably the secret identity one.

  now we need a reason why yoda doesn't explain to luke that sith can spoof. maybe he thinks making luke too distrustful of the force will lead him down the wrong path.

  V: lol
  S: Vader this isn't funny
  V: it's totally funny

    ```
    clearly in this AU vader and sidious killed yoda. they never fought him 2 on 1 in canon, after all.
    ```

- u/abcd_z:
  ```
  In this universe, Force Ghosts are actually manifestations of the viewer's subconscious mind and can't actually tell them anything they didn't already know.  Otherwise, Obi Wan's force ghost would have corrected Luke.

  Still doesn't explain how Obi Wan pulled that vanishing act when Darth Vader killed him, though.
