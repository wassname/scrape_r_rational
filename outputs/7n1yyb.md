## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  **Pint-sized time travel**

  You discover that you have the ability travel backwards in time. Specifically, you're able to, at will, instantly send your consciousness back exactly one minute into the past, upon where it will overwrite the mind of your past self (I.e. mental time travel). You also realise that you can use this ability up to 5 times every 24 hour period, with no immediate cooldown (so you can, at most, travel back 5 minutes per day by chaining your uses). 

  You could obviously use it to win at gambling, but what bigger picture uses for this ability are there? How would you exploit this ability to its maximum?

  **Scenario Two:** 

  Suppose you have the same ability as above. However, now a random person you know in your circle of friends (~30 people) has the exact same ability. How would you attempt to find out who that person is (preferably without them realizing it)? If necessary, how would you attempt to apprehend that person?

    > Suppose you have the same ability as above. However, now a random person you know in your circle of friends (~30 people) has the exact same ability. How would you attempt to find out who that person is (preferably without them realizing it)?

    Depends a bit on how the ability works.

    Consider this plan: For the next 30 days, pick one friend and have a 20 minute private conversation in a private location. Towards the end of the conversation, without any warning, take out a knife and stab your friend. (If you aren't stronger than your friend, train to be stronger before attempting.) Be on guard around the 14 to 19 minute mark of the conversation.

    There are a two possible outcomes:

    Case 1) You successfully stab and murder your friend.

    Spend a few minutes stabbing your friend to death, then revert 5 minutes to back before you stabbed your friend. Since they died without using any time rewind ability, this likely indicates that they do not have the time rewind ability (do this early in the day so they haven't used up their 5 minutes yet). Because if they did have a time rewind ability, why didn't they use it to prevent their death?

    Since you rewinded to before your murder attempt, no one notices anything wrong. Proceed to stab your next friend tomorrow.

    Case 2) Sometime around the 14 to 19 minute mark, your friend will suddenly react as if they just came back from a future where you stabbed them. 

    Watch for signs of this, such as sudden shudders, sudden attacks, sudden attempts to flee without any explanation, etc. Now you know your friend has the time rewind ability, but this is the part where things get tricky, depending on the specifics of your time rewind ability.

    The problem is, you now have an angry time traveler that is very wary of your future murder attempt. The question is, can you still use your time rewind ability? You haven't used it at this point in time, after all. And you wouldn't use it in the original future either, since your friend used his ability before dying, and you only use your ability after your friend dies, which never happens. So I would think yes, you can. Use your ability to rewind back 5 minutes, and now your friend (who has already used up his 5 minutes) can't follow you back. So you effectively arrive at a past where your friend, the other time traveler, still has no idea you were even attempting anything funny. Now you know your friend has the time rewind ability, with no one knowing you know.

      An excellent and well thought response. 

      How would you handle scenario 2? Knowing that your adversary has the ability to gather information from YOU and your environment possibly without you knowing, what opsec countermeasures could you apply to negate this?

      Or what I'd want to know is: how to resist investigation/interrogation from a person with mental time travel. Could you lie? How would you ensure cross scenario consistency? Any way to prevent your moves from being predicted?

          You don't need to be quite so secure with this since you know the power can only take back five minutes at a time.  OP does specify that they have the exact same power, so we know they have the same limitations.  Therefore you don't have to precommit to never giving out your information, even under torture, you just need to precommit to waiting at least five minutes after the perpetrator has revealed himself before giving out information.  Store all of your information under some fancy lock or encryption program that, when someone attempts to access, leaves some signal that it has been accessed, waits for five minutes, and only then actually opens.  So even if they get your password they won't be able to access your files without leaving a trace.

          Similarly, if you have personal knowledge that you might allow people to know, such as your home address, but don't want people knowing without your awareness, you can precommit to only give out that information at least five minutes after deciding to give it out.  Then the only people to be suspicious of are people you decide to give it to but end up suddenly leaving without the information before the five minutes are up.

              It depends on the context.  These posts generally imply some sort of background knowledge where you have been told exactly the contents of the post ahead of time by a reliable source, or have acquired this information in some way.  Otherwise, how would you know you even had this power and how to use it?  When is the last time you mentally attempted to go back in time exactly one minute?  When is the last time you attempted to read the mind of someone while you were touching them?  You might jokingly try some powers every once in a while, but we have very strong evidence for living in a world where these powers don't exist, so you don't try every permutation of possible triggers for powers in order to discover which ones actually work.  So if you did happen to spontaneously acquire one of these powers, you wouldn't even realize it unless something informed you.

              So I think we can assume for the sake of munchkinry that the post is 100% accurate and that this is common knowledge, but in practice I would be cautious, and probably suspicious of everyone ever in case they also had similar powers.

    In scenario two, where I have a friend with the same ability, we can work together to send information a lot further than five minutes into the past.

    To take an example, let us say that there is a lottery in which ticket sales close two hours before the results are made public. I observe the results, then I go back in time five minutes and tell my friend.

    He hears me give him the results five minutes early, then goes back in time to tell me.

    I hear the results from him nine minutes early (it took a bit of time for him to hear the results). Since I have not yet used my five minutes today, I go back in time five minutes and tell him the results.

    He hears the results from me thirteen minutes early, and goes back in time...

    --------------

    About two hours before the numbers are drawn, just before ticket sales close, we each purchase a ticket with the right numbers and share a large prize.

    So, basically, as long as the two of us work together (and can trust each other), we can send small bits of data back through time an arbitrary amount (at the risk of one of us mishearing at some point and getting the data wrong).

      Ah the future-pill gambit. I remember that one.

      This assumes you can absolutely trust your friend. In the lottery example, betrayal isn't that bad, but you would want to be very sure of them before you tried this with anything with potentially lethal consequences.

        In all fairness, trust has to be extended in both directions - and if something goes wrong, it'd be impossible to tell whether it was you or him a few dozen steps ago.

        This can easily be made to work out to a Prisoners Dilemma.

    I mean in the first scenario it strikes me that the obvious use would be in stocks, since any ability to consistently outcompete the market is going to potentially make you the richest person alive.                    
    Once you've done that it's rather difficult to imagine many likely scenarios where you can make a massive difference by going up to five minutes into the past, so mainly you're going to affect the world by being absurdly wealthy. You could also potentially make your abilities known which would make you famous and come with wealth that way, but this would come with many drawbacks and likely being barred from manipulating stocks the same way.
