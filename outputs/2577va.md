## [HSF/DC] "Rapture of the Nerds": "A sane species would ignore these get-evolved-quick schemes, but there's always someone who'll take a bite from the forbidden apple."

  The reason why I love this story despite its flaws is that it accurately depicts how a singularity without FAI and run by nerds would actually end up looking like, ie. horrifyingly ad-hoc.

    In which the planet is dismantled for computronium because someone wanted to reference HG2G.

    Oh, and you can totally go posthuman, but nobody actually tells you what that means first, so most people are too scared.

    And they have no concept of CEV so they just run myriad parallel copies of you to evaluate your decision processes.

      That's my point, it's thoughtlessly horrible and abusive and hilariously bad from a UX perspective. A rapture _of the nerds_, in other words.

        Yeah, I'm just laughing with you about it.

  It was a sufficiently fun read that I'm going to have to throw them some money for it, even if they did get a bunch of things worryingly wrong.

    You just reminded me to post *Accelerando* (also Stross) - I read it shortly afterwards and it's the best singularity story I've read, for the first five-ninths.  The remainder is excellent but still vaguely comprehensible, and loses points for that.  

    Imagine *Rapture of the Nerds*, but subtract *Makers* and flavor with a girl who creates her own sovereign nation from the Jovian system with exponential 3D printers, a two month head-start, and pure nerve.
    ```
