  Bard better watch her kidneys.

  ```
  Cat's getting her evil boots wet. I'm surprised she's so opposed to blood magic to help out Killian when she's obviously willing to execute people. It isn't like it requires their souls or anything.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Cat's moral system does seem pretty inconsistent. She killed someone for talking back to her last chapter.
    ```

    - u/JdubCT:
      ```
      Well, to be fair that was an Assassin. I don't think we've seen Catherine ever killing someone truly innocent. Although I'm willing to bet when she's "evil" enough she'll be willing to watch innocent people die because it's not her problem/responsibility(say, for instance, Procereans).
      ```

      - u/MoralRelativity:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure that was a Smuggler. Afterwards Cat talked with the assassins and let them go.
        ```
