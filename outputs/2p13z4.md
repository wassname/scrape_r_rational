  Yay! I loved your story when you posted the prologue at the beginning of RaNaNoWriMo. I can't wait to read more of it.

  Warning: ponies tag needed.

  Also, is this seriously a version of my little pony where everyone's been killed by nuclear weapons? I appreciate irony as much as the next guy, but...*why*?

    ```
    The same answer applies here as with all human undertakings. "Because we can."

    Well it's actually a fanfic of a fanfic. The original fallout equestria is actually one of the most famous my little pony fanfics and a really good read (though quite dark in places). If you're a big fan of the fallout games and MLP you will probably really enjoy it.

      Righto right here. 

      The original Fallout: Equestria is responsible for me getting into fanfiction in the first place. And while this story's universe is *mostly* the same as the original's, it *is* a separate one, working under my rules and with my characters. Sorta in the same way Methods is separate from HP Canon.

    ```
    Maybe people just aren't interested in reading about the vanilla Fallout world that they've seen only in video games, and need the extra emotional tie to the setting that a crossover into some other medium provides? There are a few vanilla-Fallout stories on FanFiction.net ([285 with at least 40,000 words](https://www.fanfiction.net/game/Fallout/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&len=40)), but certainly none of them has gained a following comparable to *Fallout: Equestria*'s, and video games in general [have a lot fewer stories written about them](https://www.fanfiction.net/game/) than do settings in other media.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's exactly that irony that propels the story. FO:E is entirely about virtues and adversity. It's also like 620,000 words long, tightly-paced, and holy crap does it keep its details straight. A worthy read.
    ```
