  This is great as usual! Although I must say, Red seemed to miss a bit too many cues during the conversation. Especially when he kept jumping to the wrong conclusions regarding the Sandslash. Was expecting a bit more cunning on his part!

    Yeah, I was a little disappointed in his intelligence. Origin Of Species has spoiled me. This Red has quite a ways to go. I look forward to seeing his journey, though.

      I can certainly understand the disappointment. Line!Red is definitely not Origin!Red, largely because I believe DaystarEld has done that in a manner far greater than I am capable of. Line!Red is reasonably smart, but he is not a genius, and lacks experience.

      Writing the Sandslash part of the conversation was actually the portion of this chapter I agonised over the most, as it's a tricky line to walk. In the end, I decided on the slightly less-brilliant approach when I placed myself in Red's position for a while - he's quite intelligent, but this is also his first meeting with a man of tremendous power and considerable dread. He's feeling a lot of pressure, and I felt that if I had been in his position, I would have flubbed the question.

      Red is not *incapable* of working this question out himself - rather, he came into the conversation with a preconceived notion, and when it was broken he was too flatfooted to think it through properly. On reflection, this does not come across clearly enough in the text, and this'll be a priority on any retroactive edits that are made.

      Thanks very much for the feedback, it's much appreciated. (ping /u/Golden_Magician - I'm not sure if Reddit sends alerts for once-removed replies to comments)

        You're welcome! I was checking this story for the promised update almost every day back in September and am glad that you got back to it. To elaborate on my point, it was clear to me how you were walking the line (hehe) between portraying Red's cleverness and his inexperience and actually appreciate the latter showing. It makes your Red more unique, in different ways than Game of Champions!Red and Origin!Red. It just seemed to be somewhat forced at a some points of the conversation, as you surmised. 

        On a side note, I found your world-building and especially the pallet part to be brilliant as usual.

  Forget Red's Journey. I want to see a war fic set in this universe.

  I liked this chapter. Reclamation is a project that I can understand, and see myself getting behind as I told myself it was for the betterment of mankind. Especially if it's obvious that you can tell theres been genetic damage from the incident.

  Huh. So instead of this being a world which is arbitrarily darker and more vicious than canon, things are this way as a direct result of events occurring pre-canon. I don't think I've ever seen this one done before. I am now sad that it has taken this long for someone to think of it and do it well. This is really cool, looking foawrd to more.
  ```

  As yet unclear whether Giovanni will be in any way as villainous as canon (and that's as it should be - we only just met him), but there's a definite edge to him; my internal voice consistently dropped an octave when I read his dialogue compared to Red's.

  Great stuff. Glad to see this return to active writing.
