  Horror time travel web comic that has been updating consistently every day for over two years!

    I was JUST about to post it here! I thoroughly agree in it's recommendation. It has over 1,000 updates so far and I'm currently making an pdf version of the comic. I only finished chapter 1 and 2 so far out of the 14 chapters though.

    It starts out as an average woman involved in weird circumstances and she gets smarter about how to deal with things throughout the story. She reminds me a bit of Taylor Hebert, only less cynical and is slowly learning to munchkin time travel instead of bugs. In addition, it's not too much of a spoiler after the second chapter, but [the time travel is ](#s "being caused by something that reminds me a lot of Lovecraft's Old Ones.")

    >>  Sisyphus (6k words): Harry is caught in a time loop, starting at his eleventh birthday

    That time loop was wasted on him. How is it possible to be so shit?
    ```

    - u/literal-hitler:
      ```
      I can't find it, but there's one where Dumbledore tries to... Dumbledore Harry into a time loop for 20 years, but it ends up being Ron instead. The loop resets every time he goes to sleep, so Ron sleeps for 5 more minutes for 20 years.

      If you're ever wondering if things could be worse, you could be Ron.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      What would you do with the time loop? It's said fairly clearly you can't get out of it, explore anything, do anything much different than the first time around, etc. I didn't see much way to game it really.
      ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      I think you missed the point of the story. The loop isn't 'wasted' on him; the loop is torture that takes away all meaning from his life.

      The only way mistake I see Harry making is not seeking novelty once Voldemort is dead. (before Voldemort is dead he did try seeking novelty, but it ends up killing him) Disappear after completing the necessary storyline, move to a different random city every time, and you can possibly have a tolerable life.

      I suppose he'd get there eventually, now that he knows the script for the first seven years.

    Done.

    >  For once, Temari manages to bond with Gaara...

    So going to read it.
    ```

- u/Traiden04:
  ```
  I encountered a manga which I found very interesting, if nothing else.

  Boku dake ga Inai Machi - Guy has time rewind on himself when people around him are in danger of dieing that he has the power to stop.
  To say anything more would be spoiling the mystery.
  ```

  - u/Magodo:
    ```
    Ooh, I was looking at watching the anime of this. Which one is better do you think?
    ```

    - u/Traiden04:
      ```
      Given that the Anime, I think, only just started airing recently; it would depend on your level of patience on if you want to watch the show or get the whole story all at once by reading it.
      ```

    - u/bassicallyboss:
      ```
      Haven't read the manga, but the anime is pretty high quality, for what it's worth.
      ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    Just wanted to chime in; good recommendation! I read it all yesterday and very much enjoyed it.
    ```

- u/Shadawn:
  ```
  [Darwin's Game](http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/darwins-game-r8466/) - manga about a deadly game in real world with superpowers. While not exactly rational, it feels very smart with challenges and decisions of main characters.
  ```

- u/Gaboncio:
  ```
  [Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1827/Seirei_no_Moribito)

  While the setting is not explicitly rational (the magic, in particular is very vague, like Lord of the Rings), the plot and character interactions are smart and consistent. It's an incredibly good anime, with vivid animation and thoughtful writing; I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime, no matter the genre.
  ```

- u/Shrlck:
  ```
  Things that I enjoyed in February:

  * Change Storms: Induction (well known for /r/rational)
  * [Saga](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15704307-saga-volume-1), a graphic novel. I read the vols 1 to 5: consistent story and art. Vol 1 won an Hugo award. 
  * Fate / Stay Night [Unlimited blade works]. Anime incarnation of this visual novel.
  ```
