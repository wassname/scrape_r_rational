    She's the high priestess directly communing with two goddesses, so I'd say she's exceptionally religious.

  Gods this meetup was as glorious as I expected.

    Oh, right, the priestess, the priestess for Drows. The priestess chosen specifically to lead Drows, Drows' priestess...that priestess?

  Did she make the commander break her own fingers or was that a metaphor?

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    She's gonna make them all break their own fingers and also take their horses, armor, and weapons.

    She's making them useless. Depriving them of their identity and purpose.
    ```

    - u/tavitavarus:
      ```
      With mage healing their fingers will be fine in a couple of weeks. That was just Catherine making a point.

      The more important bit is taking their horses and weapons, which will put the cataphracts out of action for the duration of the campaign in Iserre.
      ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        Especially note the 'weapons' part.

        Horsebowmen require completely different forms of bow than foot archers.  In addition, they are special elite troops of a nation, they have specific gear, most likely made for them by that nation. They can't just pick up longbows and go at it, and even the short bows some infantry might use will likely be inferior.  (The Mongols, for instance, had a special kind of recurve bow that only they made and used, using a European shortbow would be a downgrade.)

        Unless the Tyrant brought backup weapons for them planning on just something like this to happen, they are pretty much done unless they can get resupplied from Helike, and anyone in the way will happily ambush their supply train... so to truly fix the problem, they'd have to spread themselves out and get slaughtered or move the entire army back home.

          **JUST.  AS.  PLANNED.**

          >unless they can get resupplied

          And don't forget one of the largest players in that particular market, the dwarves, are shutting off everyone else.

          ```
          We know Stygia has really high quality mages in a "significant" quantity
          ```

      - u/drakeblood4:
        ```
        With mage healing you can intentionally heal the bones wrong. Break them badly enough, or in multiple places, and the ordeal of repairing those hands becomes much larger, if it's even possible.
        ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        Mages and priests in the army is not something that's normal. Callow and Praes are super weird even before the Reforms.

        Procer was just getting to the point they had dedicated warpriests and thier mages were very rudimentary.
        ```

        - u/tavitavarus:
          ```
          Atalante is famed for its priests though, there must be some among the League army.

          Mages are far from unheard of in most armies, the reason they aren't usually used by Procer is political. Stygia makes extensive use of mages and we know the Tyrant has his own mage cadres. The Levantines also use 'binders' in their armies. 

          What Black changed with the Reforms is how they are trained and used.
          ```

          - u/Mountebank:

            >What Black changed with the Reforms is how they are trained and used.

            Right. In other nations, the mages and priests are individuals with their own skill sets and unique training and aptitude. Some might be really good and some might be terrible. What Black did was standardize the mage training curriculum to focus on specific spells and rituals that even the worst mages can take part in and were designed for open combat. This standardization made the mages interchangeable and allowed commanders to always know and predict what kind of spells they'll have access to in every encounter at the cost of flexibility.
            ```

      - u/hayshed:
        ```
        There's some pretty specific bits about healing broken bones when Cat is at the military academy - she could break their fingers, mage heal them, *and then break them again to make it stick.* Is she that ruthless? is the question.
        ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      Is she going to do it to all of them? it looked like she might have just been talking to general pallas when she said that.
      ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        All of them I think.

        The point is to make them pay. Slights and prices. Callowan justice.
        ```

      - u/MimicSquid:
        ```
        She was only talking to General Pallas, but she was talking about punishing all 4,000 troops.
        ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    Yes.
    ```
