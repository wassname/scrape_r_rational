## Best audibles right now?

### Post:

Current like unsouled series, and the reborn apocalypse series. I just need a fantasy story with rational characters. Litrpg fiction is filled with wish fulfillment harem trash.

  If you like Unsouled, you might also like:

  * **Street Cultivation** by Sarah Lin, which is an urban fantasy cultivation novel. Think Cradle meets Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat.
  * **Mage Errant** by John Bierce. Magical academy, ala Mother of Learning. Short and fast paced like Cradle.
  * My own books. **Arcane Ascension** is a JRPGsih magical school and dungeon crawling series with lots of magic system detail. **War of Broken Mirrors** is darker, more political and traditional fantasy. **Weapons & Wielders** is lighthearted JRPGish adventuring with more comedy than the other options. **How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps** is more of a LitRPG and parody.

  Worm has a pretty solid fan made audiobook. Mother of learning also has an audiobook in progress. The bobverse series is pretty fun scifi.

    +1 for Bobiverse. It's a bit silly at times and not always totally realistic, but it at least tries to be rational which is what I'm really looking for in fiction.

      Mother of learning has an audiobook that I think is already complete, you just have to be chill with baby noises in the background occasionally.

      I really love how the author handles >!the possible problem of having an exponentially reproducing intelligent entity in the universe without having it go off the rails by having the entity just not particularly feel like reproducing much!<

        Agreed. Itâ€™s a nice spin on that. Also all the existential crisis are handled fairly well.

  If you want something on audible, I would recommend Vlad Taltos. I found it in a Rec thread on here. Vlad is a Homo Sapiens in a world where the thoroughly alien Dragaerans are dominant. While the Dragaerans refer to themselves as human, earth Humans are second class citizens, lower than the dusty peasant class.

  Vlad grew up hard, raised by a father he despised as a collaborator, hotheaded and fallible in the way that people with rough upbringings often are.

  With that said, Vlad and all the characters around him are intelligent, capable of intricate planning and interpersonal relationships.

  The action is fast and furious, the dialogue is pithy and sharp, and the Worldbuilding is deep and wide.

  The audiobook itself is very entertaining and well-spoken. There are a lot of books, released out of chronological order. I follow the release order but you may not prefer to.
