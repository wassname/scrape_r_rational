  Chapter 51 is [here](https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/2017/03/07/sharp-as-sword-blades-ch-12-daniel-hernandez/). 

  Next week's update will include the first chapter of Sequence 5, which I've finally decided to call "Sunlight." It's going to be longer than the other Sequences but will carry us to the end of 2014. 

  I've been told that the pacing has been better in this Sequence, but I feel that I'm falling short on the character end of things: We haven't done as much with Austin as I would like, we haven't seen much of the Indian kids, and I'm not sure if all of the members of PALATINATE feel alive yet.

    Maybe pair each chapter? One chapter that advances a plot, one that's just a slice of life for those characters? Just get in their heads and have a conversation.

    Chapter 50 feels like the plot is advancing (or, in this case, being set up), while chapter 51 feels like getting to know the characters (with some incidental developments snuck in there).

    Edit: For the characterization chapters, go with characters that haven't had as much screen time, ideally interacting with characters they otherwise haven't interacted with.

      That definitely sounds like a good idea, now that I have to post the chapters in pairs.
