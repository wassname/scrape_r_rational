[Spoilers Fall of Doc Future/Skybreaker's Call]

EDIT: The scenario is explicitly discussed in http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/81156411972/skybreakers-call-chapter-15 well before the actual invasion happens. Feel free to ignore this thread.

Hello,

I've finished Fall of Doc Future (found here: http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/34751426243/doc-prologue )

I'm currently on chapter 29 of Skybreaker's Call (found here: http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/63708903466/skybreakers-call-prologue )

(These works are intended to be rational, they're by /u/DocFuture )

Earth is being invaded by a fleet of space ships, and Flicker aka Skybreaker has the ability to A. Move really fast/exert a lot of force. B. 'entropy dump' so that she doesn't explode from all the energy/force involved.

Flicker is destroying some of the ships in the fleet by throwing rocks from the Earth but releases harmful radiation in the process. Shouldn't she have done this from the moon instead (she could have brought rocks/tungsten to the moon ahead of time and gone directly to the moon as soon as the invaders were spotted)?

Many of the characters (Stella, Doc, Yiskah) are supposed to be super-geniuses (literally the smartest people on earth + cybernetic brain upgrades), so isn't it a plot hole that they missed this?

EDIT: Now the invading fleet has destroyed Flicker's piles of rocks by scanning the ground and locating them. Admittedly I didn't anticipate this directly, but I did imagine flicker using underground bases on the moon (though to hide herself rather than the rocks).

  Well, nice to know my work is inspiring discussion 8-).  An early commenter on chapter 14 asked about the going to the Moon method, so I added a discussion of it in chapter 15.  One of the problems was that the Moon is quite a long ways from Earth--farther than Flicker's effective range to hit maneuvering spaceships with rocks, and wasn't in the right part of its orbit to be between Earth and the approaching fleet.  Other problems I went into more detail about in chapter 15.

  For the comment about romance:  I understand that it won't be to everyone's taste, and I can certainly sympathize with over-empathizing and emotional exhaustion, but one of the things I was trying to portray is plausible relationships--and those don't necessarily get easier at the far right end of the bell curve, even in the absence of other problems.  Doc was suffering from chronic sleep deprivation and was actively sabotaged by a powerful probability manipulator as a teenager, Flicker had multiple traumas and a completely asocial childhood, and Stella was a serial killer.  In addition, the only major viewpoint character who is remotely neurotypical is Donner.  They're bad at it for good reasons.

  I'll take "like reading Romeo and Juliet, only with superpowers and world crisis" as a compliment, whether is was intended as one or not 8-)

  Thanks to everyone who took the time to read and comment.  Seeing the different ways people react to my work helps give me perspective as a writer.

  Edited for clarity.

  Obvious problem: she's basically helpless and exposed for the duration of the trip to the Moon and back.

    Yes, because it is very easy to hit a target moving at 80% lightspeed...

    (Disclaimer: I have no knowledge of the Alien's weapon capabilities, but TFODF 'verse seems to be light-speed hard. Atomic Rocket's article on Relativistic Kinetic Kill weapons provides the rest of the argument.)

    (Incidentally, I stopped reading TFODF when it became a romance novel.)

      It didn't become a romance novel. It has romance in it, because it's depicting really intelligent people as *people*, but it's no more a romance novel than Luminosity and Radiance are.
      ```

      - u/mhd-hbd:

        It was mostly a joke, but I think it lays it on thick. I have some issues with over-emphasizing with fictional characters and suffering emotional exhaustion.

        And the characters are really intelligent, but all have Wisdom as the dump stat and that really pisses me off. It's like reading Romeo and Juliet, only with superpowers and word crisis instead of romance.

  It's been a while since I read it, but I recall this being addressed -- by the time they spotted the fleet, the fleet was too close for her to safely jump to the moon. She'd have been helplessly ballistic with no mass nearby to entropy dump into. 

  So, basically, what /u/ArgentStonecutter said.

    Quote from chapter 26 which is found at : http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/96437734176/skybreakers-call-chapter-26

    >"Eighteen ships now being tracked,” said DASI.  “Velocity about 2,030 kilometers per second towards Earth, with slight variations.”
    Doc almost stumbled.  “That’s huge!  They must have jumped through with it.”
    "How soon will they be here?“ asked Jetgirl.
    "Depends on how soon they start decelerating, and how fast.  Two and a half hours for a flyby if they don’t.  Or impactors.  DASI? Any sign–”

    EDIT: Numbers:

    According to the quote, the fleet are traveling at 2,030 kilometers per second when they are first spotted, and they will arrive at earth in 2.5 hours if they do not slow down.

    (2,030 kilometers per second * 2.5 hours) / c = 60 light-seconds away.

    Flicker has shown she can get to the moon in less than 60 seconds during the music video.

  ```
  This is specifically mentioned earlier in Skybreaker's Call (one of the Lizard children suggests it). It's very hard, maybe impossible, to make a containment suit that lets her operate at speed, and if they don't approach from the same side as the moon, she's a total sitting duck for the jump home.

  EDIT: Found it. [Chapter 15](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/81156411972/skybreakers-call-chapter-15). And note that in the actual attack, they quickly surround the planet, so those fears were well-founded.
