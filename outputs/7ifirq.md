## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  What do you guys think about [Patreon's recent change in fee sturcture](https://blog.patreon.com/updating-patreons-fee-structure/)?

  I think it's a very shitty thing they did. They had a good system of batching pledges to reduce the impact of fees, now they decided to de-aggregate them, screwing over small pledges (each $1 pledge now costs the patron $1.38, almost 40% fee) seemingly to cater to creators who are interested not in small voluntary subscriptions for otherwise free content, but in gating content behind pay walls of more substantial pledges, basically operation a more traditional pay2play business. And they try to present it as concern for creators. I mean, technically, yes, it is concern for creators, but it appears to be only for a specific subset of creators with a specific business model. 

  UPD: Also an [interesting article](https://brianbalfour.com/essays/patreon-onboarding-growth) was unearthed during the shitstorm shining light on Patreon's priorities. How do you like this language for example: 
  > But at Patreon, a big drop-off could actually mean something good is happening -- unqualified leads are getting weeded out.

    I think it's terrible - about a third of my patrons give $1 and another third $2; I'm in that "saying thanks for free content" category you mentioned.  *If* pledge behaviour isn't changed by this stupid fee structure, I'll get more money, but (a) I think that's missing the point as I don't want to trick anyone, and (b) of course it will ouch people to freer larger pledges. 

    So I'm going to look for an alternative platform - there's nothing to stop me using two, after all.
    ```

    - u/SeekingImmortality:
      ```
      If you find a decent one, please share the info regarding it.  I was currently happily supporting numerous artists/creators with $1 - $5 range support, and this new fee structure means a hefty increase in outlay from what is only a small discretionary funds budget, which would cause me to have to cease supporting many of them.

      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        Top of my list :-)

        Basically the philosophy looks good, but I have no confidence that it will still exist next year and the platform is technically a little shaky.
        ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    That graph is sketchy.  They're drawing "2.9% + $0.35" as smaller than 5%, despite the usual low amounts being pledged.  

    EDIT: they also switched the color scheme and labeling order, and distorted the lengths.  The amounts they're showing are 80% take-home + 15% Transaction Fees + 5% Patreon Fees (vs. labels of "85-93%", "2-10%", and "5%") for the first graph, which is flat-out wrong.  The second graph is 95%(91.7) take-home + 5%(4.8) Patreon fees + 3.6%(3.4) Transaction fees. Normalized percentages to add to 100 are in brackets.  These lengths *are* correct, but only for single payments of exactly $50.00.  Any less, and the $0.35 becomes more significant and the portion paid in fees becomes greater.

    Why not just prorate the monthly subscriptions when you sign up in the middle?  For example, if you want to pledge $10/month starting on the 20th, you pay $10 immediately, then $10 * 10/31 = $3.23 on the 1st, then $10 on the first every other month.  If you then sign up with a second person, you pay $X whenever, then then pay then pay $10 + $X * Y/30 on the 1st of the next month, and $10 + X each month after that.

    It seems like a solution to too high transaction fees is to reduce the number of transactions.  It also (mostly) solves the patron's issues with being double-charged as far as I can tell.

    ---

    Thinking more about it, this seems to go against one core part of Patreon's purpose.  (I haven't used Patreon, so please correct me if I'm wrong.) Before I could support 10 creators and only pay one processing fee: now I can't.  Before, I could create content for an audience of 20 people and pay only one processing fee: now I can't.  I'm not seeing the advantages compared to directly paying creators and cutting out the middleman.

    Ah, you beat me to posting this. 
    This is going to cause me to drop all my small pledges. I use Patreon because it is easy and I'd rather give small consistent support then throw a one off lump sum. Now I am considering cutting out the middle man and take the time to donate the next 6 or so months directly to everyone I'm dropping while this whole thing settles.

                This concerns both recall of positive memories and forming new ones.

            I'm not entirely sure that they are mentally sound. After all, being happy while believing that you are in a terrible situation isn't exactly the picture of sanity.

                  Again, mental health is whatever you need it to be.

                  Like... this is not me making a profound philosophical statement here (unless consequentialism + nihilism counts as one). If X is better than Y, then choose X. Leading happy fulfilling lives is better than not doing so.

                    By that logic, we should simply pump mental patients full of happiness (or antidepressants) and not bother with treating any of their hallucinations/paranoia/etc/etc. After all, as long as they are happy, they are mentally sound!

                      Oh come on, that's caricaturing me and you know it.

                      But otherwise, Neurodiversity is a thing. My point is, you don't need to be "sane" by society's standards, or to follow arbitrary rules like "You have to be depressed all the time and think about the heat death of the universe", you just need to have a brain that works. In that framework, mental illness is only stuff that impacts your life negatively, whether it's hallucinations or paranoia or whatever.

                      Otherwise, there are no rules, you just find what kind of person you want to be and how to be that person. Hence, "mental health is whatever you need it to be".

          *raises hand*

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    Yes.

    Here're things that I'd do:

    - Do an activity that involves human contact (formal dance, contact improv, acro yoga)
    - Become emotionally intimate with friends
    - Fall in love with myself
    - Remember that unfulfilled needs feel bottomless, but they really aren't.

    So, #1 and #2 help deal with #4. Sometimes what you're feeling is that lack of deep human contact, and all you really need is that.

    And then #3 is really the important one. 

    An important thing to realize is that there is no closer or longer relationship than the one you have with yourself. There's a lot of ways this looks, but a good perspective is the meditative one: there's you, there's the you guiding that you, etc. Another perspective is: if "treat yo self, don't cheat yo self", who's doing the treating? So, treat yourself well. (And notice what only makes you feel doing, vs what feels good having done.)

    A method that is working for me is that, having gotten some kind of fit / in shape, and having learned how to take better care of my hair (and otherwise paying more attention to grooming), I can just stare at myself in the mirror thinking "Damn, but I look good.".

    As for emotional techniques... I mean, you'll hear a bunch, but meditate. Not the "clear your mind", etc etc, but the "take dedicated time to check in with your insides". If your computer is acting off, you'll check it's vitals, right? What excess programs are running that don't need to be? Is the temperature good on all the different chips? Is the hard drive well organized or fragmented? That kind of thing. 

    This practice also works - and you won't expect it to, and it'll start off sucking - when you're feeling things, sit with and dive into those feelings - [and for me] then start saying stuff. I had an event a month ago where I kept breaking down into short lived sobs, and then all of a sudden I said a thing and I realized that *that* was I was upset about. Having named and realized it, I immediately started feeling better. Like River Tam, it's not the contents of the secret, but that you don't know what you know that drives you up the wall.

    Finally - Tripper 101: If you don't like what's happening, start changing things. Then remember Rationality 101: Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is a change. In other words, pick things to change and start changing them; you do not have to and will not get anything right "the first time". Can you re-arrange where you live to be nicer to you? Can you change your activities to better match what leaves you feeling good / bad? Can you change the people in your life?

      I realize that you may have a different perspective than I have, and that taking care of yourself is important and healthy.

      But *__fuck that noise__*. My problem isn't that I don't understand myself, my problem is that I'm lacking a soulmate. I'm gonna keep looking for one, and I'm going to keep feeling a crushing emptiness in my heart until then. The day I start ignoring / rationalizing that pain away is the day I lower my standards, and the day I lower my standards is the day I die.

        > I'm lacking a soulmate

        Dude. Been there. *I am talking directly from this experience*. I have been where you are *so many times*. I know that what I need is a relationship (and, now that I'm dating someone, and can *feel* the effect that's having, it's just really confirming it). These things are related in that self-care makes you more attractive and they are unrelated in that self-care is required to maintain a successful relationship.

        Think over the people you've met that you've wanted to be with. Do you think they're taking care of themselves? Do they seem like they genuinely like and value being the person that they are?

        Have you maybe noticed that most of those people are *already in loving relationships*? 

        This isn't a lowering of standards, it's a system hack.

        Wait... do you meet *your own* standards?

                But I'm the other half of the equation, and it's pretty frequent that I go "do the thing" and people are resistant and then I get them to do the thing and then they're really happy that they did the thing. Your situation fits this pattern.

    Yeah, I'm going through one of those weeks.

    The thing is, my standards are pretty specific, so I do expect finding a long-term romantic partner to be ridiculously hard. Like, of all the people I've met (in person), the number of guys I felt an emotional / intellectual kinship with can be counted on two hands at most. The number of girls is... basically zero, that I remember.

    Some days I feel like I empathize a lot with HPMoR's Quirrel.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Man, reading all this stuff depresses me / makes me feel guilty in a really hard to describe manner...

      Like, when I was 15-17, I remember *all I wanted in the world* was a boyfriend. I was bitter that other people had boyfriends and I didn't. I would get mad at people kissing in the street because they were rubbing it in my face. Etc.

      Then when I was 18 I went to university, met people, dated a guy there for a year, was single for 8 months, then met my now-husband at the ripe old age of 19. We were the first in our friend group to get married. And we're also poly so as well as my husband I have a boyfriend who I have been with 5 years now. 

      And I *want* to comment on these threads and go, "it gets better guys", but then I remember I'm a straight woman who is in the nerd/rationalist/etc sphere, so I'm in a pretty good position, supply and demand wise (and 15 year old me comforted herself with promises that at university she'd be popular and have tons of opportunities for boys). 

      Then I start thinking of the systemic problems in society, in the rationalist community, etc and the reasons why there aren't more women here. 

      Anyway - I don't know what I want to say, or why I'm writing this comment. I *want* to say "I felt that way too but it worked out for me", I also *want* to say that my boyfriend was 34 years old and never been on a date, been kissed, etc when I met him and he was also in the early stages of recovering from really debilitating OCD, and now he's got me and aren't I wonderful - but then I'm like, are there dozens of people like him who never had someone like me find them on OKCupid? 

      But if people had told me that when I was 15, young-me would have cried out that that's all well and good but I'm a teenage girl and I want a boyfriend so I feel loved and wanted and *who cares if it will get better i am lonely now*??

      So, I guess, at anyone in this thread who is reading this: you are right to be sad and wish you had love and affection. Try and find things that make you happy or fulfilled in general, without a focus on romance. Meet people. Be kind. Treat women with respect, not as an adversary. Accept that culture treats men and women differently, and just because women haven't drunk from the cup at the altar of Yudkowsky that they aren't intelligent rational people who can't some day be just as keen on signing up for cryonics as you are. 

      I guess that's kind of something to consider - me and my husband have grown up so much together, and changed a lot in that time, but maybe a lot of that was because of how young we were when we met.

      (Oh, and when I met my husband, I was like "oh, he's an interesting guy and he lives a five minute drive away. Exams have just finished and we're having our long summer break.I don't think it'll be a long term thing but it'll be fun to have a summer romance" - so you know...).

        Damn straight.

        > but then I'm like, are there dozens of people like him who never had someone like me find them on OKCupid?

        Yup. Makes for [pretty ugly dynamics](http://squid314.livejournal.com/327849.html) too.

        Honestly, I don't really see what you're describing. Like, I appreciate what you're doing, and I do realize I don't need to be limited to the rationalist community (I mean, I'm French, so that'd be a pretty bad strategy)... but this is a definite problem that I have, and I think you're aware the solutions that applied to you won't apply to me.

        I'm not going to solve this merely by meeting people, being kind, and looking less hard for romance. None of the girls I've dated felt like people I would grow to love if I spent enough time with them. I don't know what I'm going to do about this... but eh, I'm awesome. I'll figure something out.
        ```

          I don't know. I see the other side - I know people IRL who are in the general rationalist sphere and are just... not appealing partners. And I don't mean *for me*, I mean *in general*. And it's not because of anything intrinsic to rationalism; it's because of the stupid stereotypes about autistic neckbeards are based on *something*. 

          Some of it is stuff that is "entry level" - poor personal hygiene, lack of life skills (i.e. cooking / cleaning / small talk) - and a lot of that I'd imagine the average guy already knows and does. But at the same time I'd imagine that many people think they're OK but they're really not.

          I keep on going back to this one guy I know - and he's the archetypical neckbeard stereotype and turned up to like 12. I tried to give him help with his OKCupid profile ("can it be shorter than 10,000 words and not list every mental illness you are diagnosed with?" - "but any woman who loves me needs to love ME for ME!"), grooming ("I just will let my hair and beard grow out then shave them when they're too long. Rinse and repeat once a year. It's EASY")... And none of that would be a problem if he wasn't like "I want nothing more than to be loved but no women want me they're all shallow" and I'm like ARGH you won't do BASIC ENTRY LEVEL stuff to make yourself more appealing to potential partners, what do you expect???

          And yeah, that probably colours the way I interpret a lot of other people in the "I want dates but can't get them" lens. I also wonder how much people do the actual pursuing, etc. 

          Another thing I wonder is whether people are going for people "in their league" - while personality gets you a lot of places, if you're a 2 you're vanishingly unlikely to get with a 9. I once dated a guy who was a 3 and he had always been crushing on 8s or 9s with no success. He has now been living with a fellow 3 for the past 5 years and they have a beautiful cat together. And I wonder if my neckbeard friend, who is a 1, is going after 5s? He had a girlfriend for a while and she was a 2 and that seemed to go well.

          Knew another perennially single guy who was depressed about it. I have ended that friendship because of his attitude towards women that came to a head when he got a girlfriend for ~1 month. Just didn't seem to care about her as a person, only interested in whether he could have sex with her. This was a guy I considered my best friend for some 5 years. In retrospect he had a lot of problems - like, he'd groped me once or twice and I really should have just ended the friendship there because that's a much bigger deal. But so we women are socialised.... Ugh.

          I'm sure none of this helps at all. But hey, it's how I see the "nerd dating society" in my little millieu.

          (And I'm not exactly in the bay area FWIW - I'm in a small city in Australia with no formal rationalist community)

            Eh, [my profile](https://www.okcupid.com/profile/NarrateurDuChaos) is "nerdy but hygienic". The worst part is a bunch of Star Wars references, and a photo where I'm scowling at the camera. (... wow, why did I think this was a good idea again?)

            > Another thing I wonder is whether people are going for people "in their league" - while personality gets you a lot of places, if you're a 2 you're vanishingly unlikely to get with a 9.

            Yeah. I do remember one summer camp, where I kept going after a 7 colleague, and ignoring a 1 colleague that went after me. I mean, I don't think we'd have connected that well emotionally... but I'd have connected even less with the girl I was going for. It was also kind of cruel of me.

            Made me wonder for a long time how shallow I am. Still wish I had given her a chance.

            But anyway. I don't know how appealing I am personality-wise. But in recent years, I've started to get dates.

            And I'm starting to realize I always end up going for problem girls. Girls who have problems with their family, or who are lonely, or who had a bad past relationship... and I don't know if I keep going for them because I'm more appealing to them, or I (sub)consciously think "I have a comparative advantage here!" or because they're easier to get and I'm not attractive to anyone else, or I'm just attracted by a project. (well, obviously it's all 4, but I'm wondering which is most important)

            So... I dunno. I can, with a lot of effort and people-wrangling, get a date, and maaaaybe sometimes get some sex (without going into details, not very frequent), but that's not something I want long term. I read a post a few days ago by a girl on r/relationship who complained about how her boyfriend was unreasonable and asked how she could better communicate with him. I asked for an example conversation, [she copy-pasted one](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7gt9jf/i_need_tips_on_how_to_communicate_better/dqlnx2u/), and... the thing is, in that conversation she did everything mostly right. The guy was just unreasonable; she could have handled him better, but it would always have been a chore.

            So I feel like my situation is a bit like that girl's (but less extreme). I can find girls, and get an emotional connection with them, but it's kind of fake and it only lasts as long as I pour effort into it.

            And that aside... I've met people with the rationalist spark. I didn't know they even existed before I read HP:MoR, but now I've met them, both online and IRL. I know they exist, I know how to recognize them, and I know there's a world of difference between them and... these... disgusting normal humans. Like, seriously, once you have seen the difference between someone with the spark and someone without it, you just can't be satisfied with someone who doesn't have it. It just jumps in your face.

              We are all shallow people if it helps. But it's a good bias to be aware of when it can impact you and try and not let it get you too much. I was really hesitant about dating my partner because I was 24 and he was 34 and I was really freaked out by the age gap but we hit it off immediately and 5 years later it's a good relationship. 

              > I always end up going for problem girls. Girls who have problems with their family, or who are lonely, or who had a bad past relationship

              Honestly? That's.... pretty much everyone in the universe. I mean there's degrees of these things and "problems with family" can be "my dad is kind of distant" or "it was so bad I was emancipated at age 11", but you are probably going to end up dating people who are broken in some way... and you are no doubt broken in your own way too.

              > rationalist spark / "disgusting normal humans"

              I can see why you might feel that but that's not my experience,  maybe it's just some generalised misanthropy but I am always finding myself getting more and more understanding of people who are different and whatnot. 

              What really helps me is remembering that everyone is an expert on something. 

              Kind of an example: one of my favourite conversation techniques when I'm at a party is when someone tells me what their job is and my first thought is "wow, a scent-tester at a perfume factory? that job sounds really easy", I go against that instinct and go "wow! That sounds like it must be really hard." - and people always love talking about how hard their job is and you get to hear about how the perfume scent-tester doesn't just smell things all day but she has to categorise them on 17 different axes and test them against exemplar scents and you get a whole new appreciation for that person and that role in society.

              Another example: back in the day when I was a young engineer I was supervising bridge maintenance. Seeing the tradies operate heavy equipment or even just a chainsaw with practised skill and finesse was awe-inspiring to watch. I remember having the same feeling when I was watching someone shape pretzels on an assembly line. I think everyone has something they're good at and practised at?? I don't know.

              Anyway that's all come across really touchy-feely kumbayah hasn't it? 

              Again not sure if any of this helps but I think we're stream of consciousing at each other today so...

              > OKCupid Profile Link

              I just realised you didn't actually ask me for a critique but I wrote one anyway..... Sorry if it was not wanted, but it's below if it is:

              First thing that jumps out at me: you say you speak some English. I would never message someone who didn't speak English fluently unless I shared or wanted to learn their main language (et je parle le français assez bien et je veux l’améliorer, donc pour moi, c'est pas un vrai problème: mais pour les autres filles qui ne parlent pas le français....). So put English as one of your main languages, especially because your profile is *in* English (depending on the number of French people living where you are I'd probably put a sentence in French in each section, but if there are vanishingly few I probably wouldn't bother). 

              In general your profile doesn't seem... interesting? Like, if I went on a date with you, I don't know what we'd do. The standard geek standby of playing board games doesn't even come to mind as you don't list favourites. That said, I've not been actively dating for the past 5 years or so, but your profile makes you seem bland when from reading your comments on here you're exactly the sort of person I'd be interested in going on a first date with. 

              And this sentence confuses me: "I'm really interested in perspectives from people who identify as neuroatypical." - I'm not in that demo so maybe I'm missing some important context, but you don't really specify what sort of perspectives you want (like, I'm getting the feeling that you... want to date neuroatypical peopple? You want to interview them as part of a research project? you want to.... tell them that identifying as neuroatypical is stupid and they are dumb??? any of those). It's just.... weird and not in a good way. 

              You definitely need much better photos, (how to say this without coming across as a creepy old lady?) - I can tell from looking at the photos that you would probably be my type, looks-wise, but your photos don't make you look appealing? Apparently photos are the most important thing in a profile (sad but true) so that's something you should really focus on improving. OKCupid has a bunch of articles on what works well in profile pics that you might want to check out.

          "Worthy" has the wrong connotations here. And for having been there when you were doing the conversation sheet thing, I wouldn't qualify it as either materialistic or sociopathic (but definitely misguided).

          > - Am I worthy of admiration? No: My programming endeavors are quite meager (whatever some CK2 modders may say), and nothing else that I do is even worth mentioning.

          > - Am I willing to work toward becoming admirable? No: I have little incentive to write a giant overhaul mod for CK2, become licensed as a professional engineer, or learn Lojban.

          Oh come on. Everyone's programming endeavors are meager for a while. I'm in the 4th year of a coding bootcamp / engineer school, and "made a few mods in a game, has sound reasoning and a good work ethic" is already somewhat above average.

          I could say stuff like, you're the master of your own world, you're can improve as long as you try, but I don't think that's your problem.

          > - Am I willing to work toward seeming nice? No: I lack the creativity and the patience for full-time, long-term lying.

          *That's* your problem. Fuck that. I know I was ranting about lowering your standards five minutes ago, but working on yourself isn't the same thing as long-term lying.

          You have this idea that your laziness, your social ineptitude are part of who you are, and if you want to be true to yourself you have to accept these things. Fuck that. You can do better, learn social rules, do sport, study harder and still be yourself. Giving up on being better isn't okay just because you recognize that you're giving up.

  I've been meaning to recommend this book for a while, but never got around to writing the post. The book is [Version Control by Dexter Palmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733442-version-control).

  It's, hands down, one of the best books I've ever read. It's a sci-fi magical realism deconstruction/"parody/pastiche". I don't think it quite qualifies as "rational" since it has an element of "magical realism," and I'm not even sure that it's *internally* consistent. But it definitely *deconstructs* the genre of magical realism by giving it a sci-fi veneer. Part of the great thing about the sci-fi part is that except for the causality violation device, all the technology is a reasonable extrapolation of what's available today. It's a future that, barring the "time-travel," could really happen. It's a vision of multiple dystopias within one book, and a look at how our choices change depending on the circumstances. I really cannot even put down succinctly in words how good the book is, it's one of those works that, like impressionist art, must be experienced first-hand.

  It can be a heavy read. It is, IMO, "Literature" although I haven't read much to compare. But there's just *so much* you can get out of the book that I'm amazed the author fit it all into one novel. And that is definitely something I look for in a book: that it is well-structured and well-written. Both are the case here.

  I've seen on here someone mentioned what they call "perfect" works; this is as close to that as I've ever seen. (Although how I would describe it is it's at a "local optimum": there can be "better" works in an absolute sense, but for what it is, it is incredibly good.)

  Highly recommend you read it if it sounds at all appealing. It's probably particularly relevant if you're part of the 20-35 age group.

  [This interview with Garry Kasparov (the greatest chess player alive today) about Russian politics and foreign policy](http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/putin-pawns-and-propaganda-garry-kasparov/) may be the most important interview I’ve listened to all year. This is a man who can make sense of the crisis facing the world, if not necessarily how to solve it. In surprisingly few words, he surmises how civil society is being poisoned by propaganda that promotes authoritarianism and nihilism while demeaning morality and objective truth. This is how the sanity waterline is falling.
  ```

  - u/None:

    Interesting. Kasparov says, "We are at war," as well as commentary to the effect of "the free world is giving away technology to its enemies." It may be the case that restriction of information is the way forward. I hope not though. The Internet is a valuable thing, and I really hope lack of net neutrality doesn't catch on. I hope that, as Kasparov also says, the problem can be solved by political will and perhaps compromise. Unfortunately, what we actually have is Donald Trump. It's enough to make a person depressed.

    If you want to skip the intro (which is irrelevant and boring IMO) then the actual interview starts at 13:30.

    I watched a video that's relevant to this discussion as well: [CGP Grey's Rules for Rulers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs). It shows how despotic leaders are beholden to their support base and are inherently unstable; the incentives for them are to do nearly anything to hold onto their power because if they don't, they get killed or imprisoned by the next regime. It's a tough situation to resolve, especially since Russia is a fairly powerful country and its actions have consequences for the entire world.

    Kasparov seems to have good, realistic advice about how to deal with the situation, from a Russian's perspective who sees the world from both the Russian and external points of view. Highly recommended listening. Thank you for posting.

  I’ve recently gotten my first “job” as an unpaid bank intern.

  And while even doing that much did wonders in regards to solving some of the problems I’ve been fruitlessly struggling with for years, there’s still that one thing that I just don’t see any ways of overcoming, dealing with.

  My comprehension skills suck, I think. Looking back now, I had this problem standing on my way as far back as during my later school years. I have trouble with understanding and digesting new information, with converting it into knowledge that would be available to me on my “fast-thinking” lane. When I have to understand and learn new information, either the progress is happening way too slowly (for instance nowadays it can be as bad as barely managing to go through just several pages of material per day), or my mind just blanks out when I’m trying to read the text (for instance, sometimes I can’t even force myself to comprehend what’s being said in relatively simpler paragraphs, and this state of stupidly staring at the page in front of me can last for several hours straight).

  And now I have to yet again face the same damn thing that has been poisoning my life experience during both my school and university years. I just don’t see how I’ll be able to learn all the laws and internal protocols that are expected for the employees to learn with a ”handicap” like this.

  Maybe my brain (or me myself) is just being lazy, maybe I’m doing something wrong (with food, with my daily routine, etc), I don’t know. I just want to be able to absorb the damn infodumps the way other people are seemingly able to do *while* they’re also managing to maintain at least some kind of a private life and not go to sleep at 21:00-22:00 to keep being functional the next day.

  I’ve tried using the pomodoro technique, but because of the slow progress speeds mentioned earlier one interval can only manage to cover several paragraphs, making me lose the train of thought. And the constant inability to understand what’s laid down in front of me and the constant feeling of being stupid are making me almost physically sick of reading educational materials altogether, to the point that I can barely force myself to get back to reading them the next time.

  What can I do to improve my situation? At least problems like having poor social skills, etc are of such a nature that you can at least grasp in what ways they can possibly be solved.

  With this, I’m just out of ideas. I just feel stupid and like if I’ll not be able to find at least *some* kind of a solution to this, this will be blocking my perspectives for the remainder of my life.

  Any advice?

    That sounds like a really rough situation. I'm not an expert on these things. However, if you have easy and relatively affordable access to healthcare professionals (via insurance or if you are in a country with socialized medicine) I think that a doctor would be able to help you a lot. I've heard that symptoms like these can be related to nutritional issues, sleep issues, various diseases, or ADD, all of which can be treated worked around better once you know what they are. 

    One of my friends who had similar symptoms went to a doctor and found out he had a sleep disorder where he would wake up several times during the night without realizing it, causing him to always be fatigued and therefore not on his mental A-game. After he got treatment (which turned out to mostly involve changing his sleeping conditions) things changed a lot for him.

    Not sure how much of this will apply to you, but sometimes a doctor can be a hue help for this.

    To me this points to other problems in your life or health. Are you highly stressed? Do you have (even slight) depression? You may just not be someone who learns effectively visually/auditorially; given that there are people who simply don't have a visual imagination (something so foreign to me that I can't imagine how they can function) there is probably some weirdness to your specific experience that we can pin down.

    I've often felt incredibly stupid as well, in the sense of making a ton of mistakes even at a seemingly easy job. In my case the cause was that I just wasn't invested or concentrating on (and didn't even have the ability to concentrate on) what I was doing. This was because I apparently had a mental illness, and whether that was the cause or the lack of concentration was a side-effect of medication is a question I just don't know the answer to. But I can understand how you feel.

    Do you know about memorisation techniques and how to "study" in such a way as you actually retain the information? There's actual research done on this; I haven't read it but a book to try might be [Make It Stick](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick).

    Otherwise, we probably need more information about other things that might be causing this lack of retention/memory in order to help more.

    Seconding @Perspeculative's post. 

    I know that I will go through "stupid" phases during the day, depending on what I eat (mostly, kind of protein - sometimes red meat puts me to sleep; and carbs/no carbs, and VERY MUCH sugar/no sugar). So, play around with both what you're eating, and *when* (ex: intermittent fasting).

    What I can't tell is how much this was also going in college, or as I get older and my body responds different, different stuff happens.

    Also, do you feel like you're going a million miles an hour, but things aren't sticking? Like you can think super fast, but aren't forming strong memories?

    Have you tried to ask to get someone to assist you full-time until you're up-to-date on the rules (whether an employee or another intern)? It might help with your concentration problems if you can say "I'm drawing a blank here, can you explain with different words?"

    Your boss may or may not agree to dedicate one guy only to help you, but there's no harm in asking. In general, managers are aware that getting a new employee up to date in a company is both harder and more important than it looks, so there's good odds they'll send at least some help your way if you're struggling.

  Does anyone have any opinions on [Graduate Student Unionization](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-student-assistants-covered-nlra-0)?

  The graduate students at my university are starting to the process, working on collecting cards in order to get to a vote.  Talking with my parents (they are both Republicans and thus automatically against Unions), there arguments against seem to be that we should be grateful for getting a scholarship and that we aren't owed anything more?  And that participating in the unionizing could potentially endanger my own scholarship (I am pretty sure that would be retaliation and be very clearly illegal if the university actually did retaliate in anyway like that), or at the very least distract me from my own work (possible, but if anything I would just ignore the process and put in the bare minimum effort of voting).  They are also ideologically opposed to the fact that if the graduate students worked with the United Auto Workers (UAW) for resources/support some portion of our dues would go to support them.  In terms of pros... for me personally, I am happy with my advisor, my advisor is committed to making sure my work helps me complete a thesis in a timely manner, I work very flexible hours, so those aren't a big issue for me... occasionally I hear of other graduate students who have issues along those lines which I imagine might benefit from the collective bargaining of a union.

  Anyway, thoughts?

    > And that participating in the unionizing could potentially endanger my own scholarship (I am pretty sure that would be retaliation and be very clearly illegal if the university actually did retaliate in anyway like that), or at the very least distract me from my own work (possible, but if anything I would just ignore the process and put in the bare minimum effort of voting).

    You should unionize.  You're a worker, and you deserve protections as such.

    I wouldn't mind *each* department unionizing, but I'm leery of larger groups organizing under a shared umbrella, especially one broad enough to include both pure intellectuals and assembly line workers.  

    Why should the Biology students take action when the Physics students have a dispute?  It's not like it affects them in any way: a grad student in Biology can't do any of the work that a grad student in Physics does, so there's no fear of replacement workers coming in.

      Keep in mind that for PhD programs, the programs tend not to be very big... my program, which is very well funded and thus fairly big, takes in around 7-10 new students per year, while another program, peripherally associated with mine only takes in one to two new students per year.  For the most part, my program director is already on our side, so to speak, so there is no need to influence her as a program.  Organizing at the level of program is simply too small for the overall university administration to have to care, and it is the administration we would need to affect to change some of the larger overall policies.  

      > Why should the Biology students take action when the Physics students have a dispute?

      > so there's no fear of replacement workers coming in.

      I think there is actually just enough overlap to make it relevant in the case of TAs.  A math student and a physics student might be able to effectively TA in the place of each other for many undergraduate level courses, for instance.  A psychology student and a neuroscience student might both be able to TA for a cognitive psychology class.  You are right that the issues that affect sufficiently disparate programs might be pretty different... a literature RA and a biology RA might have totally different types of work and working conditions/issues.  However the overall idea, as with all unions, is to make a collective bargaining units, so for instance the Biology students know they have enough solidarity that administration can't just decide to punish them by cutting all of their TA position and replacing them with a mix of TAs from related programs.

      In the case of RAs, the idea of striking in the first place is almost absurd... their work to graduate and get published often heavily if not completely overlaps with their work as an RA.  So striking delays their own publications and graduation.  In the event their professor has mismanaged their work heavily, it is possible that their may be some disconnect between their thesis work and their work as an RA, but this is an unusual case in my experience.

    In Austria we have the Workers Chamber, which is an union everyone joins as long as they work and aren't independent. (for the independents there is the Economy Chamber) Participation is mandatory and they give you Legal Advice and Attorneys for free(like r/legaladvice with actual power behind them) when you have problem with your boss. I know many people they have helped. 

    So i think it could help, but implementation with the american culture would have to be different.

    I'm not entirely sure what the point of university students unionising is. I mean, I get the point of *unions* in general - it's a way for a large group of employees to put pressure on an employer who's being troublesome by being able to call for a strike.

    But - perhaps I'm just being dense here - I don't quite see the point of university students going on strike. The students are paying to attend the university, not vice versa - and if a student really wants to object to a university being completely beyond the pale, he need merely withdraw from his classes to deny the university his money.

    What am I missing here?

      > What am I missing here?

      I think you are unaware of the basic setup that most PhD programs have...

      > The students are paying to attend the university, not vice versa

      It is the opposite for graduate students.  Graduate Students work as Research Assistants and Teaching Assistants are given a tuition waver/scholarship as well a stipend.  In my PhD program, we typically only take classes in our first 2-3 years (while working 10-20 hours a week for our professor our first year when we take the most classes, 20-40 hours once we've gotten through the first year), and the remaining 2-3 years are entirely devoted to finishing our thesis and working as an RA or TA (work on our thesis and work as an RA tend to blend together somewhat, a 40 hour work week at minimum is typical).  

      > it's a way for a large group of employees to put pressure on an employer who's being troublesome by being able to call for a strike.

      The arrangement I described can create [perverse incentives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive) in some cases.  The professor that we work for as an RA, that is providing funding, is almost always also our thesis advisor/mentor.  So letting the thesis drag out nets the Professor a RA for a much longer period of time, which only effectively costs the stipend cost, which is cheaper than hiring a Post-Doc/Assistant Professor/Technician.  In some labs there is a lot of highly skilled work to be done.  The student has no recourse, they are entirely dependent on that professor in order to complete their research and graduate.  For me personally, this is not an issue, and I think in my entire program I've only heard of one or two professors where things even started to approach this worst case, but still, there are few protections for student in the the times where it does come up.

      In terms of stipend... it tends to be pretty small, especially if you consider the opportunity cost the graduate student takes by entering a PhD program instead of going into a Master program and then getting a well paid job.  In so much as a PhD student is worth a someone with a Master's degree, not counting the value of the tuition waver and mentorship from a professor, we are getting vastly underpaid.  Of course the education is valuable and the mentorship is priceless, but those aren't things we can live off of... (see the complaints about the GOP tax plan on scholarships for another case where this has come up)

        [](/twistare-r) ...alright. So, having a more complete description of the situation has had two effects.

        First of all, I feel more than just a little silly. I *really* should have been able to figure this out (especially since it's not just *student* but *graduate* student).

        Second of all, I can now certainly see the benefit of graduate student unions. Mind you, specific *implementations* of graduate student unions can cause problems of various sorts - from your original post, I have reason to believe that your parents will tell you all about such potential issues at great length.

        [](/twibeam) But a *properly run* union, whose principal figures are *sensible* and *sane*, could be a great boon to students in such a situation as you have described, yes. In much the same way as any union can benefit it members.
        ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      You're missing the fact that many graduate students are actually working for the university. They are often teaching assistants or research assistants, or even course instructors. They literally get a paycheck from the university for providing their services in research and teaching, and often have actual employee IDs. So in many cases, graduate students are actually university employees, many believe they should be allowed to form unions just like employees of other companies.

        Add in the fact that for research assistants, the person they are working for is usually also the mentor and has significant control over how and when they graduate, creating the potential for some [perverse incentives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive).

  Any My Hero Academia/Boku no Hero Fans here?

  Any Worm fans here? 

  I ask because I have a persistent plot bunny that I'm thinking of utilizing for a story; most likely a one-two shot as opposed to a full length story. 

  All Might is transported to the Wormverse and is brought back to peak condition by Panacea. He tries to become the Symbol of Peace in a superhero world that's definitely not as simplistic as his own, and he does his best to come to terms with the Grey on Grey setting as much as possible.

  Tbh, the above would just be flavouring because I then plan to have him fight an Endbringer. *And win.*

  Wouldn't necessarily be a rational story but could be some fun.

  P.S Based on the feats we've seen in both Worm and My Hero Academia, I'm fairly certain he doesn't have the capacity to beat an Endbringer. But I would write him to be that way, for the sake of being able to conceptualize All Might using Detroit Smash on a fucking kaiju!
  ```

  - u/SeekingImmortality:
    ```
    Yes and Yes, to the questions.

    And agreement on the PS, in that given their listed powersets, there's absolutely no way All Might could stop an endbringer.  Like, at all.  But, it would be a very fun scene, and an entertaining concept (if not a rationalist one, though you could do some interesting things with the coming to terms with grey-on-grey setting part)

        Well, yeah.  Saitama's whole power concept is basically 'I have enough force / ability to defy physics to win, under any circumstances'.  If you take that as his power definition then...yeah, Saitama wins.  And I'm fine with that.

        All Might's power set is basically that he's, in the MHA universe, fantastically strong and fast.  But we're not talking 'shatter dimensions/levels of physical reality through punching' levels of strength here, which is what canonically would be required to actually damage an endbringer core.

      I've seen similar situations happen before. Based on such situations, I'm going to guess that MagicWeasel's boss weasel retired or left the company, and MagicWeasel thus became Acting Boss Weasel as a 'temporary measure' (i.e. taking on boss weasel's work along with her own, with or without a bump in salary). Now, about three years later, WeaselCorp is actually getting around to officially hiring a replacement Boss Weasel, and MagicWeasel has applied for the job. Both she and the interviewers are perfectly aware that she's been doing the job for the past few years, and therefore she is capable, which gives her a distinct interviewing advantage, but there are reasons why she might still fail the interview (such as a New Weasel applying for the job who has a massive long list of relevant degrees and experience and/or an Uncle Weasel in Top Management). Nonetheless, fair employment laws prevent anyone from being appointed on a permanent basis without going through an interview, so therefore MagicWeasel must be interviewed.

      All subject to correction from the Weasel herself, of course, but that's what I'd expect to be the case.

        Like you're saying, there's a chance that some External Weasel will come from outside the organisation / elsewhere within the organisation and take the OW job "out from under me" and I'll keep being a Junior Weasel until another OW leaves or gets promoted to Better Weasel or a Better Weasel gets promoted to Boss Weasel and then an Ordinary Weasel becomes a Better Weasel leaving an Ordinary Weasel job open for me to apply for all over again.

        (The External Weasel risk is especially salient because we have a lot of unemployed engineers who might be wanting a secure government job)

          Well, then, best of luck becoming an Ordinary Weasel. I think that having an intern to supervise is a good sign - it suggests that the Boss Weasels are well aware that you are capable of supervising interns, and thus likely capable of supervising future Junior Weasels.

      Not to keep. It's complicated because I work for the government.

      Basically I have job A, which pays $X per week. I'm actually doing job B which pays $X+$15 per week. There's an opening in job B, but because of the rules about hiring people, they can't just offer me job B; I have to apply for it, which means that dozens of people probably wrote resumes and three page essays on how good they are at traffic engineering (yes, really, that was part of the application) for a job that is *basically* going to go to me unless I really fuck up the interview (and it does happen). 

      I need job B because job A will pay $X forever, but next year in job B I'll go from earning $X+$15 to $X+$100 per week, and the year after that another $100pw, for a few more years. And job B is a more prestigious job on paper so it will help me apply for job C down the road...

      If I fail the application I keep doing job A, someone else is brought on to do job B, and I have to hope another job B opens up (there's a limited number of job B's: this job B is open because a colleague is leaving). 

      So worst case scenario my life stays as it is now.

  Teenagers are living in a rotating habitat, which is relatively aged already, and discover an kind of well or bunker that leads into the underground (towards the outer shell of the habitat). At the end of the bunker, behind a thick sheet of cracked glass of some sort, they find an unused docking bay that’s worked into the outer shell of the habitat. They make the control room for this bay their hangout, and one of them starts the work to get the bay running again. At some point some of them dangle out of the bay just for fun, at least at first.

It’s been fully funded, stars professional improvisers from the One Shot and Campaign podcasts, and features a new RPG called Invisible Sun that combines the best parts of Welcome to Night Vale and The Matrix.

  I was super hesitant about this because I knew so little about the project and game system going in, and was convinced such an idea was way too good to be true and would end up just being weird and pretentious, but then I listened to [their world/character building session](https://youtu.be/II8MpLIEh20) and [the character vignettes from their first roleplaying session](https://overcast.fm/+BIYnVjCrU) and was blown away.

  This is the greatest piece of emergent storytelling I’ve ever seen. The atmosphere is fantastic, the characters feel all too human, the world is surprisingly rational despise the surrealism, and the fact that it’s **all improvised** is an astonishing achievement. This is something more people should know about both for its uniqueness and excellence. There are scripted audio dramas I’ve loved that weren’t as good as this.

  All the play sessions will be streamed on Twitch, where they will allow viewers to interact with the game, and then released to everyone through One Shot’s podcast feed and YouTube channel. Backing the Kickstarter just gives them more money for the production and gives you the opportunity to participate in the project. If you have even a vague interest in anything I’ve said, this is worth checking out.
