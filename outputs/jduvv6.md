## Secret Krampus Story Voting

### Post:

Welcome to the story voting thread for the Secret Krampus contest! I'll be posting each story as a top-level comment. The associated prompt and any content warnings will be hidden by spoiler tags, for those who prefer to go in blind. 

The contest will run until 11:59PM next Sunday, or technically until whenever the thread comes out of contest mode after that. Whichever story has the most upvotes at that time wins, and I will gift the winning author Reddit platinum. You can upvote as many stories as you want, including your own (but only with one account, please!). I encourage you to vote based on how much you like the stories as opposed to how closely they match their respective prompts, since the prompts are just meant to be inspiration.   

I ask that people don't post other top-level comments so that the focus stays on the contest entries, but feel free to reply to the story comments with your thoughts and questions. You may want to ping the author in these, since they won't be notified otherwise. 

Only folks who submitted a story will have their prompt included in the [prompt voting thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jdvlgd/secret_krampus_prompt_voting/). There will likely be some prompts that didn't get a story written for them, or stories whose prompts aren't in the voting thread. I'll add any late entries to both threads as they arrive, so be sure to check back later in the week for more stories!

  Story: [Differing Perspectives](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27093310) (~5800 words)

  Author: /u/Pandomy

  Prompt: >!"A genre savvy crew assemble for a mission. The problem? They all think they're in a different genre."!<
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    /u/Pandomy

    >!This is wonderful! Let me see if I got them all right:  
    - NuTrek  
    - (trashy?) romance novel  
    - SCP/men in black with just a dash of Warhammer 40k  
    - young adult adventure (or whatever you call hunger games' genre)  
    - dating sim (can I say how great it is that the alien is so alien that it is doing a different *game* genre instead of *fiction* genre??)!<

    >!I have to say this one is my absolute favorite so far. Great prompt, greater execution!!<
    ```

    - u/Pandomy:
      ```
      >!You nailed them! I was a bit worried about that, so I'm glad they came across! :)!<

      > >!(trashy?) romance novel!<

      >!Fun fact: in my original notes, Evelyn's genre was war novel. She was meant to be a grizzled veteran, but when I actually sat down to write her she just kinda morphed.!<
      ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    /u/Pandomy: Somehow the line >!"They felt their subbrachial panoply desolidify in mortification"!< is intensely relatable.

    This was hilarious! Thank you.

  Story: [The World in His Hands](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3iWPgp-msE5rllAyLT2toN8WJNx8qCd8a-5SkTBxns/edit?usp=sharing) (~10700 words, CW >!self-harm!<)

  Author: /u/ExiledQuixoticMage

  Prompt: >!"You discover a small replica of your world that floats in the air. Approaching it for a closer look, you're startled by a
   gigantic face appearing from the sky above the replica—your face."!<
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:

    /u/ExiledQuixoticMage, I really enjoyed this. My favorite exchange:

    >!“I have taken the name of the Lord,” I admitted.!<

    >!“You have taken the name of the Lord in vain?” he clarified.!<

    >!“That remains to be seen.”!<

    I do think the >!names of the characters!< risk telegraphing >!the ending!<, but I'm not sure to what extent >!the significance of the name Joshua!< is common knowledge.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      Personally, the ending was telegraphed to me at >!"42 separate rods and pincers of varying sizes small enough to precisely operate on mini-Earth rolled along metal tracks capable of rotation through a full 360° in all three dimensions."!<

      Not that that was a bad thing, as >!it gave the story a sense of increasing horror as it made its way to its inevitable ending.!<
      ```

    - u/TennisMaster2:
      ```
      What is its significance?
      ```

      - u/ExiledQuixoticMage:
        ```
        >!The name Joshua is etymologically related to the name Yeshua, which is itself related to the Latin *Iesus* which is where the English name for Jesus comes from.!<
        ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    >!Wow.  This had me enthralled.  I really wish he had instead shared his idea with Joshua.  Joshua's introductory munchkinry showed he wasn't against some mass murder with collateral damage when that's the optimal solution.  That's the greatest tragedy I see.  I have read all but the 13k submission, and this one affected me the most. /u/ExiledQuixoticMage!<
    ```

    - u/ExiledQuixoticMage:
      ```
      Thank you!  I'm glad you found it engaging.

      >!I think if this were another year the story would have ended with Joshua coming back and the two of them working out a better option together.  2020 being what it is, I just couldn't find my way to that happier resolution!<

  Story: [Heaven's Hall](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27095260) (~4400 words, CW >!suicidal ideation!<)

  Author: /u/Ms_CIA, who would like to thank their beta readers Vlaai and Capri.

  Prompt: >!"You have died. You remember what felt like the inescapable pull of slumber; a much more final pull than a simple good night's sleep. You know that you are dead.!<

  >!"Death, however, is not what you expected. It's not the empty void you'd always thought. It was a void that contained two things; you and something else. Something that you could practically feel smiling at you, as if it was in on a joke that it couldn't wait to let you in on.!<

  >!"The thing tells you that you were wrong. That atheism is a crock, albeit a well thought out one, and that it is, in fact, a deity. THE deity. The one that made what you once called existence. And now it's time to figure out where you're ending up for the rest of yours."!<

  Author: /u/Ozryela

  Prompt: >!"Once upon a time, in a land of magick and wonder, where all newborn babes are granted a unique magical gift upon birth, a child bearing an unusual gift cries for her mother's teat. She does not have the gift of mastery over fire and cold; nor does the have the power to bend light and summon darkness. She can not even bend spoons with her mind! No, her power is much more subtle than that: she can sense and craft mana at will. She's also barely a second old. Surely she'll employ her gift with the great wisdom of an infant. Surely."!<

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    >!Wow, you did an awesome job with this.  It was a challenging prompt with such high power levels, and I really liked how you managed to mold it into coherence.  The ending made me sad though!!<
    ```

    - u/Ozryela:
      ```
      Thank you for the kind words!

      >!It was a challenging prompt to write for. Went through a few ideas before landing on this story.!<

      >!And yeah the ending is a a real sucker-punch. I'm normally more into happy endings, but this just seemed to fit.!<

  Story: [The Earliest Spell Lord](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27091870) (~13200 words)

  Author: /u/blasted0glass

  Prompt: >!"Magic becomes real overnight."!<
  ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    >!I knew Brianna was planning something, but this became way darker than I was expecting.  I'd be interested in reading this as a full fledged story.  The most compelling part to me was the early stage discovery and planning.  Once it all became chaotic my interest waned a bit.  If it were to become a book or a serial, the end-of-loop failure states would need to have new elements to experiments being tried in order to keep them fresh.  Brianna is a fascinating character, and she'd carry it well.  Third person personal perspective.  Thank you! /u/blasted0glass!<

    >!There's a lot of interesting worldbuilding here that's untold!  If I understand correctly, the pilot made first contact by flying from one atmosphere to another?  I was a bit confused at how he didn't understand the local language, and that one boy could somehow manipulate a hundred metal tiles, as well as how he survived the landing.  Is there magic involved?!<

      Thanks for reading, and thank you for the feedback!

      >!Yes, he got lost in the storm and ended up landing on the other side.!<

      >!>I was a bit confused at how he didn't understand the local language!<

      >!On the Earth side, he'd recently moved there for work, and he hadn't yet had time to learn it. On the Luna side, people don't speak English. The former was mostly just a pretense for why he isn't surprised by his inability to understand Kauruva. I'll see what I can do make this clearer.!<

      >!>that one boy could somehow manipulate a hundred metal tiles<!

      >!Hmm, they just moved them with their hands (which is why they had gloves). I didn't anticipate this being unclear. Revision forthcoming.!<

      >!>as well as how he survived the landing. Is there magic involved?!<

      >!Not by intention :p It was just plot armor at play there, I'm afraid. Maybe I can give him a parachute.!<

      ---

      >!Is there anything else that you thought was unclear, or maybe was redundant? I'm not satisfied with the editing—I'm certain I can cut down on the wordcount more than I have. The most obvious contender is to shave off the aeroplane/flying-sequence as well as the immediate post-crash scene. Maybe I can add some words to the truck episode as well; it was supposed to show how Earthlings and Lunarians are emotionally similar and can bond, but it doesn't feel as if I actually accomplished that.!<

      >!Basically, the questions I most want feedback on are:!<

      - >!Where do you think I can shave off words?!<
      - >!How are Kauruva's interactions with Tremain?!<
      - >!Should I just cut the thylacine-fox thing? It was supposed to be a nod towards convergent evolution. Lunarians and Earthlings are genetically unrelated yet through their cooperation have converged to similar characteristics. Kind of like "A invents spear and shows to B, B tries spear and uses it to great success, B develops same motor skills as A did"—some kind of symbiosis. Thylacines and foxes are visually (and anatomically) close to identical due to similar enviromental input (primarily prey size) despite being genetically dissimilar.!<
      - >!What did you think of the way the fire-plot ended? Did the fire need greater foreshadowing or greater focus?!<


      I realize this is a lot to ask of you, so it's fine if you don't answer any of it. If you do, please be absolutely merciless—no benefit of the doubt to the author, please. Your personal impression as a reader can never be wrong.

      Again, thanks for reading :)
