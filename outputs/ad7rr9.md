  This originally was going to be one, longer chapter (because I didn't want to have chapters that didn't have at least *some* Pony influence) but given that I haven't released an update in almost six months and I want to reassure everyone that I will finish this story, I went ahead and turned this into a standalone chapter.

    Would it be possible for you to post the story to Archive of Our Own? That way you can have the comics posted in the same place as the text. Ao3 allows authors to post images unlike [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net).

    This entire chapter was an excellent demonstration of Albus' guilt and fears concerning his past and how Tom Riddle so strongly echoes his worst traits.

      Yes! I didn't even realize the "no links" limitation of [FF.Net](https://FF.Net) until I tried to post the comics.

        You should also be posting on Fimfiction.
