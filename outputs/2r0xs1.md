  Pretty standard premise, but decently implemented.

    Also a nice demonstration of how horror lies in tone rather than content.  As /u/CaptainLoggers commented, plenty of scifi has taken the same premise and turned it into adventure rather than horror.

    Mind, I really liked the statement that the Machine(s) simply *did not care* enough to exterminate humanity.  They just built themselves spaceships and *left*, post-haste.

  Reminds me of Dune, which was similarly a post war-against-thinking-machine society with such innovation discouraged religiously.

    The third rule specifically is a reminder of what came out of the Butlerian Jihad: Thou Shalt Not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.

    Warhammer 40k too, as a result of the war with the Iron Men, has a similar rule.
