## Does Luminosity get better?

### Post:

I'm at the 5.8% mark and nothing interesting has happened yet, so bored, tempted to just skip ahead a few chapters.
Metropolitan man and HPMOR had me riveted by this point.

  It's more character-based than event-based. If you're not enjoying the focus on characters, you won't enjoy the story.

    This. 

    I’m not suggesting you quit. There’s a section about two-thirds of the way in that is deeply satisfying (for me), but the rest was either a slog or I enjoyed character development. 

    I also re-read the Twilight series basically simultaneously so that may have helped me have a higher opinion of Luminosity.

      Why would you do that?

        Re-read twilight, you mean?

        I’d hoped that I was needlessly harsh in my initial opinion. Alas, I was right. 

        Also I was hoping to deconstruct what made me actually buy the whole series and devour it, given my really harsh opinion. I’ve read better books that I’ve cared less about. This series went viral. 

        Edit: tweaked phrasing.

          Um, that's still ambiguous.  Were you right in your initial opinion, or were you right when you suspected that your initial opinion had been needlessly harsh?
          ```

          - u/nineran:
            ```
            Yes. 




            (Sorry, that was irresistible. The Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer was downright painful for me to read. I devoured it. But I would call the books terrible. I do prefer to not bash on Twilight tho, because something about it clearly worked for me. Luminosity gets more leeway because it’s not published by a publishing house, so I can’t expect editing for things like pacing. And the MC is no longer painfully whiny. So I like Luminosity better. )

            Edit: I realized my response was ambiguous again and added to it.

              I am internally screaming, 3 years later, as I try to figure out if you absolutely loved or viciously abhorred the series. If you had set out to craft the most ambiguous comment on the internet, you've done a smashing job

    I agree, but I would recommend OP keep reading a bit more. It's hard to say if reading 5% of the story is enough to know for sure if it's your thing or not. It's possible that OP hasn't reached a part that's actually demonstrative of the story yet. 

    I really enjoyed Luminosity + Radiance, but I don't really recall the beats or the details of my experience of reading it. I do remember feeling really weirded out about reading a twilight fanfiction, even more so than an HP ff, but I managed to get through it and was glad I did. 

    I drew the line at ponies though. Could not muster up enough will to do *that*.

      I'm assuming you're talking about [Friendship is Optimal.](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) I felt the same way as you at first, but honestly, it's one of my favorite stories now. If anything the questions posed by it are more interesting for someone who doesn't like MLP than someone who does.
      ```

      - u/ansible:

        Yes, Friendship is Optimal is kind of horrifying to me in multiple ways. (As intended by the author, I think).

        Those of us who upload (or whatever it exactly ends up being) will be faced with many temptations to alter one's own mind after it becomes easy and convenient to do so.

        I could easily see myself starting down that path, and ending up totally different in a short amount of time.  If at all possible, I'll likely make at least one copy of myself, one of which is allowed to optimize, and another which will try to stay as human and unaltered as possible for as long as possible.  

        I still expect values drift and significant disagreements with myself, but I hope my optimized version will retain at least a little nostalgia and sympathy for my human version.

        BTW, /u/GlueBoy, I'm totally not a fan of ponies.  Not even slightly.
        ```

          I'm still not 100% convinced that uploading isn't the equivalent of dying and then a clone of yourself living in your place.

          It's basically the [Teleportation Pardaox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox) but strictly for brains.

          But I think if I could get past that dilemma, I'd probably be okay with the world overall. I mean I'd be bummed out that I'd have to be pony at first. And I would hope that I wouldn't need to significantly modify myself to achieve the happiness that I'd be guided to. But overall it's better deal than oblivion... I'm assuming.

            So in The \*Quantum Thief\* the idea of a Marovic upload is presented:  One neuron at a time neurons are replaced with a non-bolocial processor, until the product is software running on a standardized processor that due to the ubiquity of the processing substrate (I'massumina lot of out of band processing for analysis and modelling here that is implied but not explicitly stated).  The idea being to make a .flakk or vector art ("loss-less" analog representations of sound or shape respectively, as equations stored in digital media) of  from as high a resolution of a scan.

            &#x200B;

            If it's all just physics , and we understand all of the physics involved, the question is not if uploading is like dying, but how many nights sleep uploading is different from the you that  uploaded<chose to be a software instead of a meat robot>, and if the divergence is significant along "choices" you might makes ( recently posted a thread on Watt's Sunflower series, lets not get into the physics Tarpit \*Hotshot\* makes cross-pollinating free-will and the analytic ability of the subconscious).

              ```
              So the idea is to use the Ship of Theseus Paradox to ameliorate the problem of the Teleportation Paradox? Ha! I like it. Yeah, that would definitely work for me.
              ```

            - u/ansible:
              ```
              If I can choose a upload means for myself, it would be the one-neuron-at-a-time approach.  I actually envision at least a two-step process, where the first round of replacements are artificial neurons which can interoperate with biological ones, but also have high-speed electronic signalling protocols too.  These artificial neurons would be the same size as biological ones, and by default would not operate any faster.

              Then, when the first round is complete, you'd then convert over to electronic signaling.

              At that point (assuming things are stable), the first round neurons could be replaced with an only-electronic version which would then be much more compact.

              After the second round of replacements is done, it would be much easier to run at a higher signalling speed.

      Friendship is Optimal is really great though.

      I don't think you can get closer to the awe and horror that the singularity presents, without reading Watts, Accelerando, or Age of EM, and all of them either come down on side or the other or make the impact too widespread for the visceral gut-punch to come across.

      Iceman's opus in't about ponies.  It's about a good enough for government work  definition for friendliness taken to get first mover advantage, where the downsides start equine and pastel; but xenocide and a complete virtuality just short of wireheading might be the result.  Its a lot of deep questions shown with little hand-holding.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Luminosity is defiitely a lot more about the concepts than the events, at least until later on in it. Its sequel, Radiance, is a lot more eventful, but from what I've heard I like it a lot more than most people.
  ```

- u/The_Wadapan:
  ```
  I know it's what you asked, but "it gets better" or "it gets worse" seem like really unhelpful answers to me because Luminosity has some pretty distinct stylistic choices, and people who dislike them will say "it gets worse" when they read more, while people who like them will say "it gets better".

  Despite the fact that it's been out for ages, I only read Luminosity recently (having watched the first Twilight movie for comparison's sake). Maybe it was discussed to death in the past, but nowadays the most it gets is an offhand mention in a recommendation thread or reading list every now and then.

  For me, Luminosity (intentionally or not) averts or deconstructs many rational fiction tropes. Despite what appears to be a slow start and some meandering sections in the middle - this never really becomes an action-driven story - I think it's got some pretty strong economy of narrative, with all of Meyer's characters and worldbuilding having important roles to play in the themes Alicorn presents. It's about the conflict between wanting to do what's right for the world and what's right for yourself and the people you love; it's about the conflict between Bella's introspection and the strongly interpersonal interactions she has to navigate throughout the story. Twilight is generally pretty bad, but it's one of those stories that's frustrating because it feels like it's just a few tweaks away from being a really good and interesting one - and for me, that's Luminosity.

  Luminosity doesn't really show its hand until very near the end, I think. So, basically, if there's things about the story that are bothering you at 5% of the way in, they're unlikely to have gone by 95%. Unless you really, really like Luminosity, I wouldn't recommend continuing through into Radiance.

  ```
  It does have a somewhat slow build, but it really picks up the slack later on. In my opinion, at least. It's been a while since I've read it, mind, so I can't tell you when.
  ```

- u/tjhance:
  ```
  fwiw, i actually enjoyed luminosity the most at the beginning with the focus on bella and her obsessive introspection.
  ```

- u/PathologicalFire:
  ```
  I read pretty far into it and never enjoyed it any more than towards the beginning.
  ```

- u/lolbifrons:
  ```
  It didn't thrill me when I started it back when HPMOR had just finished, either.  I put it down, but I was thinking of trying again since I recently watched the Twilight RiffTrax.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  The strongest arc of Luminosity is towards the end, and Radiance is strongest towards the beginning.
  ```

- u/ToaKraka:
  ```
  You could try skipping to the sequel *Radiance*. It has a different protagonist, and I personally find it much more fun to read. While reading *Radiance*, you could periodically Ctrl-F *Luminosity* to fill any holes in your understanding of *Radiance*'s background.
  ```

  - u/Sarkavonsy:
    ```
    That... seems like a pretty terrible idea? Maybe I'm just more preoccupied by the idea of spoilers than most, but it sounds like a great way to be confused and bored out of your mind trying to read a book about people and events your don't under stand.
    ```

- u/The_Jeremy:
  ```
  I read a quarter of it and gave up.
  ```

- u/Slinkinator:
  ```
  It gets better the same way APGtE does...

  (It gets worse)
