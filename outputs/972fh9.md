  Oh. That's certainly a... novel fate for a rationalist story.

  Just in case the author takes the story down anyway, I think I've managed to coax the Wayback Machine to archive the currently available chapters, available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180813222138/https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3323184/1/Aeromancer).

  What?
  Is this some weird joke?
  ```

  - u/Slinkinator:
    ```
    We'll find out
    ```

    - u/MaddoScientisto:
      ```
      I'm so confused

      On one hand why would you even joke about this?
      While on the other hand how could this be serious?

        He deleted the patreon. I'm thinking it's real

    As funny as it is devastating.
    ```

- u/reaper7876:
  ```
  ...Well. That's the most surprising plot twist in the story so far.
  ```

- u/GarlicBandit:
  ```
  Would anybody be interested in an unofficial continuation by somebody who wasn't the author?
  ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    I definitely would, if it was done well.

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    I would.

  Damn it, I was liking them Devil-words.

  Since it looks like the story is about to be taken down, here's some copies of the 14 chapters in various formats:

  Note if [/u/Gelifyal](https://www.reddit.com/u/Gelifyal) has any issue with me distributing offline copies, I will immediately delete this comment. Also, [/u/Gelifyal](https://www.reddit.com/u/Gelifyal) if you aren't going to be continuing this story anymore, is there any chance of you posting your world-building and plot-line notes? I would love to know what you had planned.

  Good luck with whatever you choose to do with your life. I hope your choices turn out well for you.
  ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    I don't care if he does have a problem with distributing offline copies; if he's just gonna abandon the work, I don't care what he wants. I don't really support intellectual property anyway. If he had a good reason, maybe, but if it's something like believing that his previous work was sinful and would be corrupting minds, then I have no problem with going against the person he was turned into's wishes. It's probably what the pre-brainwashing version of him would have wanted anyway.

    So even if you take these down, I'll post them back up. I don't mean that in a rude or hostile way (towards you at least, somewhat hostile towards whoever brainwashed him though), though I understand it sounds like it.
    ```

    - u/kuilin:
      ```
      I disagree. When talking about other people, there should be a big gap between "I disagree with their worldview" and "I believe they should not have basic human rights, like property rights".
      ```

      - u/HeckDang:
        ```
        Intellectual Property rights conflict pretty severely with regular property rights, so you should probably reconsider them.
        ```

      - u/Argenteus_CG:
        ```
        I don't believe in intellectual property. I don't believe you can own an idea.
        ```

        - u/LordSwedish:
          ```
          I mean, does the fact that you can own an idea have any effect on that belief? You can believe that people shouldn’t own ideas but what you said is demonstrably false.
          ```

          - u/MereInterest:
            ```
            You are taking as granted a philosophical point that /u/Argenteus_CG has not conceded.  From the observational evidence, there exist people who believe that they own ideas, and act according to that belief.  Whether or not they actually own ideas, is a matter of discussion.
            ```

            - u/LordSwedish:
              ```
              People own things because there are laws saying they own thing. If there weren’t any laws or systems, people would just possess things and you can’t do **that** with an idea.
              ```

              - u/MereInterest:
                ```
                Were ownership merely a description of what the law says, and were the law to say that ideas can be owned, I would agree with you.  Instead, I disagree on both counts.  First, I would argue that ownership is a statement of moral rights that law is instituted to protect.  The law follows from the ownership, not the ownership from the law.  Second, the law does not give ownership over ideas, merely a temporary monopoly over some expressions of those ideas.  Copyrights and patents are there to reward and incentivize creators in exchange for releasing their writing and inventions to the public, not to give perpetual control over an idea to the first person to express it.
                ```

                - u/LordSwedish:
                  ```
                  I see your point. I don’t entirely agree, but at this point it’s mostly semantics.
                  ```

      - u/ThunderTiki:
        ```
        Nobody is stealing from him. Words and ideas aren't property in any sense but legal.
        ```

- u/lazaret99:
  ```
  I actually laughed out loud at this. 
  Just... what?
  ```

- u/Afforess:
  ```
  I am probably overreaching but whenever I see someone do a big life reorientation, such as this, I can't help but think there are psychological disorders at work. I just hope they don't get taken advantage of.
  ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    >I can't help but think there are psychological disorders at work

    Agreed. Going from non-religious (I assume from the way he talked about re-discovering god/jesus) to so devoted that he can't write a story that he feels is invested in seems a little strong...
    ```

    - u/Argenteus_CG:
      ```
      I'm actually kinda worried about him. I don't know if this is what happened, but given that it was a 'bible camp', the story I'm jumping to in my head is that he (a minor, I'm assuming, given that he was sent to a bible camp) was an atheist, which his parents discovered and sent him to a VERY heavy duty religious camp, where he would be all but brainwashed. Either they succeeded, or (and I hope for his sake that if the version of events I'm imagining is true, that this is what happened) he pretended to have been successfully brainwashed in order to ease the pressure on him and hopeful escape unindoctrinated.

      This is just the idea of what happened that's running around in my head, and while it seems plausible, we really don't have enough evidence to conclude any of what I said. It's just a possibility I'm worried about is all.
      ```

      - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
        ```
        He says in his bio that he works at bank, so that lowers the probability he's a minor.
        ```

        - u/Argenteus_CG:
          ```
          Adults don't typically go to 'bible camp' to my knowledge, though.
          ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        I'm not sure, but I don't think minors can use Patreon directly. Although it's possible if they have a parent who is managing the account for them.
        ```

        - u/Makin-:
          ```
          Or they just lied, Patreon doesn't ask for proof of age.
          ```

    - u/nolrai:
      ```
      I mean I'm an atheist... but it doesn't seem like a healthy relationship with anything if it demands you give up everything else. I mean maybe I am reading to much into how he worded things. But there's a big difference between "I found something more important to spend my time on" and "They demand that I give up everything else."
      ```

- u/kmsxkuse:
  ```
  Huh. This weekend, so sometime in the last 3 days then.

  Since the author did post: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9180bu/rtwip_aeromancer_chapter_14_prestige_academy/e3y5u57/

  3 days ago (Friday).

  That's mighty unfortunate since I was enjoying his content.

  Oh well, such is the fate of free content. Cant really be relied on to keep pumping out content. The Patreon supporters got screwed though.

    If it is indeed a hack, it appears /u/Gelifyal's Royalroad, Patreon and Fictionpress accounts are compromised, but their Reddit account is intact, since this is the only medium in which they didn't actively communicate the serial's end. That's a relatively severe hack, but far from unthinkable if they were sloppy with password reuse.

    On the other hand, I would expect at least one of these sites, Patreon in particular, to have slightly better secondary security measures in place. I'm also surprised that a malicious actor would take down the Patreon and post updates everywhere but leave the story itself up. It's a strangely halfway measure.
    ```

    - u/Ebtrill:
      ```
      Ah sorry, I'm not the author. That would be /u/Gelifyal. I'm just a reader who was waiting for this story to update today.
      ```

      - u/LupoCani:
        ```
        Which means I wrote, explicitly, in my post that the author hadn't posted the update to reddit, and then proceed to copy the username from the reddit post about the update. I'm not quite sure what I was thinking, exactly, but thanks for pointing it out.
        ```

  - u/valeskas:
    ```
    It was hinted several times that the story might be dropped. 

    Author mentioned earlier that 

    -his weekends are dedicated to other activities (presumably more important then the story)

    -story was designed with multiple drop points

    -something else I dont remember

    Specified reason might be a joke, but the drop is entirely possible.

    A pity, since the story was very promising, on par with MoL.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Nothing about it on his [FictionPress](https://www.fictionpress.com/u/1000469/Gelifyal) account, I'll treat it as a hoax/hack until further info.
  ```

- u/TheIssac:
  ```
  If this turns out to not be a joke, I truly wish the author the best of luck and happiness. Its not that uncommon that one will need to stop something he likes and enjoyes to better the rest of his/her life (think about stopping gaming or other hobbys while studying or starting a new job etc.. or because of getting kids/married).  I think Aeromancer had the potential to end up as a mayor success not only as a rational story or online novel but even as a published and finished book. But actually the current plot point is absolutly enough to end it as is, as a short story. Seti succeded in joining the world of mancers and even to attend Prestige so all his dreams and wishes got fullfilled and the rest lies in the future.

  All I would then hope for would be for the author to publish his work on worldbuilding etc ... as i would be truly interested in those kind of materials and also to see where the story could have been going.

  Also the END Authors Message at the end of chapter 14 on fictionpress got eddited and now includes the same message. So it seems to be real.
  ```

- u/sambelulek:
  ```
  I expressed interest in his story, and author responded not 3 days ago. By the sound of it, he had plans on how he would expand. By that and his active participation on this subreddit, I refuse to believe things were changing drastically in just 2 days.
  ```

- u/throwaway47351:
  ```
  What do you guys think the odds are on this being a real explanation, or him just getting bored of writing it and thinking of this as a funny way of stopping the serial.

  If it's the latter, I agree that this is pretty funny.
  ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    It's certainly unique and a bit shocking. As far as a memorable way to end a series, this is up there.
    ```

- u/Slinkinator:
  ```
  So... Scrap the rational tag?
  ```

- u/kaukamieli:
  ```
  Sad. I really liked the story. I hope the author finds happiness in his path.
  ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    I hope he escapes whatever cult brainwashed him, and does so before they ruin his life too thoroughly.
    ```

- u/CoronaPollentia:
  ```
  I appreciate that he's had the integrity to leave the story as-is and stand as a work, however incomplete, rather than adapting it into a platform for his religious views.
  ```

- u/Argenteus_CG:
  ```
  Well this is a huge shame. I was really enjoying this story, and it seemed really promising. Shame the writer went insane... maybe someone else could pick the story up, but they won't know what the original writer was planning on doing with it, and they'd have to be a pretty good writer to keep up the quality.
  ```

- u/ashinator92:
  ```
  Can someone ask him to share his notes so far?

  We know he has the story already in his head, would be nice to know how it goes (even in a abridged summary)

  Rationally speaking, if he's sure enough to leave the story dangling like this after getting a bunch of support :) , then he's commited enough to know he isnt coming back to it soon.
  ```
