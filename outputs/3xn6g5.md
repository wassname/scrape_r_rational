  Huh. I wonder how that loop-reset actually works. If it straight up resets the whole loop, then Zach has got to have noticed it when Zorian used it here. More than that, Red Robe may or may not notice that something new happened - Zach didn't die, yet the loop reset pre-maturely (assuming he's keeping some sort of tabs on Zach).

  And of course, there's the question of the other switches. Now *those* are interesting. What settings could a time-loop even have? Length? A button to bring someone else inside? Perhaps some useful minor features, such as teleportation to the origin of the loop?

  None of the above seem likely, so I really do wonder.

    One of them will probably remove Zorian from the loop, so maybe he shouldn't push all the buttons all willy-nilly. :p

    A fast travel system, or something else that can have "a list of similar buttons" as an interface.

      > I took it out. It wasn’t a bad looking belt — in fact, it was quite handsome. I wondered what I could wear it with — almost anything actually; it was just a simple black belt. It had a peculiar feel to it though; the leather flexed like an eel, as if it were alive and had an electric backbone running through it. The buckle too; it seemed heavier than it looked, and — well, have you ever tried to move the axis of a gyroscope? The torque resists your pressure. The belt buckle felt like that.

      > I looked at the buckle more closely. What had looked like a single plate of stainless steel was actually two pieces hinged together at the bottom, so that when you were wearing the belt you could open it up and read the display on the inside of the front. It was a luminous panel covered with numbers.

      > And there was something else I hadn’t noticed. The other part of the buckle — the side facing the clock — was divided into buttons. There were four rows of them, all square and flush with each other. The top row was cut into two; the second row, six; the third row, three; and the bottom row, six again.

      > I put the belt around my waist and fastened it. Actually, it fastened itself; the back of the clasp leaped against the leather part and held. I mean, held. I tugged at it, but it didn’t slip. Yet I could pop it off as easily as separating two magnets. Quite a gimmick that.
      > 
      > The buckle was still open; I could read the numbers on it easily. Almost automatically my hand moved to the buttons. Yes, that was right – the buttons were a keyboard against my waist, the panel was the readout; the whole thing was a little computer.

      > Idly I touched some of the buttons. The panel blinked. One of the dates changed. I pressed another button and the center row of lights flickered. When I pressed the first button again, a different part of the date changed. I didn’t understand it, and there was nothing in the box except some tissue paper.

  - u/None:
    ```
    Here's a plausible one: ejecting someone else from the loop. Perhaps with a purple beam of some sort.
    ```

    - u/Kodix:
      ```
      That's a good one, but I'm not so sure. Red Robe apparently doesn't have a marker, which should mean that the ejection function, if it existed, would be unavailable to him normally.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        There's clear evidence that the mechanism that Red Robe uses to time travel is not the marker. It was established that red robe does not have a marker, as only himself and Zach showed up in the location spell he used. He likely does not know of the marker's existence, as Zorian only protected himself from being located that way months after their initial confrontation and it would have been trivial for him to locate Zorian before that.
        ```

        - u/melmonella:
          ```
          >It was established that red robe does not have a marker, as only himself and Zach showed up in the location spell he used.

          He could have a different marker that wouldn't be located by the spell but would give him the same funcitons. Like usernames on a forum, with Zorian piggybacking on Zach's. It's not necessarily "The Marker", it could be "a marker".
          ```

        - u/Kodix:
          ```
          It *could* be that RR simply doesn't happen to know the locating spell - it's not necessarily common knowledge. 

          If he does know of the marker, he could also be hiding his own. But then he would also have to know of the possibility of the location spell (and therefore he would almost certainly have it, and have no issues locating Zorian) - so that's *very* unlikely.

          Mind you, I fully agree with your assessment. I was just thinking on some other possibilities.
          ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    One button has to exist somewhere: the one ending the loop, although it would be very strange to have it in the soul marker itself.
    ```

  - u/empocariam:
    ```
    What makes you suspect that it was a *loop reset* switch, and not a more simple *suicide* switch?  
    A loop reset feature would have to be developed wholecloth specifically for the sake of the time loop spell, where as a suicide switch may have already been pre-existing soul magic.  
    Since for a looper it has essentially the same function (unless you are accidentally in the loop like Zorian) it would seem more practical to reuse an existing spell.
    ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  So my little prediction that the gateway leads to Iaksu Mansion came true. Neat[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3urv1v/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_45_fine/cxr3ibu)

  Seeing Sudomir as the necromancer-in-charge there could probably explain the soul mage massacre. Maybe he wants to grab more power via open revolt in the aftermath of Cyoria invasion and doesn't want any soul mage to be a threat to his army of undead.

  And I can't stop seeing sort of mini quests lying around like little jigsaw pieces that could probably click together perfectly. Raynie is wolf shifter, wolf shifters hate ~~dire~~ winter wolves, there is a WW alpha to kill, let the girl help and let her take the credit. Boom, a little ruckus in the shifter tribe politics.

  Oh, Zach and Red Robe are VERY SURPRISED right now. 

  *add:* so after going for a walk and a bit of thinking I retract my statement I made elsewhere that for Red Robe investment in Ibasan invasion is a distraction. This does not warrant his reaction in ch. 26. Who goes in guns blazing when your decoy plot is foiled? Maybe RR is not properly paranoid and is overly impulsive instead, but that's not worth considering. "The enemy is smart" and all that. Why would RR need Cyoria razed to the ground, I don't understand. Especially if Daimen is connected to/is RR. There are cheaper ways to get your brothers killed, Daimen!

  Putting on my Doylist hat here I'd say we will have some insight on that in the next chapter (two max). Zorian has to open that memory packet as we are approaching (probably) the end of second arc. The 1st one took us 26 chapters, we're at 46, I think it's time to raise the stakes. Whatever got aranean matriarch so agitated and reckless has some clue to what RR is doing in Cyoria. It's worth noting though, that maybe intel she got was a deliberate ruse. Dozen+ restarts later (there was a handy restart-tracking spreadsheet somewhere) and the loop still looks pretty stable.

  How does Zorian open it, IDK. He could capture some low-ranking invader, haul him to Luminous Advocates. They could plant a memory packet inside prisoner's mind, and he would try to read it again and again until he succeeds. Yes I'm a horrible person. So I doubt this will be the route taken, that's too grim.
  ```

  - u/empocariam:
    ```
    >Why would RR need Cyoria burned to the ground?

    Something I thought of was that RR wants to be able to tap into the huge amount of ambient mana emanating from the Hole, magnified by the alignment event, without any interference from the city mages and city services like the teleportation network. Maybe destroying the city forces everyone else to either die or flee, giving more mana for RR to utilize.  
    The problem with this is since the reset and invasion happen concurrently, there doesn't seem like there would be enough time to "power-up" anything significant.  
    And I also suspect that ambient mana is so inefficiently utilized, like solar power, that all of Cyoria is probably barely impacting the raw amount of power, if RR were capable of harnessing all of it somehow.

  ```
  > he could get the transparency to drop like a stone

  Opacity makes more sense there - increasing transparency. One too many repetitions of Estin being the only one able to tank the magic missiles too, I think.

  >He was too good and didn't know how to hold back properly

  I like this. On the next level of mastery he could be able to duel with a weaker opponent without harming them. The level after that, his opponent wouldn’t even suspect that he’s holding back.

  Thoughts on golems: it was mentioned that golems above a certain weight limit are illegal to construct. I wonder if Zorian couldn’t circumvent this law by building a flying swarm of much smaller golems that can be even deadlier than their larger counterparts with the right protections and action algorithms.

  >Its movements were smooth and natural, and despite Edwin's rough handling, it never lost its balance like Zorian's previous golems would have.

  Oh, they’ve decided to build a [BigDog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNZPRsrwumQ) first. Never mind then.

  He discovered a very useful soul magic.

  I guess this is another reason to be very worried about risky situations.

  Also necromancers have super durability it seems.

    It seemed slow to activate, it only worked because the necromancer didn't catch on quick enough. In the future he'll have to be quicker or set up an automated trigger.

    - u/Nepene:

      Ideally, he'll find a way to bypass future wards that stop him exploding things too. I could easily imagine that Red Robes could have some spell to block him doing stuff with his soul.

  ```
  Are we sure that the switch resets the time loop? What if it's a suicide switch?
  ```

  - u/Kodix:
    ```
    We can't be sure yet, but that would be a slightly strange decision. 

    In the worst case scenario of there being no loop active while you have a marker, the switch would kill you instead of doing nothing. 

    In the best case scenario of there being a loop active, the effect of the two options is the same. 

    No gain, but additional risk. 

    Mind you, I wouldn't be surprised if mages did not think this way - this is more reminiscent of software design than anything else.
    ```

    - u/ajuc:
      ```
      The effect isn't the same when there are many looping individuals.

      But yes, the design is risky.
      ```

    - u/pizzahotdoglover:
      ```
      I agree that a reset button would be more useful than a suicide button.  However, a switch on a soul that kills that soul seems like something easily doable, while a switch on a soul that affects the entire loop may be less feasible, especially since we don't know how complex the magic used to create the loop was.  Also, why give Zack the power to affect the loop in such a way?  When Zack dies, does it reset the entire loop or does it just reset both of them, while Red Robe and everyone else continue until the summer festival?

          I'll be honest with you - I've never learned how to read those funny signs people used to denote pronunciation. But it's effectively Kiriel and Sjoria, so I guess [kɪrɪɛl] is correct?

- u/CopperZirconium:
  ```
  The last time Zack and Zorian met, Zack displayed ridiculously huge mana reserves, which Zorian was suspicious about, but passed off as crazy magical heritage. But now we see that Zorian's power is increasing too:

  >He could cast about 35 of them in quick succession, which was more than four times the amount he could cast before the time loop – that shouldn't be possible, especially since he was sure his mana reserves still hadn't topped out yet, so the most logical conclusion was that his magic missiles required significantly less mana now than they had in the past.

  I am fairly confident that this means that the time loop allows loopers to increase their mana indefinitely. This could be a product of a perpetually young body, magical hormones or something allowing their mana reserves to grow without aging to trigger the reserves to stop growing.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    An interesting theory. Mine is that this is an ongoing result of the whole soul merge deal, for which there is other evidence: his increased sociability, his uncharacteristic recklessness in this chapter.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      > his increased sociability

      That can be explained by the whole "not-constantly-hurting-while-talking-to-people-because-mindmage" thing though.
      ```

    - u/Revisional_Sin:
      ```
      I'm going to go with Zorian's explanation. He mentions that it makes it difficult to judge his capacity, so its seems to be magic missile effiency rather than abnormal mana growth. We even see his efficiency increase during the chapter.
      ```

- u/valeskas:
  ```
  >Zorian immediately felt the atmosphere in the room change, becoming heavier and more foreboding

  I wonder, how exactly is he detecting threat level. Generic danger precognition, or something simpler?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Increased mana would account for the atmosphere becoming heavier. And the fact that the mana is being used for unfriendly purposes probably tells his mage sense that it's forbidding.

  ```
  I'm a little surprised he didn't bring Edwin's golem along. Just promise to give it back the day after the festival.

  Not using it for the hook gnomes' distraction role makes sense, that certainly wouldn't look like a random monster attack. But he could have brought it with him, just as another tool that might come in handy, especially after showing it is decently robust.

  Is the golem not stealthy enough to bring or something?
  ```

  - u/nobody103:

    Not stealthy enough, yes. He expected to have to sneak into the base. If he knew how easy that would end up being, he would have brought a golem or five with him.

  Wow Zorian is now even closer to invulnerability, if he can activate his switch before someone kills him, he can restart the loop (apparently, not confirmed yet, but if it didn't and he just died there would be no point).  He can now do anything dangerous he wants that doesn't alert red robe. I wonder how zack will react to getting restarted randomly.

  In this chapter we finally get to see some inkling of what Zorian can do untethered. His skills are not suited for a duel with taiven. If Zorian fights he fights with a pet golem, dominated animals, a plethora of powerful items and mind magic attacks. Like I said in the previous thread Zorian is nerfing himself hard to fight taiven on an even playing field, which could be the purpose. I really would like at least a line about that though. 

  I've revised my opinion on using mercenaries like I advocated in the previous thread, that is best saved for the final fight. Though I still think it's a REALLY good idea to get a lot of teachers, illegal books etc with money from dungeon diving. How many useful spells can you accumulate with a large budget that replenishes once a month? A lot. Maybe he can actually cast a moving shield instead of a stationary one then. (I still think stationary shields are kind of useless)

  If Zorian was a bit more sociable it'd be a good strategy for him to go around finding "one month recruitables" as I call them. People who over the course of a month he can recruit to fight against the invaders. Just focus on one person a month that seems likely to help and try and figure them out at the end of the month tell them about the invasion and get them to fight with you. If they don't fight when it's obvious invaders are really coming then you try again next month with someone else. If they fight they can join your team. As long as you make sure they are honest people (which he can do with empathy) and you don't give them time to spread the word and possibly alert red robe, there is almost no risk. When the final fight comes he can recruit all of them at once.

  Really he should probably try and learn stuff from a necromancer  now (with backup to buy him the couple seconds he needs to restart the loop if they try to attack him). Only getting soul sight from some random potion or human sacrifice sounds fishy. There has to be another way. Plus think of all the soul magic he can learn.

  With all that in mind the author has stated (according to another reddit user) that Zorian **can** break the loop easily, but that wouldn't make a good story so he put a lot of limitations on Zorian. It just hurts my min-maxing soul for him to not exploit the loop to its greatest extent.

    It is already being demonstrated through Zoeian’s actions. Specifically stating it would be [unnecessarily clumsy,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons) I think.

  Sudomir might be Red Robe, right?  I mean, Necromancer: check, obviously powerful: check, has a reason to be involved with the invaders without being fully aligned: check (seems to be the Gate keeper), brags about being hard to kill: check (both Zach and Zorian have done the same).

  The only thing that makes it a little unlikely is the fact that he doesn't freak out over someone coming in through the gate in an unprecedented manner.  This could be explained by the fact that Red Robe isn't looping in exactly the same manner as Zorian and Zach (otherwise the soul pattern would show up in the scans), and might experience it differently somehow.
  ```

    I think Sudomir the Red Robe is very unlikely. 

    Necromancer: check. Obviously powerful: not enough power. Wears Red Robes: no check!

    It doesn't make sense for StRR to abandon invasion like he did in the past several restarts but then be still there for the final (failing) part. This token effort is meaningless. No, the actual Red Robe is doing something bigger somewhere out there. And the question why Red Robe invested time in invasion optimization is still a good one. So far I don't see any clues except that maybe it is a big distraction and nothing more.

    But the possibility of StRR raises a question why the hell did Zorian forget about recall spell, why he did not conceal his face, why he did not conceal his voice... And why he had built his escape upon an untested feature of the most enigmatic asset: his soul marker? Reckless, utterly reckless. Zach's soul bits are really rubbing off on him.

      The worst case scenario here is that Sudomir is in contact with RR and prepared to give RR a summary of the month and any notable deviations at the end of the loop. It's just a vague possibility, but Sudomir so far doesn't seem invested enough with the Ibasans and his necromancer status suggests a potential tie-in with RR.

      Recall spell: wards might prevent that too? Concealing face/voice: do we know that Zorian wasn't disguised? He is growing bigger balls as his skills progress though...
      ```

        You got me thinking and after some further consideration I'm putting StRR in the 'falsified' basket and Sudomir liaison of RR in 'unlikely' basket. 

        If Sudomir is to report to Red Robe at the end of the month, Zorian should've been soul-killed. Zorian made a pretty big splash from Sudomir's POV: saving Lukav and Alanic and then becoming apprentice in plain view. This has drawn attention from Sudomir to outright assassinate Zorian in one restart. This should've been reported to Red Robe who could infer that Zorian is time traveler or is connected to one. Moreso if Sudomir is in the loop directly. But nothing of the sort happened, therefore either Sudomir is giving RR a *very* cursory overview, or RR put Sudomir in the 'invasion' folder and therefore has avoided contacts with him in the past several restarts, or, quite likely, they are not connected at all.

        In any case, in this particular restart Zorian dodged the bullet by resetting the loop prematurely. There was no time to report to RR even if Sudomir and RR stay in touch.

        As for concealment measures, they were outright mentioned in confrontation with RR, and were *not* mentioned this time. Anti-recall wards seem possible in the setting, but again, a failed attempt to recall should be mentioned. Luckily these errors could be rectified with small edits.

          The recall spell establishes a magical link between a caster and a prepared object. The link must be supplied with mana to keep existing and - though I seem to have not explicitly spelled this out in the story - has range limitations. Any recall link Zorian may have had in Cyoria would have been severed when the gate closed shut on him.

    I'd expect Red Robe to be out in the world doing stuff. Staying at home would be rather dull for a time looper.
    ```

  - u/-main:
    ```
    If he is, then the way that person either restarted the loop right then, or was willing to commit suicide by taking their soul out of this iteration of the loop.... That could be a mistake that lets Red Robe knew that he fought one of the other time loopers.

  Upon re-reading recent chapters, I've been wondering: how fast could Zorian cast force lance, if he practiced for a while? From chapter 45, here's a description of the spell:

  > 'Force lance', as the spell was called, was her new favorite when fighting him. He knew better than to try to shield against it this time – the beam was practically designed for cracking simple force barriers, focusing an immense amount of penetrating force on a tiny patch of the shielding surface. Some of the stronger, more advanced shields could withstand the beam, but nothing in Zorian's arsenal could truly stand up to it. He had learned that lesson very painfully in the first few spars he'd had with Taiven during the past few days, and he still had bruises all over his chest and arms to prove it. Even at their highest setting, the safety wards couldn't blunt the power of the spear-like beam completely.

  > No, the only realistic defense he had against that spell was moving out of its way. The good news was that beam spells like those couldn't home in on targets, so dodging them was an option. The bad news was that a beam traveled blindingly fast and was really hard to evade at the distances he and Taiven fought at.

  It pierces basic shields, it travels extremely fast, and it sounds like it can really mess somebody up if it hits. This sounds like it could be really impressive if Zorian can cast it before a foe knows what's coming.

  Zorian learning about that particular switch in the soul fragment just in time for him to need it seems way too convenient. The same chapter we learn of them is the chapter where the protagonist could have died without it. This looks like a deus ex machina for me.

      Or he *had* other preparations which were not shown (or which were briefly mentioned in previous restarts), which he didn't need due to the existence of the reset switch.

      And let's face it, he must have been planning to test the reset switch at the end of the time loop *anyway*.
      ```

  - u/failed_novelty:
    ```
    He could have just brought his standard suicide cubes as a backup. He wouldn't have been able to use them thanks to the splodey ward, and may have chosen his marker instead as a result.
    ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    This whole mission was a bad idea anyway. Since he guessed the function of the switch, he planned to trade knowledge of what is behind the gate for knowledge for the other loopers that there is a third looper - not a good trade.
    ```

    - u/Fredlage:
      ```
      Both Zach and Red Robe knew that already.
