  150 articles... that is a lot. A non-quantifiable lot more than anything, as that's a big number even in fields with a huge number of collaborators such as High Energy Physics[\[1\]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0607224 "Scaling the
  h-index for different scientific
  ISI fields - arXiv article").

  >Red raises a hand and ticks a finger up one at a time as he speaks. "First, to become a registered Pokemon Researcher, I need to contribute twenty new articles on pokemon from my observations and experiences with mine. I can submit them through the pokedex, but I have to wait for them to be peer reviewed to be accepted."

  >"Can they be on any pokemon?"

  >Red nods. "One article on twenty or twenty on one or anything in between. I just need to discover or verify something new. Second, to become a Pokemon Instructor, I need to verify ten results from other people's research with my own pokemon, retesting their conclusions for validity. That's in addition to contributing another thirty articles of my own again. Third, I can apply to become an Associate Professor to work in the lab under Professor Oak, and to qualify for that I need to submit another forty articles and retest thirty more. And finally, once I'm an Associate Professor, I can become a full Professor by disproving ten theories that have already been established, along with a final sixty articles."

  And those seem like some very strict, non-flexible and weird guidelines. Specifically when considering it's straddling a line much more incommon with biology than any other hard science.

  ...

  Okay, let me do a mental reset and think about how I would approach this to make sense in the presented world.

  Assumptions(correct me if any of those are wrong from what has been setup in the world so far):

  -The organized field of Pokémon research is still quite recent as indicated by Oak being one of the first generations Professor's.

  -However other scientific fields are quite advanced as evidenced by the technology on display, so measurement methods and common research metodologies and evaluations like the h-index[\[2\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index "h-index - Wikipedia") and similar are in place.

  -In a similar way, university and research conglomerates also exist and work in conjuction for large projects and data collection. The degress of graduate, masters and doctor also exist in pretty much the same sense, although we can suppose some flexibility when it comes to age compared to the other fields/real world versus the field of Pokémon research.

  With that in mind:

  The first publications that Red has with his name on it should always be something he helped or collaborated in. If he had an internship at the Pokémon Lab, he was either doing mundane secretarial paperwork and taking care of the Pokémon which would only be translated in monetary gain, or if he was really helping in research projects or in the writing of an article then he should have been properly credited in it. And this actually fits with what we would expect from a research position, he would have to acclimate himself with all the busywork, from statistical analysis methods and evaluation of data to even writing the article according to publication standards(be it learning how to do write in LaTeX or Word for a scientifc publication). He would also probably need some simple programming basis as we're seeing that a lot of quantification of Pokémon data is given by technology, and I'm assuming that the Pokédex probably uses some standards that were developed in computers, so there it probably are languages and API's meant for searching and retrieving data from personal or public databases for Pokémon data.

  So, when Red goes on his journeys he should already have some contributions with his name on it, a positive point in his favor, but not a necessary thing to get the Associate Professor status. Now, what is probably wanted by all research institutions and Professors is data. Pokémon are biological machines and unfortunately you can't just reset them to a previous state and test another hypothesis, you can't experiment with the strength of a Charmander's ember pre and post-evolution based on his physical training with the same Charmander, only with a reasonable sized statistical sample(and as we're talking about a biology related field, even the usual rule fo thumb of >30 samples for a statistical normal distribution will probably need to be inflated here[\[3\]](http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_statisticalanalysis/statisticalanalysis.html#sec2-7 "Is there a minimum acceptable sample size? - A biologist's guide to statistical thinking and analysis")).

  As such, I would assume that wannabe researchers are encouraged to submit individual analysis and logs of singular Pokémon documenting their evolutions and capabilities along their maturing period. Typical articles would be variations of "Lifetime log of #Species Specymen for #Specific Environment under a #Something Training Regiment", but they would not only prove the capability and experience of the researcher for work when it comes to organization and article-writing, but those various articles would be welcomed as presenting case studies whose anomalies can be evaluated for more advanced research.

  Then, besides some 2 or 3 of those articles(or even 6, mirrowing the usual assumption of 6 Pokémon in the story's universe) it would probably be demanded one independent research article, what would probably be a Master's Thesis in our world, where Red would present an article for publication either re-evaluating some previously noticed phenomenom, or analysing something he noticed. His Spinarak is a perfect subject for this kind of thing, something about "Study of ghost-type characterized attacks from anomalous Spinarak specimen" which he would probably need to present in an open room, probably in front of a judge which is evaluating his candindacy for the rank of Researcher.

  Once he gains that rank then yes, I think some milestones in terms of articles/citations are more reasonable(as this is pretty much what happens in academia), but probably by evaluating his h-index and not his number of articles only. In a similar way, he would also have to probably present one more advanced work for each of the following degrees I would think. A long-term research and not-before-seen project for his Doctorate/Pokémon Instructor rank and then various publications to associate himself with a laboratory as Assitant Professor/Professor eventually.

  Now, one thing I haven't mentioned is the detail of publishing, but assuming the world you've protrayed so far I'm imagining that the publishing of articles is based less around paid articles in journals and more in an open-acess model similar to arXiv which is also what our world seems to be moving towards, this would also fit with the idea of young kids being able to publish articles, while allowing for peer-review nonetheless.

  I don't know if I over-engineered this too much or not, considering the story you're telling here, but I do love that you're writting a story that's making me question those kind of things.

  PS: Added sources as I thought some people might find it useful for some assertions.

    Lots of great info here that's definitely going to result in edits :) No time currently to respond in depth, just wanted to thank you for taking the time to write all this out, and I'll definitely be back to respond with my rationale and re-evaluate my system.
    ```

    Ok, now I've got time to respond!

    You're right in how fluid publishing is.  Anyone with a pokedex can submit data on the pokemon they're raising. 

    The reason for the volume is that I was envisioning the articles as pretty much everything from "On the relationship between gut bacteria and psychic powers" to "The effects of iron in sandshrew diets." In other words, pretty much anything that you can substantiate through your pokedex's data while you train them.

    What sets a researcher apart is volume: most trainers catch perhaps a couple dozen pokemon at maximum, and competitive battlers catch even less, in order to focus their attention and training on a core few.

    This often makes them experts on the few pokemon  they're familiar with, but mostly ignorant on others.

    Trainers who take the Researcher->Professor career path however are expected to know about large amounts of pokemon.  A few might specialize in less, especially for newly discovered species, but by the time someone is considered a Professor, they need to be capable of heading research on dozens of species, and be moderately familiar with at least the hundred+ native to their region.

    So becoming a professor is a time consuming process, but maybe the spread is a bit too wide.

    I did originally want to sneak the "150" number in there for fun's sake, but perhaps it's a bit much.

    The main problem might really be that there's a wide difference between a study on Red's spinarak's unusual abilities, and noting the effects of a caterpie's diet on the stickiness of its thread.

    With all that in mind, I'm considering re-evaluating what the criteria for each milestone is.

    Your description of what Red has learned is accurate, but the co-authoring of papers felt a bit too convenient to add: not that his name wouldn't appear on them, but I don't want him to already be considered an independently accomplished researcher.

    Edit:

    So let's say I shift it to an h-index approach, and weigh widely cited research far more than barely referenced ones (which makes sense).  Keeping in mind that becoming a Professor is far harder than becoming a doctor in our world, and that Professors are one of the few leaders of research in an entire region, (for reference, there are roughly three in all of Kanto and Johto), how does this sound?

    >To advance from a generic Pokemon Trainer to a Researcher, Red needs to submit an independent research article, and to advance from there he has to continue publishing until his h-index of publications and citations reaches 20 for Instructor and 30 for Associate Professor. After that, he has to demonstrate understanding in every native pokemon in his region, and write a dissertation overturning a previous established theory about pokemon.

    I agree.
    Described system feels way too much like infamous "Fetch N bear asses" quest.

    I suppose, the last level could be justified if Pokemon Professor is not like university professor in our universe, but more like Academy of Sciences of USSR, where full membership was super rare (few hundred members at most for hundreds of thousands of researchers).  

    But for entry level (Researcher), unless publications are trivial (logs like Drexer describes), I feel like 20 articles is 20 times too many. 

    That is, if Red is expected to get his Researcher licence any time soon. If it is expected to take him 4-6 years (duration of higher education IRL), then 20 publications is more reasonable.

      Professor is absolutely something that is incredibly rare and takes years to accomplish, but thanks to /r/Drexer's response I'm realizing that I frontloaded too much of it.  And yes, "Fetch N Bear Asses" is accurate :) I wanted to tie in the "150" number somehow, but I'll probably ditch it.

  Hello everyone, and welcome back! Longest chapter yet, but thankfully got it out ahead of schedule. Also, some fairly substantial edits to announce:

  Due to some great feedback from last chapter's post, I realized that I had done a poor job of making Red's goals feel concrete enough. "Become a pokemon champion" is straightforward: collect 8 badges, beat the Elite Four, enjoy your political power and prestige.

  On the other hand, the criteria to become a pokemon professor was too vague. "Catch lots of pokemon and research them" is not particularly tangible.

  So along with my usual edits to previous chapters, I've added a few paragraphs here and there to clarify Red's goals. Most notably, there are some new lines near the end of chapter 1, and a few paragraphs in the middle of chapter 4. The takeaway is that to advance from a generic Pokemon Trainer to a Researcher, Instructor, Associate Professor, and finally Professor, ~~Red has to submit a total of 150 research articles on pokemon, retest the conclusions of 40 that have already been submitted, and disprove 10 established theories. He begins to receive payment for submissions when he gets his Researcher license.~~ **Edit: Just edited the qualifications to the following thanks to /u/Drexer:  To advance from a generic Pokemon Trainer to a Researcher, Red needs to submit an independent research article, and to advance from there he has to continue publishing until his h-index of publications and citations reaches 20 for Instructor and 30 for Associate Professor. After that, he has to demonstrate understanding in every native pokemon in his region, and write a dissertation overturning a previous established theory about pokemon.**

  I've also added a bit to their dinner conversation in chapter five, where Leaf clarifies her interest in regional myths and legends surrounding pokemon for a book she wants to write, along with some tweaks to other chapters to make it more apparent that she's actively seeking such information.

  Finally, in this chapter I've renamed some of the Plates for more consistent theming. Because seriously: "Fist Plate?" No.

  Hopefully these changes improve the structure of the early story, and make milestones easier to imagine :) Thanks again to /u/AmeteurOpinions for the great feedback, and hope you all enjoy the new chapter!

  Also, I don't think the thing with the Clefairy (are we supposed to know what she did with the clefairy?) is actually unethical. I also don't think it would constitutes insider trading under any real-life legal system, because it holds intrinsic value and is not a financial asset (an intangible asset that derives value because of a contractual claim).

  Also, I think *all* successful trades based on fluctuations in value rely on either luck, or knowing something that other people do not know (just because it's public knowledge does not mean people know it). It's actually an area of debate as to whether insider trading *should* be illegal in the first place, and it's fairly difficult to define at what point a piece of information ceases to become "insider" information. 

  If you generalize Red's mother's argument of "profiting off ignorance" making it deontologically unethical to apply to all cases of profiting off other people not knowing things as quickly as you do (like gray-area information which is neither a secret nor well known) or other people making less accurate predictions using the information that is held in common, then I think you condemn *all* speculative trading in general as either unethical or pure gambling. 

  (Consequentially speaking, the economic repercussions are a complex mix of good and bad. You also end up condemning cool things that the rationalist tribe likes, such as prediction markets. Blanket bans on all speculation are unenforceable, anyway.)

  Edit: It's totally *believable*, of course, that Red's mom thinks it is unethical and Red agrees, so you don't have to change the story or anything. A lot of cultures (including my own) have a notion that people who make money without actually producing useful objects, services, or information are using cunning to cheat society, and while I'm not sure they are *wrong* in that intuition, I'm not sure how to practically *apply* that naive intuition to decisions made in the complex world of finance. I think what ends up happening is they vaguely feel that money, business, and finance in general are vaguely dirty, which I don't think is the correct conclusion unless we want to abolish ownership and revert back to hunting and gathering / we can get to a true post-scarcity situation.

    Aside from the course of the story, however, the basic idea in this case was more that the information Red has is privileged: he is not the one that discovered this secret of clefairies, Daisy was. If Daisy wanted to make use of this information to make money, it's much more acceptable, because her work is what will result in the value of the clefairy going up.  

    Red profiting off it seems somewhat parasitic, and definitely raises my moral hackles: I don't know that he's exactly *cheating* people, but he's definitely taking advantage of their ignorance, which makes the transaction unfair to me. It's not that they're incapable of determining the clefairy's "true value" and thus think the deal is worthwhile, either.  If they had the same information and still wanted to sell it at the same price because they don't think it's worth more or don't think the information matters, that's their error in judgement. Red purposefully seeking them out because they don't, while knowing the information would change their price, makes it predatory, to me.

    I'm open to the idea that I might be wrong. It makes little difference to the story, as I'm not writing Red as an author-insert, but as the main protagonist our values are obviously going to have some overlap :)
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    They're very much arguing the moral side rather than the legal one, but it's definitely something Red might or might not shift his stance on, depending on who the people that influence his values and thoughts are :)

  ```
  >How much money would you have accepted on the condition that you tried?

  I think this went over my head. How does considering how much money he would accept in order to attempt the dangerous task help him know if he was a coward or not?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    It might not have been couched well enough, but the idea is that it put a concrete value to how confident Red was in his decision.  

    If there's a price he might have taken to try it, then he must think there was a chance it would succeed (if not he wouldn't collect, obviously).

    Realizing there's no price he would take to try it helps make it more tangible that he really didn't think there was a chance it any thin would work.

    Does that make sense? I'm open to suggestions on either making it more explicit if it's not, or to the idea that it doesn't make sense at all :P
    ```

      Wow, that's not how I interpreted that at all.

      >From what details you have provided, I would have acted as you did. If that is not sufficient to your sense of responsibility, and you still fear that you acted out of cowardice, consider this: how much money would you have accepted on the condition that you tried? -G

      >Red lies awake into the next watch change, thinking about it. He eventually responds simply with None, and when he puts his phone away, he sleeps until morning without dreams.

      This makes it sound like G is asking, "If you did help, how much of a reward would you have accepted?" and like Red is answering, "I wouldn't have accepted any payment." not "What amount of money would have convinced you to try?" and "There is no amount of money for which I would have tried."  I definitely think you should reword this part if you were aiming for the latter set.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Thanks, changed it to " is there any amount of money that would have convinced you to try?"

  I really like the broad strokes of this chapter, but some of the details hurt it, I think. Power Force Ten and League of Heroes help flesh out the culture of the world in an interesting way. But it's not *three pages* interesting. Power Force Ten made me think back to Blue's type chart in the first chapter, where he had sixteen types. But apparently, it is accepted in pop culture that there are seventeen types? Why the variance? This sticks out because Red is criticizing the very concept of types, but nobody is objecting to anything else about the set up. On the other hand, it is a nice way to talk about the Fairy type in a casual, low-stakes way. That fleshes out the world a lot more than the love triangle between Crystalla, Lung, and Kagari, none of whom exist.

  I like the concept of pokemon markets, and the ethics of trading. I do hope that comes back later, since Red really isn't offering the best counterpoints. But I wouldn't expect him to. However, his mother was a lot quicker on the uptake than I was. So far, Red has shown a lot of interest in studying pokemon, and zero interest in making money. He hears a cool new thing about a rare pokemon that is about to be really expensive and he wants to buy one - I conclude that he wants to make sure he has one to study, and I'm momentarily confused when his mom isn't happy with him. I didn't catch on until several lines later, when Red finally says "But I really need the money!"

  Oak's reassurances do a good job of setting up a contrast between Red's role models, while also working well on their own. And of course, Red demonstrating the learnable skill of recognizing cognitive dissonance is great.

  The discussion of psychic phenomena kind of rubbed me the wrong way though. First, as a minor issue, Red starts taking notes, even though when he was talking to his mom "he hasn't enough light to write by". More seriously, Oak dodges the question. Red asks for theories, and Oak gives him a categorization schema. It would be like if Red asked him how life develops, and Oak tells him that there are animals and there are plants. Trying to avoid theory induced blindness doesn't excuse everything. Even what he does say is slightly annoying to me, in a literary sense. It's an exposition dump; lots of telling, zero showing. It felt like that's not how the story had to tell me this information... but it's fairly short, and it's between two mental exercises that work well, so it's not *that* big a deal.

  Red puts a lot of weight on that "Other" category, even after being told it's extremely noisy. I wouldn't expect him to be able to find a correlation without hundreds of data points and months of dedicated research... And even then he'd be better off ignoring "Other" and just comparing the pokemon code directly to find correlates. Perhaps that's a good long-term project. He's gong to need a *lot* of spinarak. Good luck, Red.

  Giovanni is awesome. In just a few lines, he gives good advice... and also shows himself to be the kind of person who likes putting prices on things. He could be light or dark at this point, and he seems intelligent. I'm quite eager to see more of him, little by little.

    >I really like the broad strokes of this chapter, but some of the details hurt it, I think. Power Force Ten and League of Heroes help flesh out the culture of the world in an interesting way. But it's not three pages interesting.

    Huh. I haven't ever viewed my story in terms of page count, so that does seem a bit excessive now that it's framed that way.  Might do some pruning.

    >Power Force Ten made me think back to Blue's type chart in the first chapter, where he had sixteen types. But apparently, it is accepted in pop culture that there are seventeen types? Why the variance? This sticks out because Red is criticizing the very concept of types, but nobody is objecting to anything else about the set up.

    The types are a lot more fluid in different cultures, which is something I wanted to get across subtly but might have shot myself in the foot with here. I'll probably just change Blue's type chart number.

    >On the other hand, it is a nice way to talk about the Fairy type in a casual, low-stakes way. That fleshes out the world a lot more than the love triangle between Crystalla, Lung, and Kagari, none of whom exist.

    Beyond world building, a lot of this was mostly set up for later: I want characters to be trope-savvy, which means I want characters who are aware of the same common/popular story structures. Introducing shows like Power Force Ten now should help make it easier later when someone needs to make a reference.

    > First, as a minor issue, Red starts taking notes, even though when he was talking to his mom "he hasn't enough light to write by". 

    Woops. Just noticed I forgot to mention that he's writing by the light of the pokedex, though I definitely remember thinking it. Thanks for catching that :)

    >More seriously, Oak dodges the question. Red asks for theories, and Oak gives him a categorization schema. It would be like if Red asked him how life develops, and Oak tells him that there are animals and there are plants. Trying to avoid theory induced blindness doesn't excuse everything.

It felt like that's not how the story had to tell me this information... but it's fairly short, and it's between two mental exercises that work well, so it's not that big a deal.

    This is definitely something I struggled with, as I need Red and the audience to know these things before he starts his research on his spinarak, but have no reason for psychic, ghost, and dark pokemon to be in the story yet for "showing." The way I saw it was that someone has to be telling someone else these things, and I really want Oak to have an active role as Red's adviser. Maybe the pokedex can show some simulations that the professor preps for Red to watch.  I'll have to think it over for future edits :)

    >Red puts a lot of weight on that "Other" category, even after being told it's extremely noisy.

Good luck, Red.

    One of Red's lacking skills is that he's not a programmer: he knows the basics of coding logic, but the code itself is gibberish, and he doesn't have the resources to do it himself. The idea of the biometrics in the dex is to give people like him the ability to examine things like that without being an expert in them, but unfortunately it hasn't been perfected yet, and there's still a lot of data from the pokemon's code that the pokedex can't parse and label appropriately. So it's a starting point more than anything.

    >Giovanni is awesome. In just a few lines, he gives good advice... and also shows himself to be the kind of person who likes putting prices on things. He could be light or dark at this point, and he seems intelligent. I'm quite eager to see more of him, little by little.

    I hope everyone ends up finding Giovanni as much fun as I find writing/imagining him ^ _^
