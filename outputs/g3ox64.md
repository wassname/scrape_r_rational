## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  A genie whispers in your ear that the cure for a slew of both deadly and inconveniencing diseases is a decoction of lavender and avocado oils (1:2 ratio, +/- 2%) prepared under the full moon and applied liberally to the right nostril and left ear thrice daily over a period of a month. After a month has passed, the effect is nigh instantaneous, the body suddenly finding hidden resources with which to heal itself over the following hours. You know the genie's words to be true (your wish being for the knowledge of a panacea), and can envision an industrial process to prepare this substance within acceptable tolerances. “That’s really stupid,” you think, “but OK.” Using the resources currently available to you, how do you most effectively publicize this knowledge for the betterment of all humankind? Alternatively, how do you maximize profits in a pharmaceutical context?

    My first instinct is to obfuscate some of the wackier elements while still keeping them in the production and application process. I've not much knowledge about the preparation of regular medical products, but assuming I did, I'd probably advertise it as having the lavender and avocado parts as a natural way of making the 'medicine' (additives) have a pleasant smell/taste. Tell the people that take it to use it as a skin salve, making sure to apply it to the sinuses and everywhere on the face (it's like suncream - you have to remember to put it on your ears and the back of your neck!). The thrice daily thing needs less obfuscation in order to appear feasible - I could see people accepting that as something necessary for the medicine to work. The hardest thing is the preparation under the full moon. How does that apply if you prepare it on the moon? Orbiting the moon? On another planet? And so on. Presuming that it works on a cycle that just happens to line up with the cycle of the moon as seen from earth, the best I can think of is simply keeping a small scale operation where manufacturing happens on the day imports arrive - which happens to be the night of the full moon.

    After that, if the panacea becomes famous enough, you can create an 'R and D' team to 'discover' what you already know. You can point them in the right direction, of course, but empirical evidence will be more likely to be accepted if it comes up naturally, I presume.

    Gradually refine the formula until you get what you were given originally, and people accept that it works.

    This strategy is definitely not the best, because I'm not very knowledgeable about this stuff. I'd hire people to try and alleviate that when I get enough capital, but that's contingent on getting said capital. As it stands, though, I think I've covered the points that would differentiate this from marketing any old medicine.

      Tossing some tried-and-true pharmaceuticals into that +/-2% margin and passing them off as the active ingredient is a good idea! Or even not and saying you did, lots of supplement etc. companies apparently get away with really lax purity standards. The way I'd envisioned it is the end product is sort of a viscous oil that'll leak out of your ear and dirty your clothes, and also out of your nose and taste kinda gross. So it has to still be majority oil by volume & mass, not just a trace ingredient in the specified ratio. So to get the necessary amount in the appropriate locations their face would really need to be dripping with the stuff lol.

      The moon thing would more require that the light of the full moon fall upon the constantly mixing surface of your vat / cauldron / beaker, the exact mechanism [redacted]. Maybe it has to do with some specific wavelengths of light in some specific orientation and quantity etc. Genie magic works in mysterious ways.

      I reckon a good first step would be to sell it cheaply as a supplement on Amazon, seeding your initial reviews with a few hundred fake ones emphasizing the need to follow the exact instructions to receive the purported effects, with lots of accounts describing initial failure under inexactitude followed by stunning success after precise adherence to the specified instructions.

        I still agree with the parent that the easy way to get this done is to require people to apply it liberally to the entire head. Pour it on your head like shampoo and let it run all over: the genie didn't say that the opposite nostril and ear need to stay dry.

        >The moon thing would more require that the light of the full moon fall upon the constantly mixing surface of your vat / cauldron / beaker, the exact mechanism [redacted]. 

        It's definitely an array of giant 10m industrial tanks. But it, an input buffer, and an output buffer are all in a TOP SECRET courtyard in the middle of the manufacturing facility. Shipments come in when they come in, do whatever you like titrating your legitimacy-adding pharmaceuticals at a constant rate, and make sure bottling goes out of the output at an approximately constant rate...no one needs to know that the central tank is empty for 28.5 out of every 29.5 days.

        I say "Top Secret" because your employees and customers need to expect that it's a semi-legitimate scientific process. But the other side of the coin is that you really need to not keep this secret: you need a dead-man's switch so that if you tragically get hit by an asteroid the secret doesn't die with you. Upload it to random subreddits. Print out the instructions and hide them in sealed jars. Get as many other people as you can in on the secret - take out a home equity loan, cash out your retirement, and give $1k up-front, $1k on completion to as many people as you can to send you thrice-daily videos of them following the protocol to get your exponential growth kick-started.

    I have no particular interest in maximizing profits, I'm going to skip that option and focus on publicizing it.

    It is, of course, easy to just post the cure to some blog on the internet and it is now, in theory, available to everyone. The problem is that this won't benefit anyone because no one will believe it. The trick is to persuade people to believe you.

    Making some of the concoction isn't difficult and is well within my means, so I would make up a bunch of doses by hand on my own -- maybe enough to treat 20 or 30 people. Then I need to convince people to put up with a month of treatment. I would try to find a few people -- maybe 10 or so -- who have incurable diseases like late-stage cancer. I have enough money saved up that I could offer to pay them some retainer to put up with applying this three times a day according to my exacting instructions. I'm hoping at least half of those would actually follow the instructions properly.

    Once I have, not one, but several "miraculous cures" I would reach out to doctors at major research universities and invite them to replicate my results. Again, I would focus only on completely incurable diseases because even a skeptic would need to admit that *something* unusual had happened if I (and my research collaborators) could produce multiple cures for such people.

    Of course I have wasted many months performing this "slow rollout" and condemned millions of people to an unnecessary death -- so I wait until I have gotten coverage in some major newspapers. Then I go immediately to publishing my "wacky treatment". Sure, at this point only the conspiracy theorists would give it any credibility, but that is still millions of lives that are getting saved. And the research by official research institutions can proceed at its own pace -- which will only be accelerated by mounting evidence that a small fraction of conspiracy theorists who follow my recipe ("small fraction" because most won't succeed in following the procedure correctly) have experienced inexplicable results.

      You gotta be kiding.

      People believe in all kinds of nonsense, including Flat Earth, Young Earth Creationism and even Christianity.

      I bet that someone would believe this cure and try it, let's be realistic.
      ```

      - u/mcherm:
        ```
        Finding one or two people to believe it is no problem. But one or two people claiming they have experienced a miraculous cure from some non-scientific process isn't going to persuade anyone *else* to try it. there are hundreds of non-scientific processes that have at least two or three people claiming it cured them of something obscure.

          To be fair, it's not like the medicine stops working if it becomes scientifically recognized. If you can get a half-dozen folk to believe you, you can all reach out to local news or scientific journals. All you need is one bored scientist, or better yet get the attention of someone trying to "prove you wrong." Once you demonstrate it works in a controlled setting, even if you have no idea why, the information can still be recognized in the scientific community. 

          For a fun real-world example, there is no complete understanding of how Tylenol works. There are some ideas that have been suggested, but no concrete method.

  You can talk to anyone alive or dead, but there's a few caveats.

  * You can only do this once and never again.
  * You can only talk to one person.
  * You can talk to anyone you like even if they never knew the language you spoke when they were alive. They'll understand you and respond in English (or some other language of your preference).
  * This only matters if you pick someone currently alive, but they'll remember having a conversation with you afterwards.
  * You have no supernatural ability to force them to answer your questions. They could even choose to say nothing at all in response. They are only required to listen to you speak.
  * You can't ask anything about what happens after death. Or you can try, but they won't give you any answers. Or they might mess with you as a joke. Depends on their personality.
  * You need to have a clear idea of who you want to talk to. Such as "Julius Cesar" or "Elon Musk" works. But you can't do "smartest man in history" or "17th President of the US" if you don't have a name or idea of who the person actually was. No using phrases or criteria to filter out a specific individual if you have no idea of who the person who meets the criteria could have been.

  How do you best munchkin this for fame, riches, power, or personal amusement?

    Point it at someone famous and alive. Never actually end the conversation. You can now easily and repeatably demonstrate that magic is real, which is possibly the biggest news ever.

    ~~Use the above method to cheat at bridge~~

    &nbsp;

    Try to connect to Satoshi Nakamoto. Sure, that's not their birth name, but it's *a* name, connected to a person we know as much about as many obscure historical figures.

    If they're dead they might be willing to give you the key to the giant early bitcoin stash (or another more modest bitcoin stash, since it's quite plausible the key to the big one was just lost) and/or enough evidence to demonstrate their identity, in exchange for fame or your promise to use some of that money for whatever posthumous desire they may have.

    If they're alive, you might be able to blackmail them for same, if they wish to remain anonymous and you can bluff that you have evidence to unmask them. Possibly you can uncover that evidence the hard way if you get enough information about them during the conversation to direct your investigation.

    (If it doesn't work, there may be other dead people known to have the key to a crypto stash or another; I'd have to look it up.)

    > You can't ask anything about what happens after death. Or you can try, but they won't give you any answers. Or they might mess with you as a joke. Depends on their personality. 

    I would try to munchkin around this rule as much as possible, preferably by securing the cooperation of a terminally ill patient with a family they love that badly needs my (financial?) support. They either cooperate with me after they die or I cut off my support to their family, so I don't have to worry about them just keeping silent. Preferably I should also secure all kinds of other motivations for them to cooperate.

    The issue then is, they can't talk about what happens after death, but can they talk about what does NOT happen after death? I could just have them continue listing everything that doesn't happen after death, eliminating possibilities one by one. Or better yet, what is enforcing this secrecy rule? If its some kind of intelligence like a king of hell monitoring the dead and punishing them for revealing details about hell, could we outsmart said king with secret gestures, words, topics, etc.?  For example, before my partner dies, I could teach them a number of keywords to say depending on what type of scenario they have found themselves in after death. Even something as simple as starting the conversation with "Long time no see" to mean that they are in a hellish environment, and "Oh hello!" to mean they are in a heavenly environment. Or more generally, answer my yes/no questions by talking about themselves if yes, and talking about me if no.

    Example conversation:

    Me: Hey partner, is the afterlife heavenly?

    Partner: You know you can't get an answer for that.

    Me: Are you in hell then?

    Partner: I can't say.

    Me: Have you seen <religious group X> in there?

    Partner: You shouldn't probe for such information.

    Me: Should I perform <action Y> before I die?

    Partner: I already said I can't answer questions like that.

    &#x200B;

    From that I would learn that my partner is in hell, that religious group X wouldn't go to hell, and that I should do action Y before dying.

  You stand in a cubic block of space. You cannot exit this space, nor can you move it. The boundaries are invisible and intangible, and everyone else can freely move across them, making you look like an idiot. 

  However, you have macroscopic awareness of everything in the space (3d vision), as well as a form of telekinesis slash matter manipulation. You can mentally move matter around slowly but forcefully, allowing for things like shaping stone and mushing brains. You can also slowly expand your space of influence by focusing hard, at, say, 2 cubic metres per hour. It doesn't necessarily have to expand as a cube shape - you could grow out tendrils, for example. 

  You start off in a house in a town. How would you munchkin this?

  - u/Amagineer:
    ```
    > You cannot exit this space

    How "cannot" are we talking here? Mental compulsion? Death-on-leaving? Inexplicable physical resistance? What happens if someone tries to drag me out of the space?

    My initial reading was inexplicable physical resistance (which is, admittedly more munchkinable :P). That allows for doing things like "building" a space elevator (though I suppose that'd be a hell of a climb). Also brings up questions about what "me" is (can my acoutrements pass through the barrier? bodily fluids? severed limbs? funky meditative shenanigans to redefine "me" to something weird?)

    >telekinesis/matter manipulation 

    >...

    > You can also slowly expand your space of influence

    How fine grained can I go with either of these? Can I split atoms with my telekinesis? What about fusion (fusion probably doesn't even strictly require fine grained control, just strength)?

    Can I use a space-filling curve to mess with the expansion rate? What happens if I try to claim a [Gabriel's Horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_Horn)-shaped space?
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    How strong is my telekinesis? Could I buy pencils (or get a partner who can leave my cube to buy them) and crush the graphite in them into diamonds, thus securing riches for me and my partner without ever leaving my house? It's a good thing we live in the internet age so I can communicate with various people through phones and text and even order item/food deliveries, so I wouldn't ever need to leave my house. That said I should probably regularly extend my block of space towards other structures I might need in an emergency, like a hospital or a hotel.
