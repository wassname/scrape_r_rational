      /u/eaglejarl, /u/FuguofAnotherWorld, /u/Velorien, /u/augsphere, is the gender and/or the name of the character up for vote?
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Sure.  Vote for anything you like.  We reserve the right to adjudicate / veto, though.
        ```

          Would you Veto for instance, Charles Barkley of the Village Hidden in the Jam?
          ```

          - u/Velorien:
            ```
            [quickly checks that there is no actual Village Hidden in the Jam because Kishimoto]

            Yes. Yes, we would. Even if you wrote the name in katakana.

              And Augsphere just stopped me from making an insensate rock with Ninjutsu through the character generation rules, this is a tragedy.

            This actually made me laugh, instead of breathing slightly stronger than normal. Two thumbs up.

  ```
  Looks like it'll be fun! I'll try to participate under the username -Caconym-. I've never done one of these before so I'm going to step back and let others do the character creation first.
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    None of us have ever done one of these before either, so you're in good company. I think once character creation gets going there'll be plenty of room to offer suggestions and vote on things without necessarily taking the lead.
    ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Feel free to post something simple, like this:

        plan Caconym 
        A close range fighter focused on speed instead of power. 


    You don't need to go crazy with the details.
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      Doesn't it go like

          [X] A close range fighter focused on speed instead of power.

      I think you need the [X]. And `[X] plan Caconym` is for people adding votes to Caconym's plan, not Caconym himself.

      The chargen rules are open to editing by anyone, so the owner should restrict it to suggestion only.

  Can we talk a little bit about how the voting works?

  To me it seems like we can vote for as many alternatives as we want. The way to make sure something doesn't happen then is to vote for everything *but* what you want to exclude. 

  I am also somewhat unsure what is meant by "earlier votes by a user is excluded". 
  My assumption is that you only get one post to vote in. Which makes it a good strategy to go back and edit your voting-post later? 

  It also seems to be the case that simple majority wins. 

  How will you resolve cases that seem similar or have the potential to be combined? I assume a certain degree of consideration is required by the GMs when deciding winners. 

  I am most interested in how you will resolve this in regards to stat-distribution. If a complete stat-distribution with fire-affinity gets 4 votes, but a simple vote for earth-affinity(only, no other details) gets 5 what happens?

  How will you mix and combine if points are insufficent for both? 
  Say earth-attribute 4 by itself gets 5 votes, but the complete distribution, which only has fire-attribute 2, but no points leftover gets 4 votes, how will they be combined, if at all?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    The only answer I can offer to any of this is "we'll use common sense and try to reflect our best understanding of what people want."
    ```

    > I am also somewhat unsure what is meant by "earlier votes by a user is excluded". My assumption is that you only get one post to vote in. Which makes it a good strategy to go back and edit your voting-post later?

    The voting bot looks back through all of the posts looking for things with an [x] in them. Then is takes the most recent by each person, counts and collates them. Simple majority does indeed win.

    In cases of a tie the GMs have a few options, such as waiting another half hour and re-counting, gauging the feeling of people in the thread or just picking the one that will make a better story. 

    Fortunately votes are kept separate even if they have similar parts. So, you won't end up with a mangled mish-mash of a character made by slamming two other possible characters into each other.

    If, later on, you end up in a position where there are 7 people saying go right, and 10 saying go left split into 5 go left and smell the grass with 5 saying go left and kick a rock, it is unlikely that you will end up going right.
