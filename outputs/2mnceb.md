  Fuck, now I **have** to write that Roomba story.

  In all seriousness, at first glance this seems pretty cool, but how do this stack up against other ways of making money with short fiction?

    Not great. Only 52 submissions accepted a year. Word length limit: 2000.

    On the other hand, if you have an in with the editor (like the people who will actually be accepted will) that's a few hundred dollars for maybe a couple of days hard writing and editing...that you have almost zero chance of earning by emailing that address.

    Hmm.

    So really, more of a standard open-call (slim) chance to get published than a way to make real cash monies fast. 

    >how do this stack up against other ways of making money with short fiction?

    Just as impossible. But do it anyway. But don't quit your day job.
