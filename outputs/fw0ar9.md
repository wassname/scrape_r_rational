## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  It’s... Monday somewhere right? 

  Is there any engaging ‘rational’ fiction that has NO ‘weird sex stuff’. It’s all I can find lately and it’s been dragging me down. Metaphorically.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    What have you read? Because most of the generally recommended fiction has no romance at all, let alone sex.
    ```

    - u/DearDeathDay:
      ```
      Most of the generally recommended fiction... 

      Mm, the list is too long. It’s too much to expect the casual observer to read so I was kind of just hoping someone would have read something interesting lately that wasn’t too well known or had slipped through the cracks. 

      The most obvious ones are: Delve, Worm et. al., He Who Fights Monsters, Something Healer, Cradle, Ra, Unsong, most of EY’s stuff (HPMOR et. al.), 14, Gilded Hero, Metropolitan Man (ehh), etc. etc.

      Edit: Weird Sex stuff shows up a lot. Or if not sex stuff it’ll just be really weird and uncomfortable. And I know I have a lot of triggers on that front but I can’t get past most of them if they’re one off. But when the character is thinking with their dick more often then their head or they’re getting ‘serviced’ for no particular reason or one of their skills is ‘talk with women’ I just can’t. It’s too much. I don’t like all that stuff in my normal fiction :<
      ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        Just checked your posts and saw you already read Mother of Learning, which was gonna be my rec, and Worth the Candle, which while it definitely has some extremely weird and uncomfortable moments deals with them pretty well. 

        Long shot, but [Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl) has zero romance and I've been enjoying it lately. It does have some prurient jokes in the game text sometimes. For shorter recs, you could give [The Northern Caves](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/) and [The Library Unpublished](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498) a try, in that order. [CORDYCEPS](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868) seems like the kind of thing you might have already read.

        I think you might've got less of a "can't find good non-sex stuff" problem and more of an "already read every good rational fic" one. A lot of people in these threads seem to have that problem, including me. (Maybe write some?)
        ```

        - u/DearDeathDay:
          ```
          Yeah your... right. The stuff I’ve been reading lately has been full of that kind of stuff but it’s probably just been some bad luck. I’ve read so many rational and rational-adjacent fictions. I’m kind of sad the well is starting to dry of stuff that isn’t low-FanFiction quality. WtC was a little weird but it’s well written and engaging, I took a break to numb the pain and awkwardness of >!her!< death but came back to catch up on the updates. 

          Thank you for the recommendations! I haven’t heard of them so hopefully they’re engaging. 

          And on the topic of writing... I used to write a lot of FanFiction plots, nothing published of course but I’m pretty sure it’s in the 100k+ word range in total. Which is kind of wack. Proof is easy, I know words on the internet are cheap, if it matters. I haven’t been particularly inspired for a few months but even before that I could never convince myself to commit to writing anything. It’s a lot of effort and I get distracted really easily. My grammar and spelling skills are also pretty messed up from all those years of reading not-quite-edited FF so I’d probably just feel bad and rewrite everything 10 times. I wrote this stupid plot for BNHA, some romantic fix-it-fic, and then rewrote it 7 times. It was after that I realized I’d run out of ideas for that fandom, felt about not working on my original ideas, and well, here we are now much later with no updates. 

          So, uhh... 50/50 chance you’ll see something not under this pen name out eventually.

          Edit: On a side note; why are there so many harems?!? ^yada^yada^power^fantasy

            If you want something not entirely rational I may have a few things.

            Ar'Kendrythist is super long, starts off like Delve but becomes its own thing very quickly. Same level of worldbuilding and consistency as Delve (though not as much math). The main protagonist is a middle aged dude, so anything romance related takes a long time to appear, much less happen. Character development is well done, and the author has been pretty respectful about how he approaches character relationships in general. Heavily recommend.

            River of Fate is a xianxia written in native english. It's pretty good, and the characters actually seem like they think before making decisions. It does the mystical aspect of cultivating well. Zero romance so far.

            Chronicles of Fid is a good superhero trilogy about the world's biggest supervillain, Dr. Fid. It's not as self-consistent as Worm, but for what it sets out to do, I found the story to be engaging and Fid's character to be interesting. Zero romance.
            ```

        - u/DearDeathDay:
          ```
          Just caught up to DCC and it was pretty interesting. The writing is fairly consistent and the distasteful humor is only over used in the kind of ‘this was never edited’ kind of way, maybe... Let’s say it was engaging enough to overcome its flaws by a slight margin, at least in my opinion. It’s unfinished and unless there’s time skips in the future it’s timescale is looking to be very, very, long so I guess I’ll check back in a few years.

          Thanks again! On to the next one I suppose...

    If you have already read most of the uncomfortable rational fiction, you gotta do a lot of searching.  Webfiction leads its self to the sexulized and cringe in genarle.
    ```

    - u/DearDeathDay:
      ```
      Yeah :/ 

      It’s unfortunate but I guess that’s the price for there being soooo much of it.

    Most of Brandon Sanderson's stuff is reasonably rational or at least adjacent. But my recommendation in general is, go for published books that are known to be good. They tend to be rational adjacent, that's what makes them good, imho it has more to do with the authors intelligence and care than with an actual intentional desire to make their stories rational..

    &#x200B;

    The book of ancestors by Mark Lawrence is great and has a powerful non mary sue female MC. Published books tend to have less sexual or misogynistic stuff, because they are meant to be sold.

    &#x200B;

    You may also be able to find a 'booktuber' with tastes similar to yours and read some of their recommendations. I like Daniel Greene, even though our tastes aren't exactly the same and he's kind of ignorant when it comes to foreign fiction, the books he likes tend to be good.

    &#x200B;

    If you don't want or can't pay for books you can get them for free on library genesis. Here's a link, [http://gen.lib.rus.ec](http://gen.lib.rus.ec) search around if you don't trust it. It's a site made to freely distribute scientific publications and books in general to the world, and there's a fiction section.
    ```

    - u/DearDeathDay:
      ```
      Thank you for the author recommendations and I’ll check out that YouTube channel as well. I guess I should start casting my net back out into the wider world of actual published fiction. It’s... been a while. I’ve been reading web novels and FF for so many years.

  I have discovered [The Guy who Didn't Like Musicals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrxKX44qBJ0) on this subreddit and it absolutely blew me away. The same team has recently released a new one, [Black Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqt4_tHLSB4), and it's also absolutely incredible.

  I wouldn't call them rational or rationalist fiction, but this is the best thing I have discovered in the last few years, and I wanted to share in case you haven't heard about it.

  They're Sci-Fi Comedy Horror Musicals, which is a pretty crazy mix, but they're *so* good. Imagine Dr. Horrible was 2 hours long, and every minute of it was exactly as awesome. Just watch the one from the first link, I fell in love with it in since the first song. 

  The same team has a bunch of other musicals, they're also pretty great, though not on the same level as these two. The others worth watching are:

  - [Twisted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5mkyhYMaQ8) - the Aladdin told from the perspective of Jafar
  - [Firebringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOblLPsAK_U) - how humanity has discovered fire 
  - [Starship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAi0XQPgXmQ&list=PLC6A915952D67F112) - Aliens meets Little Mermaid.

  I have also enjoyed [Holy Musical Batman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmZhMeY5L44) and [Spies are Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd3aJl930YE). They're also quite delightful.

  Lauren Lopez stars in all of these musicals and she's amazing, absolutely steals every show she's in. Check out [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_U1iYqdkyU) from Spies are Forever(even if you aren't planning to watch the whole thing). All the actors in this team are talented, but damn.

    I have to say, I've never really understood why so many people on r/rational like Twisted so much. I really like it's premise, but the execution was just very sub-par. It's been a while since I've watched it, but I remember my main issue with it was the constant jabs at Disney through world building elements that made literally no sense. It leans much more towards contrarian, or subversive fiction than full on rational fiction. Not to get too semantic here, but I'd barely even call it rational-adjacent. The only similarity between Twisted, and true rational fiction is Jafar's more intellectual approach to policy. I'd like to see a rational fic with the same premise (>!Jafar as a small time city manager trying to reform his country using evidence based policy!<), but where Jafar must figure out ways to politically outmanoeuvre his political opponents, and win the common people's votes and support. 

    tl;dr: Rationality is the art of winning. Jafar is the biggest loser in the land, and the land is a world building exercise in roasting Disney. Thus, Twisted is not rational, nor a good story.

    EDIT: To be fair, I did like Twisted’s depiction of Jafar as an idealistic intellectual, facing problems that challenge his core beliefs and are not suited for his intellectuality. Certainly it makes sense how many on r/rational would identify with this aspect. But, he never actually solves his problems! The best he can do is >!take the necklace his wife gave him and “believe that magic is real”! !<And then he’s shown a path that’ll make all his problems go away. This is not rational.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Would it be as good as good fanfiction if the story was written out in text form? Not by a long shot. Is it the actual musical based on a subversive-fanfiction like script? Definitely. Was it, in a vacuum, entertaining and funny and worth the time I personally spent on it? Yeah it was.
      ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    I didn't realize there was an entire series of these!

    I thought Twisted was pretty okay, though my favorite parts were only vaguely gestured at and it spent a lot of time making thoughtless jabs at Disney (there are so many valid reasons to have a problem with Disney; none of which Twisted seems aware of).

    I just watched The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals though, and it blew me away. I think /r/rational will pretty consistently get a kick out of this one.

    ```
    As a Team Starkid fan, I'll agree TGWDLM was pretty darn good... but I did not enjoy "Black Friday" nearly as much. The songs weren't nearly as strong, there were too many plot lines to devote attention to specific characters, and the best of the jokes were really just references to previous shows (especially TGWDLM). It was worth watching, IMO, but it was definitely not one of my favorites. 

    I would put "Twisted" up there as my favorite, tied with the Harry Potter musicals (more as a fan of the series than for how strong they were in any particular way). TGWDLM was great too, though I'm not sure I like the Hatchetfield spin-offs it has set up if "Black Friday" was any indication. We'll see how "Nerdy Prudes Need to Die" goes (rumored to be their next musical, though "Working Boys" may get a stand-alone release first).

  I am in search of several different recommendations:

  * New sites for webfiction other than RoyalRoad, AO3, Fanfiction.net, Fimfiction, Storiesonline, and Novelupdates. Especially looking for any blog webfiction that isn't on other websites (like [The magineer](https://www.themagineer.com/) or [Taint](https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/)) or fiction that is on websites you wouldn't expect ([Dream Drive on literotica](https://www.literotica.com/s/dream-drive-ch-01))

  * Long (>500k words) web/fan/erotic fiction you've read. /r/rational readers tend to overlap with my interests even if it's not rational

  * Any sci-fi/fantasy that covers if magic/crazy super-tech were introduced to current day society and how that magic/tech changes life. Effectively "the singularity". Most novels seem to skip this phase of the process and jump to 100 years later after most of the changes have already happened.

  * Anything pro-immortality that isn't the villain. Preferably with a real chance of getting it

  * Looking for stories that give the feel of the main character being surrounded by dumb-ish NPCs and abusing that fact. Examples of this concept would be HPMOR, With This Ring, Harry Potter and the Natural 20, or Two Year Emperor.

  I try to define my entertainment based on whether or not I was entertained, not whether or not the content was objectively good. Junk food entertainment is fine, so don't feel like you only need to suggest books with no typos or excellently crafted plots. It's enough if you found enjoyment from it.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    >Looking for stories that give the feel of the main character being surrounded by dumb-ish NPCs and abusing that fact.

    Liar game (the manga). It's games of wits between two or three smart PCs and a bunch of NPCs that can follow the PC's logical arguments, but are not at all creative themselves.
    ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    I note that your list of websites doesn't include [fiction.live](https://fiction.live), which definitely has a lot of stuff that isn't elsewhere.  Search for quality is an issue.
    ```

  - u/Gr_Cheese:
    ```
    If you're unaware of TopWebFiction (vote / rank site) then it's worth checking for new entries every couple of months. A lot is objective trash, in my opinion, because the voting system is suboptimal and does not deliver comparative rankings for anything other than popularity. But it's a good place to find a wide selection of stories that have long-active authors.

    And there are stories I've enjoyed in the lower rankings.

  - u/Amagineer:

    [The Simulacrum] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum) fits the bill on dumb NPCs, at least as far as I read. Sadly it felt like it failed to deliver on genre-savvy shenanigans. Hopefully you get more out of it than I did.

    There's an interesting erotica called The Gamer, found on chyoa.com (it's like a text based adventure website). Follow the route written by neo_kenka. It's like an erotica version of The Gamer manhua. I both recommend and un-recommend this. It's interesting in how it explores sapient creatures created by the MC's system, and their dubious existence (are they automatons? do they have free will? Are they philosophical zombies?). There's some sorta deconstruction going on also with the MC's charisma and libido stat(which is ever rising), as well as his role as The Gamer (his origin and purpose). And the mc's build is really cool, it's like a mix between dimensionalism and summoning. Also copious amounts of sex and bodily fluids, hence the un-recommendation. Really interesting if you can get past that though.

      I've actually read a fair bit of funatics route. I'll have to give that one a try. And the NSFW stuff doesn't bother me, though I will say funatics route somehow managed to make sex boring. By the 20th sex chapter I mostly just skimmed over to get back to the plot.

      Thanks for the rec!

    Do you have any recommendations for someone who is a fan of Dream Drive?

    My recommendation for you is Tristan's Tale on literotica.  I'd summarize it as an Alice in Wonderland type story with mind control powers.

    For something I haven’t seen recommended here before that hits the immortality seeking protag niche, take a look at ‘The Tragedy of Prince Hamlet and the Philosopher's Stone, or, A Will Most Incorrect to Heaven.’ It’s a full length play inspired by an omake from HPMOR. https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Philosophers-Incorrect-William-Shakespeare-ebook/dp/B0061Z9KWM

    “ACT I

    PROLOGUE

    KING CLAUDIUS

    "Grieve not for the dead.

    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven."

    What may we make of him who birthed these lines,

    and, in his mad stinking London,

    committed them to paper and the voice of me, his villain?

    Was our Shakespeare a Will most incorrect to heaven?

    Had he the liberty, what Hamlet had he writ?

    A true opponent, not just to me, but to the natural ordering

    of the spheres and of the mind?

    A youth, perhaps, who though as cautious as could be in action,

    were o'er-rash in fantasy.

    Exit CLAUDIUS.”

    If you don't mind erotica, ShaperV has a couple of decent sized quests on Questionable Questing; beware though as most of them are dropped. I've also enjoyed his [Daniel Black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KZ41LHM?notRedirectToSDP=1&ref_=dbs_mng_calw_0&storeType=ebooks) books quite a lot, and would recommend.
    ```

  If you haven't yet, try checking out the OG work on rationality, [Rationality: From AI to Zombies.](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality) I've just finished my second read through, and going back and reading HPMOR has been *so* rewarding.

  It took a while for my brain to get used to the lack of narrative (it's non-fiction), but after I did, I found that it was still a very engaging read.

  I've been plotting out this fanfiction in my mind and in my journals since last October. I'm only gaining traction on it now because I've actually started putting work onto being able to make smarter decisions myself, and I'm therefore becoming more able to write characters making smart decisions.

  10/10 would reccomend.

    I've been reading a chapter of that per day as part of my morning routine for a few years, and I've gone through it several times by now. It is really great and incredibly insightful. The insights per page is probably the highest among any nonfiction I've read.

    For anyone who really likes the book and never read the original Lesswrong posts, there are a bunch of sequence posts that didn't make it into R:AtoZ for various reasons that could be of interest as well.

  I have been reading [I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension)](http://webfictionguide.com/listings/i-am-going-to-die-in-this-game-like-dimension/), the author mentioned re-branding to something like 'The Whispering Crystals' if you've come across this post later on.

  The story is essentially transported -> survival game, in a world with different physics. There are stat screens; and the writing is solid. I'd argue that, while there are story-like elements and the rare bit of deus ex machina, the world and the characters follow the tenets of r/rational.

  I'd recommend it if you enjoy Delve.
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    I started reading it from this recommendation, and I just caught up.  I'll second the recommendation, and add that the alternate physics is treated like *physics*.  There are hints of a complete, well-developed system that the characters aren't exploring because they're busy surviving.  

    For example, when they say "Oxygen doesn't exist, you draw sustenance from Lavi via your lungs", it isn't just flavor text.  There are predictable implications from that, which become clear later.
    ```

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  I've been reading [Ar'Kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) for the past month or so. It starts off sort of like Delve, where a middle aged dude and his daughter get isekai'd into another world with magic and a "system." It quickly becomes its own thing though. I highly recommend it.

  Things I liked:

  * The characters are all well written and three dimensional. There is a lot of good character development, as well as meaty relationships.

  * Worldbuilding is great. Veird is a well developed place with believable history and vibrant environments, which are shown well when the characters visit those places.

  * There is a good balance between the powerful protagonist and his powerful enemies, not all of whom can be defeated by purely physical means.

  * The magic development + the magic of Veird itself is really interesting.


  Things I didn't like:

  * The main character faces a moral/personal dilemma which can be sort of hit or miss. For me it was more on the miss than the hit. I will say that it makes sense given his character though, so it doesn't seem unwarranted.

  As for requests, I've got two. Anybody have recs for big meaty stories, preferably 200k words or more, that have a bunch of time pass? One thing I've noticed with long stories is that the pace is almost always really slow. I want a long story with a significant amount of time passing between the beginning and the ending (or the latest chapter I guess).

  My other request is for stories with hivemind protagonists. Something like >!Zorian!< from Mother or Learning, or Taylor from Ex Synthetica, or the virus from Biomass Effect. Bonus points for using the hivemind in interesting ways (other than just a supercomputer).
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:

    > Anybody have recs for big meaty stories, preferably 200k words or more, that have a bunch of time pass? 

    The Long Price series, by Daniel Abraham (Book 1 is "A Shadow in Summer") is excellent.  It's well written with believable (imperfect) characters who act in line with what they believe instead of what the author forces them to do.  

    It's a well-developed fantasy world that's undergoing some very major changes throughout the series.  It mostly follows the same ~6 characters throughout, with about a ten-year timeskip between books (for a total of 30 years across the series).
    ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Been reading Ar'Kendrithyst now on your rec, its very good. Great prose and very civilized society, not dark+gritty as many Isekai tend to do.
    ```

  - u/afeyn:
    ```
    In regards to hivemind protagonists, Crystal Society might fit the bill.  It's about an AI with multiple agents sharing a body (think the emotions from Inside Out) each trying to accomplish their own goals.  It's well written and part of a trilogy.
    ```

      Isn't that the opposite of a hivemind? A mindhive, if you will.

      I agree it's the opposite of a hive mind, but it's a unique thinking perspective. I've been meaning to post a discussion of the series and writing style. I highly recommend the first book, am neutral about the 2nd, and recommend against the 3rd.
      ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Thanks for the Ar'Kendrithyst recommendation! It's been on my reading list but your explanation made me start, and the first chapter hooked me with the tone and heart. The tone reminds me a lot of the Dresden Files but without the grit (so far).

  ```
  A month ago someone recommended Lord of the Mysteries here. I read through two million words and wrote a longer review so you guys can decide if it's for you.

  https://recordcrash.substack.com/p/lord-of-the-mysteries

  tl;dr: The translation and start of the story are both really bad. However, the novel's got amazingly well crafted worldbuilding and pretty clever fight scenes, and for me that made up for the awkward Mandarin-to-English issues. Barring some Deus Ex Machinae, it has enough sidebar features for me to call it rational adjacent.
  ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    Great review! I found myself agreeing with pretty much all the points you made. It's one of those stories that I've kept up with constantly since I started reading it several months ago... it helps that newly translated chapters seem to be released in batches of 3-6 daily, giving a constant trickle of new content. 

    Two questions:

    1. You said there are "1068 chapters," but as of this morning I'm on chapter 1106. Do you mean these were the number translated when you made your review? Do you know what the number of (untranslated) chapters are? I'm wondering if new chapters are coming out daily and are translated and posted soon after.
    2. You mentioned "wait for the anime;" is there anything about an anime release, or was that ~~you lampooning~~ just a joke?
    ```

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      That was the last chapter posted to the site I used at the time of the review yeah. I don't know the number of untranslated ones, but judging from the wiki the plot has advanced significantly since 1068.

      The anime thing was just a joke, but I wouldn't be surprised, much worse and less mainstream appealing garbage makes it, and LotM has already been published as a light novel and manhua so it's the natural next step.
      ```

  - u/Rice_22:
    ```
    If only LotM had an even better translator it would've been a great work worthy of adaptation to other mediums, I think.

    Don't get me wrong, the translation is still far better than MTL or an amateur blogger working in his free time, and the best thing about the translations is the sheer speed and consistency of updates by the sole translator (20 chapters a week, 2000 words per chapter, minimal padding). I just wish there was a professional editor that went over the translations to correct all the issues that bugged me as I read.

    **Edit:** Read your review, can't disagree with it on most points. From sharing the story IRL with other book buddies, most people only got fully hooked after finishing Vol 1, Vol 2's pacing dragged a bit too long during the middle, some less attentive readers didn't like the information overload from earlier chapters but acknowledged they were necessary for the payoffs hundreds of chapters later. Most agreed the fights are short as they should and brilliant, even if the author cheats a little with 'Unspoken Plan Guarantees' to give Klein a better chance (which also has in-story justification). He's a paranoid one, our MC.

    I do think the main group of characters are more interesting than you give credit for, though. I never find myself bored wondering when the viewpoint would be switched back to Klein's. The focus on the value of money early on is because Klein is a penny pinching miser who constantly spends himself into poverty for reasons, which is often humorously contrasted with the near-infinite wealth of another character in the next paragraph. 

    Klein's character development is rather minimal as you said, more like someone near the end of their character growth arc and given opportunities again and again to show what sort of person he really is. He doesn't change much since Vol 1, but the repeated situations he keeps finding himself in fleshes him out realistically as more than just some reader self-insert.

    And yes, strongly agree that the most satisfactory part of LotM is how it all fits neatly together at each climax and the excellent use of foreshadowing.
    ```

    - u/AngryPuzzle:
      ```
      I have to agree, LotM’s characters are some of the best parts of the story. It’s fun reading how Klein drags the cast with him as he progresses with power. In most Chinese web novels it’s almost a feature of the story how the MC leaves the side characters in the dust and they subsequently become forgotten. 

      They also very distinct voices and interesting character growth, to the point that they could have their own novels. A good example would be how Alger changes his position in the organization.
      ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        I never said the characters were bad, they are fine. I'm just comparing them with other stories I read instead of other chinese novels. 

        I'm never bored per se, but Audrey viewpoints are almost always the same thoughts over and over, it only became interesting recently.
        ```

        - u/AngryPuzzle:
          ```
          I didn’t mean to give the impression that you were saying the characters are bad, if you read regular mainstream stuff I can understand that LotM’s characters can feel lacking in some areas (though I feel this author writes characters better than same mainstream fantasy writers like Brandon Sanderson). 

          Audrey has always been one of my favourites, but it’s true she has improved a lot recently, the Hvin Rambis arc is a good example. Maybe it’s how much of a slow burn LotM is or because the author is still improving but at 1000+ chapters I feel I have a far better impression of the characters than when they were first introduced.

  I have two requests, I hope that's alright.

  I'm looking for books with a forward momentum, high energy and highly intelligent protagonist, like HPMOR and the Vorkosigan books. I gather that Harry was based on Miles, so it seems to be a pretty rare concept in fiction. Does anyone have any recommendations for books like this?

  Does anyone know any good books with a realistic take on the life of an average person during various time periods, like prehistoric, roman times, medieval, etc. 

  Granted average person lives are probably too boring for a story, but at least somewhat of an approximation. A fantasy twist or alternative history is fine too, as long as it gets the feel of those time periods right. Things like social lives, how towns and cities were built up, what kind of authority figures were around, family composition, such things.

    The books that feel most similar to the Vorkosigan series (which is one of my favourites) to me are mostly in the genre of urban fantasy - The Dresden Files, by Jim Butcher, October Daye, by Seanan McGuire, The Rook, by Daniel O'Malley, or Alex Verus, by Benedict Jacka. I'd describe the main feature of these books (shared with HPMOR and Vorkosigan) as being "Cheerful mayhem, often against an epic scope". A more action-y series is Worm, by Wildbow (web serial, free online).

    I'd be curious to hear of other good works in this space.

    The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson is set in the 16th century and is written from the viewpoints of multiple characters. Lots of plotting by everyone that involves alchemy, inventions, currency and stock manipulation, the royal society, bankrupting countries, cryptography, faking deaths, the English succession, round the world trading voyages, prison breaks, etc..
    ```

      The Baroque Cycle is great, possibly my favourite trilogy of all time. 

      Anathem and Cryptonomicon by the same author are also very well suited for this request, and it doesn't require such a huge commitment.

    Reborn: Apocalypse has very high forward momentum, although the most recent volume did not portray it as well. The premise is that a cultivator goes back in time after humanity gets destroyed by another species. His goal is to make sure humanity survives. If you know about Cradle by Will Wight, this is like Cradle + Death Note. Not very rational but very fun.

    Documentaries on specific time periods tend to have this. Also some youtube channels. A few months ago I was researching falconing to see if it could be used interestingly in a story and came across a lot of videos of mongolian eagle tamers. Really cool stuff. Most of this though you'll find from doing research on specific things you're interested.

    Hardcore history podcast is fun, you can find it for free if you look hard enough.

    Have you read Ken Follet's stuff, e.g. [The Pillars of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth)? Medieval saga about a town in England, and the people jostling for power in it. Protagonists are minor nobility, farmers, merchants, or builders. Content warning: lots of violence, some graphical sexual violence in some chapters.

  Does anyone have recommendation for a Youtube news channel?

  I'm looking for something similar to the [Philip DeFranco Show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClFSU9_bUb4Rc6OYfTt5SPw), that has some of the same qualities:

  - A non-partisan-ish coverage of political events; if there are two or more conflicting sides, I want a summary of what each side believes, not "here is why X is wrong and Y is right".

  - A focus on international news and major events; if possible not too america-centric (PDS is not that great here; there's a lot of internet celebrity gossip and it's very american-centered).

  - Short videos with decent density of information. I don't want to watch a vlog, I want to spend less than 20 minutes a day knowing whether the US is going to go to war with Iran this week.

  (in the meantime the PDS is pretty good, but I'd like to have multiple news sources)

    I have no idea of a youtube channel, but if a subreddit might serve, check out /r/TheMotte, particularly the Weekly Culture War Roundup threads. It's a spinoff of /r/slatestarcodex, which was itself a descended or inspired by lesswrong.com, from which /r/rational is also descended by way of /r/HPMOR. So it's kind of like staying in the family, heh.

    /r/TheMotte is definitely not all rainbows and unicorns (especially if you go against the center-right/libertarian grain) but it's full of smart, articulate people and the moderation team is competent and strict without being heavy handed, and as a result the discussion tends to be interesting and fruitful. If nothing else, as a social democrat I find it a good way to sharpen my arguments and streamline my thinking, as many of my friends lean towards "tech bro" libertarianism.

    One caveat I would give you is that "hearing what the other side is thinking" may make you more well-informed, but it will not make you happier for it. It may even negatively affect your productivity. I believe there is research supporting that, but since I'm on a phone and can't provide any, consider it anecdotal.

        But that's humanity at large, right? Actually humanity is even worse, because it's full of idiots **and** it's unmoderated! Regardless, things aren't going to get better if we just ignore their existence, and are ignorant to their arguments.

    Spice and Wolf (economics, character driven, historical, romance) Great slow build romance with realistic approach. No idea if the economics were rational, but they seemed reasonable to me. Most novels have a nice complete story arc to it so it's easy to get closure even if you don't read all 17. Fully translated with a sequel series

    So I'm a spider, so what? (Comedy, isekai, decently smart protagonist, gamelit) Greatly enjoyed a non-human protagonist. The MC didn't make many of the glaring mistakes others in the genre do that I could tell. And it was pretty funny at parts. Up to volume 8 I believe.

    The Faraway Paladin.  Isekai about a boy raised by a ghost, skeleton and a mummy.  IIRC the prose is really good for a light novel and the story is character driven.  Has some good world building and an interesting magic system.  The first volume is one of my favorite light novels ever.

  There's a work of at least rational-adjacent fiction that I think I must have seen on this sub, because I don't know where else I would have seen it, but I can't seem to track it down.


  It's an MLP fanfic, though IIRC nothing in the story actually depended on the MLP universe (I followed it without knowing anything about the setting). There's a temple on the edge of the desert with some writing on the walls from 50,000 years ago and some people in the area who remember old legends not to go near the place. The rest of the plot as I remember it (major spoilers) is that >!they break into the temple and go exploring while they wait for an expert in ancient languages to fly over, but when the expert arrives they translate the message as saying that there's a sealed horror at the end of the tunnel that should never be breached, and to leave this message in the reader's language to warn the the next civilization. The people who have explored are finding themselves deathly ill at this point. I think it was implied but not stated to be radiation in there? It had to be left alone for a million years, or something. !<

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      I've got a few, although most of them aren't *that* rational.

      Man off the Moon is a mass effect / Fate extra crossover with Nameless as the protagonist in the ME universe. It follows nasuverse rules really closely, plus the main character does some cool things with his powers. Pacing has issues at times but it's forgivable for how fun it is.

      As expected, the confession they want is wrong is an Oregairu/Love is War crossover. Done really well imo. Hachiman and Shirogane are best friends, which makes for some great chemistry.

      Ex Synthetica is a Worm fanfic with Taylor having the power to make and control nanobots. Really fun, and Taylor uses her powers pretty well.

      Greg Veder vs The World is a Worm fanfic with Greg getting gamer powers. Better than 90% of gamer fics out there.

    - u/Hypervisor:
      ```
      > If you don't mind me asking, why didn't you like Berserk?

      I read up to the end of the Golden Age arc. The only good thing the manga has going for it are the relationship between Guts and Griffith which I admit is pretty good. But the rest of the story is just feels like a typical manga with just a lot more gore and sex. Nothing else impressed me: the worldbuilding is standard pseudomedieval, the romance weak, the fights are mediocre with just Guts slicing everyone with ease (granted on that last one I went into after reading much more clever fight scenes from Sanderson which might have made me biased).

      In particular, I can't fathom why people praise it for the art: while it does quite a few detailed scenes it's not much more so than most other popular series and IMO the characters look meh because the artstyle is obsolete 80s style. And the arc ends with a literal Deus Ex Machina with Guts being saved by Skull Knight. Maybe subsequent arcs fix those things but I googled 'best Berserk arcs' and most people seemed to think the Golden Age arc is the best so I decided to cut my loses right then and there.

      Thanks for the recs though!
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        Ah I see. If you didn't like it by the end of the Golden Age arc you probably won't like the rest of it. I guess the reason many people, me included, really liked it was because the end of the golden age arc is such a drastic change for all the characters. Besides a lot of people compared it to the Red Wedding scene from GoT, which I can't disagree with. 

        As for the art, honestly I have to disagree. I think the style is perfect for the tone it wants to convey, and the amount of detail for even the minor stuff is what carries it forward. While other manga would reserve a lot of detail for the two-page spreads Berserk does that for almost each page, which is why chapters take a long time. You'll see what I mean if you just browse through the latest chapters, and Miura has been doing that for at least 150 chapters. The only artists I've seen who put that much effort to singular panels are [Kaoru Mori](https://imgur.com/a/JMbki), [Shinichi Sakamoto](https://imgur.com/r/manga/DFU5r), and [Yusuke Murata](https://imgur.com/a/FEzuRN2).
