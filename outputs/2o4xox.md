  Wait. That's the actual Potter family motto in canon Harry Potter?

  Well *damn* that does fit like a glove. Previously I did indeed feel it was pretty.. "icky", if somewhat plausible. Knowing that it was *there before MoR* does make it much better.

    It is not necessarily the "family motto", but it definitely was is inscription on Harry's parents grave in canon. From what I found online the Potter family has a coat of arms, but no motto.

      It's a passage from the Bible, [1 Corinthians 15:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A26&version=KJV).

    I didn't like it in canon either. A christian epithet on a wizard grave stone didn't fit for me.

  >Can you imagine how loudly people would have screamed “Plot device!” and “Oh, come on, that is way too convenient!” and “That isn’t right at all, transhumanism isn’t something you get from your parents, it’s not something you inherit like a royal bloodline, it’s a decision we make for ourselves!”

  Wait.  I *did* scream that.  I actually had not known this was the Potter family motto in canon, and in canon, it's a *fucking terrible* family motto, because it turns the whole thing into Harry Is Jesus In Purgatory.  That freaking quote refers to Christ conquering capital-D everyone-goes-to-hell Theological!Death by sacrificing Himself on the fucking Cross!

  Hehe, I'm actually sort of [attempting this](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=145791.0) right now with [*my own Dwarf Fortress mod*](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=89267.0).

  It's a Homestuck mod that's been cobbled together over the years with nary a thought towards meta-world building. The story was supposed to be a standard somewhat silly CYOA, but then one of my first traveling companions had an analytical ability of over 3500 (where 1000 is average and the top percentile of humans is 2000) and a memory of 5000 (which is perfect memory in DF terms, so she remembers everything), so I ended up having to think about stuff because I felt like someone *that* smart combined with two intensely curious traveling companions means that stuff has to be questioned, analyzed etc.

  So it's sort of odd. Contrivances in-story actually come from the game, or at least how the game *should* be working at the time, so explaining that ends up seeming kinda off-the-wall, but the fact that the game does it makes it better. But *I made the mod that way*, even though I didn't do it while planning to write this story. This piece says that "There are authorial decisions that you *cannot* make yourself and that *only* another author can make for you", yet here I am making a story that relies on the constraints of something I made, using storytelling strategies that I would not use if the game weren't telling me that that ought to be happening.
