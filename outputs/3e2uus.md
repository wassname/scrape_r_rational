## So, has anyone started writing "A Song of Ice and Fire and Rationality" yet?

  [Discussed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2jlylx/rthfoneoff_short_storyrational_game_of_thrones/), but aside from that short I don't know of one. The problem is that we don't know enough about the magic to munchkin it, and the characters don't really behave irrationally enough that they need correction (most of the problems crop up from character traits and differing values rather than strict "you didn't think that through").

  Edit: Also, [munchkin thread here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39yvpn/munchkin_imp_game_of_thrones/).

    I haven't read the books, so maybe it's better there, but just from the TV show, I'd say there's a significant amount of irrationality, such as Spite Before Reason ([](#s "Cersei, Sand Snakes")), Passion Before Reason ([](#s "Jorah, Robb")), Honor Before Reason ([](#s "famously Eddard, also arguably ser Davos, he should've dumped Stannis long ago, imho")), Poor Communication Kills ([](#s "the Faceless and Arya")), and plain good ol' religious fanaticism ([](#s "Stannis, Sparrows")). Examples are not exhaustive.
    ```

      I don't really see the relationship between the faceless and Arya as irrational. I liken it to the relationship between the master and disciple that is central to Zen. The master's task is to pass on an experiential understanding of the tradition, not an intellectual one. This involves methods that appear irrational or mystical to outsiders.
      ```

      I think [](#s "Eddard") is most commonly used as an example of "irrationality" but I really do think that this is a case of values; he'd rather die an honorable death than live a dishonorable life. For that reason, I don't think you can call it a lack of rationality, because rationality doesn't mean that you're changing your core values.

      Some of the others are more arguable. I think I would defend religious fanaticism when there are actual, verifiable results that come from that religion. There's no excuse for [](#s "Cersei") though.

        His chief value is to keep his family safe and protected. This is something he singularly fails to achieve.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          I think he has multiple values which come into conflict with each other (which is good characterization). Simply saying "his family was more important to him, ergo he should have behaved dishonorably from the time he got to King's Landing" is simplifying too much. His family *was* more important to him than honor (and I would argue that this is one of the chief reasons to believe [](#s "R+L=J")), but honor was also something that he valued. I don't think trying to do things as honorably as possible while protecting his family was that irrational.

          As a comparison, it's like Batman trying to fight crime while also refusing to use guns or kill people. Those are both values that he holds, and there are some good stories that come from throwing those values into conflict.
          ```

        - u/sparr:
          ```
          Is it? I think he is portrayed as being willing to sacrifice his family if that is the only honorable course of action.
          ```

          - u/thebeginningistheend:
            ```
            Then why does he forego his honour and confess to King Joffrey to protect Sansa?
            ```

            - u/sparr:
              ```
              Because he's not perfect.
              ```

      I'm going to talk about Eddard here and this is going to spoil things from the latest season and book. You have been warned.

      I hate it when people talk about Eddard as being "honourable to a fault" or having "honour before reason" because it's just not true. As soon as Eddard gets imprisoned the north rises up in rebellion and crowns Robb king of the north because they would do anything for Eddard and his house. They would go into war against the seven kingdoms if they had to because of their loyalty to the Starks.

      While it isn't shown in the series, the books show how the north rebells against the Boltons in hatred because Roose Bolton helped kill Robb. The mountain clans of the north all join up with Stannis to march on Winterfell, the Manderlys join up with the Boltons by necessity but spend their entire time there insulting them and assassinating the Frey retinue present.

      Eddard is an honourable man and acts honourably which has given him the most loyal and powerful kingdom out of the seven. He rules a land as large as the other six combined and everyone (with few exceptions) loves him and his house and know he can always be trusted. The north remembers and Eddard and his children will be followed to the ends of the earth.

      It sounds like your first three are the straw Vulcan fallacy (that a rational agent cannot choose their goals based on emotion). Similarly, I find it hard to find religious fanaticism irrational when the religious fanatics can literally perform miracles

    I don't think you need to worry about the magic. 

    No PoV character (except Bran who you could just "Ron" off-screen) understands magic or can control it. All the characters with Magic can just act the same as their canon versions.
    ```

    - u/JackStargazer:
      ```
      But the mere fact that magic verifiably exists and is accessible indicates that it is likely the most powerful optimizing agent in the setting. Any truly rational protagonist would seek it out.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  I maintain that it should be called "Game Theory of Thrones" (and actually be about game theory (and decision theory)).

  I'd rather see the wheel of time given a rational treatment, I think there is more meat there.

    Have you seen [this?](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7628608/2/Ta-veren) It hasn't updated since last spring, but what's there is pretty decent.

  We need more information about Maesters and Oldtown, as well as blood magic and the Asshai, which I anticipate will be a significant part of Winds of Winter.
