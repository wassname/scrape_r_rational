  > It looked like a large metal cone with a black tip, 6 feet long and 2 feet wide at the base. There was something written on it but she couldn’t make it out in the scurry.

  I think I should recognize the device on the pallet, but I don’t.

    Don't worry, probably not relevant!

  Are all the physical descriptions of the infomorphs based on Hollow Knight characters? I originally thought their depiction in the cover art was just a fun easter egg particular to the art itself, but now that Miss D is a dead ringer for Hornet, I'm not so sure.

    Originally, no. Then I used some HK character art as reference images for the cover artist, and they became kind of fixed in my head when thinking about future vessels. Delmutt's current vessel is a direct nod to that influence, but we won't see much more of HK- too obscure to just obliquely reference. Which is a shame, because it's an amazing game.

  My money is on the piece of furniture being a wardrobe. Can't think of anything else relevant.

  I love how the metaphysics in this story are developing!
