## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Picked up [El-Ahrairah](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/reader/) again over the weekend.

  Hoping someone familiar with Watership down/the fic can explain the meaning behind the name? There‚Äôs a bit with Lisa early on where she jokes that could be her cape name, or something, but context clues couldn‚Äôt get me there and I‚Äôm not drawing much from reading the Wiki of the rabbit/story.

    > All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, and whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first they must catch you, digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed.

    I think the majority of the name reference can be summed up with the above quote (from Watership Down), in reference to the sheer scope and nature of the problem Taylor is dealing with.

    A bit later in the story Taylor has a conversation with >!Glaistig Uaine!< in which this is explained a bit more than the Lisa convo.

  I've just discovered [Unfathomable Power for the Low Cost of Someone Else's Soul](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57721/unfathomable-power-for-the-low-low-price-of-someone), and I've been really liking it so far.

  The main problem I have is that I really want to learn what the MC's unfathomable powers _actually are_, since they're all fairly well optimized so far and the MC (and author, by extension) have clearly put a lot of thought into the maximally useful powers you could be granted by an extra-dimensional being on a budget.  So far he has personal small-scale biokinesis and a 3 second future sight, and he has to have a few more as well just based on how many souls he's sold.

  There's also just straight up wards and magic involved, and the MC can cast spells and create wards given time and materials. Unfortunately he's currently busy fighting >!magical pirates!< so it hasn't come up - after all, I'm betting that most of his abilities aren't actually combat oriented.
  ```

  - u/meangreenking:
    ```
    Its fun, but people here should note that the MC is stupid.
    Not out of combat, but as far as fighting goes he's basically too stupid to live.

    He doesn't use all his abilities, loses really badly, then goes "well, time to get serious"... and then uses a single extra ability next fight out of all his abilities and then the whole cycle repeats multiple times. And its not (just) out of morality or anything, its just he's too stupid to remember he has them and turn them on before he fights.

    Eventually (like 2/3rds of the way through the first arc) he finally starts fighting actually using all his powers, but it takes much longer then it should.
    ```

    - u/sephirothrr:
      ```
      well obviously the main character is a metroidvania protagonist, and he hasn't actually unlocked those abilities yet
      ```

    - u/lucidobservor:
      ```
      The protagonists strongest powers, as well as large workings of magic in general, are said to be *dangerous* to use and capable of changing him in ways he's not clear on in advance. Which means he doesn't use them until absolutely necessary, and correspondingly doesn't have practice using them. I'm not going to claim he makes those tradeoffs even close to optimally, and his great success actually using the powers of narratively sketchy.

      But it seems like your reading of the story was something like "dude ignores cool abilities on his character sheet until it became dramatically appropriate to use them"? Whereas during my reading, it felt more like "dude pulls out possibly dangerous powers when it's obvious he needs to to survive, then learns to use them in live combat."

      TL;DR: I enjoyed the story and did not spend very much of it cursing the protag's stupidity.
      ```

      - u/lillarty:
        ```
        The problem with your interpretation is that the protagonist is explicitly stated to have *forgotten* about having powers before he activates them. It felt more to me like a mediocre fanfic, where the author arbitrarily throws in new powers when they feel like it and writes half a sentence justifying that they totally had the power the whole time and it's definitely reasonable that it was never mentioned before now. 

        I feel like in these sorts of situations Wildbow's advice on writing web novels (namely, keep a backlog) would help enormously; if you have several chapters in your backlog you can retroactively add references to your new idea to chapters so it feels more natural when it actually comes up. All it would take for me to be all-in on your interpretation would be a few references to him contemplating using the potentially-dangerous abilities for a few chapters before it actually gets used.
        ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      While that's entirely true, I do think it works fairly well; one of the MC's deeply held beliefs is that killing other humans is a terrible crime, for which literally getting your soul forcibly pawned off is a fitting punishment. Combine that with the fact that he's slightly superhuman and has therefore been living in something of a world of Kleenex for the last several years, and I think his continued hesitance to actually fight like he means it is fairly well justified.
      ```

      - u/meangreenking:
        ```
        I get the morality stuff and not wanting to kill people, not every MC needs to be a xianxia murderhobo.

        I get about forgetting about abilities in the heat of the moment. Fighting is hard and scary. Fighting while handicapped by morality is harder still.


        Less acceptable is sitting in a room starving for days, and during that whole time not taking about twenty seconds to make a mental list of your abilities to see if they could be of any use in the whole not dying thing. Because yes, he totally *does* have an ability that doesn't have any side effects and that doesn't require him to kill people/risk his soul/sanity. He just completely forgets about this ability that he likely spent months writing a contract for and killing people to acquire.

        And I do understand why the author made him slowly turn his abilities on slowly (he wanted to show off his abilities one by one), but it still makes the MC either a big idiot or someone with pretty substantial memory problems and (IMHO) is a pretty big weakness of the story.

        E: It honestly isn't that big a deal though, its a fun story and I largely enjoyed it.
        ```

        - u/ansible:

          > And I do understand why the author made him slowly turn his abilities on slowly (he wanted to show off his abilities one by one), but it still makes the MC either a big idiot or someone with pretty substantial memory problems

          That's a curious choice by the author.  If the MC slowly *acquired* those abilities, I doubt anyone would have an issue with that.
          ```

  - u/lillarty:
    ```
    I stopped reading it the third time the MC pulled the "Oh tehe, I forgot I had a superpower this whole time, lemme just activate that real quick"
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    **It's The Dresden Files without background, investment, or buildup.** That's 100% what the tone and characters seem to be imitations of. And I love the Dresden books.

    It's decent, but really emphasized to me how important the other 75% of those novels are. Just jumping into the sacrifices, fights, and smarm loses so much.
    ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    I do appreciate this little detail in the first chapter:

    > The spell was already cast, technically. It was on the floor. I just needed to activate it. I pulled my pocket knife out of my pocket, flipped it open, and drew it quickly over the top of my left hand, letting the blood well and drip onto the top of the circle.

    In movies and TV, people are ***always*** cutting the palm of their hand, their thumb, or something like that if they need their own blood.

    But those sorts of wounds are so annoying! For goodness sake, put a cut on your forearm or someplace that won't hinder your activities.  Someplace like your forearm is also much easier to bandage, and have the bandage actually stay on.

    -----------------

    I also liked this bit from chapter 5:

    > In the end I called myself a pussy, which activated some caveman ‚Äúme not pussy‚Äù response and I washed and got dressed.

    Just wanted to chime in since you're getting a surprising amount of pushback, to thank you for recommending this, because I'm enjoying it! I've read everything that's been released so far.

    The issues the other comments are describing are present, don't get me wrong, but at least to me they feel a great deal more minor than other people are apparently seeing them as.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Yeah I kinda think a lot of people are bouncing off of the story because the MC is terrible at combat, both in terms of handling it while under pressure and executing it. 

      I get the criticism that the MC keeps forgetting to use powers and pulling them out of his back pocket, but honestly that makes a ton of sense to me given his character - he's _not_ a direct combatant, he's an ambush predator who's picked up a couple of these powerful utilities kinda by accident. He's having to do a full on paradigm shift in multiple axes, and he's not handling it well.

      Whether or not that makes sense to you is probably going to be the determining factor in whether or not you like the story.
      ```

  - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
    ```
    I read the first handful of chapters. I liked the first chapter, the subsequent ones have so far been kind of meh. 

    Does the MC ever get over being such an excessive *dweeb*? It's kind of turning me off of him.
    ```

  I watched [From](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDHqAj4eJcM) the other day and feel as though it deserves a recc. With the second season starting up soon, it might be worth to people who like a bit of Sci-Fi esque(not sure if it accurately describes the setting) horror.
  ```

  - u/andor3333:
    ```
    I agree with the other posters that it is pretty cool if there is an answer at the end, but I get the impression they piled on as many twists as possible without a plan to solve any of it. It was watchable so I hope I‚Äôm wrong. If you don‚Äôt mind it running on dream logic it is good.
    ```

  - u/Valeide:
    ```
    Strongly disrecommending this. It's not rational, at the very least- it could be (and evidently is) enjoyable in some other sense. I would describe this show as being anti-rational. Random Shit is going to Randomly Happen until the series is over, and any watchers are going to be stranded with a dozen partially or fully unresolved "mysteries."

    The ending is going to be something like... Well, here's a review of Under the Dome. No context required. "We never actually learned where the dome came from aside from some glowing egg. We never found out what the dome was for. We don't know where these aliens came from or why they needed to live on Earth. We don't know why Chester's Mill was chosen, and we don't know if there were more aliens coming. We just know that there was a dome that randomly popped up in a Stephen King-ian town in the Northeast." 

    The same is going to hold for From. There's going to be an "explanation," something to do with "pagan" religion/rituals, or they're all dead or whatever. It's not really going to explain anything, other than that the random symbol people kept drawing in season one was an alien footprint or a pagan something-or-another, and that the ~~giant dome~~ uh, weird space-loopiness was caused by ~~an alien egg~~ monsters.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      I mean, it straight up says "from the executive producers of LOST" so anti-rational is just par for the course...
      ```

    - u/LaziIy:
      ```
      I never stated that it was rational but yeah the point for the potential ending of the series to ruin everything, with the director having history in Lost and Game of Thrones, is not really lost on anyone.
      ```

      - u/ricree:
        ```
        >I never stated that it was rational

        Considering the sub, I think it's perfectly fair to judge the series by that criteria unless your recommendation specifically acknowledges that it isn't. 

        (For that matter, it's probably not ideal to recommend something here that does a bad job at rationality without including a disclaimer, but you'd hardly be the first there)
        ```

        - u/LaziIy:
          ```
          Oh sure I have nothing against you for judging it against that criteria, just saying that I did not intend to declare it  as some high form of rationality. 

          If we go by the sidebar definitions of rationality I'm sure that one or two could apply to the series thus far so I was unaware I needed a disclaimer to recommend it.
          ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    The trailer *did* look interesting. However, they mentioned the producers from "Lost"... so I can only hope they've got an actual ending that makes some kind of sense already planned out.
    ```

    - u/LaziIy:
      ```

    What would you say makes it worth watching, particularly from the r/rational perspective?
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      It's a show about delving deeper into the unknown to discover a central mystery about reality, complete with cryptographic easter eggs. The internal logic of the show is too cartoony to be properly rational, but characters at least try to make intelligent decisions with the tools and knowledge they have.

      Though to be honest, when it comes to this thread,

      >Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise?

      I mostly recommend stuff in the "or otherwise" category. This subreddit aggregates people with a similar taste in fiction as me, so I'm far more likely to enjoy reccs from here whether or not they're actually "rational," and I do my best to return the favor by recommending anything I find particularly engrossing.
      ```

- u/RetardedWabbit:
  ```
  Anyone have good recommendations for **litRPGs** where the numbers/system details have **impact**? 

  So many of them seem like an afterthought, 1:1 replacement for normal character strength growth, or muddy/low effect. That doesn't make them inherently bad stories, but I've been trying to find another one where you get excited at the number/skill change AND then see/feel it in the story. Ideally with some thought/planning about that beforehand.

  Good examples of this that I'm thinking of are: Worth the Candle, Delve, Everybody Loves Large Chests(initially at least)

    It's fanfiction but [The Games we Play](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12119784/1/The-Games-We-Play-By-Ryuugi) by ryuugi does that pretty well I felt. It's a rwby fanfic where Jaune gets the power of The Gamer (from the manwha of the same name). One of the big things is that every 50 points in a stat gives a perk related to that stat, and usually these perks *meaningfully* change the way the protagonist interacts with the world. It's really well realized, although pacing suffers at the end. It's also one of the few litrpg stories I've read that has an end, so there's that. 

    A similar fanfiction of Worm is [A Daring Synthesis](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/). While it doesn't do as much with the physical stats, it handles the Wisdom stat really well. The protagonist starts as a cringy teen 4channer in the beginning and slowly and painfully gains wisdom, every point of which changes his understanding of the world and himself. The ending is kind of bad, but there's a place a few chapters before the ending that serves as a better ending.

    Besides that, most Russian litrpg tends to be pretty crunchy. I remember Disgardium being pretty good. Way of the Shaman and others by the same guy are pretty crunchy as well, but tend to be a bit unpleasant in terms of... cultural bleed through. Both are dystopian VRMMO.

    *Azarinth Healer* has a very nice leveling system, which incentivizes characters to go out and do unusual, even crazy, things as opposed to "grinding stats and levels".

    Unfortunately, the writing is not all that it could be. It slowly gets better as the fic progresses (the author got an editor) and the Kindle rewrite is reportedly decent, but the original version posted on Royal Road was rather painful. The only reason I managed to get through the first 300-500 chapters was the interesting leveling system.

    [Transcendent Humanity](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity) is pretty great. It's a Mass Effect fic where the PoD is that humanity never found the relay or any protean ruins and so their technology and culture developed differently.

    Finding utopian fiction is difficult because there's no clear definition as to what a utopia is. More specifically, everyone has a different vision of what it might be, so you typically need to qualify from whose perspective something is a utopia (eg a wealthy plantation owner might be living close-to-utopia but the slaves he owns definitely aren't).

    I, for example, would not consider the Star Trek setting a utopia, because while it's not bad, there are still some biases they have that I believe are bad (eg their stance towards transhumanism). 

    Furthermore, storytelling relies on conflict, stakes, consequences, etc. all of which are very difficult to include in a perfect setting. If you define a utopia as a setting where everything is perfect, can there even be a plot?

    That said, there are some stories that I feel contain partially positive visions of the future. 

    * *Bobiverse* series: While this series kicks off with an apocalypse, later in the book series it gets pretty positive. There's still conflict and stakes, but considering the main character is a von-neumann machine and the remaining human society has nearly magical 3d printers, it's pretty chill. 

    * *Murderbot diaries* series: Granted, a large portion of the setting is future corporate hellscape, but there are entire planets of "good" people on the rim that live well.
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Union Station series is a pretty decent collection of comedies set in a galactic community which is pretty chill because the ftl system is run by AI that like things that way.

    Actual Play Audio, so YMMV, but Friends at the Table‚Äôs ‚ÄúTwilight Mirage‚Äù season did plausible high-tech utopia, but its also about what utopia in decline looks like.

  Have recently discovered that my laptop is the ideal way to read manga, so I've been tearing through series lately and have found it very rewarding.

  First thing I found is that Tatsuki Fujimoto is one of my favorite living storytellers, both of his series gaining easy 10/10 scores. **Fire Punch** is his first, featuring a post-apocalyptic world where people randomly obtain supernatural powers, with the entire planet being locked in a neverending winter by an unknown person known as The Ice Witch. The protagonist is an extremely high tier regenerator who is hit with a blessed flame that does not ever go out until its fuel is consumed, leaving him with a body permanently on fire as he stands in the ashes of everyone he loved, with the only thing keeping him sane being his desire for revenge. This series explores the absolute worst of what humans can do to each other, what they can become in a world without a future, and how a person can continue to live despite this.

  Fujimoto's other 10/10 is the famous **Chainsaw Man**, and I assure you that the hype is justified. This story explores what it means to be human through the perspective of the boy Denji who has spent most of his short existence figuratively buried underneath Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, finding contentment only in the best dog in the entire world, Pochita the Chainsaw Devil. After being betrayed and killed by the people who've been exploiting him his entire life, Pochita sacrifices himself to become Denji's heart and tells him to follow his dreams, while giving him the power to become the titular Chainsaw Man and fight devils. This series has a heart of gold buried very very very deep down, but it will hurt you so good in every way it can think of.

  The only other manga I've found so far that is giving me that 10/10 energy is **20th Century Boys**, though I'm far from done with it. Boilerplate premise is that a simple man trying to raise his sister's child while running a convenience store starts to become aware of a strange cult bearing a symbol he invented as a child and only ever shared with his small group of friends, and becomes increasingly alarmed as people start dropping dead in ways that feel suspiciously familiar. It doesn't have any of the violent artistic flair of Fujimoto's mangas, everything sticks to a pretty restrained and realistic style, but it still manages to invoke a very strong sense of intrigue almost immediately and keeps it going for several volumes. I've felt like punching the air in celebration several times, and then Volume 5 hit me in the face with a flashbang and politely waited until my confusion had died down before sucker punching me right in the kidney. I so look forward to what the rest of this series brings, and his other manga are up next.

  I can't give it a perfect score, but **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** has definitely been the most enjoyable series so far. Protagonist Rentarou has given a total of 100 failed confessions before even entering high school, but he is quickly informed by a god of love that he has been given a grand total of 100 soulmates as reward for his dedication and definitely not because said god watches Ghibli films while working. He must find each soulmate and make them happy, lest they die of a broken heart. This one does not take itself remotely seriously, Rentarou is an impossibly perfect Girlfriend Loving Machine and his girfriends regularly ignores the laws of physics. But this series makes all of that work, and while no one knows exactly how this series will avoid collapsing under its own weight when the girlfriend count grows large enough, it has remained super fun so far so it gets a thumbs up and an easy recommendation.

  If anyone else has a manga that they consider a 10/10 contender, please let me know, I have been accumulating them for a while.

    I don't like ratings so I'll just post the ones I really like.

    Grappler Baki is my only 10/10 because it sets out to do one thing, does it perfectly, and it never deviates from that. And I'm rating the series as a whole here, not just the first part. It might take some getting used to the strange, but excellent artstyle. And if you don't like action you won't like it, because it's 95% fighting.

    Soil is very interesting, and I'd easily recommend it. It's a lovecraftian mystery set in a small town. 

    Freesia and other Jiro Matsumoto's manga are all really good. Other stand outs are Jigoku no Alice and Joshi Kouhei.

    Kani ni Sasowarete is very surreal and has a great atmosphere, and it's really short too, just a collection of one shots.

    Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou (finished), and Shimeji Simulation (ongoing) are both really good too. The former is more a post-apoc journey with a comfy but sad themes, while Shimeji Simulation is more surreal so you'd probably like it more if you like Fujimoto.

    Fujimoto is the Tarantino of manga, I like to say. Also his pacing is totally bizarre, but strangely it all works really well, it keeps you on your toes.

    I‚Äôm curious as to what exactly you found so amazing about Chainsaw Man when from what I remember the series was barely even about its interesting initial premise of covertly marauding demons drawing power from causing humans to fear them,

    and instead, it was mainly about petty interpersonal conflicts between extremely stupid bland anime stereotypes with ill-defined generic superpowers and a greater than usual emphasis on the sort of pathetic/incoherent mimetic desire associated with them?
    ```

      I'll take my best shot at explaining why I like it I guess, with some light plagiarism from people more eloquent than me. I also have no idea how far you have read, so I'll stick with the first third of Part 1, aka until the end of Katana Man arc, in terms of spoilers.

      For me, the best contender for what CSM is about is answering what ideas it is thematically exploring with its protagonist. This story is about Denji, a boy who spends most of his youth risking his life for the absolute bare minimum of survival, some daily food scraps and a shitty shack with a mattress. Impossibly, because he has his best friend Pochita the Chainsaw Devil at his side, he is content with this life, idly dreaming of the hypothetical future where he could have jam on his bread slices, or maybe even hug a girl. The subsequent betrayal and sacrifice loses him Pochita but grants him access to a still objectively shitty life of devil hunting without the freedom to choose otherwise, but far far greater than anything he'd have before. Now his life is starting to satisfy those basic requirements, he has a decent place to live in with abundant food, and he starts striving to meet his other goals of romance and intimacy. Makima grants him a tender hug, Power allows a few gropes as payment for saving her cat, and uuuh Himeno ruins his first kiss. Denji begins to realize that none of these were as satisfying as he had imagined in his fantasies, and his new great fear is that he will always be disappointed by the reality of his new dreams, that he is trapped on this hedonic treadmill and will never find true satisfaction in this new life devoid of Pochita. He now has to figure out who he actually is when he's no longer scrambling for the barest essentials of survival, and what he really wants in his life.

      To respond to your points:

      > interesting initial premise of covertly marauding demons drawing power from causing humans to fear them

      The entire thing of devils is more of a setting premise than the focus of the story. There is more devil lore shown later on, the setting is developed and expanded and you see more about what they are and how they've impacted modern human society, but it isn't the main priority.

      > it was mainly about petty interpersonal conflicts

      I would wildly disagree that this is even slightly what CSM is about, I'm trying to think of where in the early sections you could draw this conclusion. Maybe the conflicts he has with living with Aki and Power, or the infighting in that early hotel arc? Katana Man's motivations? The only one I'd describe as a petty conflict is the first one, with Denji being a messy nuisance and Power being both a huge asshole that poor Aki has to coexist with. And yeah, absolutely true, extremely petty conflicts, but the dynamic between the three of them living together is Extremely Important to the overall arc of this manga, later sections simply wouldn't work without it. This is Denji being granted both a decent shelter and a reliable source of food (aka most of his wildest fantasies), which later evolves into (spoilers for later in Part 1) >!Denji gaining a family he actually loves and prioritizes over his own wants!<.

      > between extremely stupid bland anime stereotypes

      Uh also guessing here, Denji and Power are definitely pretty stupid in most areas, but even Power is far from a 2D stereotype. Using her as my main example, Power knows exactly what she wants and is a gigantic asshole about getting it, she has a ludicrously inflated self-image, she edits her own memories to win arguments. But one of the main things that makes her interesting in the early story is that she has that One Big Exception: she loves her cat, the first living thing to show her unconditional affection that she can no longer live without. And she definitely develops as a character throughout the story and made me like her far more than I ever expected. This extends to most characters.

      > with ill-defined generic superpowers

      For most of them I wouldn't disagree, the powers are generally pretty simple and often don't have sharp limits, Denji mostly remains pretty close to his base power set of Has Chainsaws On Body, Is A Strong Regenerator, Requires Pulling Cord to Power Up, and Requires Blood to Replenish Energy, with some exceptions. There's no particular advanced system underlying this stuff, nothing like Nen or Chakra or Total Concentration Breathing. It's just not where the appeal of the battles comes from. There is a certain amount of cunning and creativity on display, but mostly it is simple brutality.

      > and a greater than usual emphasis on the sort of pathetic/incoherent mimetic desire associated with them

      I can't actually parse what you're saying here, so I can't respond to it. 

      **TL;DR Bullet Points:**

      - Art is great and messy and energetic and visceral, Fujimoto is great at conveying both the tender moments and the cosmic horror of the stronger devils.
      - It's a strongly unconventional shounen story that tosses out many standard tropes and innovates on them in interesting ways.
      - Character work is really solid, the major characters all have nuance to them and they grow over time, if they are granted the lifespan to do so.
      - The story only gets more thrilling over the course of Part 1, to the point where my plan to space out of the volumes went out the window in the final third and I shotgunned the rest of the series because I couldn't wait.
      - The core themes are beautiful, this series will hurt you, it will bring death and misery to both random bystanders and beloved major characters, but there is a heart of gold buried deep down.
      ```

        It seems odd to describe the story as being about achieving humanity through self-discovery when all of the events you‚Äôve described and most of the story beats I remember are about the protagonist looking for someone or something to tell him what to want without ever reflecting on his greatest values and how best to achieve them. 
        Culminating in him >!resolving to be generically higher status before confronting the main villain.!<

        My point about all of the characters being extremely stupid was about how:

        - The demon hunter organization which most of the cast belongs to is ridiculously incompetent given its complete lack any sort of identifiable combat doctrine, infosec, rules of engagement, or really any sort of design feature conceivably optimized to counter the type of magic powers that exist in the setting. 
        -	The only advice given by the paranoid mentor character amounts to vague platitudes about it being good to expect stuff that‚Äôs unexpected 
        -	Almost all of the demon hunters have no reason to accept their profession given how weak they are compared to the heavy hitters, how infrequently demons show up and how quickly demons are usually killed.
        -	Almost every demon hunter is less effective for their stated purpose than a drone strike or chemical weapon.
        -	None of the evil demons ever realize how valuable or easy it would be to have anonymity for their crimes given the inexplicably mundane setting. 
        -	None of the evil demons ever realize they have the ability and no incentive not to collude to scare people into being afraid of almost everything given the inexplicably mundane setting.
        -	None of the human characters ever consider that they should probably stop unrepentantly enjoying sinning given how the existence of demons and the four horsemen imply that all but a infinitesimally small fraction of their lives will be spent being tortured 
        -	The plot requires the main villain to almost never use her powers i.e. >!she never uses the information gathering, coordination enabling and infiltration aspects of her powers to kill all of her enemies before they become a problem by controlling flies to poison them or really anything else a sane person with mind control powers who wanted to rule the world and get someone immune to mind control to love them might do.!<


        My point about how the superpowers being ill-defined was about how the strength of the powers vary arbitrarily from panel to panel by sometimes orders of magnitude according to the needs of the plot.

        Additionally, Power seems like an odd example to use of a non-stereotypical character given that she fits pretty well into the mentally unstable standoffish former mass murderer who decides to be good out of some sort of initially denied contentless appreciation for love archetype with the only wrinkles being that those are typically male and usually aren't played for comedy.

          I outright disagree with many of these things, some of them just do not fit with the story I just read, and some feel like really specific hopes for seeing something but not getting it (which I totally sympathize with). I am also reluctant to litigate this, I know myself, and this is the sort of thing where I could just spend another hour writing up another slab of analysis and argument. That was about my best attempt at explaining why I love it, and you've already read Part 1, so nothing else to really convince you of.

      Well, it's an Asus Tuf F17 laptop, but I don't even use the full screen size. I mainly consider it the best way because I can do one page at a time and zoom in enough that 1) I can truly appreciate the art and page composition, and 2) I cannot see the entire page without scrolling so I can't skim it for dialogue or erratically skip ahead to see what's coming. Also an option to have a 2 page spread that covers the whole screen but I don't prefer that.

  I want to recommend a youtube channel [Media Zealot](https://youtube.com/@MediaZealot). This guy gives satirical analysis and deconstruction of plots in major scifi/fantasy shows and movies in his series "civilizations to stupid to really exist." Also deconstructs villains goals.

  Though not fiction, I guess I'll also throw in the youtube channel [Two minute papers ](https://youtube.com/@TwoMinutePapers). It's an interesting channel about AI learning and how ai become clever in overcoming obstacles in games.

  P.s thanks for recommending The Game at Carosel last week. I'm really enjoying it.

    I dunno, I watched the video on "Pacific Rim" and it just feels to me like Media Zealot doesn't "get it" or that my preferences in humor just don't mesh with his. 

    Specifically, Pacific Rim isn't *supposed* to represent a realistic scifi future, it's explicitly supposed to be a "stupid" movie, and that's what's fun about it (over the top visual spectacle, contrived plot, etc). There are valid criticisms that you can make about the movie, sure, but it feels a bit to me like someone reviewing a forklift and complaining that the 0-60 time is bad and that it performs poorly on a racetrack. True, yes, but missing the point.

  * Polytopia
  * 7 Billion Humans (paid)

  I also plan to at some point try out Super Hexagon, Linelight, and Monument Valley, although those are all paid too.
