  So the Drow are fairly insanely strong. Mighty Urulan was almost a match for Cat. It was almost as strong, more technically skilled, and had a fairly ridiculous number of abilities displayed in this short fight alone (dissolving matter, shooting laser beams, preventing Cat's immortal construct body from healing, physically binding someone made of mist, shattering Winter-made ice with a gesture, transmuting mist into acid, flying, seeing through glamours, and causing matter to explode - all in the space of a few minutes)

  But again, Mighty Urulan was almost a match for Cat and this is fairly insane; Cat is one of the most powerful people on Calernia, and Urulan is just some Drow. The reason Cat picked out the Urulan sigil to fight was that they were the softest target In Great Lotow, which itself is just a random city picked because it was the closest one.

  What do the *actual* powerful figures amongst the Drow look like? Cat said she was heading to great Lotow to "declare war on an entire civilization", but that's looking less and less like a viable plan. And then there's the small matter of killing *Sve*, the Priestess of the Night. What does she look like?

  Maybe there was something funky going on - Sve bolstering Urulan or some such - but that raises question on its own.
  ```

  - u/haiku_fornification:
    ```
    Yeah, Cat views this as a side-quest when it's been pointed out many times that Sve is a monster on a level of the Dead King. She probably predates Callow, owns an entire civilization and the fucking dwarves call her a breathing blasphemy. I'm not sure why Cat believes she can just stroll into her seat of power and kill her.
    ```

  - u/staahb:
    ```
    This also explains why the dwarves want her to clear out some of these old monsters, despite the Kingdom Under being the premier power on the continent.
    ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    This is an interesting comparison though I feel like it is mildly unfair, cat is in her 20's Urulan could 1000 for all we know, he/she may not have had this level of strength that whole time but...

    Cat is definitely in the top tier of power on the continent, she just has the skills of a toddler in comparison to others in her weight class, like the Sve Noc, who I'm pretty sure is probably equal to Cat when it comes to sheer power, but is rediculously more experienced and skilled at it, to the point that her servants that only have a fraction of her power pose a threat to Cat.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      I'm not sure that changes the threat levels of the powerful Drow though? Cat had the edge in power, but it wasn't an *overwhelming* difference, meanwhile this random Drow was far superior in terms of skill and had a fairly ridiculously sized bag of tricks to pull from. And it's a nobody among the Drow. We know for  a fact that there are stronger individuals in the city, and that there are stronger cities out there.

      This Mighty might have beaten Cat if she hadn't fought dirty, Cat who can beat a half dozen junior heroes on her own. A concerning sign when it's the lowest guy on the food chain.

      And yes, the hypothetical Cat in ten or twenty or a hundred years would crush this guy - but that's not much help to Cat now.
      ```

  - u/RiOrius:
    ```
    Drow are powerful, but that power is lootable. Every victory adds the entirety of the losers' strength to the winners. Meaning if Cat takes out a bunch of drow half her collective strength, she's now at 1.5 Cats, and can repeat against a sigil that's 0.75 Cats strong. Repeat and it's exponential growth.

    Now, under normal circumstances this doesn't work out well because drow are prone to backstabbing, and with good reason. But thanks to Fey contact magic, Cat can have actual loyalty from those she empowers. Which makes her snowballing her way to victory just a matter of time, unless the rest of the drow wise up and go on the offensive against her.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      >But thanks to Fey contact magic, Cat can have actual loyalty from those she empowers

      I'm pretty sure there are concerns about this though.

      For one thing, the loyalty from the Drow revolves, as you say, around the oaths Cat had them swear. There are nineteen of them, three greater and sixteen lesser, and it's a pretty safe assumption that Cat's done her utmost to make the ironclad.

      But there are issues.

      * First off, if all the loyalty centres around the Winter oaths, well, we know what Black has taught us about plans with a single failure point.

      * Then there are concerns that letting Cat's Drow loot too much Night could let them break free. Firstly because Night makes Drow more powerful, and there are obvious concerns about leashing monsters more powerful than yourself both practically and narratively. Then there's the fact that the Night comes with knowledge and skill, and with the number of Secrets seemingly floating around (some that can evidently counter Cat's Winter powers), there are risks that the Drow might stumble into something that lets them break or subvert the oaths

      * Then there are issues with Akua's involvement in the process, giving the idea of the auction, helping with the ritual and the wording of the oaths, being given the power ups to her second that she requested to better have a hold over the Drow, and potentially forming death squads. The involvement of Cat's traitorous lieutenant, who is smarter and more manipulate than her, does not instil confidence on a narrative or logistical level.
      ```

      - u/Banarok:
        ```
        the only way you could subvert the fay oath in this case is by regenerating faster then the winter can eat you from the inside, and the problem with that is that it will probably not stop trying to consume you until you're dead, just the pain from this is absurd, but then we get to the 2nd problem, if you must keep the power regenerating you constantly forever do you have enough power to do other things with it? and does it even regenerate it's power fast enough to keep you alive.

        &#x200B;

        don't forget winter is endless, night is not, the fact that the oath uses winter without passing through cat first means that oath is about as deadly as one can be.
        ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Yep. Urulan gave Cat a run for her money, but now that she's defeated it, she presumably gets her *own Urulan* to bring to the next fight. I'm not sure whether the Night includes *only* techniques or whether it also comes with knowledge of how best to apply them, but that's a fuckload of power even in the hands of a less experienced drow.
      ```

  - u/hailcapital:
    ```
    I think the way Cat approached this fight may have exaggerated Might Urulan's effectiveness. For the most part, the Mighty seem to be glass cannons- Urulan's attacks are insanely powerful, but he's got little in the way of defensive powers, and most of them go down pretty easy when she can land an attack. However, since Cat was under the impression she could pretty much roll any Mighty and they had basically no way to permanently hurt her, she's been charging into every engagement with the Mighty and broken their fists with her face.

    If she'd, say had Ivah pretend to lead to bait out the sigil-holders strongest Mighty, and then sneak attacked them with overwhelming force, this might have been a much different fight.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    It will only be much sweeter once she gets back to Callow and starts throwing heavyweights heroes/ undead around.
    ```

- u/BaggyOz:
  ```
  If this guy gave Cat trouble then it looks like her plan will require her to rely on her drow to kill the Mighty as they move forwards. Which is a problem because they get the night of any Drow they kill on their own which means Cat will get less and less to auction.
  ```

  - u/Agnoman:
    ```
    I'm concerned by what Secrets Cat's Drow might pick up if they go off and take Night from the Mighty. What if they learn how to break or subvert the oaths they swore? There seem to be a lot of tricks floating around, just judging by what Urulan brought to bear, and we already know that some of them can beat out Cat's Winter powers.
    ```

- u/MasterCrab:
  ```
  Cat needs to invest in better gear cause her's keeps getting destroyed
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Legendary swords / shields / armors of doom are a crutch that get you killed once they start failing.

    Though maybe she should look into regenerating armor too.
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      She should just give in to the apotheosis and modify her body schema to include clothing and plate. Not like it's worse than turning into mist.
      ```

- u/MutantMannequin:
  ```
  Possibilities?

  * Now that Cat has killed an actual, important sigil holder, one who's probably been a name in the Drow "political" landscape for millennia, the other mighty might be more willing to deal, rather than insist on fighting to the death every time. Doesn't seem entirely likely, but it's possible.
  * Cat might have to start slurping up that Night, if the weakest sigil holder in Great Lotow comes this close to creaming her.
  * Cat might find a way to convert Night into Winter. On one hand, that could potentially make her Drow army more effective and strengthen their ties to her. On the other hand, that feels like a "sinking deeply into power" move, and those never go well.
  * Another "sinking deeply into power" move, I can see Cat eventually discovering Night is just a ripped fae trick, and she can do it, too.
  * When Cat kills Sve Noc, she takes the mantle, or employs her soul Akua-style.
  ```

  - u/Just_some_guy16:
    ```
    With the possible death of black she may also get access to black night powers, i feel like there is still something that can happen to her Name, she mentions she still has it every once in a while, it just does t have any power anymore
    ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  I'm thinking that since Urulan was killed by her, after a rough fight, she can take the Night for herself. The earlier part where she didn't take the night from the corpses was because there was a "LITERALLY FREE POWER" sign hanging on it which would mean that she would be eventually brought down if she took it.

  Here though, she's earned this night. And she will probably get a lot stronger from all the night collection to come.
  ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    The amount of night in that pile of corpses was tiny compared to even the earlier Mighty. If that small amount of Night was a trap that would allow her to be influenced then what is this pile of Night? I don't think it matters how the Night is acquired, it's a trap that allows Sve in.
    ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      But, at this rate, if all the big 'uns go to Ivah, then she might become more powerful than Cat herself... it's a bit of a dilemma.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        Well, he did swear a binding oath to her. Not sure how binding it would be if he started overpowering her, though.
        ```

    - u/d3nzil:
      ```
      Maybe she could get the night weaved into her cloak as she does with the banners of her defeated enemies? That way she could probably keep it under control. Of course there would be risk of Akua getting access to it, but it's still probably safest way to deal with it.
      ```

      - u/Banarok:
        ```
        from their earlier conversation it seems that the night is a double edged sword, especially since even Aqua didn't want to touch it and she is all about usurping power.

        &#x200B;

        the night probably takes just as much as it gives, it's just subtle about it and the night is probably the very reason the empire collapsed and that does not bode well for consuming it, especially not when you're the head of the kingdom and all the souls there in are yours to barter with in many ways.
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          It does seem like this is an energy field larger than Cat's head again.
          ```

        - u/Dent7777:
          ```
          Akua, Ubua, Aqua, what's next?
          ```

          - u/SkoomaDentist:
            ```
            I don't know why people insist on misspelling Ubua.
            ```

    - u/turtleswamp:
      ```
      I think the premis here is that the risk presented was not so much the nature of night itself as the narrative causality risk that taking obvious schmuck-bait posed to somone with a fae mantle. This would be claiming spoils of war not grabbing the mystical equivalent of Wile-E-Cyote grabbing the "free pie".

      &#x200B;

      Though I suspect theres a similar reason why harvisting night now would be a bad move. Cat already promised to auction her kills, deciding not to do so now that a better than expected prize is promised to go to auction would be flirting with oath-breaking.
      ```

- u/TaltosDreamer:
  ```
  I am curious why the Dead King doesn't consider the Queen of Night to be on his level. 

  He made a big deal about how the Bard, himself and Cat are in this exclusive club. Now we see Night grants possible agelessness and pretty much every power Cat has through Winter to even its weaker members.  How is the Queen of Night not also reaching for (or already achieved) godhood? He could have been lying for about a million reasons, but it didnt seem like it.

  I also wonder  with Cat having Night in her domain, if that will give her an edge with it if she decides to absorb it.

  Definitely a lot of fascinating directions this can go.
  ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    pure speculation, but i think that is because cat is winter, while the Sve only wields the night so cat's potential growth is way higher then the Sve even if the sve is at the apex of her abilities and hence very power full right now (and have been for a while).
    ```

    - u/TaltosDreamer:
      ```
      That is a good point. 

      Another I thought of is that she seems like a parasite that gets others to gather power for her. I could see the Dead King feeling that is unworthy of being included, regardless of her actual power.

      The Bard, The Dead King and Cat all appear to have taken their power and use it actively. Something I could see being appealing to a sorcerer/warrior-king type.
      ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    He didn't name every person in his club, just mentioned a couple.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Is there a reason Cat isn't using aspects any more?  That fight is the first time she's been in real danger in a long time.
  ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    yes, there is, she lost her name when she became the dutchess of moonless nights in full, so she's no longer the squire hence she no longer have aspects.
    ```
