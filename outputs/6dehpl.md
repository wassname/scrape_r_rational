## [Challenge Companion] Low Budget

### Post:

**tl;dr: this is the challenge companion thread, post comments, thoughts, or recommendations here**

I think about budget a fair amount when writing, either in the sense of "I have no budget, therefore I should go nuts with it" or less often "this thing I'm creating would be marginally more interesting if it could easily jump mediums". In college I had a few film classes and made ultra-low budget student films, so an awareness of film/theater constraints followed from that.

If you want to write for a low budget, I think that generally means:

* Either no special effects, or very simple ones (e.g. having a person play against themself in a doppelganger, time travel, etc. scenario is easily done, while grotesque aliens on a starship are not).
* As few locations as possible. I have an affection for very spartan plays that all take place in one location, because they feel a lot more cozy. That's also super cheap.
* As few actors as possible. Two people in a room talking to each other is a very cheap thing to do in theater or film, and I tend to like those a lot because so much effort needs to be put into both the writing or acting - there's no spectacle that might allow you to hide behind bad characterization or poor performances.

One of the go-to low budget science fiction movies is *Primer* by Shane Carruth, but it was low budget partly because a lot was done behind the scenes to make it so rather strictly the confines of the script. I think I would also point to a number of "people in a room" movies, like *Circle*, *Exam*, or *The Man From Earth*.

  I like this one a lot!  Although to be fair, I might be slightly biased because my fiction tends to naturally devolve into "several people sitting in a featureless room talking" anyway.

  I decided to go for a story that could plausibly have been shot as a low budget student film (takes place entirely in a classroom, only one adult role).

  I can't write for shit, but I'd like to suggest tackling this from a slightly different angle. There's a anime called Chromartie High School made on such a low budget that the animators intentionally left in bugs like parts of character's faces moving independently or would draw characters standing on the ceiling in the background because they couldn't afford to insert them into the conversation by cutting to another shot. It makes an already funny and weird show hilarious and surreal.

  Is it possible to do something similar with text? You obviously can't pull off purely visual humor in prose, but I wonder if it's possible to take elements of writing that are technically bad and turn them into a style of comedy or surrealism. It wouldn't be easy to pull off, but it'd definitely be something unique and memorable. Make the writer lazy, arbitrarily stick to a word count, leave in bad grammar and punctuation, or make it a school writing assignment with other dumb requirements.
