## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I have a sci-fi world that combines elements of The Matrix, Westworld, and Inception in my most high concept idea yet. The Singularity may have solved many problems by uploading everyone into a virtual universe where they could do whatever they wanted, but it turned out that even digital minds need regular REM sleep in order to stay sane. This wouldn’t be that big an issue, except that dreaming is now a high-fidelity simulation the subconscious mind creates to trick you into thinking it’s real. 

  This simulation increases in detail with the brain’s processing power, which can’t be modified on a daily basis, so what happens when someone dreams sentient life into existence? This is a society that thinks it’s immoral to delete sentient life and that free will cannot be expressed in a universe run by an omnipresent god, so the only ethical thing to do is save the data from the dreams and integrate it into the virtual reality. People who’s whole lives were imagined overnight become refugees in the waking world, while first contact is made with sprawling worlds created by the musings of massive minds.

  What kind of civilization would this be where the dreamscape is a new frontier for exploration? I can see immigrants saving money to recreate loved ones who didn’t make the cut, political debates about whether to change imaginary worlds to be more hospitable or set up an afterlife, and lucid dreamers being charged with imagining what it was like when people mourned the dead since it subjected people to suffering that turned out to be real.

  I honestly don’t have an idea for a story in this world, I just think it’s an interesting twist on the idea of life in a simulation that allows for boundless possibilities. It could be be like if Night Vale was an urban ghetto in Altered Carbon, Star Trek meets Psychonauts where they visit worlds of fiction filtered through someone’s subconscious, a coming of age story about a romantic fantasy searching for the person who made them, or a criminal who hides from the law inside other people’s dreams.

    Why not require those who are advanced enough to dream up sentience to be trained enough in lucid dreaming to not do so automatically? If sentience can be detected and saved from a dream at its conclusion, why can't its imminent formation be detected and aborted? Perhaps it is discovered that not dreaming of people at all gives you mental problems such as losing your theory of mind. Perhaps the current Manhattan project is to have the enhanced humans research how to solve this whole problem while at night they spawn a managable number of immigrants. It seems to me this scenario will be hard to tweak such that it would be hard for a *civilization* of *superintelligences* to solve; and if you succeed that fine-tuning might be enough to have the characters discover the fourth wall.

    Just following the regular life of a character subjected to those kinds of strange problems is probably enough, it's basically how Greg Egan writes, and a lot of older sci-fi stories like Asimov's stuff have that kind of plot.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    In a virtual universe, the ultimate resource is processing power; finite, rapidly filled by sentients (who grow exponentially in number), and, ultimately, running out - unless there is some means to carefully ration it, and ensure that the growth in the number of people does not outpace the growth in space for people.

    This... could actually be a solution for that problem. If all means of creating sentients *other than* dreams was disallowed. (That is, you can't fork a copy of yourself, and you can't create a mind to order).

    Lucid dreamers then become the only source of custom-designed minds, but anyone who *really* wants a certain kind of person to exist can make the attempt to dream that person up...

      I actually thought that there’d be enough reason to not endlessly create people already, but I actually like this idea. I wouldn’t expect making minds on purpose to be illegal in every circumstance, you just need to jump through legal and financial hoops first.

      Even if you did make someone without the resources to care for them, they’d be put in stasis. However, the dream-born are subsidized because they can be created by accident. I know this sounds like a pretty idealized world, but I prefer the idea of conflicts being more personal than societal.

  Time travel is difficult and expensive...or at least it was until some insane wizard teleported into our reality and made it easily available to Muggles in our world.

  You have Time Turners as they are used in the Harry Potter books where anyone can travel back in time, but history can't be altered since all time traveling results in [Stable Time Loops](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop). Arbitrary restrictions are no going back more than 6 hours into the past (even if you used a different one in the past to attempt 6 more hours), only one person can use a device at a time, and they are easily accessible (for at least the first few days before anyone tries to control their supply).

  There is no other magic available; I'm just curious what impact Time Turners would have on our society.

  EDIT: Feel free to also answer how you think society would develop if this ability has been around for a long time rather than it just miraculously appearing one day.

    Isn't the answer to such questions always 'somebody doesn't get their learning neural net/seed AI quite right before sticking it into a time loop, and we all die'? 

    Less flippantly: 

    * I expect many, *many* zero-day exploits to occur starting six hours before Mr. Magic gave out time machines. Disconnect all devices from the Internet and hope you aren't too late (you are). 

    * The global economy crashes horribly. If the markets somehow manage to survive, there's probably now a six-hour (minimum) wait for any transaction. 
    * Spy agencies can recieve data from six hours into the future. Expect Minority Report-style police teams to show up seconds *after* crimes have been committed. 
    * Disaster relief teams have up to six hours to prepare for instant response.
    * Weather is predictable with perfect fidelity up to six hours ahead. 
    * Sufficiently motivated thieves can fence their loot *before* stealing it. 

    How do the mechanics of time travel respond to precommitment to violate causality unless <improbable event> occurs? Can we use exploits like in chapter 17 of HPMOR (instant factoring of large numbers), or is there some 'do not mess with time' filter that intervenes?

    HPMOR and some of the proposed solutions to the final exam talk about some of this in detail. I recall [Following the Phoenix](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix) has some detailed time travel exploits w.r.t. disaster response.

      I'm not sure because I don't have too good of a grasp on the consequences on whether or not causality is violated or what it means if improbable events can be easily 'fabricated'. The closest understanding I have is the [Outcome Pump](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARaTpNX62uaL86j6/the-hidden-complexity-of-wishes) which basically means easy access to godlike power.

      > Can we use exploits like in chapter 17 of HPMOR (instant factoring of large numbers), or is there some 'do not mess with time' filter that intervenes?

      If I say that the exploits are possible without 'do not mess with time' issues, how do you think it would play out?

      Thanks for the ideas!

        Poorly. 

        Most of modern cryptography is rendered null, and thus every device not protected by an air gap is likely compromised. The process of identifying, adapting, and distributing systems that might still be secure (one-time pads, Carter-Wegman) would take ages, and the damage done by bad actors in the meantime will be excessive. 

        It's even worse from a physical security perspective - with basic time travel you can arrange to have a signal sent from the future which tells you that your objective was successful and not act unless you recieve said signal. If you can also precommit resources towards retroactively undoing false-positives, this guarantees either your success or that your opponents have interfered via time travel of their own. Warfare and counterterrorism now become even more of a game of cat and mouse. With a full-on loop, you can extract detailed information on how your plan failed and iterate again. Weird things may happen like the authorities waiting seven hours to arrest perpetrators so the 'guaranteed success' described here does not work. 

        You probably have to wait at least six hours in isolation before any kind of standardized testing to ensure you didn't get the answers from the future. Ditto for giving witness at any kind of trial so you can't prep for unexpected questions. Changing anything security-related definitely takes seven hours minimum. 

        On the positive side of things, computationally-expensive but fully specifiable problems are now solved as soon as someone sets up a vaild loop. Protein-folding, searching for gene sequences, finding large primes, computer chip design, searching through interesting datasets, etc. 

        There are some interesting alert systems you can set in place for unexpected deaths - if someone is in a car accident, automatically send the name and cause of death back six hours. If the system receives a given name, send it back six hours later even if nothing happened in your time line. People who pay attention to this service should in theory never die due to sudden accidents (assuming you have an easy way to avoid whatever happened). Now in addition to 'sick days' at work you have 'death days', where you stay home because otherwise you'd get in a fatal traffic accident. If done right, deaths due to car/train/plane accidents, surgery, heart attack, drowning, and more can all be avoided. 

        Edit Addendum:

        You can also get the results of any six-hour course of action before or without actually going through with it. Thus, persons wishing to avoid counterfactual kidnapping and interrogation must set up a time loop of their own that is fail-deadly to interference. This will not necessarily prevent said counterfactual kidnapping and interrogation, but it *will* alert you if it happens. Sort of like a cell phone fail-safe 'text 1 if you're okay' except it's 'if you are recieving this message, you will not be kidnapped in the next 6 hours'.

        Then password hacking and various cryptography hacks become laughably small-scale. Think **BIGGER!** If you are the first person to get a time turner, do the following:

        1. Write a computer program that quickly outputs random strings of characters in black every time you run it. Make it output the characters in red if the new string is exactly the same as the previous string. Make it so that every random string is equally likely: i.e., "a" is as likely as "asdaiosidfhpjdq jwi    dq23rvW#$WV!.a, isd".

        2. With the program open and ready to run, close your eyes for a while. 

        3. When you open them:

        3a. if the program hasn't been run, wait 6 hours, then time turn back and run the program.  

        3b. otherwise, obey the outputted string to the best of your ability. Within the next 6 hours, if you become god, time turn back and use your god powers to make the program output the same string you obeyed. If you haven't become god, time turn back, and run the program. If the program gives the same random string that you just obeyed, run it again and again until either you get a different random string or you got the same string 1000 times in a row (you can immediately tell if it is the same string after the second time because it will be output in red). 

        There are only three stable time loops: 

        A) You find that the program hasn't been run. You died in the next 6 hours, before you would time turn back. So future you never comes back to run the program. Try to prevent this loop by staying in a very secure location and doing nothing dangerous for those 6 hours.

        B) You find that the program has been run. You obeyed the random string and became god. You time turned back and used your god powers to make the program output the same random string. You are now god.

        C) You find that the program has been run. You obeyed the random string but did not become god. You time turned back and ran the program, but it gave the same string. You ran it again and again a thousand times but it kept giving the same string out of sheer random chance. You conclude that either there is no way to become god in 6 hours that can be written in a million characters, or you are extremely unlucky. Like somewhere around 1/10^1000? unlucky depending on how many ways there are to become god in 6 hours that can be written in 1 million characters.

        If you get outcome (A), you are now dead. Should have planned your secure location better.

        If you get outcome (B), you are now god. Pat yourself on the back, remake the world to your will or whatever.

        If you get outcome (C), repeat the experiment with a different overpowered goal. Like finding instructions for how to freely time travel or gaining super speed (which would make the next set of experiments far more powerful since now you can do a lot more in 6 hours). If you're in a rush, you can actually combine a lot of these experiments together to get more out of your time.
