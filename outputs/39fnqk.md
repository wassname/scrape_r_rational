## [D] A model for determinsitic "free will" that I was considering doing a short story about, but how free actually is it?

    Pretty much what I thought, but I considered it a good idea to ask in case I was being incredibly stupid without realising.

  Sorry for the double reply, but this is a separate issue. 

  You ask "Is this really free will," and in order to answer that I think you need a good definition of free will. Can you explain what it is? Do we have it? What is the physical difference between someone who "has free will" and someone who only *thinks* they do? If there isn't a measurable difference, I would be suspicious that the question is malformed. 

  What are you *actually* asking?
