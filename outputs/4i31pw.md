  I'd tell the President to pick someone else

  I'm sorry, but I look at this post and all I can see is a tiring discussion. I understand that there are people on this subreddit who would love to discuss and debate about how they would convince the AI to not destroy them, but this is going to turn off a large number of potential readers. It takes significant mental energy to come up with an argument and a speech to convince someone else of some idea and there are professional writers who are paid obscene amounts of money to write speeches for politicians.

  What I would recommend you do to get more comments is to make this into a role-playing game. Write a quick post about the AI announcing itself to humanity, people's and governmental reactions, write about how the governments all over the world (no way that the American president is the decider of who ask the questions, the other countries will never stand for it), and write about how **you** got selected.

  This will get people in the mind-set of thinking of good questions to ask and to make it even better, this can be an ongoing story where every week people on this subreddit have to all agree on asking one question and each redditor gets one chance to argue for humanity and failure means they can't make any more comments. At the end of the ten weeks, the AI announces humanity's success or failure.

  ....say if you don't want to do that, I might try something like that myself for the summer after college is done.
