## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You've been given a magical power called 'shinigami eyes' which lets you see the remaining life span (down to minutes) of every person you look at (directly; not through camera, mirror, etc).

  (Idea is from >!death note anime series/manga !<and should work as there)

  How and why would you use it? Can you find any tricky uses for that?
  ```

    ```
    Are you able to use this information to change people's lifespans? What happens if you try to kill someone early, or save them from an untimely death, or just butterfly effect things by flinching at the surprise numbers when you first get your power?

    Options:

    * Use the inside knowledge to make money, for example through life insurance, claiming to be an undetectable assassin but only taking contracts on targets you can see will die soon anyway, or predicting the deaths of CEOs to play the stock market

    * Improve medical research by observing the lifespans of people in clinical trials to find out the long-term effects of a drug as soon as it's administered, or even beforehand

    * If you can't change people's lifespans, you can at least inform them of their new time horizons so they know whether to save up for a lengthy retirement or to make the most of their remaining lifespan now

    * Predict disasters by recording the times of death you observe and looking for clusters in timing and geography

    Nice one!  
    I guess every choice a person makes would influence their remaining lifespan. Off the top of my head I would probably try to find out the answers to the important questions that we're all asking:

    \- Marijuana vs Tobacco

    \- Does a Keto diet actually make a difference?

    \- Do Flat earthers live longer than the rest of us?

    I would probably be an amazing safety inspection manager.

      Iirc, the spoilered show includes ways to reduce the number but not to increase it.  The  number you'd see was the one that the meddling feedback loop converges to.  I think the author just kind of ignored the possibility of infinite oscillation (if #<x intervene else do not intervene; type situation)

        You mean manga author or me?

        I see a lot of issues with that 'shinigami eyes', and the one of the ways I'd munchkin it (no one mentioned it here) is  >!"get" a person, make a commitment to kill him if certain stock go up, and check his remaining life span with shinigami eyes, and then based on that invest in this stock or don't (or use third person for this, because my own knowledge and will might meddle with prediction)!<

  You have the power to open portals to any place you have been before. The portals may be as small as a hole in a watch-strap; or they may be as large as a building. You may open multiple instances and you may also control what can pass through them. 

  You are a person living in <Random Country>. You want to become rich using your power, but do not wish to reveal it to any other individual. You also don't want to indulge in anything illegal or suspicious that would raise flags with any governing body.

  How do you use your power creatively to accumulate riches while maintaining a facade of a having earned this wealth through legal methods?
  ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    This is a late-game idea which needs some seed capital, but what about engaging in high-frequency trading?

    Visit all the main stock exchanges and buildings for sale nearby them. Open up portals and run cables through them to transmit stock information between the branches of your trading firm faster than light. This gives you an unbeatable advantage compared to other firms and should let you make money rapidly and reliably.

    In terms of legalities, high-frequency trading is generally legal, and can be rationalised as making the prices of stocks more accurate or protecting the markets from shocks somehow. As for maintaining a facade, you just need to claim that your proprietary hardware and algorithms give you an edge in predicting the markets. With the money you'll be making, you can probably afford to employ a load of quants to explain how you gained your advantage. 

    As an aside, it might be worth considering the answers to standard questions like what reference frame the portals are stationary relative to, what happens when you open one on a moving train or in space, whether you can cut anything with the edge or so on.

    Your control over what can pass through could be very versatile, and putting two portals right next to each other would effectively make a stationary filter. If you can select types of objects, you could sort through trash quickly to recycle efficiently. If you can extract chemical elements, you can pull gold out of seawater by opening a portal in a part of the ocean with a strong current that transmits only gold to your stores. If you can select isotopes, you're a one-person nuclear enrichment facility.

      Disagree with the undetectability of the stock market idea. I it is possible to detect FTL communication after the fact - I believe (but don't have a convenient citation for) a journalist who was investigated for releasing some market announcement in two cities both at exactly 6:00:00.00pm when the announcement wasn't supposed to be released before 6pm.

      I acknowledge that you could explain consistent better-than-market performance, but it'd be highly suspicious if your proprietary algorithm/hardware never messes up.

    Gold panning might work. You could probably place a large portal across a river or stream in the middle of nowhere.  The gold is almost entirely in the sand/gravel, so you’d need a way to get that through a portal, which would be easy if you can move portals. Otherwise I think you’d need to dump the river somewhere else so it’d move the stream bed with it, then filter it, then bring it back. Dubiously legal, and dubiously effective, but it should work pretty quick if it’s gonna work. 

    As an excuse for where the gold came from, you could sell it off slowly and claim you and some friends have been panning for a while and you’re just now selling it off.

    > you may also control what can pass through them

    How smart/selective is this? Can I make a portal that only transports cancerous cells? Executives that have knowingly engaged in insider trading? A specific chemical from a low-yield chemical process? Spoons from universes where the nature of dark matter is [blank]?

    Cancer - Faith healer that actually works. Maybe get someone else to be the front man / miracle worker so they draw the scrutiny when word gets out.

    Executives - You can yoink rich people who've committed crimes into a dark room, blackmail them for money, then send them along their way.

    Chemicals - Make an industrial chemical filter that consists of an interesting but nonsensical device, like an EmDrive, containing a selective portal to make it actually work. Sell it at a high cost, knowing you have a monopoly and are immune to industrial espionage.

    Spoons - You can brute force hypotheses about the laws of physics and get a confirmation when the spoon goes through the portal. A binary search scheme would help. Once you have a correct novel theory, you'll have to do actual intellectual work to prove it, but knowing the end point for certain sure helps. Once you've won your nobel prize(s) in science, you can make honest money on speaking fees and appearances. Also go harvest the millennium prize puzzles.
    ```

    - u/mentalspaceshards:
      ```
      Wow! The spoons thing was a really creative one. But no, I was thinking more of a semi permeable filter of sorts. 
      This was more of a thought experiment I was having; what if you wake up one day and find out you have this amazing ability of creating portals? What would you really do with this to increase your wealth or standing in this world without informing anyone of this ability. 

      The obvious thing that comes to mind is being able to listen in/observe people anonymously. Since the portal is selectively permeable; One could fashion two in front of their eyes. Photons would go one way only; so no ambient light from the other side would spill.

      The faith healer thing is nice except the portal would work on your knowledge of the subject. For example, you could choose for sea water to pass through without the salt and other material giving you fresh water but you couldn't really pass an individual without their cancer cells. How would you define a cancer cell? Unless you know exactly what to look for?

      I think the chemicals idea is a real world application. You get to maintain the pretense of a legitimate product without having to reveal the proprietary filter.

      Great food for thought!

    I had an idea of opening a portal and exploring the ocean. Since I control what passes, the challenges of water pressure won't faze me and bonus is if I find treasure that is worth claiming legally.

      [Manganese nodules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese_nodule) are sea floor growths that are reasonably valuable and would be relatively easy to harvest given the portals described by the OP.

      There have been talks in the past about mining them, but in practice the extreme capital costs tend to make it a questionable investment. The highest profile attempt turned out to be a CIA deep water espionage operation, but other companies have looked into doing it for real.

      Unfortunately the "must have visited" qualifier means you still have startup costs, but getting a manned observation vehicle to the bottom is much cheaper than building a deep sea mining ship, and requires few continuing costs once you have a portal.

  You have the power to tell how any coin you are touching was oriented 24 hours ago.

  When you directly touch the coin, you can sense an orientation, relative to the current orientation of yourself. (So you can't use this power to tell which way is north, but you can tell if a coin is in the same orientation that it was in a day ago.)

  This ability has an accuracy of a few degrees. Items that are kind of coin like will have lower accuracies  associated with them. So you cant tell anything about the orientation of a washer, but you should have a rough idea for a fake coin. If the coin is a good enough fake for it to be hard to notice the difference, your powers will be about as accurate.

    You could use this as a poor man's GPS tracker. Find the car you want to track, measure its tire circumference, tape one coin vertically to the undercarriage and another to the inside of one of the car's tire rims. The next day, retrieve your coins to see where the target went. If you put your feet on both coins then hold a roadmap in front of you with a pencil and ruler, you could fairly accurately trace out where the car went and how long it spent at each location. Each revolution of the tire rim coin is one tire length traveled, and you'll know which direction the car went based on the undercarriage coin.

    You could also use this as a secure form of encryption. If Alice wants to send you a message without any risk of it getting intercepted by a third party, she could encode it in coin turns which form a binary representation of her message and then deliver the coin to you so you can decrypt it on your end.

    You could use it as an after-the-fact break-in detection system. If your doors and windows are hinged (rather than sliding), place a coin on (or in) each of them. If something goes missing and you suspect someone broke in to steal it, you could retrieve all of your coins and wait until you sense one which turned. This would also confirm which door or window should be tested for fingerprints to identify the culprit if you have a few likely suspects in mind.

    You could also use this as a poor-man's day-in-advance alarm clock. Keep a coin with you and spin it on a table at whatever you'd like to be aware of tomorrow. Then, place the coin somewhere it will stay in contact with you and you'll be able to sense when it started spinning yesterday.

  In a world where agurs who can see the future are common, and it's common to meddle with predicted events to get a more desired outcome, you've gained an ally augur whose predictions are accurate even after attempts at meddling. 

  In other words if a regular augur predicts your horse will lose the big race next year you can create a better training regimen to get the horse closer to winning, or prevent sabotage.  If your ally augur predicts your horse will lose, her prediction will usually come true no matter what you do, because her power accounts for how you will respond to hearing the prediction.

  How would you munchkin that ability to prevent one of her predictions from coming to pass?
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    If you make the basic stipulation that the augur has to accurately say their prediction, it should be really simple. Just remove chaotic elements from the prediction. The augur predicts you will raise your left hand in the next minute, you raise your right instead. They predict you leave the room out of one door, you take another. The augur would need some fairly obscene and obvious reality warping to make simple choices actually turn out in such a way that you *couldn't* choose any other way than the observed one.

    For stuff that's less in your control, it depends on how much improbable stuff is caused by the prediction. If you try to wear a different colored shirt than what the augur saw, it would be fairly difficult to make that be inevitable in a way that seems natural, especially if you do the same experiment multiple times.
    ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Augur, in the dictionary, seems to imply predictions of outcomes rather than direct actions.

      And again, the stipulation is that her predictions are accurate (which does leave a bit of wiggle room) even after they've been told.

      Thus, if she says attempting to raise your right will lead to success and attempting to raise your left will lead to failure, well, something is about to mess up your attempt at precommitment.

      This is meant to be a bit challenging.
      ```

      - u/gramineous:
        ```
        Is she intentionally wording predictions to minimise backfires from absolute and inflexible wording or is it part of whatever source is dolling out this knowledge?

        If it's the former, work out the manner which her predictions are normally structured and plan for that. Stressful situations could help. For example, stage an obvious assassination attempt that invites a prediction about surviving immediate harm, while covertly administering a slow acting poison to the target. A prediction about "experiencing no negative effects from an assassination attempt" would be too broad to likely be made for example, so just make her make predictions that don't matter. 

        Tl;dr misdirection

  How can I effectively use a metal part in a machine that can temporarily (for around 30 minutes at a time) become indestructible in an industrial context? 

  I understand that having a crossbar for a ballista that could store an arbitrary amount of energy would be useful but I want something more constructive rather than destructive.
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Rockets - nozzle durability is a serious bottleneck to power, and if it's *literally indestructible* then you can do so properly crazy things with inert-propellant thermal nuclear rockets.

    Or get exotic with metallic hydrogen chemistry for *even higher* specific impulse.  Or exploit your unmeltable high-temperature reactor for ion drives.  Or... well, you get the idea.
    ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    Drill bits, cutting tools, dies on hydraulic presses.  Sharpening and replacing tooling is a massive expense for any business that makes metal parts.  Preventative maintenance that involves swapping out parts every batch with freshly hardened ones is expensive but it also means you can use much older and cheaper methods to hold modern tolerances, simply because your tools don't need to be replaced.


    Explosions are used for certain kinds of welding too. It's all just a matter of what you want to make.

    You could make a [Bitter Magnet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_electromagnet) with an infinite maximum magnetic field strength. I have no idea what you could actually *do* with an arbitrarily powerful magnet, but it would probably be something neat.

    Running an atomically thin metal wire between two blocks of metal would allow you to make the entire thing indestructible and cut through basically anything. There's probably some really good uses for that, but cutting through blocks of stone is what came to mind for me.

    Depending on how loosely you can define "metal part", you could make pressure reactors for chemical processes that are ordinarily prohibitively expensive to run at high pressures. Not sure if this one is actually feasible.

    Exploding a nuclear bomb inside an indestructible sphere with a single small outlet would be interesting, though I again have little idea what you could actually do with that. Tunnel boring maybe? Wait, no this would actually make a really good rocket if anything could survive the insane acceleration it would provide. It would also be an absurdly strong weapon, admittedly.
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    How large of a part? How often can you make it indestructible?

    An indestructible container makes nuclear fusion pretty easy. No need to magnetic confinement. Start up the fusion process, make the containment vessel indestructible, harvest power, wait until shortly before the 30 minute time limit is up, and stop the fusion by venting the plasma into a larger container that's big enough that the hot plasma is diffuse enough to not melt it. Whether this is useful depends on the startup/shutdown time, and how often you can restart the process.

      ```
      I am repurposing a spell from warhammer fantasy roleplay which works on any one weapon, probably only on metal weapons, but I suspect that I can replace a lot of parts with knives, spears, swords, shields etc since they would be indestructible in operation.

      I would prefer to avoid casting the spell more than once a day honestly since the chances of spells going awry in warhammer and the consequences thereof are pretty bad.

    If you're ok with nondestructive uses outside manufacturing, this would be an amazing power for rescue operations.  A lightweight object that can support a collapsed building and prevent it from collapsing further long enough to get everyone out is huge.
