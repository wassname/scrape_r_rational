    That hilarious. Valencia is an apex predator of nine thousand Hells. If she can communicate with Hells she can even rule them as  fabulous Dragon-Tyrant.

      But there's no guarantee that she can eat every devil she encounters. It's implied that her "tentacles" default to the shallow hells. Deeper down, there may be devils that are too strong for her (at least with her current companion passive, "Infernal Capture"), or that cause indigestion, or other side-effects. They might end up lying in wait for her, or setting traps.
      ```

        Well, Valencia is essentially one compliment away from loyalty 20, so...

        She is probably the most overpowered member of Juniper's kharass, currently. Juniper himself has the potential to become an overgod, the locus could resurrect druidic civilization, but Valencia *reaches into hells and takes apart millenia-old devils for spare parts to compensate for her drunk-walking*. She is in a position to greatly upset the world order, *right now*.

        And this was from 10 loyalty. What will she get at twenty?
        ```

        - u/dalitt:
          ```
          She's also un-healable, so her powers can only be used in combat very sparingly.  It's also unclear to me that the combat skills she gains from the devils make her more effective in combat than e.g. Juniper, whose strength, reflexes, etc. are all augmented, as well as his base skill.  Valencia still has the body of a normal 17-year-old girl.
          ```

          - u/Noumero:
            ```
            Fair enough, but why would we measure her power based on how well she can make her meatpuppet punch and cut? If we must judge it based on her value for hypothetical war effort, I imagine there's quite a few overcompetent devil tacticians, strategists, and combat instructors, which would be more valuable than warriors by far.

            She does lose to Juniper if given no time to prepare, but also would most likely be able to take out their entire group combined if given a day in a city. (Not that measuring her power based on whether or not she can win a conflict against her other companions is correct.)
            ```

            - u/dalitt:
              ```
              I basically agree with your first paragraph — the reason I measured combat ability is that it’s more or less been what’s tested in the story so far.  That said, I think the situation you construct is a bit artificial; it depends, for example, on Val being able to pick out and recognize the (presumably rare) master strategists among the demons.

              I’m not sure I agree with your second claim—so far we haven’t seen the demons demonstrate general genius at planning, just in-the-moment social genius.  I suppose that if you gave Val the element of surprise and let her build a bomb, she could kill Juniper and company, but I think letting her prepare and not Juniper is not a fair test.
              ```

              - u/Noumero:
                ```
                Hm, fair point regarding Valencia's ability to identify the devils with the skills she wants.

                We didn't see master-planner devils, no, but even if there's none (which doesn't seem that likely), social manipulations would be enough. She could recruit people who will recruit people who will recruit warriors and mages for her army; if she doesn't have devilish master planners, she could use a social-genius devil to identify and then recruit a human master planner. She would have half the city where she wants it to be in a day, or in a week if her selection of devils is limited to manipulators.

                Whether Juniper's group is preparing as well or not doesn't matter that much, since she has advantages in speed of work and deception. Juniper and company are much more effective in direct fights, but she would never be where they expect her to be, and her web of influence would grow faster than their.

                I suppose without devil-planners it wouldn't be a sure victory, but not a sure loss either.

          Her powers have a source (millenia-old devils) and use it destructively. How long will it take her to run out? Or, at least, for the remaining ones to be able to evade her?

            Sure, but would that still be a good thing to do? Forget genocide; let's suppose we have the choice of killing [~~six billion demons~~](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillSixBillionDemons) six trillion devils and letting one trillion human souls in the hells to decay, *or* leaving six trillion devils and one trillion souls to exist for all eternity. What's better?

            Many people, me included, would be seriously inclined to kill them all. The tuung, though, and perhaps Juniper, given that conversation in Chapter 84, may choose the other option. How many happy people justify the existence of one person in eternal suffering?
            ```

            - u/abcd_z:
              ```
              I'm fairly confident that, if souls decay in hell, they'd do so whether or not there were devils around.  Better that they at least not be tortured in the interim.
              ```

              - u/Noumero:
                ```
                Well, perhaps devils have some sort of soul maintenance magic that will stop working if they die. Or perhaps you would need to destroy the hells with souls in them to stop the torture, or perhaps killing every last devil automatically destroys hells, or... There's a lot of possibilities.

                    Why yes, I do. I thought that was clear enough? I stopped talking about the actual situation and started philosophizing after my "forget genocide" line.

                    In actuality, there's probably not nearly as many devils (a lot less than the doomed souls), but there's several practical issues, such as the speed at which Valencia can kill them, the possibility of a counter-attack, and the possibility of her being unable to reach into the deepest hells or consume the strongest demons/devils.

  ```
  > A green-skinned woman had a shell on her back, embellished with miniscule gardens and inch-tall trees that gave the impression of a living place, a world in miniature (and I could vaguely recall seeing something like it before, but couldn’t quite place where). 

  I'm a little surprised that Juniper's forgetting this scene from the Cranberry Bay arc (Chapter 38), but not immediately suspicious:

  > I ... decided to follow along after a green-skinned woman with a shell on her back to see what her deal was. The shell was decorated with a complex, miniature cityscape which had been affixed to it, and she walked in such a way that all the buildings of the city stayed level with the ground. I stopped myself from wandering after her only when she saw that I was paying attention and flashed me a smile.

  That said, I do find it suspect that this NPC has reappeared, although the logistics make sense.

  It seems like either a dangling plot hook (possibly for resolving the bottlocus situation, if the miniaturisation is magical rather than actual models) or a potential complication (e.g. if Shelly is actually a spy for one of the more subtle threats). Best case scenario, the whole thing's just a red herring.
  ```

  - u/Cifems:
    ```
    That's unlikely to be the same person; in one of the monthly worldbuilding threads, the author brought up the idea of peacock-esque mating displays in human-like races, or something along those lines. Turtle ladies with miniature shell sculptures was one of the examples.
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      Ah, disregard then. Looking at it with that in mind, they seem to be describing different dioramas, a forest vs. a city. I'd overlooked that in my initial read.

      I still kind of want there to be a payoff for the peacocking turtle women. A lot of the worldbuilding in the story is touched on only briefly, which is necessarily kind of shallow (although it may, in aggregate, imply deeper links). Probably not enough words to cover it all though, since there's so much detail to go over.

      I've got an unrelated question, since I only recently got caught up I'm not sure where discussion is at. Back in chapter 73 there's a moment where Valencia teleports with Amaryllis. Valencia appears to not experience the traditional blinding pain as a result, asking if it hurts. Did people have any theories on that?

      Since that was the first time any character has been implied to not feel agonising remembered-but-not-experienced pain during this transition, my assumption is that the pain is due to the difficulties of teleporting a soul (which a non-anima presumably does not suffer from).

      Specifically, the teleportation key might be ripping the soul from the body, storing it, facilitating the teleport, and then replacing it. The 5 person limit could be based on the storage capacity of the teleportation key (which may mean it could be subverted by powerful soul magic, although my assumption is that it's a balance thing).

      As to the pain itself, the likely possibilities to my mind are (a) that removal of the soul is an intensely painful experience, (b) that a disembodied soul is, by necessity, in pain, or (c) that the particulars of the teleportation key storage are the culprit, for example if it involves a sojourn of unspecified length in one of the hells.

      The discussion about teleportation in chapter 84 doesn't help hugely to resolve this. It implies that bacteria get wiped out by bulk teleportation (makes sense), but presumably the teleportation key allows a very large number of bacteria to be teleported (and if the quantity of bacteria affected the limit, you'd expect that that would have been noticed).

      If the pain-caused-by-soul-storage thing is correct, it's possible that Valencia doesn't count towards the teleportation limit. She could effectively be transported for free. If nothing else, she could probably sit in Sable while it happens (I think the party discussed that as an option, but I don't remember it going anywhere).
      ```

      - u/akaltyn:
        ```
        The souls thing would also explain why bulk teleportation for food and stuff needs different technology than teleporting individual humans
        ```

      - u/i6i:
        ```
        I just assumed teleportation went through hell.
        ```

      - u/icesharkk:
        ```
        you should re-ask your second topic in a newer thread, I'd really lik eto see more replies on Val teleporting and having a different experience. I misse dit in the story and it seems kinda important since it implies some amount of interaction between Souls, Hells, portkeys, and 17yo girls? What about the bacteria being rendered inert or removed when bulk teleporting. Are they lucky Val didn't come out dead? I know there's a difference between bulk and people ports but they didn't know would have a reaction it could have been serious.

  This is important. Extremely.

  In short, the Tuung can control the genders of their children. That is to say, the well-known Tuung gender imbalance is both *artificial* and *deliberate*.

  And it has political repercussions, too, with a small female elite ruling over a numerous male underclass...

        I suspect the GM decided to start hiding all of the quests because the meta-gaming stopped being funny - He will instead just get the "Quest Complete" notifications from now on, like he did with the quest to stop Fallather.

        - u/None:

          I think you're half-right. He'll probably still get quests, but only when it becomes obvious that he has them. For example, once he meets with the handmaiden and commits to helping her.
          ```

        - u/JiggyRobot:
          ```
          I think the flashback is linked to that. Joon realized that it felt more engaging if his players had some sort of choice in their quests (even if it meant they just chose who to listen to), and so I think the DM is hiding quests for a similar reason. This way, Joon is doing things because he wants to, and not because he just wants to clear his quest log.

      TBF, I wouldn't even rule out the phantom menace gambit. Real princess is masquerading as handmaid, wants out, actual handmaid is happy to take over and just act like the real princess forever, we get the real princess without even knowing about it until it's convenient for the plot.

    Amaryllis because she's the level-headed meticulous "Hermione" of the group (am I being topical yet?), although her ruthless power hunger is not necessarily the greatest.

  Happy for the chapters coming out as always, thanks author!

  I liked the feel these chapters had, they had an amount of caution, but it wasn't the be all end all. Amaryllis discovering Earth technology is great, and now it seems she has somewhere to direct her energy. Fenn was fun as per normal, and I like how Val was pulled in by the book, making comparisons to herself. I could see her becoming a book lover. Grak chilling with the other dwarf was pretty funny, just at the right timing since I was wondering where he was.

  Joon hearing the psychic messages were pretty cool, kind of want an extension of that magic/technique. Interesting how happy he was to go alone with it all. I did jump to the handmaid swap as Joon did too, happy surprise to find out I was wrong. Seems like the partnership with the handmaid could be entertaining, I do wonder if she or the princess is to be the companion.

  How does everyone picture the main characters? In my mind the party looks something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/oG2IfJR.jpg), except maybe swap the Red Prince as Amaryllis out for [Lightning](https://i.imgur.com/LYzjSDY.jpg). They don't quite line up with how they're described in-text, e.g. Valencia is probably closer to [Alice Nakiri](https://i.imgur.com/NqFFloW.jpg) in-text than Lohse, but the latter also has a demon inside her so thematic parallels for me overwhelm the actual description.

  Great Chapter!  

  Making electronics is easy when you know how and have magic!  Lol, just blank circuit boards alone probably took teams engineers decades of work to perfect.  They are not remotely as simple as they look.  Maybe the author meant breadboards.

  You know, this sidequest feels like a problem they just don't need.  Our hero already has a blade that can be disguised, he doesn't need a summon-able one.  One baby is enough, not 500k of them.

  I'm suspecting that the reason aerb has no computers (and the backpacks can't produce them) is that they'd put too much strain on the simulation.
  Nowadays we have more smart devices than people in in the world, not counting the huge amount of "dumb" electronics that exist pretty much everywhere.

  If the Aerb simulation has a finite capacity (even though it can still simulate at least 5 billion of people) then it makes sense that the DM might have stopped all the attempts at creating complex  electronics.

  Aerb used to have way more sentient beings but it was before Jon's time and it's pretty suspicious that the population dropped conveniently before the main character appeared

  This are some questions  i had about the story or stuff that i noticed.

  **1) Druid magic and Junipers dislike of it, it's structure and how it's so different from other magic.**

  While his less when fond treatment of druid magic can be attributed to his dislike of something solely based on faith in particular, i find it ironic that most of the structure and ways in which Druid magic works was described in his rant about God in Chapter 81. The whole thing about "if omnipotent and benevolent, why suffering - when means not omnipotent or benevolent" can be applied to druid magic and describe it limits and how\why it doesn't work if you lack faith.

  I can understand his dislike towards Druid magic, because it's similar to faith in God, but it being vague or breaking laws of physics (not making sense) and examples he lists as such are contradicting what he actually does himself or other magical schools in the story. Saying Druid magic doesn't have structure is kinda wrong to since you can clearly apply a lot of limits to it and if it was all powerful Locus would not be so vulnerable. You can clearly define there forest ends even tho the border would be somewhat moving and wouldn't resemble a straight line.

  My problem is more about what he attributes to Druid magic not making sense or breaking the laws of physics. Cause anyone at that point should ask "How do Anyblade?" Most of the transformations and momentum changes that he attributes to Druid magic not making sense are present with the Anyblade. Form change,structure change,momentum transfer nullification,size,weight, composition. Yet he only questions similar stuff in relation to Druid magic.

  Requirements of Druid magic are in fact similar to other schools of magic. Why exactly, blood magic gives you an ability to produce fire from your hand, the answer at this point  is the same as for Druid magic "It's magic". The only thing consistent in all magic that gives all of them sort of structure is that you have to pay a price - blood (Blood magic), believing\faith (Druid magic), bones (Bone magic) etc. In fact i think Gold magic is more mysterious than Druid magic.

  **2) Anyblade is broken and is a god among weapons.**

  It's also pretty similar to Druid magic in many aspects.

  >It immediately sprang to life in my hands, changing and warping into different forms, becoming thicker, then thinner, sharp, then dull, long, then short, never staying as one particular sword for very long. Despite that, it was perfectly balanced in my hand the entire time, forming counterweights in the grip to ensure that the shifts it underwent weren’t too jarring.

  >I directed a thought at it and transformed it from a sword to an axe wrapped in decorative gold hair, then to a small dagger with a skull on the hilt, then to a bronze khopesh.

  >It could only do blades, but it was pretty permissive when it came to what a blade was, and I could work whatever I wanted into the ornamental features of the sword, axe, or other bladed weapon I formed it into.

  So there does the mass disappears to (It was a toothpick at one point)? What about it's density? It can change the material it's made of? It can adjuster sharpness? How durable it is? What are limits to what counts as an ornament? Can it have properties (poison, curse, etc)

  All of this may result in creating the most durable thinnest (even if atom thin is not possible, toothpicks are pretty thin), sharpest weapon that can cut anything with ease. Decorations being vague he can create a smart blade with a mini super computer attached to it.

  Can he create a blade that extracts\traps souls akin to the stuff he was using in the first chapters? Can he create a Gunblade, Star Wars lightsaber,  High-frequency blade from MGS Rising any other blade with extreme properties? What happens if the blade is chipped in it's longest form or in it's smallest form, would it be simply counted as it changing form and bear no effect what so ever, does it need to be destroyed to atomic level to seize all functions or it has some magical properties powering it? Can those properties be replenished or the blade powered up if he created an ornamental feature that got power from souls, like cars\bikes do(he already used some infant soul before, so he wouldn't be exactly against the idea)?

  **3) Dragons believing that skies of Aerb unequivocally belongs to them.**

  So this sudden description of why they can't take a plane to the Boundless Pit raises a couple of questions with me.

  1. The first chapter started with our hero Juniper being frown out of a plane. Wasn't it a waste to go through a lot of discussion and arguments just to throw a handful of prisoners into an Exclusion zone? Wouldn't those resources and ability to transfer something via plane be better spent elsewhere? Since they are practically killing the prisoners and not really expect them to make it back, it's a lot of money and energy spend for almost no payoff.

  2. So Aumann was so powerful, went through Dragons or just didn't care when he used a Helicopter to fly over a pretty sizable desert? Wasn't it also implied that he did it multiple times before? So Dragons just don't care about that part of Aerb?

  3. So we had FIVE helicopters chase or party with no prior preparation and on a very sudden schedule. Dragons didn't care about that, it was arranged in a fast manner disregarding Dragons or again group that gave chase was to powerful to care about that, since they had Larkspur aka royal prince with them?

  4. Since all of the above took place and Juniper was super eager and heavily questioned why him flying a helicopter was not part of the Narrative to that point. How nobody ever mentioned Dragons having the domain over Aerb skies to him before, did i just miss it? Why using a helicopter to get to Botomless Pit is not even toyed with by Juniper, he wanted to have\fly one so badly before. He even mentioned his father being a helicopter pilot and having some flight experience before. Why the possibility of finally having to fly one, as the means to escape from the Botomless Pit, never even enters his "narrative sense" as the result of this line of thought?

  >The train was necessitated by the fact that we didn’t have a better way to get to the Boundless Pit.

  >This wasn’t just a question of bureaucracy; some of the worst disasters in Aerbian aviation history were caused by dragons going after improperly cleared flights, which was obviously the kind of thing that had a chilling effect on passenger air travel.

  And instead it's quickly dismissed by. 

  >Also, there was no doubt in my mind that we were going to have to fight a dragon at some point, but that thankfully seemed like it was going to be a long time coming.

  They go on the Narrative hunt with almost 0 evidence and speculated about tiniest of possibilities, but this is not even considered. I dislike the "narrative as the driving force" personally, but they mention in it in relations to "princess on a train" that has less indications that it's a narrative thing. But this huge thing is completely flies over their head and no one said anything before to Juniper that flying a helicopter might be a problem. They didn't steal a helicopter only , because they couldn't transport it, not because it would be dangerous to fly it.

  >But it was obvious to me that if the Dungeon Master had a single dramatic bone in his body, I would fly a helicopter at some point, especially because this marked the second time that I had come close to a helicopter and then not been allowed to fly it.

  >“But some things are definitely clues,” I said. “Some things have cosmic significance, for lack of a better word. And helicopters are one of them. They’re part of my backstory, again, for lack of a better word. I’m not saying that everything is going to have meaning in one way or another, I’m just saying that this probably is a clue, and if we don’t go back for the magic helicopter, or we can’t take it with us, then we should at least be on the lookout for other helicopters. Really, we should just go there and use bulk teleport to put it somewhere that we can get it again, if we need it. For both the helicopters, actually.”

  **4) Are we having pregnant VIRGIN MARY in the story?**

  So who counts as the father, Juniper since he was conducting the ritual? He seems pretty okay with this God metaphor and doesn't even mention this whole thing in his "God rant" in the next chapter.

  I can even stretch this to the Trinity metaphor in some form since we have Father, Son, Holy Ghost - Locus,Solace being one and the same or mixed together at the end of the ritual. I can even stretch it even further to just having those forms Father\Juniper|Locus, Son\Juniper|Solace, Holy Ghost\Solace|Locus they somewhat fit those description if you separate the three as their roles in the ritual. Father - helped to give birth to Solace or provided power for the ritual. Son - standing in the ritual hierarchy, using the external power provided for the ritual or act of being born. Holy ghost is well, yeah, it's obvious.

  So nobody mentioned that fact and Juniper was not even considering or thinking other what he has just done. Similarities to God were not even considered or brought up as arguments during his speech about God in the next chapter.

  ***
  Current chapters are were fun. Even tho Chapter 83 felt somewhat jumbled or jumping from one thing to another, or containing a mix of scenes and ideas. Maybe it was just me, but it kinda addressed a lot of things at once and maybe even some comments that i saw before from readers. It's probably my imagination, but still it felt kinda strange to me in some places.

  I would love to hear opinions of others towards the stuff i brought up. Maybe some questions can be answered or viewed at other angles. Maybe i even missed something, i tried to be more diligent this time and search\reread the novel to find answers. I still very much like this novel.
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    One of what I would consider the main problems with this story as it stands right now (one of a few) is that Juniper knows more than the audience does.

    The problem is that there's a lot to Aerb, both in terms of magic systems, nations, races, and other things, and *logically*, Juniper has been going through a whole lot of sociocultural bootcamp -- and this has been stated to be happening a few times in the text. And the problem with *that* is that A) I don't want to write "Mary and Juniper sit in a room while he gets things explained to him for several days" and B) most people wouldn't want to read that, because it would mean stalling out the plot for a hundred thousand words and C) most people would forget about whatever was written in that stretch by the time it became relevant to the plot and D) some of it would never be relevant to the plot, because not literally everything ever shown in the world can/should be, especially with a big world.

    I made the decision fairly early on that I would just bring up things when I thought they were relevant, either through flashback to when Juniper first learned about them, or direct exposition/aside, depending on what I felt worked better.

    This comes with a few pros and cons. I think the biggest con is that some people really want (or claim to want) massive exposition dumps. I already feel like WtC has too much of that, and there's no way that I'm going to add more on top of what's there, especially when it would give the impression of a dangling plot thread when I've already been accused of having too many of those, or taking too long to get where I'm going.

    (There's always been a strong argument for having the reader learn things along with the main character, but that really limits what sorts of books you can write, and has some results that I don't like, especially with regards to the plot.)

  - u/vaegrim:
    ```
    I'm receptive to some of these points, but not all. To the first in specific; I think you've misunderstood the root of Juniper's unease with druidic magic.

    > Saying Druid magic doesn't have structure is kinda wrong to since you can clearly apply a lot of limits to it and if it was all powerful Locus would not be so vulnerable. You can clearly define there forest ends even tho the border would be somewhat moving and wouldn't resemble a straight line.

    Druidic magic is clearly limited; specifically, the inability of Druids to experiment with Druidic magic to better understand its capabilities or develop reliable practices is a fairly sharp limitation. It's not that Druidic magic has no structure, but that mapping its structure is impossible. Since experimentation and armchair theorizing are core personality traits of Joon's, he takes the idea of a magic seemingly designed to thwart his curiosity a bit personally. It's not about the impossible feats Druids can accomplish, it's about being told he's not allowed to investigate how they work.

    > Anyblade is broken and is a god among weapons.

    I suspect the limitations are fairly sharp (hah!) on the Anyblade, much like the clonal kit. In both cases, they were magic items that Joon was largely responsible for. When he had to stretch the capabilities of the clonal kit a bit, we saw the experimentation demonstrated a bit more in the text. With the Anyblade, I imagine most of the "broken" exploits were already considered and rejected during its time as an rpg item. There might be a nice opportunity in the story for someone to get excited about the possibilities, only for Juniper to chuckle and shoot them down. That'd give a chance to explain WHY he can't do more with the anyblade, but I doubt he's actually missed a trick with it.
    ```

  - u/ceegheim:
    ```
    To rephrase what other's said: Joon's problem with druidic magic is that all bugs are Heisenbugs. This differs from the other kinds of magic, which don't obviously have code for detecting that they are running in a debugger.

    No. There is a DM around and he manages what the backpack gives. Seems obvious that he would say no to getting whatever with the sword too. Would be stupid anyblade anyway if you could just make a hammer with a blade somewhere. Or a nuclear bomb with a blade stuck in it.

    There is an actual god watching over the MC and deciding what he gets away with, so there just is no holes for that kind of munchkining.

  So this time i will focus on stuff i liked about the story first and some questions later. It seems i went other the word limit and will have to separate it, quotes and final words pushed it well past 10 000 character limit.

  1. Chapter to chapter character interactions and dialog is great. It feel like living people taking to each other, a group of friends going on a journey\adventure. They all have their quirks and ways of talking, positions they like to take and jokes that they make. Spoken dialog between individuals is pretty awesome.

  2. Most of the in chapter stuff is consistent between itself. It's nice to follow and end with an interesting cliffhanger, that doesn't feel forced and is instead implores you to read more of the story.

  3. World and people inhabiting it are rather unique, even when they have similar counterparts in other fantasy stories. Same can be said about magic systems.

  ***

  **Problem\questions i have about the soul magic and ending to the  Fallather's ark.**

  So i initially thought that "lines branching off from the soul" that Juniper uses to check on his companions actually had a real direction or\and distance to them, so he could have easily identified the fake Amaryllis. Since the line would not point towards her. I didn't find the confirmation that they functioned that way. But since he already tried to check Grak's soul directly and didn't do it only because Grak simply was not fond of the idea. Why didn't he check fake Amaryllis directly when he was touching her during the motorcycle ride? He didn't even need to do it stealthy without her consent, they could have just put Grak into the glove first and have Fenn watch, while Juniper explained to fake Amaryllis what he wanted to check her soul. At that point she either complies and is exposed, or disagrees and he has no reason to trust her, cause real Amaryllis would've agreed.

  That whole chapter was them being paranoid about the most minor of thing and taking outrageous preconditions, but it all was resolved with ton of luck, guessing and Juniper taking actions with no justification. He even says it himself. All while he has actual reasons and ability to check things. He notices tiniest of details and comes to conclusion that Amaryllis is fake in the span of minutes if not seconds, but when he has time and ability he forgets about it.

  >Why the lie? It was easy to construct a reason, working backwards;

  >… but that was post-facto reasoning, not why I’d did it in the moment. Was it something subconscious? Or that my augmented mind rolled a high number somewhere and fed me the idea of lying? I tried not to stare at Amaryllis. I’d been lying to her, was that my original intent or a byproduct of keeping information from Grak?

  He wasn't even sure in the end, but acted upon it.

  >“Imposter,” I said, feeling a momentary flip of my stomach as I looked down and worried that I’d made a mistake, even with what the game had told me.

  >We’re sure?” asked Fenn.

  >“Game notification,” I said, tapping the side of my head. “Not one hundred percent before that, no, but she wasn’t using her magic items, and -- maybe I knew it from instinct, or Luck, or beamed into my head by the game.”

  This is why i disliked that moment and "narrative" in general. He had all the logical,intellectual and discerning power to resolve that situation, he goes into long stretches of constructing thought and finding solutions, but it all came down to "gut feeling", even tho the whole situation could have been avoided beforehand.

  [Part two\one in this same thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/82v9go/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_8384_familiarline/dvdbhq0/)
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    >Why didn't he check fake Amaryllis directly when he was touching her during the motorcycle ride

    Because he had no reason to. At that point, he had no reason to suspect that checking her soul via soul-link and directly would show different results, the entire stratagem with impostor!Amaryllis created by copying Amaryllis' appearance onto an accomplice's soul was outside of his expectations. He was mainly worried about Fallatehr changing his companions in ways too subtle for him to detect, which no reasonable amount of re-checking would counter, and had little reason to suspect that Amaryllis was compromised at all.

    With Grak, he had to use direct method because da nad had no connection to his soul (since da nad loyalty was below ten).
    ```

  - u/ceegheim:
    ```
    I also generally dislike conflict resolutions that pan out by lucky spur-of-the-moment revelations rather than careful considerations. Feels like a cheap way of getting a surprising twist into a climatic action scene.

    The fact that WtC was pretty self-conscious about this, as evidenced in the lines you quoted, leads me to cutting it a lot of slack.

    I mean, the characters actually talking about this, having a plausible in-story mechanism, and trying to learn from the failure of their plans instead of going "hah, improvisation FTW" puts WtC miles ahead of pieces like worm, in this regard.
