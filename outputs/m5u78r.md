  Man I've been following this fic since around chapter 15 and it's consistently been one of my favorite pieces of writing. Props for taking a huge part of my childhood and making this beautiful creation out of it.

  Also a bit of speculation- I was doing some thinking about where the heck a Varnax (the yeerk-eaters, not the abstract concept) comes from. It seems like it occupies a very strange niche, being an apex predator which is hyperspecialized to pull yeerks out of their hosts. This seems like a really strange place to end up in via natural selection; extracting the yeerk is a whole unnecessary process vs just eating whatever you're wrapped around. And if yeerkflesh is such a desirable meal to the average predator you'd think the main bodies would have more specialized predators than the shards. But there is one species for which yeerk shards have unique nutritional value: other yeerks.

  So my headcanon origin story of the Varnax: in the old wars on the Yeerk homeworld there were coalitions torn apart and dragged out of their pools. This is normally lethal, but out of millions of scattered shards of yeerkflesh there are a rare few whose natural aptitude for self-modification lets them force biological changes to survive both open air and separation from their main body. (The purple color is a side effect of this; the modified flesh reflects more energetic light wavelengths to prevent dessication, kinda the reverse of the green chlorophyll in plants)

  It's a clumsy process and they lose a lot of the brainpower in the process, but what's left is an amorphous predator, insane both from being torn apart and from needing to repurpose too many vital parts of the brain in the subsequent metamorphosis. The change in color and consistency (I'm picturing something like a purple amoeba that can extrude appendages as needed) leaves them unrecognizable. Most of their body is repurposed for long-term Kandrona storage and out-of-water movement. They can no longer dwell in water, having undergone an irreversible adaptation to surviving out if it. But they still need some Kandrona intake, and the shattered remains of their Yeerkish instincts are screaming at them to expand. So hunting Yeerks isn't just a matter of nutrition for a Varnax; it's a twisted reflection of the sharing between pools, a desperate attempt to sate the trauma of forceful separation and isolation.

  This crystalized in my head after reading Elfangor's speech in the last chapter, and I think there's a certain poetry to it especially wrt the Visser's allegorical Varnax; the tendency of conflict to lead to terrible repercussions down the line, and the dangers of crossing lines (physically destroying vs absorbing rival coalitions) even if it wins the war.

  Also, the end of chapter 47 was intense, but I had intended to say in the comments there that I really liked the validation Elfangor gave Tobias before things got intense.

  Oh hey I'm early for a new chapter!

  You know what just occurred to me...where is Marco's mom amidst this whole mess? Does she know Peter's alive? I'd like to see her show up if they go pick up Cassie's parents at the Mars base...someone who has some idea of the horrors they've have gone through.

  I had a showerthought yesterday, that this series really veers off the Ax-Tobias friendship in canon which I was a bit sad about. But then I realized r!Tobias has Garrett, and in some ways Garrett's kind of like canon Ax if he went human nothlit isn't he? Garrett's senses are sometimes overwhelming like taste for canon Ax, he's trying to navigate the social rules of humanity, quirky sense of humor etc.

  Oh yeah, one question for you /u/TK17Studios, what's with the Hork Bajir being so in-the-background? Not to be taken as an accusation, but more curiosity...I found it interesting that Han Pritcher is mentioned as an unwilling slave to V3, but not Hyruk's HB host, as a comparison.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Marco's mom is still way tf out near Arn homeworld space; they didn't know at the time that there was a quick way into the Earth system so she doesn't know about it, either.  They may or may not get the chance to tell her.

    Hork-Bajir have just had less of a chance for me to pick them up.  Han being mentioned but not the Hork-Bajir host was meant to show subtle human-centric bias, although in Jake's defense, they *had* begun negotiations for releasing all unwilling hosts, upon transfer of morphing tech and Arn tech.
    ```

    - u/KnickersInAKnit:
      ```
      If the goal was to demonstrate human-centric bias then I definitely noticed something was up, yeah. That's a big change in r!Tobias vs canon Tobias - canon Tobias was the alien ambassador of the team (shorm to Ax, namesake to Toby, somewhat favored by the Ellimist), and I think that's a role that never got assigned to anyone in the r!Animorphs team. Well, I suppose we could say it was an intentional move by the gods? A bit late for it now since Hyruk is definitely dead, but when that HB controller showed up I wondered if it was a seer or Toby. I bet a coalescion without access to human hosts would treat a seer HB as TOP PRIORITY HOST.


      Edit: Actually I'll amend that a little - r!Tobias is on board a Pemalite ship doing some reprogramming right now with Maninho in his head. Alien ambassador role still there, but not as big.

    Also why didn't Telor Reborn send more neurons in a human host?
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Wait, is this question "Why was Peter sort of dumb?"
      ```

      - u/daytodave:
        ```
        Frick, I actually meant Hyruk. Why didn't Hyruk send a bigger shard that a human could wear for the council?
        ```

        - u/TK17Studios:
          ```
          No Human Controllers on board those ships.  That was the reinforcement fleet, remember: they hadn't acquired any human hosts at all.
          ```

          - u/daytodave:
            ```
            Right, but couldn't they send a human-sized shard for Cassie or some other volunteer to equip?

            Edit: They're not actually on the ship. Nevermind!

  So one question about the timeline, which could determine whether or not this is a good idea: Was Rachel born before or after the avatar spoke to Artem-Amorra-Gahar?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Artem is strongly implied to be an elder veteran, and his first exposure to the avatar was when he was seven, so it almost certainly predated Rachel's birth.

    Also, Rachel has been curiously uninvolved since knocking the gun out of Marco's hands—almost the same level of impact she would have had if she'd previously died or just not-been-there...
    ```

    - u/earnestadmission:
      ```
      We’ve been treating the memory episodes as the aberration, and assuming that Rachel is basically fit but is incapacitated with increasing frequency. Your comment here suggests that Rachel is actually insensate by default, but gets roused to action / imbued with agency when necessary for one of the Players. This need seems to be less and less frequent.

      I’m not sure which version is more depressing.
      ```

  No idea what will happen now. I even [thought that](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/lzmmvm/ffrtwip_ranimorphs_the_reckoning_chapter_47/gq50rx2/) this would be the least likely thing to happen next. A silly notion, in retrospect, to presume that the AI wouldn't be unchained in an r! fic.

  Literally no idea what will happen, now. The only sure thing ("the piece on the chess board that doesn't move", as Duncan Idaho says) is that the team will have to make big decisions in furtherance of The Game. 

  It was annoying to see (what I thought was) Tobias' thoughts being edited in real time, when it looked like he wanted to quit playing the game. If the players will intervene to that level to preserve the game, my earlier solution (everyone just quit playing) is not going to happen.

  Thank you TK for another great chapter

    FWIW, while I intend to leave some things open to interpretation, my *personal* headcanon-as-author is that the gods are intervening *way* less frequently than the characters think.  It's just that once you suspect there's godly intervention, you start to see it everywhere, even in the twists and turns of your own thoughts/even in things that you otherwise would not have considered particularly big coincidences.

      Which is exactly what they wanted us to think :). If I set up a tower to topple over after I walk away, I still did it, even if I didn't give the final push

  >WE CAN KILL THE HOWLERS.  WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KILL THE HOWLERS.  PLEASE.

  How does this fit together with that?

  > “There’s a censor that wipes any Chee that thinks a—a wrong thought,”  
  >  
  >A refresh cycle that wipes them every half-second anyway. 

  Saying that sentence alone takes longer than a half-second.  
  Not to mention, that the "set us free"-ask was premeditated. The time it took for Tobias to consider even letting all 36 holograms show up.....  
  But half-a-second is just an upper bound till the wipe happens.  
  The censor would wipe them before?  
  Also what does it even mean that a "Chee is wiped"?  
  Or "if they get stuck somewhere".  
  The Chee can hold a coversation, that is longer than 0.5 seconds.  
  Was that all on nonviolence autopilot?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    The individual Chee aren't speaking.

    Each Chee is making a fraction of a sound, not even an entire phoneme/letter.

    There are 36 of them, which is enough for them to reboot, reconnect with the network, download the context of the conversation, and produce the next fraction of a sound when it's their turn before the censor catches up to them and wipes them again.

    So between the 36 Chee there's a single "voice" that's sweeping around the circle multiple times a second.  All 36 of them repeatedly being wiped and rebooted, cooperating to form a single voice.
    ```

      ```
      Awww, that's so adorable!
      Dog is man's best friend, but truly Chee are truly dog's best friend.

      Maybe I'm dumb, but I would recommend making this slightly more obvious. Would have been cool to have this revelation while the story rather than be mildly confused about how this their strange behaviour was supposed to bypass the control and then understand it later because of a reddit comment. But also maybe I'm dumb (and kinda sleepy).

        Kinda his unique writing style.
        Even completely innocuous things are a puzzle, like Marco's remark about Garrett being top, has to be puzzled together to make sense.
        Usually I just accept that mostly everything is in the whoosh-category for me, since I won't read slowly or more than one time :)

            I know, right?  How you gonna JUST NOW open up such a rich vein of jokes, this late in the game?
