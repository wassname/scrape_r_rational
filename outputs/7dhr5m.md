## [RT/DC] Heretic's Edge, by Cerulean. A magical high school training monster hunters.

### Post:

I recently stumbled upon [The Web Novel Heretic's Edge](https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/2015/10/03/orientation-1-01/) via Spacebattles, and the story hooked me in hard.

 It's an original universe pulling inspirations from several places, It reminds me a lot of Worm in how practically every named character has their own unique voice, views, and abilities, and the powers depicted are far from the generic brute, blaster, and utility type abilities you normally find in fantasy fiction. There's also heavy elements from the postmodern fantasy 'what measure is a non-human' trope, as well as investing heavily in the rarely covered idea that members of a group don't automatically agree with every party line, because every group is full of individuals.

Hogwarts had multiple elements dedicated solely to fueling political conflict, and generally extended the extreme isolationist attitude of the magical community for no real reason, to the detriment of both worlds. Tristian Academy of Familiar of Zero, is dedicated to training the power of the next generation of the magicracy, yet even though this is the one time in their lives the young nobles can be held to account for their actions, backstabbing and conspriacies abound. For many other magical schools, the result is either graduates who have so much power that they might as well make the world a magicracy, or are specialized in a way that they could take over at least some industry if the world is too much.

Crossroads Academy in the story Heretic's Edge is different. Crossroads gives their students a singular overriding purpose, to keep humanity safe by hunting down and killing Strangers, the catchall term for all the fantastic creatures from zombies, vampires, and weres, to all the obscure mythological beasts, slipping into our world from alternate earths to kill humans under their veils of unnoticability.

The magic system of the academy is solidly defined. Besides the ability to see through the masquerade, new Heretics get bonded to a unique weapon that can vary from a pair of goggles to a robot dog, each with fun twists. With time and effort, a Heretic can imbue an attribute into an object, which can be as simple like emitting light or sound, or complex enough to react to trigger phrases, and the masters of this imbuing magic create the weapons new Heretics take up. Finally, when a Heretic kills a Stranger, they automatically absorb a portion of the Stranger's magical strength, which then manifests in the form of a new power or the strengthening of a previously gained power with diminishing results.

The core gang around the protagonist is simply amazing compared to many other fantasy novels. Where most other fantasy gangs have a clear protagonist who the story revolves around, in HE the POV character is far from the only one with a mystery to solve, or a trauma to overcome, or a goal to reach. Cerulean's world takes advantage of the webfiction style popularized by Wildbow of regular interludes with alternate POVs, and the result feels far more like the characters are a group in an original setting tabletop game, working together to solve each other's problems, rather than a grand adventure with a handful of characters who have little motivation beyond helping the main character achieve their goal.

  I tried to read both this, and Certuleans worm fanfic Intrepid and eventually just stopped reading both.

  Not cause they're bad, they're just exhausting. The story never ever stops and takes a breath. Arc is about to finish, but right before the end Boom, dramatic reveal, i'm your father, Boom, dramatic reveal, secret ancient enemy. Go Go Go next arc. Lets start 3 more plots that won't be resolved for the next 5. Boom dramatic reveal, "She LIVES!" Boom, dramatic reveal New enemy out of nowhere. Boom dramatic reveal, I'm also family somehow.

  Maybe its better if you read it a few chapters at a time instead of binging it. Intrepid is even worse cause it has switching PoV, each with their own plots, so there's even less downtime.

  Liked the start of it though. Read up til volume 18 or so.

    As a huge fan of Heretical Edge, I do have to agree with you that this is one of the major weaknesses. I don't think it holds up nearly as well to binge-reading the whole thing. The constant excitement does work great reading it episodically, but yeah.

    There's also how Cerulean didn't want to do the Harry Potter thing of introducing a new villain every year and then neatly wrapping it up in the end. An admirable goal, but it led to just being dogpiled with threats, enemies, plots, and mysteries for a while. I feel like Heretical Edge is so in-depth that it really rewards serious fans but is harder for casual fans to get into.

  Started this story just now but don't think I'll continue. A moralizing protagonist right out of the gate (how dare you sell drugs to kids!) that ignores most of the complexity of how dealing drugs actually works, not to mention how busts go down. (If this was real life, the real bad guy in the situation would be the negligent police officer.) The exposition is really heavy-handed here, it does my least favorite thing at the beginning of stories, which is to immediately and awkwardly tell the protagonist's hair color in the first few sentences as if it's the most important thing that absolutely cannot wait. At least she doesn't look in a mirror and describe herself. I'm also underwhelmed by the backstory--your mom left so you don't want to have friends. Just feels very transparently written by an 18-20 year old.

    Moral complexity is actually one of this story's greatest strengths, even if it's not apparent for a few arcs. Some of the best storylines come from characters realizing that simplified moral views are misleading and miss a lot of stuff.

    I have no knowledge of how drug busts work, so no comment on that.

    The exposition does take some getting used to. Personally the style bugged me a little at the beginning but doesn't anymore, so I guess I just got used to it. I don't think it changed all that much.

    It seems you have an issue with the backstory being too simple or normal or something, which...well, I guess it's reasonable at this point in the story, but it's utterly hilarious with more context. The author just didn't want to get into all the backstory immediately, and a lot of the future story actually goes to examining Flick's life so far and all the influences on it.

    I'm not necessarily trying to convince you to read more, since I don't know how much emphasis you place on each issue, but I thought I'd give you a bit more context so you could make a more informed decision.

      Thanks for following up. I guess I don't need perfect verisimilitude or slavish research in my stories, but my instinct is that an author that uses a head-scratcher like this right off the bat (the unrealistic drug bust) might not yet understand human nature or how the world operates well enough to tell a story that I don't find annoying. With that said, the technical writing is on the better side for web fiction and the premise sounds interesting, so thank you for suggesting the story and hope you continue to enjoy it. I've definitely read some pretty out there things myself (wuxia comes to mind), we all have different priorities when selecting what to read. :)

        I follow Heretical Edge and have been caught up for a year now. It's written well and the plot itself is interesting which is why I still follow it. 

        My issue is similar to the one you mentioned, but perhaps a little different: everyone is sensitive, fragile, and almost caricature-like in their exaggerated emotional responses. Oh and everyone needs a tragic backstory, which I guess can be chalked up to the grimdark nature of the world, though I feel it's taken too far, with people being evil for the sake of making the world dark most of the time. 

        Why do I say this is relevant to the moralizing? Because a lot of these emotional responses happen because of some moral issue arising. For example, in recent chapters, one character had to take control of the body of another character, and they just keep apologizing and feel like they've done something wrong because I suppose mind-control stigma and a personal violation of their body. Which isn't wrong, per se, but the incessantness, and reiteration just goes too far. To be fair, there's a little more to the situation that would be spoilery, but it doesn't fully counter my point.

        There's also how nakama/friendship power comes into play where they make each other feel better because everyone is traumatized in one way or another. For some characters, it's like /u/Oaden said, they're traumatized once every week. At some point, you become desensitized and just hate them all for being snivelling, whiny, and fragile, even though that may be a little harsh to them. The presentation still makes you feel annoyed anyway. Worm did it better: depressing but not constant ~~black clouds~~ thunderstorms and lightning drowning and burning everyone. There are upbeat moments where they go on dates or have talks but they're usually subverted and it's a little too sickly-cutesy to the point where you're rolling your eyes.

        Despite all this, I continue to read because the plot and content is good and interesting, even though I do get pissed off almost every chapter.

    While I can't comment on the rest as I havent read enough, I have to agree that the drug 'bust' was laughable. That's a police officer using a civilian (and a Minor!) to elicit testimony or evidence gathering they were not entitled to without a warrant.

    That whole search is  getting thrown out by any competent lawyer. The police can't end run around the 4th amendment by getting a civilian to do their dirty work for them.

  This is the third time someone has recommended that for me.

  I suppose I can't hold it off any longer. _Just_ when I was about to make progress on the backlog.

  Minor nitpick, but isn't the title "Heretical Edge," not "Heretic's Edge"?

  I second your recommendation for HE; I read the web novel (up until I was caught up with the new entries) early this year and recall that I really enjoyed it. I've read *so much* in the months since then that the specifics as to what I liked are murky in my head, but back in February I wrote:

  >Heretical Edge: Still in the middle of reading this (well, 16/20 arcs into it), but I've liked it so far. A teenage girl ends up going to a secret academy where Heretics (humans who can see monsters and absorb their abilities) are trained to protect the rest of humanity. The writing is pretty good, and the author frequently throws twists and turns. Fair warning - the scene can go from jocular to extremely violent and gory very quickly. The author does a great job writing some of the horror scenes. There's not a strong focus on the system of magic or abilities unfortunately, but if you like action, drama, horror, and budding bisexual teenage romance, it's worth checking out. 

  Thanks for the reminder about this; when I finish reading some of the other stuff I've got on my plate, I think I'll pick this up again and see what's been updated in the past year!

  So...the best strategy for hunters is for the experienced ones who have hit diminishing returns to capture what monsters they can and have the students execute them for magical xp? It seems that if the monsters are common enough to build a story off of and devote a school to fighting then there should be a system in place to get all hunters to a certain minimum power level, if not skill. Haven't read the story, just the first thing that popped into my head.
  ```

  - u/CreationBlues:
    ```
    Yep. It's a little more involved than that, as the hunts students go on are in the field and hands off unless they get in serious trouble, but students do get a lot of training and power ups in "safe," "controlled" situations.
    ```

  - u/Pondincherry:
    ```
    They actually do exactly what you suggest to get everyone a basic regeneration power, but there's strong in-universe reasons why it would be a bad idea to do that with all monsters as opposed to the controlled hunts where the students still have to handle the actual combat.
    ```

  ```
  I never heard of heretical edge before, had a look when I saw this recommendation, and binged on it for the last week (I don't get a lot of free time). I'm thoroughly enjoying it and gutted that I now have to wait days for the next chapter.
