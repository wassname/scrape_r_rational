  Lavarro may be powerful, but she has low impulse control. She forces some poor translocation specialist to teleport her, then treats him like trash because he can't teleport her all the way, despite admitting to not knowing anything about teleportation. She is generally aggressively ignorant and utterly selfish -- she's making Velika seem better and better by comparison. She also seems to believe in the transitive property of fighting. She beat Halgrave, Halgrave kinda looked like he was beating Westbridge, thus she must be able to beat Westbridge. Personally I expect and hope that she'll get crushed for attacking a wizard in his tower. More likely narratively their fight will be interrupted by the empire invasion (no doubt after their fight has crushed half the city and killed tons of civilians).

  Velika is getting some reasonable points for ignoring Val when it became clear he hadn't killed the Blue. That's good because it seems everyone is going to have to work together (right when the Watch is pulling something stupid).

  The empire thinks it can break down the barrier. This is surprising to me, because the whole seizing the teleport platform depends on speed. They can destroy it otherwise, or simply respond in force. Sure they think they can fight off 3-4 citizens, but the teleport platform means the moment the barrier drops 50 citizens could attack them. Just crush the expeditionary force in a couple minutes, then go back home.

  I admit I was more interested in the Empire as representing the power of efficient builds for the group (aka fascism the MMO) instead of focusing on Feche as a personal badass.

    I'm like 99% sure she will kill westbridge. We have Chekov's gun in the form of the barrier control device that anyone can use if all registered users are dead. The only way Rain gets to use it, is if westbridge dies.
    ```

    - u/nohat:
      ```
      That's a good point. I forgot about how westbridge thought to himself that the device would drive most to insanity -- presumably tons of clarity is needed, which is a rain call-out if anything is. If westbridge dies will the barrier drop? 

      That's purely narrative though, since westbridge can also call for support, and generally seems like the prepared type.
      ```

        The barrier shouldn't drop. The artifact seemed very computer like, so I imagine it just stays doing what it was until a user tells it otherwise.

        It would just stay up until it runs out of mana to siphon

      Westbridge is characterized as a citizen who has restraint, and who cares about his people. If Lavarro does kill him, it's bad for pretty much everyone. This doesn't mean she won't kill him - just that the consequences for doing so are terrible, and that she's a bit of a monster for acting out despite this.
      ```

      - u/DihydrogenM:
        ```
        I think he's characterised as someone who cares about his awakened people (he did not seem to have an issue with killing random civilians), but yeah killing him is not a good thing.

        I'm just saying that story wise he is fated to die. Also this will be a bad action for lavarro to take, and will have negative consequences for her. However, she is a short sighted idiot who thinks she is above the rules and she is going to do it.
        ```

        - u/EsquilaxM:
          ```
          From what I remember he did care about killing the unawakened, thought it was a sad necessity to accomplish his goals. He only mentioned a special exception for the awakened the way he did to avoid a war with the watch and the guild.
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Lavarro is by far the most self-absorbed piece of work in the entire story, to a point where all she sees are her immediate goals, everything else be damned. I hope her obliviousness will cost her.

    No idea how someone like Halgrave who seems like a caring, well-spoken and responsible person, ended up with someone like Lavarro. It truly is a mystery. Must've been a heat of the moment thing.
    ```

    - u/nohat:
      ```
      I get the impression he was similar, but he grew up and took responsibility. Him throwing Rain out of the city after stealing all his money was an example of that. Rain didn't do anything illegal or harmful, he just upset some political balance he knew nothing about. However Halgrave did apologize, and try to act better in the future, which shows that he's trying.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I kinda agree with Halgraves reaction. It sucks for Rain and it would've been best if Halgrave had followed up on Rain to check if he's fine, because Rain was obviously ignorant and didn't know what the heck he was doing, but taking swift and decisive action was definitely the right move with how (understandably) prickly the Watch is concerning adventurers blasting unidentified magic at full tilt in populated city centers.

        Ignorance is not really an excuse, you have to admit. I think kicking Rain out of the city was a fair move, it just happened to be very harsh because Rain had basically no money to his name and was still pretty much lost in what to him was an alien world (something that Halgrave didn't know, and that you wouldn't expect of someone who is awakened). The overwhelming majority of adventurers would probably be fine if you kicked them out.
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          Yeah from Halgrave's perspective at the time: he's got some creepazoid foreign adventurer in his town who doesn't know how shit works. The man's clearly from far away so he probably traveled quite a bit to get here; he can almost certainly take care of himself in the wilderness. Kicking him out of town is a much safer and more humane approach than throwing him in jail. 

          It just turns out that Halgrave was wrong, and this weird foreigner managed to get to town without actually traversing any of the intervening distance (and thus developing any of the wilderness survival skills you'd expect a foreigner to have).

            You said it lot more eloquently than I did, kudos.

    Lavarro also doesn't seem to realize what it means that her goldplate experience is fighting her husband.  

    *Maybe* she's just better than gold plates despite her level.  Or maybe she had a good matchup.  Or maybe the guy didn't want to go serious on the girl he liked or (later) the mother of his child.

    > teleport platform means the moment the barrier drops 50 citizens could attack them 

    Well, if the empire is any good at strategery then they're attacking from multiple fronts, so it's unclear to me that the DKE can afford to send all their resources to defend Fel Sadanis. In general, the author seems conservative in revealing big picture details (e.g. we're given dribs and drabs of the skill tree as they become relevant to the plot, Rain's endless list of questions are repeatedly lamp shaded, etc.), maybe to maintain the space of possible explanations for any plot holes that emerge.
    ```

    - u/EsquilaxM:
      ```
      From what I understand fel safaris is the only target they can actually reach without a long journey and logistics issues.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Other way around. Fel Sadanis is a target that can only be reached through a long journey and logistic issues, but it's also the only one that isn't "hard", with a cohert of Gold citizens to defend it.
        ```

- u/Angelbaka:
  ```
  Getting some catch-up on the plot thread about val's dad sooner than I expected. What's the over-under on them actually getting to meet this time? I can't imagine the empire guys can actually crack the bottle. Maybe the light attacks will go through the barrier?
  ```

- u/throwaway11252016:
  ```
  Consider the following: Velocity boosted crystal slimes used as missiles.
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    Now that Rain knows how to make them, there's going to be so many crystal slimes.  It'll be like Xiugaaraa: the City of Lights, except with crystal slimes instead.
    ```

- u/xachariah:
  ```
  It only took 90 chapters, but they're finally getting to the part where they have to ... **Delve**.  Also, I think I finally understand where the story is going.  Originally, I thought the story was meandering for the sake of it, but it actually seems like it's all coming together.

  The story spent a long time in the city, setting up the players and how it functions, then finally threw a wrench into everthing with Velika and putting the whole city in a bottle.  Now we've got all these dysfunctional elements who have to work together, because the Empire of Adamant is confident they can tear down the barrier, and the city has to be ready when they do.  

  So they've got to Delve beneath the city and hunt some blues.  The Watch has to figure out how to work with Velika, because they need her able to fight the Empire.  Velika has to figure out how to become a leader and give up (relative) power without getting killed, because she can't win alone.  And Rain has to figure out how to work in a group that isn't his quirky friend team, since he's like 0/6 with authority figures.  

  Really looking forward to it.
  ```

  - u/nohat:
    ```
    Yeah, I didn't quite understand that. Apparently there are depths that they could dig down to and find blues (within presumably spherical barrier)? Why isn't that more common?
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      As Talasa said, she expects it to kill them all.  Maybe another city can handle a direct line to high level monsters that could kill everybody, but this city can barely keep slimes in check.  

      The whole reason the city is setup here is because they're a low ranked area.  It makes them backwards, but it also means the people can live like humans instead of the City of Lights or whatever nightmare underground poison city Amelia lived in as a child.
      ```

    - u/BaggyOz:
      ```
      IIRC The depths are an underlying structure that goes everywhere but are also incredibly deadly. If you're in a low magic area they'll be far beyond what you normally encounter and if you're in a high magic area theres already enough blues/ dungeons on the surface to make it worth the risk.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Massive amount of effort involved in digging deep. Easier to just find an existing cave system or lair.
      ```

- u/PDNeznor:
  ```
  Goddammit Val, of course you'd already be half dead when Rain finds you again. It's like you WANT to owe him your life. This brings the number of times he's saved you to what, 3, 4 times if you count dissuading Velika from killing him? Looks like he's shaping up to be like his father in more ways than just his build \*wink wink\*
