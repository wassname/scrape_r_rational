  So, Voldemort took Harry advice, and is testing the treatment he wants to do on himself on somebody else first?
  ```

    ```
    Daaaamn, yea, that must be it.
    ```

  What I don't understand is why Voldemort said out loud what had happened. Seems counterproductive and I'm not 100% convinced it isn't some kind of ploy, but maybe he was just really freaked out.
  ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    I am guessing either:

    A) This is all still mirror-based wish fulfillment

    or 

    B) This is all part of some deeper plan to make Harry think he "won" and has been "successful" and can thus *not rip apart the stars in their heavens*. 

    Even if B), the acting seems overly dramatic and the sort of thing I expect Harry to question shortly (hand back all Harry's possible tools, then violently exclaim "No if you kill me now while my back is turned I will really no-foolin' die!"? **Really?**) This inclines me towards A); It wouldn't surprise me if in an hour and a half, Harry will question his perceptions and realize he is mirror-bound specifically because of how implausible what just happened was.

    If *I* accidentally overwrote more than a hundred lifetimes of save files, I would be screaming and  ranting far worse than Voldemort did here.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Think about it, he was going to unlock both the good and evil endings, and now he gets neither.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        He gets the bad ending.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Really?  My reaction upon experiencing extreme depths of frustration, and I am a damned hammy person, is usually to lapse into apparent calm and mutter "oy gevalt" or "oh bugger".  Seeing that actually shows, for me, *more* exasperation than screaming and ranting.  Screaming and ranting shows I am still *engaged* and have not yet started wanting to just fuck off and *not be there anymore*.
      ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    I don't even know what happened. Why did his horcrux fail? Because Harry exists? Because the horcrux would affect Harry too, so their magic got mixed and bad stuff happened?

    edit: Was he trying to make a horcrux for Harry? Hermione?
    ```

- u/kaukamieli:
  ```
  The power Voldermort knows not. The ability to get stuff from the pouch by drawing letters in air? :)
