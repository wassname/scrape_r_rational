    Lmao just imagine Cat thinking of that name at some point and being like "Fuck yeah that sounds cool"

      Right? I imagine the Grey Pilgrim thinking "Ugh, and she already has an Empress name in mind. How tacky."

    Dread Emperor/Empress names are always so friggin' cool

      There was a bit of discussion on that topic when EE first said that Cat's name as Dread Empress (if there ever was a future with her as Dread Empress) would be Victorious.

      It's beyond cool. "Malicia" was chosen because it's never been done before. "Traitorous", "Sorcerous" and the likes are descriptive. "Triumphant" too, she was to win and do so in so glorious a fashion that History would never forget.

      "Victorious" is a simple description: "Those who attempt to strike me down fail."
      ```

        It also has so many times to different story elements, to "one sin one grace", to the fact that the only times she has ever *lost* was when it also made her win, and also as a direct synonym to Triumphant, who is by far the most well known Dread tyrant.

  So...did Masego just forget to mention that the Dead King repurposed the entire city of Liesse just to divine the Wandering Bard's plans? Like, that and the entire conversation they had is pretty damning.

  >“I know,” the Dead King said. “And now that I do, I need not lift a  finger. I’ll tell them, Intercessor, and every last one will turn on you.”

  >“Yeah, see, that’s the part where you’re getting ahead,” the woman drawled. “You knowing. The little shard of you in poor ol’ Zeze knows, but you-you? That’s a different story.”

  >“You failed,” the Dead King said. “The Tyrant spread into the souls, yes, but the Black Queen contains him. I will still have room enough to pass what I know.”

  >“Do you?” the Wandering Bard grinned.

  I guess that due to the state that he was in, he lost the memory. Bit of a trope, and so under the Bard's jurisdiction. Plus, since the Dead King didn't actually pass on the info to Masego, it could be thought of as an attempt at manipulation, even though the Bard never denies any of it. I guess that if he actually did tell Masego, he definitely would've forgotten.

    None of this would change Tariq's mind. If, like Tariq believes, Bard is ultimately on the side of Good and opposes Keter at every turn, then OF COURSE the Dead King going to go to great lengths to try and figure out her plans! Having the Dead King as an enemy doesn't really hurt your credibility with the Heroes.

    As for that particular conversation, it's really not that damning, especially if you're already inclined to give Bard the benefit of the doubt. Nessie claims that he has dirt on Bard that would get everyone to turn on her. Bard completely ignores the question of how damning the dirt is or the response it would provoke in favor of pointing out that he won't actually retain the info. Nessie is the only one making damning claims here, which Bard neither confirms nor denies, and Heroes won't be inclined to look favorably on the words of the Dead King.

    Besides, Tariq *knows* she's worked on behalf of Below before, he just thinks the good she does outweighs that. When presented with this conversation, he might conclude that Nessie had learned about something like the fact that she helped the Sisters become Sve Noc and that Nessie then made poor assumptions about the convictions of Heroes and their capacity for forgiveness. He'd believe *that* before he'd believe that if he knew what they were talking about he'd side with the Dead King against Bard.

    The issue is not that Tariq hasn't ever seen Bard do something sketchy. The issue is that he's seen her do enough good (and enough Good) to outweigh any sketchiness. One more incident that's maybe-sort-of-kinda sketchy won't change his view on things.

      All true. Even so, if the Pilgrim knew the Dead King went to such enormous lengths and risked/sacrificed a piece of his soul to figure out her plans and motivations, and said it was an acceptable loss (though possibly lying about that to create doubt), that would certainly give him doubts about what she really wants.
      ```

      - u/werafdsaew:
        ```
        Sure, but neither Cat nor Masego knows that information.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  The ending of this seems like a pretty good example of game theory in action. Cat credibly precommits to use disproportionate retribution to any violation of the rules, forcing others to enforce them
  ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  Bard set it up so she'd win no matter what: Cat dies, Cat stays out of her way, or a wedge is driven b/w Cat and the Pilgrim.
  ```
