  Being a rationalist song from a [Dungeons and Discourse](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/22/dungeons-and-discourse-third-edition-the-dialectic-continues/) ([comic 1](http://dresdencodak.com/2006/12/03/dungeons-and-discourse/), [comic 2](http://dresdencodak.com/2009/01/27/advanced-dungeons-and-discourse/)) campaign - see [this log](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ep2Z42hYqj68QZz6w/king-under-the-mountain-adventure-log-soundtrack) and [the sequel](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/17/fermats-last-stand-soundtrack-and-adventure-log/) for an excellent writeup.

  Other fun music [can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/user/qraikoth/videos) - in particular *Mathematical Pirate Shanty*, *Philosopher Kripke*, and *What Is It Like To Be A Bat?* are somewhere between great (if you like puns) and terrible (if you don't, you monster).  From a different channel (but same campaign), [Thomas Hobbes' Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaaPNKbWD80) is *unfairly* catchy.

  Any other notable examples of rationalist musical fiction?

    I don't have any other rationalist music to recommend, but I did want to say that firstly, this is amazing, and secondly, does anyone have a link to the lyrics of this? The live journal says access denied and google is failing me.
