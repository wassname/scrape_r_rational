## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Some aliens come by Earth and give the UN access to the galactic energy banking system. 

  With it, a civilization is able to take out "energy loans" in the form of electrical energy. These loans come with 20% APR, meaning for every gigajoule of energy loaned, you must pay ~6.34 watts of power in interest until the loan is repaid.

  In addition, Earth is only certified to take out loans up to 5x the energy it produces in a year. Every year, an appraiser from the galactic bank will come to scan Earth and re-certify our loan limit. The appraiser is not a computer and will only take into account power facilities made in good faith.

  To access the galactic energy banking system, the UN receives schematics to create connection points. These facilities are about the same price to build and size as a modern nuclear power plant. These facilities produce power at an adjustable rate as long as they are allowed to take out more loans. These facilities also accept electrical power to pay for interest / repay the loans.

  The alien bankers are understanding and will allow for a grace period in the case of disasters. However, they reserve the right to deny loans and have the ability to put a lien on Earth's power production in the case of a default.

  You have been appointed the UN Chief of Electrical Finance. You are the only human able to approve of energy loans and can distribute them as you wish to different facilities. You also have a lot of sway in producing an energy plan for the Earth. Also, you have access to see current loan amounts, interest due, as well as usages and payment history of each facility.

  With this new found source of energy capital, how can you advance humanity into a new age?

    Oh! This one is easy. Since they are galactic aliens, it stands to reason that you can take out a loan anywhere in the solar system, and repay it from Earth.

    Build a connection point on Earth and another one on every planetary body in the solar system. Then this galactic bank effectively allows you to transfer as much electricity as you want from Earth to another planet (and back if you want to build nuclear power plants on other planets). This massive amount of electricity would allow us to quickly colonize or even terraform our entire solar system.
    ```

      Conversely, we could set up large-scale solar generation closer to the Sun, yes?
      ```

  - u/Seth000:
    ```
    Some ideas:

    - If paying back loans early is allowed, two connection points could be setup to transfer energy between them without power losses. Put one near the equator with large amounts of solar panels, and one near giant cities.

    - Do we receive interest on the overproduction of electricity (a.k.a. our bank account) If we get 10-15%, I'm sure we can get find funding to invest a few trillion dollar into more power generation. If not, we'll start our own bank and charge only 19%.

    - Dyson sphere with a connection point included solves the energy transfer problem. 

    - Connection points on mars and the moon will rapidly increase our collonization efforts.

    - We can get rid of our pollution coal power plants. Maybe even the gas plants, to keep these fossil fuels in the earth and lower global warming.

    - Also aliens exist and have FTL travel and communication. They probably have a lot of advanced technology we could buy/trade for.

    ... Short term loans. Energy storage and grid management is *way* more valuable than 20% per annum. So just decouple the grids entirely, feed in output from nukes and equatorial solar to the bank, draw all consumption from it.
    ```

- u/SignoreGalilei:

  Let me know if someone's done this already:

  You have one (1) Remembrall: it is a clear hollow glass sphere about 10 cm in diameter with translucent white smoke inside. The smoke turns red when someone who is currently holding it forgets something, and turns white again about 5 seconds later.  It does not tell you what you have forgotten, and it only works as a complete unit - you can't e.g. take the smoke out and use it for FTL signaling. You also don't have other Harry Potter magic. Basically it is a really specific brain machine interface that works on unknown principles.

  I'm not sure if the great JK Rowling specified what it means to be holding something or forgetting something, so I'd probably munchkin away from there? Conquer the world, make a trillion dollar industry, discover the meaning of life, whatever you can figure out.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    If it can only detect the biochemical process we call forgetting, you could use it to detect whether someone is a human, or using a different cognitive substrate. If the world is otherwise unchanged this is of doubtful utility, but it's something.
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    One problem is that Remembralls CAN be made in real life. So if you can munchkin one to conquer the world or make a trillion dollar industry, you might as well just do it instead of posting the idea on reddit lol.

    The simple reason is that you are ALWAYS forgetting something. ALWAYS. So just make a ball of smoke with a motion sensor, to glow red when touched. Now you have a remembrall!

    (Just make sure to keep it away from people with photographic memory.)
    ```

    - u/PM_ME_CUTE_FOXES:
      ```
      Remembralls are canonically not constantly glowing, so they quite clearly run on a heuristic different from "forgetting something, anything, any memory ever".
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        You mean "having forgotten" as afaik it glows if you have forgotten something, not just when you hold it and suddenly forget something.

        Canon is a mess. I bet JK has no clear model of how they work. She just made up bunch of trinkets for the magical world that is kinda not supposed to even make sense.
        ```

        - u/Norseman2:
          ```
          If we define it as "having forgotten something which would cause you to immediately change what you're doing if you remember it" then a Remembrall could potentially be quite useful. Grab it just before you leave home, before you leave work, before you go to sleep, etc. With that criteria, it shouldn't always go off, but it should warn you if you've left the oven on, forgot to set your alarm clock, etc.
          ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Perhaps wizards have supernaturally clear memories, and forgetting or forgetful people are dangerous aberrations.

  Munchkin magical translation from any language into any other language .
  Something counts as a language only if at least 100 persons know how to Speak it.(edit now you have to take over the world whith it or at least get big amounts of money and or power, other creative  uses of the power are still ok , but try to think how to exploit them).
  (EDIT rules of what counts as a language added)

  The 100 humans(they have to have minds that are humankind enough for the magic to detect them as users) have to be able to  more or less understand each other talking it( they have to be able to communicate more or less the same amount of information the average English speaker can communicate to other English speakers, this is a static variable that doesnt depend on the  current number of English speakers as defined by the magic) , they have to think of it as a different language and their brain has to store it the way brains store new languages(so you can't arbitrarily decide something is a different language) .Also  at least 1/4 of the world population has to not be able to understand it(so gestures and body language don't count).Once something is considered a language  it isn't enough for someone to say a word thinking of it as for exaple English in order for the translation to work if that word isn't recognized as English by most English speakers, 100 English speakers have to agree that it's a  English word to count as English .
  ```

  - u/GemOfEvan:

    Create a language based on some NP problem. Translate that language back to English and get your answer in linear time.

    For example, let's create a language that will allow us to find the prime factorization of a number in linear time. 

    Our language is pretty much like English except for one particular rule. If we want to say a list of prime numbers, like "two, two, three, five", we instead say "foobar" followed by their product. For example, "two, two, three, five" in our language is "foobar sixty".

    Since this language is pretty much just English with an extra rule, we can teach it to most educated English speakers. This extra rule makes it more complicated to speak the language, but theoretically, anyone with an understanding of the rule and some time can understand our "foobar" phrases.

    Now, we want to find the prime factorization of 16,407,349.

    First, we say "foobar sixteen million four hundred and seven thousand three hundred and forty-nine" and then translate it and find out it's actually "seven, twenty-three, one hundred and one, one thousand and nine" in English.

    So, we have just found out that the prime factorization of 16,407,349 is 7 * 23 * 101 * 1009.

    We can similarly do this for other problems where it is theoretically possible for a human to translate in an arbitrary amount of time.

      Hm, reading this comment has made me realize that the original question is underspecified. Specifically, what does it mean to be able to "talk" (speak) a particular language?

The English +extra  rule that the Np  solving idea proposed would count as a variation of English so you wouldn't be able to translate it to English but you could translate it to any other language so it would still work.

    - u/Jiro_T:
      ```
      >theoretically, anyone with an understanding of the rule and some time can understand our "foobar" phrases.

      No, they can't.  Anyone who knows the rule can *produce* such phrases, but another speaker would not be able to understand the first speaker because understanding the phrase would be NP-hard.

      If speakers of the "language" can't understand it, it may be ineligible for being considered a language at all.
      ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:

      Well, why stop at NP?

      Create a language Omegalish that is English, except every question has its answer appended.

      For example, "What is one plus one?" in English becomes "What is one plus one foobar two?" in Omegalish.

      Teach 100 people this language. Now your translator power effectively grants you omniscience.

      Want to get rich? Convert the question "What is the optimal way for me to get rich?" from English into Omegalish.

      Want to take over the world? Convert the question "What is the optimal way for me to take over the world?" from English into Omegalish.
      ```

      - u/crivtox:
        ```
        First I don't think people can talk omegalish well enough to be considered a omegaish speaker by the magic.
         You can't use it in most contexts where  English speakers ask questions  so  think you don't pass the threshold of being  roughly as good talking it  as the average english speaker speaks english  In the np example not being able to use big numbers was a problem but you could still memorice a lot of numbers putting you barely on the treshold .
        I guess that boundary is too vague and I  shouldn't use it to  discard solutions that I dont like.
         .Another  problem is that speaking omegalish requires extra information that the humans speaking it dont necessarily have, humans can't speak Omegaish , even whith infinite time and memory which is .
        Also  normal languages don't depend on some sentence being true for some combination of words to be correct , and in fact here you have combinations of words(like "what time is it?" ) that can be correct a given moment and then stop being a correct translation , wich makes the language so diferent from normal ones than it wouldnt be recongised as a language by a magic translator that was desinged for human languajes .
        So i could argue that Omegalish wouldnt work , but lets say it does  since I guess as its written my proposal technically  doens't disalow it .
        In that case   I wouldn't risk asking for world domination to a unknown process that you don't know if its aligned with your preferences , and that you don't even know what criterion it uses for deciding whats the "answer" of a question.
        ```

  - u/696e6372656469626c65:
    ```
    I mean, this pretty much already exists. Aside from the obvious personal credit you get by being the polyglot to end all polyglots, and the utility of being able to act as translator in any situation, I'm not really seeing any munchkin possibilities here. (Possibly you could use the power to figure out if there are any mole people who speak their own language?)

    Try to translate English into dog-speak? If it works, that proves that dogs are "persons". Presumably, that means they are sentient. Repeat experiment for every animal.

  You have the power to see the one or more hours into the future, *however...*  

  *  You only see what would occur if you did not alter your actions based off of your visions.  
  * You may only look ahead for a burst of 1 second, which grants a 5 minute block vision.  
  * You may only use this power once per hour.  
  * The time ahead you look may be up to 23 hours, in one hour increments from your current time (use at 1:24pm, see 2:24-2:29pm, 3:24-3:29, 4:24-4:29, etc.)  
  *  You may not back signal: data from after the time you look ahead to may not be passed to your current self.

  What could you manage to munchkin? Please show your work: saying "I could just build a time machine now" doesn't tell us what the visions do for you.

    Well, the obvious time travel methods of getting rich still work: look at outcomes of gambles/stocks/lotteries 23 hours in the future, place winning bets.

    Same for preventing crimes and changing the future. Though you would have to be careful here since your actions may actually make things worse.
